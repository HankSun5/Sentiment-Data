The regulator issued a warning to GEDI, a publisher in the country against sharing its data archives with OpenAI, citing a potential breach of the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This follows a partnership between GEDI and OpenAI, which would allow OpenAI to train its ChatGPT models on Italian language content. GEDI is a media company owned by the Agnelli family. It publishes daily newspapers, La Repubblica and La Stampa, and it announced a partnership with OpenAI in September. The partnership involves delivering Italian language content from the publisher’s news portfolio to help train and improve OpenAI’s products. GPDP frowns on GEDI’s partnership with OpenAI John Elkann, Chairman of GEDI, said, “The partnership signed with OpenAI is part of GEDI’s digital transformation journey and recognizes its leadership in producing high-quality content within the Italian media landscape.” However, the GPDP warns that this partnership could potentially lead to a breach of the EU’s GDPR. The GDPR sets a global standard for privacy laws, emphasizing user consent, transparency, and accountability. It was also the first to propose an AI regulatory framework , which it claims will promote safe and responsible use of AI. “If GEDI, on the basis of the agreement signed with OpenAI, were to disclose the personal data contained in its archive, it could violate EU regulation, with all the consequences, including those of a sanctioning nature,” the GPDP stated. GDPR violations can cost offending companies up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover. Contrasting global perspectives on AI usage This latest episode with GEDI further escalates the tensions between technological advancement and compliance with privacy regulations in the EU. Clearview AI , an American company, was fined about €30 million by the Dutch Data Protection Authority, citing privacy breach and violation of user rights under the GDPR. Earlier this year, the GPDP temporarily banned ChatGPT over concerns about unlawful collection and processing of user data. The U.S. has taken a relaxed and market-driven approach to AI, favoring innovation and emphasizing self-regulation within the space. The “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence”, which was issued in October 2023 alludes to this. The lack of clear legislation, especially on a federal level, has led to states leading the way in regulating the industry. California’s Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) is an example of state-level AI legislation. China has also put a regulatory framework in place. In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued regulations on the use of generative AI. It also plans to formulate over 50 standards for AI by 2026 . These regulations would apply to both local and international providers of AI services.

According to the report , the exchanges include Bybit Fintech Limited, MEXC Global , Bitget Limited, KuCoin, and Bitcastle LLC Unregistered Operations and Customer Risks Notably, all five crypto exchanges have been accused of operating in Japan without appropriate registration. None of the five entities has the authorization of the FSA or any other local financial bureaus. This implies that the crypto exchanges are providing unauthorized services to their users based in Japan. A broader implication of the violation by the five cryptocurrency exchanges is that the Financial Services Agency cannot supervise their activities. Hence, customers and their assets lack protection should there be trouble or any unforeseen issue requiring regulatory intervention. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, customers of the five exchanges are not covered by asset protection or compensation as stated in Japanese law. Customers have no coverage and are very exposed to all forms of financial risks. Japan’s FSA Efforts Toward Crypto Regulation The FSA’s warning comes as a warning to users of this platform to know the risks facing their financial assets. Over the years, Japan has adopted a strict regulatory approach to maintain the integrity of its market and protect customers from heavy financial losses. Meanwhile, as per a report, Japan recently reorganized its Web3 leadership to ensure regulatory clarity. This move aims to provide support for innovation in digital assets. Additionally, it will help to grow users’ confidence and trust levels in cryptocurrency. Is Japan’s FSA Pushing for a Crypto-Friendly Landscape? Perhaps Japan’s regulatory body, the FSA’s proposal to adjust the country’s crypto tax rates, is geared towards encouraging compliance. The proposal made in August 2024 is for the 2025 financial year. Currently, Japan imposes a hefty tax on profits, which could range from 15% to 55%, depending on the taxpayer’s income bracket. The FSA’s proposal resulted from widespread calls from stakeholders in Japan’s crypto sector for a more friendly tax environment. The FSA’s response in pushing for reform remains subject to legislative approval by the country’s national legislature.

XRP Bulls Rally Toward $2 Mark,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/explosive-breakout-ahead-xrp-bulls-rally-toward-2-mark/,"Recently, XRP has been on a robust positive run; some predict that the altcoin will hit $2 in the following weeks. This hope coincides with increasing whale activity, as technical signs suggest that the price might cross significant barrier levels. Starting in early November, XRP’s explosion has inspired experts and investors. Whales Fuel Price Movement Whale purchase activity is one of the main causes of XRP’s recent rise . Widely seen as a positive sign, large altcoin holders have been accumulating millions of XRP tokens. $XRP to $2 isn’t even a question. $8-20 is inevitable 1. Bullish patterns = long-term setup2. Whales accumulating hard3. MACD cooling off + RSI neutral4. $1.60, then no resistance to $25.

Notable transactions, like a 150 million XRP trade valued at $227 million, have drawn attention from market watchers. Technical Indicators Point To Continued Growth Technical study also indicates XRP’s bright future. Expert in cryptocurrencies, CrediBull, informs us that XRP is currently experiencing a “five-wave impulse climb,” typical of long-term increasing trajectory. He predicts that if the price remains over $1.05, XRP may break out above $2 in the next weeks. On the other hand, if the price falls below this critical support level, it may indicate a correction before the next upward impulse. Another expert, Egrag Crypto, is keeping a careful eye on XRP’s market rise, which is approaching crucial levels. The analyst focuses on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, which is now at 2.57%. #XRP Dominance – FIB 0.5: IT’S TIME! Trend lines often get invalidated, but they provide a visual guide for market structure. Add Fibonacci extensions into the mix, and you have a leading indicator to anticipate what’s next. Key Levels to Watch:On the monthly timeframe,… pic.twitter.com/ZqMyiAoomS — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 28, 2024 If XRP closes above this level by the end of the month, it might lead to more gains. Analysts are also looking at the 0.702 Fibonacci level as the next goal for domination, which might lead to further price gains. XRP Path To $2 Promising XRP’s price has already grown by 16% in the last week , and it is now trading around $1.47, with a daily rise of 5%. The coin has demonstrated steady upward momentum, breaking through critical resistance zones and finding support at $1.30. If XRP maintains these levels, there is speculation that it could approach $2. Possible gains in the coming weeks are being paved by whale activity, strong technical patterns, and increasing market domination. The success of XRP hinges on its ability to retain strong support levels and continue its upward trajectory as it gains momentum. If the upward trend continues, XRP has the potential to hit new highs in the near future.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-29 22:12:00

On its previous day of trades, Nov. 28, Bitwise’s $BITB led at $48.05 million with Fidelity’s $FDT at $40.24 million as no other ETF inflows or outflows were recorded. Bitwise sees strong appetite for digital assets BITB, CEO Hunter Horsley revealed in a post on X platform adding the bull run was suggestive of strong demand for digital assets by investors. “$26,000,000 of inflows into $BITB today and $82M of volume in just 3.5 hours with short market day,” wrote Horsley. “People want more Bitcoin. Things are just getting started. Happy Thanksgiving!” Horsley. This comes as Bitwise filed to start a 10-Crypto index exchange-traded fund (ETF) meant to provide exposure to the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Uniswap and Polkadot. Once approved, the 10-Crypto Index ETF is expected to expand the two-way access between mainstream and the digital asset market, which will immensely interest both institutional and retail investors. Coinbase Custody will store the assets while the Bank of New York Mellon will act as the fund’s cash custodian and administrator. Bitwise reangles its European operations targeting institutional investors Bitwise has a history of supporting new and advanced crypto investment products, as last year the company submitted requests for ETFs based on Solana and XRP. The company has also spread its operations to Europe. Meanwhile, the asset management firm has announced the rebranding of its European XRP ETF to Bitwise Physical XRP ETP. The European operation, which was known as ETF Group Physical XRP will trade in Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA under the ticker GXRP. In a Wednesday blog, Bitwise indicated the move was part of a strategic overhaul of the company’s European product lineup. This was also meant to enhance its appeal to institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to XRP. The operation launched in 2022 under the ETC group and remains backed by physical XRP. Horsley spoke of a strong track record and evolving capabilities of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) a blockchain with more than a decade of proven reliability. “We’re thrilled to provide investors with access to this innovative asset through an institutional-quality product,” Horsley noted, signaling the product’s potential to attract significant institutional interest.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $9.97 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF’s price may surge to $16.21. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $3.29 Market cap $3,281,696,199.18 Trading volume $603,437,301.43 Circulating supply 998,844,854.96 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $3.33 24-hour low $3.05 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $10.52 (227.25%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 19.16% 50-day SMA $2.75 14-Day RSI 53.18 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $2.42 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF struggles to break past $3.389 TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis shows consolidation. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at $3.389. WIF’s support level is present at $3.056. The Dogwifhat price analysis for November 29 shows price consolidation, after a failed attempt to break past $3.389. Having seen massive gains over the past month (over 28%), and a rebound afterward, the bulls have been unable to push WIF to its previous highs. What next for Dogwifhat ($WIF)? Continued consolidation or a bullish breakout? Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF sees 8% daily gain, but continues to consolidate The WIF/USD 1-day price chart analysis shows that the token has seen about 8.1% gains today, but has struggled to break past $3.389 over the past 4 price candles. WIF’s immediate support is present at $3.056. A breakdown below this level could see WIF drop to $2.907. WIF sees 8% daily gain but continues to consolidate In the event of a bullish breakout, $WIF could recapture $3.5 or even higher. The RSI indicator shows 55.61, suggesting the market is neutral with no clear overbought or oversold signals, aligning with the token’s recent consolidation and current market conditions. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF is in an uptrend in the short-term The WIF/USD 4-hour price analysis reflects an uptrend in the short term, with the coin trading close to the upper Bollinger Band at $3.307. Immediate support is present at $3.117. A bearish reversal could see WIF settle below $3. If the current momentum persists, traders can anticipate a breakout towards $3.5. WIF is in an uptrend in the short-term Likewise, the MACD indicator suggests bullish momentum, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power shows that sellers are gaining a significant advantage, indicating the possibility of a trend reversal.

The 4-hour and 1-day charts point to a short-term bullish trend for WIF. However, a price correction could be on the horizon with RSI nearing overbought levels. Monitoring trading volume and key support/resistance levels will help gauge if the rally can hold. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $10 and $13. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, Orca, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? The recent decline in Dogwifhat’s price is due to a market correction after a bullish surge, high open interest levels, bearish technical signals, large whale sell-offs, shifts in market sentiment, long position liquidations, and breaches of key support levels. Will WIF reach $10? Having already reached about $5 on March 31, 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Predictions by analysts suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2028. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $5 by 2025 and $15 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The 24X National Exchange, a Stamford, Connecticut-based trading platform, is set to launch with an almost uninterrupted schedule. Designed to serve both retail and institutional investors, this exchange plans to operate on business days from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. But that’s not the big deal. Pending final approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 24X might extend operations to 8:00 p.m. ET on Sundays through 7:00 p.m. ET on Fridays—essentially open for 23 hours a day with just a one-hour pause. This is the closest the U.S. has ever come to a stock exchange that barely sleeps. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, which stick to standard hours and shut down on holidays, 24X is rewriting the rules. The company is leaning into the global nature of trading, wanting to accommodate markets in Asia-Pacific (APAC), where U.S. equities are hot commodities, even when Wall Street is fast asleep. Why now? – The crypto connection Let’s not pretend this is a coincidence. Cryptocurrencies, which have been trading nonstop since Bitcoin’s debut, have been schooling traditional markets on what 24/7 access looks like. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase thrive on constant availability, and traders have gotten used to the idea of instant action, regardless of the time or day. Stocks, on the other hand, have stayed in their lane, sticking to opening bells and closing times. Sure, brokerage firms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have extended trading hours for some securities, but those windows still don’t come close to crypto’s round-the-clock hustle. The 24X National Exchange seems to be taking a page from the crypto playbook, recognizing the demand for seamless trading across time zones and asset classes. Dmitri Galinov, the brains behind the exchange, knows what’s at stake. “Traders are most at risk when the market is closed in their geographic location,” Galinov said in a statement . His solution? Bring U.S. equities trading to a global audience and make it as accessible as crypto. The 24X National Exchange is powered by technology from MEMX Technologies, a company known for its high-performance systems. The exchange claims it plans to use its advanced infrastructure to adapt quickly to customer feedback, so it can build trust with traders tired of rigid systems. Yet, for all its ambition, 24X isn’t abandoning tradition entirely. The exchange will stick to U.S. market holidays, closing in sync with NYSE and Nasdaq. A bigger picture Traders who have flocked to crypto markets for their constant availability might now have a compelling reason to split their attention. A stock market that’s almost always open could siphon off some of the volume that’s been a hallmark of crypto trading. And let’s talk liquidity. Extended trading hours mean more opportunities to buy and sell, potentially stabilizing prices in both the stock and crypto markets. But with liquidity comes volatility. Markets that never really close are like roller coasters without brakes. Every global event, every piece of breaking news, could trigger reactions that ripple across time zones. This isn’t just about traders though. Regulators will need to step up their game too. A near-24-hour stock exchange is uncharted territory, and it could push the SEC to rethink how markets are overseen. Don’t be surprised if this leads to clearer coexistence between crypto and equities. The overlap between the two worlds is becoming harder to ignore. Winners, losers, and the retail dilemma But the truth is, not everyone will be cheering for 24X. Retail investors, for one, might find the idea of nearly nonstop trading overwhelming. Let’s face it, not everyone has the stomach for markets that are always open, which is understandable. While institutional players will likely thrive in this environment, retail traders could struggle to keep up, widening the gap between Wall Street pros and Main Street novices. There’s also the risk of market manipulation. Longer trading hours mean more chances for bad actors to exploit loopholes. But for those who can adapt, the opportunities are huge. Arbitrage traders, for instance, could find gold in the overlapping hours between stocks and crypto. Global participation might also see a boost, with investors from different time zones jumping in when it suits them. Whether 24X succeeds or fails, it’s pretty clear that the way we think about markets is about to change forever, even if it is just through President Donald Trump.

The stablecoin issuer had just minted another 3B USDT last Sunday. The company has pushed its total minted USDT to 14 billion since November 8. CCData revealed that USDT has remained dominant in the stablecoin ecosystem, commanding approximately 69% of the total stablecoin market share. The high volume of Tether’s stablecoin activity was the primary driver behind the network’s $2.5 billion in earnings during Q3 2024. Tether’s CEO claims additional USDT for inventory replenishment PSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Tron Network. Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps. — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) August 20, 2024 Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, explained that the minting is a “USDT inventory replenish,” meaning the tokens are only authorized but not yet issued. Ardoino revealed that the tokens are added to Tether’s inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps. According to the company’s CEO, the approach will help ensure sufficient supply for effective liquidity management, with tokens released into circulation once officially issued. Ardoino is confident that the more stablecoins become available, traders will have greater flexibility in the market, and it can enhance market stability and efficiency. Data from on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously revealed that Tether mints the USDT and sends it to its multisignature wallet, where the funds are transferred to its treasury. The data also disclosed that the transaction featured zero fees. The company’s strategic minting depicts its ongoing efforts to maintain a robust supply of USDT to meet market demands. Tether’s newly minted USDT impacts the crypto market Research by Dr. Aman Saggu, together with Blockchain Research Lab, indicated that Tether’s continued issuance of USDT has a significant impact on the crypto ecosystem. The study evaluates and identifies every USDT minting and burning event on every blockchain ever used by Tether over the 2014 to 2021 period. The research revealed that Bitcoin prices tend to rise shortly after Tether mints new USDT. The study highlighted that Bitcoin prices increased by approximately 0.4% after 5 minutes and 0.8% after 30 minutes following a $1 billion USDT minting event. Saggu’s research suggested that investors view USDT minting as positive news due to its increased liquidity and demand signaled in the market. The study also confirmed that investors do not react similarly to USDT burning events. However, the study confirmed that the market does not perceive a reduction in USDT supply as negative news. Instead, it highlighted that Bitcoin’s price response to USDT minting is more driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) during periods of strong market sentiment and bullish conditions. CCData reported that the stablecoin market has surged in the past month. Tether marked an increase in its market capitalization to $190 billion and $1.8 trillion in trading volumes. The firm revealed in a post that USDT’s market cap rose last month by 0.57% to mark its thirteenth consecutive month of growth. Cryptocurrency traders and investors utilize stablecoin supply like Tether’s as a proxy to gauge market sentiment and investor interest. The rise in the level of newly minted stablecoins depicts bullish momentum, suggesting that traders are speculating on price movements. On the contrary, a reduction in supply would hint at lower interest and market activity.

The exchange’s website highlighted that traders can now access SOL/USD, SOL/EUR, PEPE/USD, and PEPE/EUR spot trading pairs. The exchange will debut PEPE, the third largest memecoin by market cap, which significantly surged in price after the listing announcement. The listing comes amid a prior “permanent” suspension trading ban of Solana on Bitstamp. Bitstamp believes relisting SOL demonstrates its dedication to bringing diverse options to U.S. customers.

Start now: https://t.co/sPXIuEAQ2H @pepecoineth @solana pic.twitter.com/nsbIQ2NoXe — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) November 29, 2024 Bitstamp supports several projects across decentralized finance, non-fungible token marketplace, and memecoins. The company shared that it is listing the third-largest memecoin by market cap. The PEPE memecoin has surged in price in the past few months amid a broader market uptick. The announcement was shared on the company’s official X account. The listing news comes at a time when the U.S expects a myriad of changes to the it’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, following Donald Trump’s presidential election win. The price of PEPE jumped to $0.000021 amid the news, and was up by 6% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing. The memecoin has now entrenched itself as the third-largest memecoin by market cap. SOL also bounced to highs of $247 after the news. Bitstamp reverses previous SOL trading suspension In August 2023, Bitstamp announced that it would no longer recognize SOL and six other cryptocurrencies. The decision followed allegations that Solana and six other digital assets were unregistered securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, the tokens were suspended from trading on the Bitstamp exchange. Even though only two crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved under the previous administration, the market is expecting a bigger shift following Trump’s win. ETF issuers are making applications for Solana, XRP, and HBAR ETFs, among others. A potential candidate for the next SEC chair, Teresa Guillén, also advocates to “make crypto great again.” Gary Gensler’s stepping down as SEC chairman has hinted towards a new approach to crypto regulation that could be more friendly. As a result, crypto exchange platforms like Bitstamp are embracing the new environment with their new listings in anticipation of a more relaxed regulatory environment. Multiple crypto platforms have begun adapting to the prospects of an improved regulatory environment. For example, MetaMask now allows US users to buy crypto directly using Venmo as an additional payment method. Bitstamp’s CEO, Bobby Zagotta, explained his renewed confidence in the stablecoin market in an interview on November 5. Zagotta revealed that the stablecoin market has the potential to grow from $175 billion to $5 trillion. The CEO backed his confidence by acknowledging that stablecoins have already played a crucial role in the development of the crypto ecosystem. Zagotta maintained that stablecoins have reduced frictions in terms of transfer value, collateral, and lending. Zagotta also revealed he is confident the stablecoin market will grow as other fiat currencies continue gaining traction in crypto. The crypto mogul compared the potential growth of the stablecoin market to the growth of the foreign exchange market.

Dogecoin Is Currently Showing A Pattern Similar To Previous Bull Runs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that has formed for Dogecoin’s weekly price recently. The “ TD Sequential ” refers to a technical analysis (TA) indicator that points out locations of probable tops and bottoms in a given asset’s price. This indicator involves two phases: the setup and the countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. Once the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be complete, and a reversal in the asset may be expected. Naturally, the price would start heading down if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were green, while it would catch an updraft if the candles were red. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown begins. This phase of the indicator works similarly to the setup, except for the fact that it lasts for thirteen candles. After these thirteen candles are also in, the asset may be considered to have arrived at another likely point of turnaround. Dogecoin has recently completed the TD Sequential phase of the first type, as the below chart for its weekly price shared by the analyst highlights. As is visible in the graph, Dogecoin has finished the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the indicator has just given a sell signal for the memecoin. Considering the indictor’s history, it’s possible that this would lead to a drawdown for the asset. That said, history would also inform us of another thing, as Martinez has highlighted in the chart. It would appear that during each of the last two bull runs , DOGE observed a similar TD Sequential setup in the initial leg of the rally as the one witnessed recently. These signals led into declines for the coin, but the bearish momentum didn’t last very long on either occasion, as the rally renewed each time after a temporary setback. If this trend is to go by, it’s possible that the latest TD Sequential sell signal may also prove to be only a minor obstacle on the way up for the cryptocurrency’s price. From the graph, it’s also visible that the last two Dogecoin bull runs both fit neatly into an ascending parallel channel . The channel has also continued to hold in the current cycle so far, meaning that if DOGE is going to rise all the way toward its upper channel, it might break through the $14 mark. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the asset would repeat the pattern or if this cycle is going to be different from the last two. DOGE Price Dogecoin has hit the snooze during the last couple of weeks as its price has continued to move sideways around the $0.41 mark.",Dogecoin|doge|Dogecoin Bull Run|Dogecoin Sell Signal|Dogecoin TD Sell|Dogecoin TD Sequential|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-29 23:00:42

In a new blog post, the crypto exchange says that its US branch is adding support for smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) and Pepe ( PEPE ), a frog-themed meme asset built on top altcoin Ethereum ( ETH ). “The day US fans of Solana and Pepe have been waiting for is finally here! We’re excited to announce that well-known Solana and the popular meme coin Pepe are now available for trading on Bitstamp in the US.” News of the listings sent both SOL and PEPE flying, as Solana went from a low of $235 on November 28th to a peak of $246 the next day while PEPE went from a low of $0.00001941 to a peak of $0.00002101 during the same time frame. Both SOL and PEPE have since retraced and are trading for $240 and $0.00002038 at time of writing, respectively. In its post, Bitstamp describes Solana as “a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to deliver fast and scalable transactions” and Pepe as a charming token inspired by the legendary Pepe the Frog character that has no actual utility beyond collecting and trading. Earlier this year, retail trading giant Robinhood announced that it would be acquiring Bitstamp – which was founded in 2011 in Luxembourg – for $200 million despite getting hit with a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

BONK and DOGE Lag",https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elon-maga-elonmaga-solana-memecoin-to-rally-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-lag/,"Elon MAGA could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-29 23:08:00

The multimodal AI model is thought to be a boon to Amazon’s AWS offering. Additionally, Olympus is expected to reduce Amazon’s reliance on external AI providers while strengthening its own cloud computing service. Amazon’s Olympus can analyze videos Amazon is reportedly working on a new AI tool, Olympus, which could analyze videos, images, and text. AI functionalities software developer, Tibor Blaho, explained in a post on X that the multimodal AI model is designed to help businesses in specific industries. It can reportedly perform tasks like searching through videos using text prompts or automatically analyzing footage in detail. scoop w/ @KevKubernetes : Amazon has developed new generative AI that can process images and video, in addition to text. Amazon could launch the model (code-named Olympus) next week at re:Invent in Las Vegas to lessen its reliance on 3-party models https://t.co/7cwB65zT5T — Anissa Gardizy (@anissagardizy8) November 28, 2024 But, what is Amazon getting out of this AI tool? Well, it is claimed that it will reduce Amazon’s dependency on other AI companies, like Anthropic. Blaho says that an official statement may come during Amazon’s AWS re :Invent conference in the upcoming week. Notably, AWS or Amazon Web Services comes under Amazon which provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs. From the information, we infer that oil and gas companies could use Olympus to analyze drone footage and identify problems with underwater equipment. These inspections are usually long and costly and Olympus might cut the time and cost. Another application is potentially to create sports highlights and analyze archives. Video-related features are something that mainstream AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have not captured. Amazon’s cloud computing customers could benefit from the launch . AWS offerings can benefit from Olympus integration AWS is a pay-as-you-go pricing model that deploys applications globally. It is not only known for applications that scale computing and add various features , it provides security services and AI tools as well . For instance, Amazon’s Olympus could enhance the capabilities of Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock with in-house multimodal capabilities. Its integration with products like SageMaker means building complex applications can become simple. Potentially, developers could access Olympus as a pre-trained model for multimodal tasks. Amazon’s Olympus could be an AI game-changer | Image is AI generated Last year, AI commentator Rowan Cheung reported that Olympus is Amazon’s attempt to enter the competitive generative AI space. Especially when companies in the sector, like NVIDIA, have been making fast-paced advancements in high-speed model training. In September 2023, Deloitte said in a press release that it teamed up with AWS to create Olympus, a cloud accelerator fund. Forrest Danson, principal and global chief commercial officer of the Amazon/AWS alliance, Deloitte Consulting LLP, explained that the partnership would help businesses quickly adopt advanced cloud-based tools and technologies like AI to solve problems. Meanwhile, AI launches continue to hit the markets. Tesla chief Elon Musk is bracing for his artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, to launch an AI-powered gaming studio. Telecommunications company Orange announced a partnership with OpenAI and Meta to develop AI models in regional languages. Amid these offerings, Amazon’s Olympus AI tool could add additional capabilities to the technology sector.

The latest model reportedly outshines OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini models on some specific benchmarks, such as the AIME and MATH tests, which evaluate AI models’ performance in logic puzzles and math problems. Alibaba has made QwQ-32B-Preview for download. According to the retail giant, Alibaba’s new model is capable of tackling complex and intricate problems compared to normal large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5. An article by Benzinga indicates that the QwQ-32B-Preview is one of the few available under a permissive license, enabling users to download and use it. The model is now available on the AI development platform Hugging Face. However, Alibaba released certain components of the model to limit full replication of the model or insights into its working. Alibaba’s latest model boasts 32.5 billion parameters which allows it to handle prompts of up to 32,000 words. With the model’s significant capabilities and semi-open accessibility, Alibaba’s new entrant sets the stage for a transformative leap in AI reasoning technologies. Alibaba’s transparent announcement, which underscores its model’s sophistication, OpenAI has kept its parameter counts under wraps. The coming of this model comes at a time when OpenAI is making significant strides in the AI sector. In October, OpenAI’s valuation jumped to $157 billion following a successful funding round. Earlier this week, SoftBank Group SFTBF reportedly increased its stake in the ChatGPT maker through a $1.5 billion employee share buyout. OpenAI is also said to be exploring the development of its own web browser to challenge Alphabet’s subsidiary Google Chrome browser after pressure coming from the US Department of Justice to divest it. Alibaba admits the model has flaws too Although it possesses some unique strengths, the new model also has limitations. According to the group, QwQ-32B-Preview has issues like unexpected language switches, which could potentially confuse users. The model also underperforms in tasks requiring common-sense reasoning, which is common with many AI systems. According to AutoGPT , the model may get caught in logical loops, delaying responses. Despite its shortcomings, its reasoning capabilities allow it to fact-check itself, therefore cutting on errors but increasing resolution time. By reasoning through tasks and planning steps, Alibaba’s model avoids some pitfalls that affect traditional AI systems. But this approach demands extra time which might limit real-time application. According to Benzinga, QwQ-32B-Preview’ responses align with Chinese regulatory standards , avoiding politically sensitive topics. For example, politically sensitive topics like Taiwan will give responses that are aligned with the Chinese government’s stance. Additionally, prompts about events like Tiananmen Square result in no responses coming up, showing the model’s cautious design. While this might be ideal for the Chinese market, it can also limit its appeal on the global market. However, the model is a significant step into the world of reasoning AI. While its limitations may narrow its global appeal, its other components like logic and semi-open nature makes it a big competitor for OpenAI. According to AutoGPT, QwQ-32B-Preview highlight the potential, and challenges, of this exciting frontier where AI labs across the world are working towards refining reasoning technology.

Amidst the chaos, investors always look for the best crypto to buy today, navigating the noise to uncover hidden gems with explosive potential. While major market players are making headlines, there’s growing buzz around new innovations like Qubetics ($TICS), whose presale has the crypto world sitting up and paying attention. But first, let’s glance at the drama surrounding Binance and SEI’s recent breakout. Then, we’ll dive into why Qubetics could be your ticket to massive returns. This article will break down the latest developments for Qubetics, Binance, and SEI while helping you uncover the best crypto to buy today. Qubetics Wallet: Where Innovation Meets Convenience The Qubetics Wallet is set to revolutionise how we interact with digital assets. Designed for everyday users, it’s all about making crypto management easy, secure, and accessible. Whether you’re on iOS, Android, or a desktop, this wallet offers seamless functionality across platforms , letting you control your $TICS tokens and other digital assets like a pro.

This bold step merges traditional and digital finance, giving users more control and flexibility in their financial lives. It’s not just a wallet; it’s a gateway to your financial future. Binance Faces Whistleblower Allegations and Legal Troubles Binance, one of the biggest names in crypto, is under fire again. A former executive, Amrita Srivastava, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit in the UK, claiming wrongful termination. She alleges she was fired for reporting a colleague who requested a bribe from a customer in exchange for preferential treatment. Binance denies these allegations, stating her dismissal was due to performance issues. Meanwhile, Nigerian authorities have accused Binance of laundering $35.4 million and operating without a license. These controversies could cast a shadow on Binance’s reputation, leaving investors questioning its ethics and long-term stability. SEI’s Meteoric Rise: A 60% Surge and Bullish Momentum SEI has been turning heads with an impressive 60% surge over the past two weeks, driven by strong market interest and bullish momentum. After a slight pullback to the 50% Fibonacci level, the coin has rebounded to $0.5264, marking a 14% gain in just 24 hours. With trading volume hitting $783.84 million and TVL standing at $207.32 million, SEI is clearly on an upward trajectory. However, liquidation risks loom as shorts face increasing pressure. Key resistance at $0.5460 and support at $0.4414 suggest volatility ahead, especially around liquidation clusters. Whether SEI continues its climb or sees a correction, it’s a coin worth keeping on your radar. Qubetics Presale Phase 10 Ending Soon If you’re wondering about the best crypto to buy today, Qubetics is hard to beat. Currently, in Presale Phase 10, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, with over $3.6 million already raised. Here’s the kicker: each week, the token price climbs by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike in the final stage. That means the earlier you get in, the more you stand to gain. Let’s talk numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could skyrocket to $10 or even $15 in the future. What does that mean for you? A modest $200 investment at today’s price could turn into a staggering $80,000 at $10 per token—or an eye-popping $195,000 if it hits $15. That’s an ROI of up to 59,900%! With opportunities like this, it’s no wonder Qubetics is making waves as the best crypto to buy today . Conclusion: The Crypto Revolution Awaits In a market full of opportunities, Qubetics, Binance, and SEI are making waves for different reasons. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy today, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out with its innovative wallet, practical payment integrations, and the jaw-dropping ROI potential of its presale.

Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground, preparing for a potential Wave 4 breakout that could take it higher. Algorand (ALGO) is on fire, showcasing a “W” breakout pattern that analysts believe could catapult its price by 300% to $1.26. But stealing the show is Qubetics ($TICS) , the new best crypto presale to buy now, which has already sold over 239 million tokens, raising a jaw-dropping $3.6 million. What makes Qubetics different? It’s not just another token; it’s a solution-driven platform addressing real-world issues that older blockchain systems couldn’t crack. With tools like its Multi-Chain Wallet, Qubetics is setting a new standard for usability, security, and innovation. If you’re hunting for the best opportunities in crypto , here’s everything you need to know about these three projects. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Qubetics is the talk of the town for all the right reasons. At its core lies the Multi-Chain Wallet , a revolutionary tool designed to simplify people’s crypto management. Think of it as a universal remote for your digital assets—seamlessly handling transactions across multiple blockchains without hassle. Imagine you’re a small business owner juggling Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana payments. With Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet, you no longer need to switch between apps or worry about compatibility. It’s all under one roof, making life simpler and more secure. For professionals, this wallet eliminates the headaches of managing diverse portfolios. And for everyday users? It’s the easiest way to send, receive, and store crypto without the steep learning curve. Qubetics isn’t just about innovation—it’s also about delivering massive ROI potential. In its 10th presale stage, the project has sold over 239 million $TICS tokens to 4,800+ holders, raising more than $3.6 million. Priced at $0.0257, this is the new best crypto presale to buy now—especially with a 10% price jump coming this weekend. Analysts are bullish, predicting $TICS will hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS could surge to $1, delivering a 3,787% ROI. If the mainnet launch hits its stride, the token might reach $15—a mind-blowing 58,213% ROI. To put that into perspective, a $4,000 investment at $0.0257 nets you about 155,250 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $15, your $4,000 becomes a staggering $2,328,750. It’s not just an opportunity; it’s a potential financial revolution. No wonder crypto analysts consider it the new best crypto presale to buy now . Cardano (ADA): Waiting for the Wave 4 Breakout Cardano has always been a crowd favourite, and its recent performance keeps investors intrigued. After breaking above $1, ADA is eyeing its next move. Analysts call this a Wave 4 setup—a critical phase where the price consolidates before potentially breaking out. The key support zones to watch are between $0.85 and $0.60, with the most critical level at $0.702. Despite a recent pullback, ADA hasn’t lost its bullish spark. The Fibonacci support levels between $0.88 and $0.778 have held strong, providing a base for the next leg up. What’s exciting is the potential for higher prices. If ADA breaks resistance around $1.14 and $1.12, it could soar to $1.87—a significant leap for holders. But here’s the kicker: the recent pullback from the November 23 high was in three waves rather than five. This opens the door for an upward move, making ADA one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for those seeking medium-term gains. ADA’s current range is a balancing act between risk and reward for traders and investors. If the price dips, support at $0.85 and $0.77 offers potential re-entry points. But if it pushes higher, the upside could be substantial. Algorand (ALGO): Aiming for the Moon with a “W” Breakout Pattern Algorand is catching fire, and it’s easy to see why. The token is trading around $0.30, but a “W” breakout pattern has analysts predicting a 300% rally to $1.26. This classic double-bottom setup often reverses the trend, and ALGO seems primed for liftoff. The critical resistance lies between $0.30 and $0.32. A daily close above this range would validate the bullish pattern, potentially triggering a massive upward move. The projected target of $1.26 isn’t just hype; it’s backed by solid technical analysis. The pattern’s height adds credibility to the prediction, and traders closely monitor volume to confirm the breakout. But there are risks. If ALGO fails to break $0.32, the price could retreat to its $0.15 support level. However, the overall sentiment remains positive, with rising trading volumes indicating strong interest. For those looking at the best cryptos to buy now, ALGO offers an exciting mix of short-term potential and medium-term growth. Seize the Moment with the Best Crypto Opportunities When it comes to the new best crypto presale to buy now, Qubetics is leading the charge. Its Multi-Chain Wallet is a game-changer, and the ROI potential is off the charts. Meanwhile, Cardano is setting up for a Wave 4 breakout that could take it to new highs, and Algorand’s “W” breakout pattern offers an enticing 300% rally target. But time is of the essence. The Qubetics presale is in its final stages, with a price hike just days away. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Secure your $TICS tokens now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. What are you waiting for? Dive in today and make your move before the market does!

As per a November 29 filing, the company reported converting 14,200 ETH into approximately 515 BTC in an open-market deal worth more than $49 million. The Ethereum had been acquired at an average cost of $2,777 per ETH, totaling $39.45 million. Following the transaction, Boyaa now holds 3,183 BTC, with an average purchase price of $57,724 per coin. The company emphasized that the move is in line with its strategy to expand its Bitcoin reserves, considering the market outlook for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. According to the board, converting existing Ether holdings into is a timely decision. In March, Boyaa announced the approval of a $100 million initiative to allocate $45 million of corporate funds to Bitcoin, $45 million to Ethereum, and $10 million to stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed firm disclosed a $1 million investment in the UTXO Management Bitcoin Ecosystem Fund in July.

Notably, the correction has given rise to the formation of a bullish pennant on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. This development might be the bullish momentum needed to eventually break past the $100,000 price threshold. However, the anticipated breakout is not just above $100,000, but a run that would send the cryptocurrency to $145,000. Bullish Pennant Emerges On Bitcoin Price Chart Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the $96,000 price level after spending the majority of the week on a correction path . Particularly, this correction saw the Bitcoin price hitting a low of $91,000 as many traders took profit. Notably, this back-and-forth movement of the BTC price has given rise to the formation of a small bull pennant. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, known for his technical analyses, pointed out this formation on social media platform X. In his post, he stated , “Small Pennant Big Target,” while pointing to the formation on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. A bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that often emerges during strong uptrends. It begins with a sharp price movement (the flagpole), followed by a consolidation phase (the pennant), before potentially breaking out in the same direction as the initial trend. The emergence of this bullish pennant on Bitcoin’s 3-day chart suggests that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for another leg higher. However, the formation suggests that the Bitcoin price could still continue to consolidate for a while as the liquidity in the pennant is yet to be filled. Nonetheless, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis highlights the longer-term implications of this formation. According to his projections, once Bitcoin completes its consolidation and breaks out of the pennant, it could surge toward an ambitious price target of $145,000. The $145,000 price target has become somewhat recurring among crypto analysts. For instance, this price target also made its way into an analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino, whose analysis pointed to the Bitcoin price top for this cycle at around $145,000. $100,000 Price Target Still In Play At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $96,070 and is up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours but down by 3.3% in the past seven days. The possibility of the Bitcoin price reaching the $100,000 price mark is not a matter of if at this point but of when. Speaking of when, the BTC price is about to witness another catalyst that could finally send it above $100,000. Bitcoin is about to undergo its largest monthly options expiry of 2024 on Friday, involving a total exposure of $13.6 billion. This expiry event could provide the momentum needed for bullish traders to drive Bitcoin’s price past the $100,000 milestone in the coming week.",Bitcoin|analyst|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 00:00:25

Morocco becoming the first African country to support a pro-crypto regulatory framework is big news for the global market and will drive the prices further up. Widespread adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and other front runners could potentially be beneficial to blockchain platforms like Near Protocol (NEAR). However, a new player could see the most out of this surge, IntelMarkets (INTL). Bitcoin Price: $5K Down Since Its ATH Bitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Being the largest crypto ever, Bitcoin’s massive price swings are nothing new. Its finite supply of 21 million coins and secure network has made it a popular store of value and an investment asset often referred to as “digital gold.” As per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $95,100, a 40% increase since last month. BTC seems to hold onto this upward trajectory due to favorable crypto policies being implemented around the world, together with rising institutional interest. Morocco’s progressive legislation is one example that will aid in BTC adoption in that part of the world. Bitcoin is the go-to long-term investment for many traders because it offers stability like none others. However, its massive market cap of $1.88T means that BTC has a limit on its upside. Many investors are looking to invest in shorter-term, higher-return projects. One of those projects that they’ve turned their heads to is IntelMarkets (INTL), which is becoming the game changer for those who seek higher returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Struggling To Reach Its Former Glory, Down 3% Near Protocol (NEAR) has made its name in the blockchain world with its focus on scalability, developer accessibility and user friendly applications. It uses a unique sharding technology called “Nightshade” to achieve high throughput and efficiency. NEAR, which is trading at $6.53, has repeatedly failed to recapture its former glory — its ATH of $20.42 in January of 2022. NEAR’s price instability shouldn’t diminish the fact that the token is still a solid choice for long-term investors as its ecosystem expands. With increased decentralized applications and partnership adoption, experts target a conservative $7 by the end of 2024. But since NEAR’s market cap is over $8 billion, explosive growth is far less likely than that of low-cap gems. NEAR is a safe entry for steady gains, but IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a unique opportunity for investors wanting to maximize returns utilizing a brand-new AI-driven approach. IntelMarkets (INTL): Revolutionizing Crypto Trading The project you should be looking out for during the following months is IntelMarkets (INTL). IntelMarkets combines AI, blockchain, and DeFi in one platform, offering traders a hassle free experience. The self learning AI trading bots analyze data at incredible speeds and enable a user to make profits on compelling opportunities across asset classes. The market has been excited by IntelMarkets ’ forward thinking approach, and so it was no surprise that investors have poured over $2.4 million into its presale. Some of INTL’s Key Features: AI Integration: Real-time self-learning bots that learn by optimizing their trading strategies. Dual-Chain Architecture: Scalable and efficient because it supports both Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Low Entry Price: With tokens sold at $0.055, there is plenty of room for early investors to get in. Massive Upside Potential: A top pick for life-changing gains, analysts predict a 75x rally post-launch. Exponential Growth Potential: As a low cap token, IntelMarkets (INTL) is predicted to outperform Bitcoin and NEAR on an upside basis, due to their limitations. Key Takeaways While Bitcoin (BTC) and Near Protocol (NEAR) remain attractive options for long-term investors looking for moderate gains, IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a rare opportunity to achieve life-changing returns. Its cutting-edge AI technology, low entry price, and immense growth potential make it the best investment choice in 2024. With Morocco’s crypto-friendly policy adding fuel to the market, INTL is poised to lead the next wave of innovation and surge.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 00:13:00

If approved, Ripple will be able to issue its stablecoin under a limited-purpose trust charter. This will position the company as a key player in the regulated U.S. digital finance market. The potential launch date is set for December 4, 2024, pending final regulatory approval. Ripple Labs Set to Launch RLUSD Stablecoin as New York Approval Nears According to a recent Fox Business report , Ripple labs is on the verge of receiving approval from New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD. This approval is crucial for Ripple as it seeks to enter the regulated U.S. market for stablecoins. The NYDFS is known for its stringent regulatory standards, ensuring that companies meet high levels of transparency before offering digital assets. Once approved, Ripple will be able to issue RLUSD under a limited-purpose trust charter, a common regulatory pathway for digital asset firms in New York. This regulatory approach allows Ripple to offer stablecoins without the more complex regulatory requirements faced by traditional banks. If all goes as planned, Ripple could launch RLUSD as soon as December 4, 2024. This is a significant step for the company in its pursuit of expanding its offerings in the U.S. digital finance sector. According to a recent report, Ripple Labs is expanding its partnership with Mercy Corps through the “Unlocking Opportunities” program. The initiative will drive the adoption of RLUSD, promoting financial inclusion in cases such as savings, and micropayments. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Aims to Offer Stability More so, Ripple’s stablecoin will provide a stable alternative to XRP, which has been prone to volatility. By being pegged to a stable asset, RLUSD will attract customers seeking a more predictable and reliable digital currency. Stablecoins are typically pegged to assets with stable valuations, such as the U.S. dollar. They also serve as a store of value and help facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions. Ripple’s move into the stablecoin market places it in direct competition with other established U.S. issuers like Circle, Paxos, and Gemini. Additionally, for the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple labs will collaborate with several well-known payment providers, including Bitstamp, Moonpay, and Uphold. These partnerships will help Ripple expand RLUSD’s reach, offering users more access to payments and remittances. Keith Grossman, president of Enterprise at MoonPay, stated that the launch is a positive development for the stablecoin market. Grossman emphasized, “For another well-capitalized, highly regulated player to enter into the global stablecoin marketplace – especially as MiCA regulation in Europe is about to be implemented – is a win-win and MoonPay is proud to provide access to RLUSD for our partners and customers on day one of Ripple’s launch.” Meanwhile, XRP whales have moved over 139 million coins, sparking speculation as the Ripple Labs vs. SEC lawsuit nears a potential resolution. These large transactions come amid growing optimism that the legal case could favor Ripple, with XRP price rising.

XRP is currently trading above the crucial $1.50 level and is up by more than six percent in the last 24 hours. The altcoin has gained 20 percent in the past week and is now eyeing to break the $1.60 level. As for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is trading above the $97k level and has slipped into the red zone. XRP Continues Bull Run Although many cryptocurrencies move in waves, XRP tends to follow a straight upward trajectory, especially during bull markets. At the moment, XRP is facing some resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If XRP breaks above $1.70, it could easily hit $2 soon. Watch for the breakout above $1.70 to confirm this possibility. Support Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, in case of a pullback, XRP has solid support around $1.25 to $1.30. This range has acted as major support in recent times, so if the price drops, it is likely to bounce back from there. Short-Term Outlook: Breakout and Resistance XRP has successfully broken out from a triangle pattern. Although the breakout was slightly delayed, it is now heading towards the target price of $1.77. Short-term resistance may appear around $1.70, but once that level is cleared, XRP is expected to continue its upward movement. Previous Resistance Becomes Support The breakout above $1.50-$1.51 marks a significant shift. Once this resistance level was cleared, XRP’s price surged higher. Now, those previous resistance levels should act as new support. Watch for support around $1.62 to $1.63, and further support around $1.56 or $1.50 if the price pulls back.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 00:25:03

However, to make your experience as comfortable as possible, it’s essential to approach it with thoughtful preparation and strategic choices. One of the most important steps is choosing the right platform. While there are countless crypto-gambling sites available, not all offer the same level of security, fairness, or user experience. Look for platforms with verified licenses, strong reputations, and provably fair gaming systems. Additionally, ensure the platform supports the cryptocurrencies you intend to use and provides responsive customer support for any potential issues. For those seeking fair gaming, diverse gaming options, access to multiple cryptocurrencies, and enticing extras like bonuses and other freebies, this list of crypto casinos is an excellent place to start. These platforms have been curated to offer a secure and enjoyable gambling experience, catering to both newcomers and seasoned players. Although being web-based platforms, they’re fully compliant with international security and payment standards, and licensed accordingly. But starting with these activities without a clear expenditure plan can be a slippery slope. Hence, managing your budget effectively is another key to a comfortable experience. Set a clear gambling budget in advance and stick to it. This not only prevents financial stress but also ensures that the activity remains enjoyable. Many crypto platforms offer tools like deposit limits or self-exclusion options to help you stay in control. Take advantage of these features if they can enhance your comfort. Familiarizing yourself with the games is equally important. Before diving in, spend some time understanding the rules and strategies of your chosen games. Many platforms offer demo versions that allow you to practice without risking your funds. Whether it’s poker, slots, or sports betting, having a solid grasp of the gameplay can enhance your confidence and reduce frustration. Another essential tip is to ensure privacy and security. Use a reliable crypto wallet to manage your funds, preferably one with robust security features like two-factor authentication. Avoid sharing sensitive information and be cautious of phishing attempts . Some users prefer gambling anonymously; if that’s a priority for you, choose platforms that don’t require extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. Staying updated on cryptocurrency trends can also make your experience smoother. Crypto values can fluctuate significantly, so being aware of market conditions helps you plan deposits and withdrawals strategically. Keeping an eye on transaction fees is similarly important, as these can vary depending on network congestion. Finally, prioritize platforms with a user-friendly interface. A cluttered or confusing design can make the experience frustrating, while intuitive navigation and helpful tutorials can enhance your enjoyment. By carefully selecting your platform, managing your funds, and staying informed, you can make crypto gambling a comfortable and rewarding experience.

Despite the resistance, the HBAR price at press time was trading at $0.1823, a 25% surge from the intra-day low. During the rally, HBAR’s trading volume and market capitalization soared by 261% and 25% respectively, reaching $954.36 million and $6.92 billion. Hedera (HBAR) Price Jumps 25% Hedera (HBAR) price has displayed strong upward momentum, reinforced by technical indicators suggesting continued bullish trends after skyrocketing over 25%. The HBAR price recently crossed both its 50-day (SMA 50) and 200-day (SMA 200) simple moving averages, forming a “golden cross”. The SMA 50 is currently at $0.07545, while the SMA 200 is positioned at $0.07169, both well below the current price. HBAR/USD price chart (Source: TradingView) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for HBAR has reached 78.56, nearing the overbought zone of 80. This suggests strong buying activity but also indicates a potential price consolidation as traders may take profits. However, analysts remain optimistic, with one Javon Marks forecasting a possible rally to $0.504, representing a 192% increase from current levels. Increased Market Activity Boosts Investor Confidence HBAR’s price rally has been accompanied by heightened trading activity and open interest, indicating growing market participation. Trading volume surged by 261% to $954.36 million in 24 hours, while open interest grew by 48.26% to $208.25 million. This increase suggests that new capital is entering the market, which could support sustained upward price movement. According to More Crypto Online, HBAR’s current movement aligns with Elliott Wave theory, suggesting one more high is likely in the short term. Analysts are monitoring key resistance levels at $0.176, $0.20, and $0.23. A breakout above these levels could further validate the bullish trend. Federal Reserve Collaboration Fuels Positive Sentiment HBAR’s recent price surge is also being supported by its growing role in blockchain-based federal payment systems. Hedera is integrated into the Federal Reserve’s FedNow payment platform through Dropp, enabling real-time payments with increased efficiency and security. In addition, Ripple (XRP), which has partnered with Hedera for USD transactions, is expected to receive regulatory approval to launch its RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024. This partnership could enhance interoperability between Hedera and Ripple, further bolstering HBAR’s adoption in the payments sector. Concurrently, HBAR traders are also optimistic due to speculation about the potential approval of a Hedera exchange-traded fund (ETF) submitted by Canary Capital to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP beat Binance Coin (BNB) in terms of market capitalization, with XRP having a market capitalization of $100 billion above BNB’s $94 billion. This surge puts XRP in the elite $100 billion club. Currently valued at $1.74, XRP has risen by 17% in the last 24 hours and a stunning 200% in the past month, its best showing since December 2017. The cryptocurrency has continued to surge, reaching $1.7, a price it last touched in April of 2021. Currently, XRP is trailing behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Solana (SOL). On the daily chart, the XRP shows a steep upward trend from $0.50 to $1.72 in a parabolic trend this month. The RSI stands at 88.09, indicating that the asset is overbought, while the MACD at 0.25022 points towards the buying pressure. Support levels are at $1.40 and $1.50 while major resistance levels are at $1.80. A pullback to the $1.50 area, accompanied by a bullish breakout, could be a decent entry opportunity, with the price rallying above $1.80 if volume remains on the rise. Speculations surrounding changes within the US Security and Exchange Commission have boosted investor confidence. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch in December Ripple Labs is making headlines again with its RLUSD stablecoin, a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that is overcollaterized. According to sources , the New York Department of Financial Services is expected to provide its green light to the stablecoin as early as December, which may lead to the trading of the token. Ripple first unveiled its plans to launch the RLUSD in April 2024 as a way of challenging other stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. The company has forecast that the stablecoin market will be $2 trillion by 2028. The pilot of RLUSD was launched in August on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet, with the intention of adding more blockchains. Ripple has also ensured it partners with exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, and other exchanges that support RLUSD. CEO of Ripple Brad Garlinghouse reiterated the company’s commitment to using assets such as XRP to enhance the use cases of the stablecoin.

Launched in April 2023, Pepe Coin quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts. The coin, inspired by the popular internet meme, saw an incredible surge in its value shortly after its debut. If you had invested $100 in Pepe Coin at its launch, you would have seen that investment skyrocket to over $1.6 million during its peak in May 2023. When considering new coins to invest in, several factors should come into play. A coin’s online presence is one of the most important aspects to examine. How a project markets itself online can make a significant difference in its success. SEO cryptocurrency tactics are essential for boosting visibility and reaching the right audience. Projects with optimized websites, strong community engagement on social media, and high-quality content tend to attract more attention. Other factors include the team behind the project, its roadmap, and the utility of the coin itself. Pepe Coin’s success was largely driven by its community. Meme coins often rely heavily on online culture and viral trends, and Pepe Coin was no different. The coin’s developers leveraged the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme, creating a narrative that resonated with a niche audience. Community-driven campaigns on platforms like Twitter and Reddit helped the coin gain momentum. The sense of camaraderie and humor in these online spaces attracted more investors, fueling the coin’s rapid rise. However, the coin’s success was short-lived. By mid-2023, Pepe Coin’s value began to decline, and the hype surrounding it faded. By November 2024, the coin’s price had dropped significantly, leaving many late investors with losses. This cycle is common with meme coins, where the initial buzz often leads to unsustainable valuations. Investors who entered early and exited during the peak benefited the most, while others faced the downside of market volatility. The rise and fall of Pepe Coin underlines the importance of timing in cryptocurrency investments. Early adopters often see the greatest returns, but this comes with high risks. The speculative nature of meme coins means they can lose value as quickly as they gain it. Pepe Coin serves as a reminder for investors to approach such opportunities cautiously and be prepared for the risks involved. While the case of Pepe Coin is fascinating, it also highlights the speculative nature of meme coins. Unlike projects with strong utility or innovative blockchain solutions, meme coins often lack long-term sustainability. Their value is typically tied to social trends and online buzz, which can fade quickly. Looking at the broader crypto market, projects with robust foundations tend to perform better over time. Utility, team credibility, and a well-defined roadmap are critical for long-term success. While meme coins like Pepe can offer massive short-term gains, they are not a substitute for projects with solid use cases. Ethereum , for instance, has grown consistently because of its role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Pepe Coin’s story is a cautionary tale for both seasoned investors and newcomers. It shows the potential for high rewards in crypto but also the risks of chasing hype-driven assets. For those considering new investments, focusing on projects with a strong online presence, community engagement, and clear objectives is essential.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 232,200 followers on the social media platform X that Sei ( SEI ) looks bullish after breaking out of a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart. A rounding bottom formation is a bullish reversal structure suggesting that an asset is ready to witness a new uptrend. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “Fundamentals-wise, I think there needs to be a bit more built on there for people to gamble on but all in all, it looks really good for higher. Grabbing a bag a bit lower if it comes. Something like $0.60 would be a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.66. Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is the smart contract platform Fantom ( FTM ). According to the crypto strategist, FTM looks solid for long-term investors given its strong fundamentals. He also says the coin looks bullish after breaking out from a multi-month accumulation period. “FTM: there’s a lot to like with this chart and project IMO (in my opinion): -Andre [Cronje] cracked dev -high float/not as much sell pressure from VCs (venture capitalists) -Sonic rebrand coming that hits all the narratives -chart-wise, almost a two-year accumulation period followed by some big moves and clean levels. I’m in. Don’t really recommend you buy at this current level, to be frank, but I think that buying any dips is a good thing. Still believe that this is a pretty decent one to hold if you’re looking for older 2021 movers that have high float/supply out (others like AVAX might be considered).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FTM is facing one big resistance level at $1.10. At time of writing, FTM is trading at $1.00. Looking at fellow layer-1 (L1) protocol Near ( NEAR ), the trader shares a chart suggesting that the altcoin may target its resistance at $8.29 after moving above $6.50. “NEAR has pretty slow grinding price action and isn’t really a great active trade right now. That said, I do think that this hits a lot of narratives for this cycle in terms of AI (artificial intelligence) and L1. Would like to see more growth on there / more degen stuff but I do have a bag of this.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X NEAR is trading at $6.97 at time of writing.

Each day starts with new shifts in the bull market. The current session witnesses the BTC price reclaiming its previous price of $96,000. Ripple, which had been struggling for most of the year, has gained strength with the XRP token surging amid the spot XRP ETF buzz. These changes have been quite notable in the crypto space. Yet, DTX Exchange grabs the limelight with its massive ROI. Experts reveal that the DTX token is poised to give a 1021% rally in this session benefitting the investors. BTC Price Revisits $96k On Fed Rate Cut Expectations On Wednesday, US economic indicators fueled bets on a December Fed rate cut. The Core PCE Price Index rose 0.3% month-on-month in October, mirroring September’s increase. However, year-on-year, the Core PCE Price Index increased to 2.8% in October, up from 2.7% in September. The October figures suggested a sticky inflation environment. Nevertheless, the chances of a Fed rate cut increased on Wednesday, boosting demand for US BTC-spot ETFs and BTC price surge. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a Fed rate cut rose from 59.4% on November 26 to 64.8% on November 27. On Wednesday, BTC price gained 4.32%, reversing a 1% loss from Tuesday, closing at $95,883. BTC price trends hinge on Trump’s nominations and BTC-spot ETF market flows. Pro-crypto nominations for the SEC and CFTC Chairs bolster expectations of BTC becoming a strategic reserve asset, potentially boosting BTC price and demand. XRP-Spot ETF Applications Signal Seismic Demand Shift For Ripple An XRP-spot ETF market could materially boost Ripple’s demand, potentially driving it toward the January 2018 all-time high of $3.5505. The US BTC-spot ETF market offers a precedent, with BTC surging by 113%, advancing from $46,742 (January 11, 2024) to an all-time high of $99,318 (November 22, 2024). Speculation about President-elect Donald Trump potentially appointing a pro-crypto SEC Chair has fueled expectations for an XRP-spot ETF market. Since SEC Chair Gensler’s resignation announcement, investors are also betting on the SEC withdrawing its appeal against rulings in the Ripple case. If the SEC withdraws its appeal, the Programmatic sales of the Ripple ruling would set a crucial legal precedent. This could pave the way to an XRP-spot ETF market. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP did not satisfy the third prong of the Howey Test. On Wednesday, November 27, XRP rallied 5.17% to close at $1.4711, reversing Tuesday’s 1.17% loss. Significantly, Ripple ended a four-day losing streak while tracking the broader crypto market, which gained 4.89%. An SEC Chair favoring the end to ongoing legal battles with crypt firms could drive XRP toward $2. However, Ripple must move through the November 23, 2024, high of $1.6299 to target the May 2021 high of $1.8171 and $2. DTX Exchange (DTX): Trading Revolution Raises $8.8 Million DTX Exchange (DTX) is the latest project with the potential to redefine the global trading industry by combining the best centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges into one place. DTX enables access to over 120,000 asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities, all on a unified layer for a wallet system built on the Layer-1 blockchain. This is an innovative approach that fuses TradFi and DeFi, making DTX Exchange stand out. Based on Ethereum and Solana protocols, the DTX token is currently priced at $0.10 during its fifth round, having sold nearly 80% of the tokens available. Once they’ve been sold out, the price will increase to $0.12, marking a 20% for early investors. Having already raised $8,850,000 in presale, DTX Exchange is one of the most hyped investments today. Key Takeaways The BTC price recovers its lost momentum and crosses the $96,000 level once more. On the flip side, Ripple surges in tandem with XRP-spot ETF. However, after a 1021% surge, DTX Exchange is still unstoppable in this bull run. The platform raises over $8.85 million!

Whale Moves Signal Big Rally Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-10-within-reach-for-cardano-whale-moves-signal-big-rally-ahead/,"Cardano (ADA) has achieved a significant milestone by breaking past the $1 barrier , a level that appeared unattainable for the majority of 2023. The cryptocurrency’s recent price surge has captivated the attention of both analysts and investors, as it has been unable to overcome this psychological level for years. Although the token has recently experienced some price consolidation, analysts anticipate that this is merely the commencement of a much more substantial rally. Cardano: Consolidation Phase ADA’s momentum weakened after it crossed the $1 threshold, and it has been hovering just below this mark. Cardano has entered a phase of consolidation around the $0.99 to $1.00 range, contrary to the expectations of many investors who anticipated that the rally would persist. While this may appear to be a temporary setback, analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He perceives this consolidation as a positive indicator of redistribution, a prerequisite for the ADA to continue its upward trajectory. For years through the bear market, many didn’t think $ADA would ever hit $1 again. Many holders have been waiting to sell at $1. Now that we’ve reached $1, it’s great to see a consolidation and redistribution. After this phase is over, Cardano can focus on $5 and $10. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) November 27, 2024 Gambardello anticipates that Cardano may pursue significantly higher price points after this segment concludes, potentially achieving a range of $5 to $10. Increase In Whale Activities The increase in whale activity during Cardano’s latest performance is among the most fascinating features. ADA whales have been rapidly rising their numbers over the last few weeks, particularly following the token’s $1 breakthrough. According to reports, over 130 million ADA tokens are owned by millionaires, and that exceeds over 3.2 billion. Such accumulation is taken as a strong vote for the token, which would keep the price going high. Despite profit-taking, the ADA adoption has kept its positive optimism. Whale Appetite Up As Bitcoin approaches $100,000, there is a transition in focus to other cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano. The market capitalization of ADA has increased by more than 30% in the past week, reaching an impressive $35 billion. Because of the rise in whale activity and the possibility of a good regulatory environment, investors are very optimistic about Cardano’s future. The level of excitement has also been raised by rumors about Cardano’s founder and possible partnerships with incoming US President Donald Trump. Although these factors are still considered speculative, they contribute to the increasing conviction that Cardano may achieve new price milestones in the near future. Cardano’s most recent performance has demonstrated that it is once again competitive. ADA may soon achieve new heights due to the expanding market sentiment and robust whale support. The $5 to $10 price range may appear to be an ambitious goal; however, it is now feasible with the appropriate catalysts.

The amount of money tied up in criticized loans, which show emerging signs of risk and weakness that could lead to defaults, just reached its highest level since 2020, reports S&P Global. JPMorgan Chase has witnessed the largest year-over-year increase, with the number of criticized loans at the firm jumping 26.3%, reaching $26.01 billion at the end of Q3. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has recorded a 17.9% year-on-year increase in criticized loans, at $37.6 billion, while Bank of America recorded a 15.2% year-on-year increase, at $26.06 billion. That brings the total amount of the criticized loans at the trio of banks to $89.67 billion since Q3 of 2023, reflecting a trend that’s playing out at banks across the board. “Criticized loans at public US banks amounted to $279.98 billion, versus $240.37 billion at the end of 2023, and such loans at the 100 largest US public banks totaled $260.48 billion, versus $219.82 billion at 2023-end.” Among tier-one banks with over $50 billion in total assets, four lenders recorded triple-digit increases in criticized loans. Flagstar Financial recorded a 338.6% year-on-year increase in criticized loans while First Horizon, Valley National Bancorp and Webster Financial Corp witnessed 112.2%, 110.1% and 102.8% year-on-year increases in criticized loans.

Institutional adoption is skyrocketing, with big names like BlackRock and Fidelity stepping into the game by launching Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs have already amassed a staggering $52 billion in assets under management as of 2024, and recent U.S. election results saw a jaw-dropping $2.6 billion inflow in just a few days. It’s now seemingly obvious that Bitcoin isn’t just some fringe asset—it’s the future of investment. With all the interest in Bitcoin blowing up, there has been a bigger demand for reliable tools to manage cryptocurrency. The best bitcoin wallet for iOS users is designed to meet this need. The interface is easy and very intuitive, plus it has loads of handy features. This is why the app makes buying and selling Bitcoin a breeze. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, these apps provide all the functionality you need to handle your crypto with confidence. But it’s not just Wall Street that’s taking Bitcoin seriously. State governments are getting in on the action too. Colorado and Louisiana now accept Bitcoin for tax payments , and Ohio is considering similar legislation. Meanwhile, state pension funds are diving in, with Wisconsin’s investment board holding a hefty $99 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Even Florida’s Chief Financial Officer has proposed adding Bitcoin to the state’s pension portfolio. For individual investors, staying ahead in this rapidly evolving landscape requires the right tools. That’s where the crypto wallet apps truly stands out. Non-custodial wallets allow you to have full control of your assets. No one can freeze your funds or block transactions. Plus, its multi-chain support makes swapping cryptocurrencies across different blockchains lightning-fast and stress-free. This is why you’ve probably seen a lot more wallet app developers designing their apps to make crypto management straightforward and accessible, even for those new to the space. More people use Bitcoin, its not just about institutions investing in Bitcoin. Everyday users are getting more involved, driven by the convenience of modern apps . The app is really simple but it doesn’t skimp on power. With it, you’ll get everything from secure storage to seamless transactions, plus a whole lot more. Why does this matter? Well, as more people adopt Bitcoin, having a wallet that’s both reliable and versatile is becoming a necessity. The momentum behind Bitcoin is undeniable. With record-breaking ETF inflows and increasing support from state governments, it’s cementing its place as a major financial asset. This shift is creating a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, pushing demand for tools like Best Wallet that make it easy for anyone to participate. As Bitcoin’s role in finance grows, being prepared with the right tools will be the key to navigating this exciting new era.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s jaw-dropping success, they’ve flipped the script on traditional crypto investing. And now, a new star is stealing the show: BTFD Coin . With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming platform, staking rewards, and an ever-growing community, this coin is poised to redefine what meme coins are all about. Launched on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin didn’t just tiptoe into the meme coin space—it kicked the door wide open. Within the first 24 hours of its presale, it had completed nearly 25% of its journey through 16 presale stages, raising a whopping $150,000. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential, with its presale price of $0.00005 expected to hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. Could this be the best meme coin to invest in today? Let’s dive deeper and find out. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Raising the Bar BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme coin. Sure, it’s got the humour and community-driven vibes you’d expect, but it’s packing some serious utility under the hood. Think P2E gaming, staking rewards, and even a roadmap designed to make early investors a fortune. Since its presale launched at $0.000004 per coin , the momentum has been unstoppable. Fast forward to Stage 5, and the price now stands at $0.00005 per coin, with over 10 billion coins sold. Investors are piling in, eager to snag what could be the best meme coin to invest in today . In just a few days, the presale has raised over $295,000, proving that the hype isn’t just noise—it’s real. Let’s talk numbers. Imagine you invested $4,000 in Stage 5 at $0.00005 per coin. That would bag you 80 million BTFD Coins. Now, when the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would be worth a cool $48,000. That’s the kind of ROI dreams are made of. What sets BTFD apart is its vision for the future. While most meme coins ride on fleeting trends, BTFD is building an ecosystem that thrives on utility. With its P2E game just around the corner and staking rewards offering passive income, it’s not hard to see why investors are flocking to it. And let’s not forget the FOMO factor. With only 16 presale stages, the clock’s ticking to get in early. Apu Apustaja: The Underdog Meme Coin You Need to Know About Move over, Dogecoin—Apu Apustaja is here to claim its throne. Inspired by the iconic internet meme, Apu Apustaja taps into nostalgia while carving out its niche in the crypto world. But can it compete with heavyweights like BTFD Coin? Apu’s charm lies in its community. Built on a decentralised ethos, it’s all about inclusivity and grassroots growth. But what’s its edge? For starters, it’s rolling out an NFT marketplace where users can trade Apu-themed digital assets. It’s a bold move, but will it be enough to make Apu Apustaja the best meme coin to invest in today ? The coin’s price action has been volatile, to say the least. After launching at $0.000002, it saw a brief surge to $0.000009 before retracing to $0.000005. Some call it a buying opportunity, others a red flag. Regardless, Apu’s roadmap is ambitious. It plans to integrate with DeFi platforms and even launch a play-to-earn game by Q2 2025. Here’s the kicker: Apu Apustaja is all about the underdog narrative. It thrives on community support, making it a wildcard in the meme coin race. While it doesn’t have the immediate ROI appeal of BTFD Coin, it’s got a loyal following that could propel it to new heights. If you’re willing to take a risk, Apu might just surprise you. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Meme Coin with a Twist If the name doesn’t grab you, the concept will. Cat in a Dog’s World is a satirical take on the meme coin craze, flipping the script with its feline-first narrative. But don’t let the humour fool you; this coin means business. Launching at $0.000003, Cat in a Dog’s World has already seen a 40% increase in its market cap within its first week. Its appeal lies in its simplicity. No overcomplicated utility, no grandiose promises—just a meme coin that’s unashamedly fun. And sometimes, that’s all it takes. What’s unique about Cat in a Dog’s World is its “Clawback Program.” A portion of every transaction is redistributed to holders, creating a passive income stream. It’s a clever way to keep investors engaged while incentivising long-term holding. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, with price predictions targeting $0.00002 by mid-2025. But let’s be real—can Cat in a Dog’s World compete with the likes of BTFD Coin? Probably not. While it’s a fun addition to any crypto portfolio, it lacks the robust ecosystem and ROI potential that make BTFD the best meme coin to invest in today . Still, for those looking to diversify, it’s a quirky option that’s worth considering. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that meme coins are far from being a passing fad. They’re evolving, innovating, and offering investors opportunities that traditional cryptocurrencies simply can’t match. Among the contenders, BTFD Coin stands out as the frontrunner. Its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support make it the best meme coin to invest in today. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a first-time investor, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss. Ready to join the meme coin revolution? Don’t wait too long—the BTFD presale is heating up, and the best deals won’t last forever. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your stake in the next big thing in crypto.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 01:20:00

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and for good reason. Robert Kiyosaki’s bold $500,000 Bitcoin prediction for 2025 has reignited investor confidence, while Fantom has surged past the $1 mark, positioning itself as a DeFi powerhouse. As these projects steal the spotlight, a rising star, Qubetics ($TICS), is quietly but confidently changing the game with its innovative solutions and impressive presale performance. For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, these are the best cryptos to watch in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Qubetics is solving real-world problems with its revolutionary Web3 aggregator and user-friendly QubeQode IDE. Unlike its predecessors, which often alienated users with complexity, Qubetics is breaking barriers, making blockchain accessible to all. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader, the $TICS token offers a promising opportunity that blends innovation, usability, and potentially life-changing returns. Let’s dive deeper into what makes Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Fantom the best cryptos to watch right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Web3 with a User-Friendly Twist If you’ve been searching for a cryptocurrency project that combines cutting-edge technology with practical usability, Qubetics is your answer. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is setting new standards in the blockchain space. Its flagship feature, the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is a game-changer, designed to simplify Web3 development. Think of it as the Google Docs of blockchain—a platform so intuitive that even a novice can build and deploy smart contracts without a hitch. Imagine this: a small business owner wants to integrate blockchain for supply chain tracking but lacks the technical know-how. With QubeQode IDE, they can create a smart contract with just a few clicks, ensuring transparency and efficiency without hiring an expensive developer. This ease of use is why Qubetics is attracting thousands of token holders, with over 4,800 investors already onboard. The presale’s numbers speak for themselves. Now in its tenth stage, Qubetics has sold over 239 million tokens, raising a jaw-dropping $3.6 million. At just $0.025 per token, early adopters are seizing the opportunity before the price surges by 10% this weekend. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, projections skyrocket, with $TICS potentially reaching $5 for a staggering 19,337% ROI. A mere $1 investment today could grow into $58,213 after Qubetics’ mainnet launch. Bitcoin (BTC): Can Kiyosaki’s $500K Prediction Come True? Bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrencies, and its reign shows no signs of slowing down. Robert Kiyosaki’s recent forecast of Bitcoin hitting $500,000 by 2025 has turned heads across the financial world. According to Kiyosaki, institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and increasing demand are all aligning to create the perfect storm for Bitcoin’s next massive bull run. With Bitcoin’s recent surge nearing $100,000, it’s not hard to imagine this prediction coming true. But what does it mean for everyday investors? Let’s consider Kiyosaki’s prediction in numbers. If you invest $1 in Bitcoin today and it climbs to $500,000, your dollar could grow exponentially, especially if purchased during a dip. Of course, Bitcoin’s price movements can be wild, but for long-term believers, the upside is hard to ignore. Bitcoin’s story isn’t just about price—it’s about resilience and adoption. Major corporations like Tesla and Square are embracing Bitcoin, while countries like El Salvador are building their economies around it. For those eyeing the best cryptos to watch, Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader. And with experts like Chamath Palihapitiya and Mike Novogratz echoing Kiyosaki’s optimism, the future looks brighter than ever. Fantom (FTM): DeFi’s Rising Star While Bitcoin grabs the headlines and Qubetics dazzles with innovation, Fantom quietly proves its worth in the world of decentralised finance (DeFi). Fantom’s recent surge past $1 is a testament to its growing utility and investor confidence. Unlike the speculative rallies of 2021, this price movement is underpinned by real-world applications and a robust ecosystem. Fantom’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at an impressive $131.01 million, a clear indicator of its active DeFi participation. Its ecosystem thrives on stability, thanks to its $320.62 million stablecoin market cap. These numbers highlight a maturing blockchain that prioritises security and efficiency—qualities that DeFi enthusiasts value deeply. Price predictions for Fantom are equally promising. Analysts suggest that if the current momentum continues, FTM could easily break new resistance levels, offering substantial returns for investors. For those looking at the best cryptos to watch, Fantom is more than just a contender—it’s a DeFi powerhouse ready to redefine the space. Seize the Moment with the Best Cryptos to Watch The cryptocurrency market is teeming with opportunities, but the clock is ticking. Each project offers unique advantages, catering to a diverse range of investors and traders. Qubetics stands out with its presale success and groundbreaking tools like QubeQode IDE, making blockchain more accessible than ever. Bitcoin’s journey to $500,000 might sound ambitious, but with growing institutional interest, it’s a target worth betting on. Meanwhile, Fantom’s rise past $1 signals the dawn of a new era for DeFi enthusiasts. Qubetics’ presale won’t last forever, and Bitcoin and Fantom are only getting stronger. The best cryptos to watch today could shape your financial future tomorrow.

After a strong bullish run in recent weeks, the recent pullback appears to be a temporary pause in an upward trend. Crucial on-chain data supports this outlook, indicating robust network activity that reinforces the bullish sentiment for ADA. Key metrics shared by IntoTheBlock reveal over 840,000 transactions recorded on the Cardano network, with total fees amounting to 279,000 ADA. This data underscores growing usage and demand for the Cardano blockchain, adding to its fundamental strength. Such network activity often correlates with price appreciation, suggesting that ADA could soon maintain its momentum. As ADA consolidates above $1 , the market will closely monitor whether it can hold this key level and push higher. Investors and analysts are optimistic, citing the network’s increasing adoption and solid transaction metrics as critical factors driving its bullish outlook. The next few weeks could be pivotal for Cardano, with a sustained move above $1 likely signaling the continuation of its upward trend. Cardano Activity Growing Cardano is trading at multi-year highs and looks poised to continue its impressive rally. After breaking through the critical $1 level at the start of this bull run, ADA has shown strong momentum, driven by increasing adoption and investor confidence. On-chain data shared by IntoTheBlock analyst C Thumbs highlights significant milestones, signaling sustained growth in the Cardano ecosystem. The latest data reveals that Cardano recently surpassed 840,000 transactions, with total fees reaching 279,000 ADA. Notably, the last time transaction volumes and fees were this high was in March 2022. This resurgence reflects the growing utility of the Cardano blockchain, transitioning from being primarily speculative to demonstrating real-world value. A closer look at holder trends further underscores this shift. From July 2022 until today, ADA has seen sustained growth in the number of holders, indicating increasing confidence in the blockchain’s long-term potential. Unlike previous cycles, where ADA’s price movements were driven primarily by speculation, the current rally appears underpinned by tangible network activity and adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Above $90K – On-Chain Data Reveals Key Demand Levels As Cardano continues to gain traction, investors are focusing on the next significant supply level. With robust network activity and bullish sentiment prevailing, ADA appears ready to target new highs, reinforcing its status as a leading blockchain in the crypto space. ADA Testing Crucial Supply Cardano has experienced a remarkable 250% rally in less than a month, showcasing strong bullish momentum as it gains traction in the market. Currently trading at $1.06, ADA is approaching its yearly high of $1.15, a crucial resistance level that could define its next price trajectory. If ADA successfully breaks above the $1.15 level, it could open the door to a significant rally targeting the next supply zones at $1.25 and potentially $1.60. Such a breakout would signal renewed investor confidence and sustained demand, further solidifying Cardano’s position as one of the most dynamic assets in the crypto space during this cycle. However, there is a risk of further consolidation below the $1.15 mark. If ADA fails to hold momentum at this critical level, the price may pull back to test support at $1.00 or lower. Such a scenario could indicate a temporary pause in the uptrend, allowing investors and traders to reassess the market conditions. As Cardano trades near these pivotal levels, market participants will closely monitor its price action to determine whether the rally can extend or if consolidation will define the short-term outlook for this rapidly rising altcoin.

In a recent post, he stated that FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) could benefit investors as Bitcoin price approaches the $100,000 mark. Kiyosaki, a strong advocate for alternative assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, warned that holders of traditional fiat currencies risk missing out. He believes that as BTC nears the $100,000 milestone, only the ultra-wealthy will be able to afford significant holdings. Robert Kiyosaki Warns: FOMO is Key as Bitcoin Nears $100K In a recent tweet , Robert Kiyosaki highlighted his view that Bitcoin will soon surpass the $100,000 mark. He emphasized that once BTC hits this price point, it will become increasingly difficult for the middle class to invest in significant amounts. Kiyosaki argued that those holding traditional fiat currencies like the dollar, euro, or yen will lose out as Bitcoin becomes more accessible only to the ultra-wealthy. Robert Kiyosaki has long been a critic of fiat currencies and advocates for alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He has been consistent in his stance that Bitcoin offers an opportunity to protect wealth in a way that traditional currencies cannot. With Bitcoin price approaching new highs, Kiyosaki has advised those hesitant about Bitcoin to reconsider and embrace the “FOMO” mentality. He suggested that this fear of missing out could drive more investors toward the crypto, benefiting those who act early. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author emphasized, “The horse will be out of the barn and running. Why? Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000 only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind!” Kiyosaki Criticizes Fiat Savings According to Robert Kiyosaki, those who save in cash or hold fiat currencies are “losers,” as he calls them, due to the devaluation brought on by inflation. He reiterated this message in his recent posts, where he underscored the importance of diversifying into assets like Bitcoin. His argument rests on the view that inflation and government monetary policies will continue to erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies. As the Bitcoin price continues to rise, he forecasts that it will soon reach $100,000 and beyond. He pointed out that once this milestone is achieved, it will be almost impossible for most people to catch up. Kiyosaki added, “Savers are losers…because cash is trash. Bitcoin will soon break $100,000. Once Bitcoin passes $100,000 it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up.” In addition to his commentary on the Bitcoin price, Robert Kiyosaki praised Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, for his Bitcoin strategy. Kiyosaki referred to Saylor as a “genius” for utilizing the company’s treasury to purchase billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. He believes that Saylor’s approach strengthened MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $96,400, following a recent rebound from a low of $91,000 earlier in the week. The cryptocurrency has shown strong resilience, with analysts predicting a BTC rally toward $100,000 soon.

Currently, the XRP chart highlights distinct patterns in market behaviour, suggesting that historical price action may be repeating itself. The analyst predicts that if the cryptocurrency can successfully replicate these bullish historical patterns, it could trigger an upward surge for XRP. XRP Price Patterns Signal Bullish Potential Richard, the crypto analyst on TradingView, popularly known as ‘The Signalyst,’ has declared that history is repeating itself in the XRP price chart. The analyst shared a detailed analytical report on XRP, predicting its future target while examining critical aspects of its current price action. According to Richard, the XRP 4-hour chart reveals an intriguing pattern characterised by lower lows and a sharp bullish impulse. The two red arrows labeled “LL” on the price chart indicate areas where the XRP price made lower lows mid-November, signaling a correction or a trend reversal. This downward trend was quickly followed by a period of consolidation within a defined range seen in the green zone on the chart. After experiencing lower lows and bearish momentum , Richard pinpointed that the XRP price entered a corrective phase, stabilizing within the aforementioned green zone. Eventually, XRP broke above this green resistance range, triggering a bullish impulse that pushed the cryptocurrency to its previous price high of $1.5. Although the XRP price has corrected again and was trading at around $1.4 earlier this week, Richard has highlighted that the cryptocurrency seems to be repeating the above historical set-up. Its price has entered a new consolidation phase just below the $1.53 level, signaling the start of its next bullish movement . Should the XRP price repeat this pattern and break above the $1.53 threshold, the analyst suggests that this would validate XRP’s anticipated bullish impulse position and pave the way for a potential rally toward the $2 psychological level. Analyst Labels XRP At $1.4 A Bargain Buy Steph, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has called the XRP price a bargain buy at $1.4. Following its surge above $1.5 earlier this month, the XRP price witnessed a slight trend reversal, pushing it down to $1.4. Steph disclosed that the $1.4 XRP price was a prime buying opportunity for investors, as a breakout to the upside was about to begin. Concerning the predicted breakout, it seems the analyst was spot on, as the XRP price is currently trading at $1.6 , marking an 8.7% increase in the last 24 hours. While XRP continues to gain momentum , Steph predicts that the cryptocurrency could soon see an explosive increase to $50. With this bullish scenario in mind, Richard has urged investors to start buying XRP before further adoption drives its price into “the very expensive range,” between $22 and $120.",XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 03:00:27

Solana, with its much-discussed ETF potential, has captured institutional and retail attention alike, while Cronos’s projected price increase to $0.22 signals steady growth. However, stealing the spotlight is Qubetics ($TICS), the new Web3 aggregator in town, setting itself apart with innovative tools like the QubeQode IDE. Unlike many predecessors, Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s solving real-world problems. At its heart, QubeQode IDE introduces a groundbreaking Code Snippet Library that simplifies development for Web3 builders, bringing a tech-forward approach to token value. Combine this with analysts’ predictions of up to 58,213% ROI, and $TICS could very well be the crown jewel of promising cryptos this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Web3 with Innovation As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is simplifying blockchain development with its intuitive QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Developers often hit roadblocks when coding decentralised apps (dApps), but QubeQode changes the game with its Code Snippet Library—a treasure trove of pre-written code blocks. Imagine an entrepreneur building a crowdfunding platform on blockchain. Instead of scripting smart contracts from scratch, they can simply select and customise relevant snippets from QubeQode . This innovation cuts development time and costs while reducing errors—giving creators confidence and investors peace of mind. It’s no surprise that $TICS has captured the market’s imagination. The presale, currently in its tenth stage, has already raised over $3.6 million, with 239 million tokens sold and 4,800 holders joining the movement. At $0.025 per token, investors are scrambling to grab $TICS before this weekend’s expected 10% surge pushes the price higher. For those sceptical about early-stage investments, consider this: analysts predict $TICS could reach $15 post-mainnet launch. If an entrepreneur invests $10 now, they’d receive 400 tokens. Solana (SOL): The ETF That Could Reshape Crypto Solana continues to make waves as institutional interest mounts in its potential ETF. With applications filed by firms like VanEck and Bitwise, a decision from the SEC is expected by August 2025. Optimism is high, especially with the impending resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, which analysts believe could create a more crypto-friendly environment. Globally, Solana ETFs have already been approved in Brazil and Canada, creating indirect pressure on the U.S. to follow suit. Approval could be a game-changer, not just for Solana but for the entire crypto ecosystem. As Matthew Sigel from VanEck suggests, a Solana ETF would bring legitimacy and open doors to institutional capital, further solidifying Solana’s position as a leading blockchain network. On the price front, SOL’s recent performance is nothing short of spectacular. The token hit an all-time high of $264.31, up 18% this week and 160% in 2024. For investors, this means SOL remains one of the most promising cryptos this weekend. With the possibility of ETF approval and continuous ecosystem expansion, Solana’s bullish trajectory seems poised to continue. Cronos (CRO): Quietly Building Momentum While Solana grabs headlines, Cronos is making steady progress. Trading at $0.176018 as of today, the token has underperformed against BTC and ETH in the short term, but analysts project a 26.11% price increase by December 3, 2024, bringing it to $0.222803. Cronos has shown resilience, gaining 130.94% over the last month and nearly doubling its value year-over-year. These metrics make it a solid pick for investors looking for less volatility compared to meme coins. Moreover, its role in the Crypto.com ecosystem ensures consistent demand, further stabilising its growth. Looking at the big picture, Cronos’s all-time high of $0.959822 in November 2021 suggests room for growth, especially as the Fear & Greed Index signals “Extreme Greed” among investors. While it may not promise the explosive gains of $TICS, Cronos’s reliability makes it another standout in the list of promising cryptos this weekend. Which Crypto Should You Bet On? When it comes to promising cryptos this weekend, Qubetics ($TICS) takes the crown. Its utility-driven ecosystem, groundbreaking QubeQode IDE, and jaw-dropping ROI projections make it an irresistible choice for risk-tolerant investors. Solana and Cronos also offer compelling narratives, with SOL riding the ETF wave and CRO delivering steady growth. But let’s not ignore the ticking clock. With $TICS priced at just $0.025 and a 10% surge expected this weekend, there’s no time to wait. Imagine snagging 1,000 tokens now and watching them turn into $15,000 post-mainnet launch . Opportunities like this don’t come often, so why not take the leap?

The company behind XRP, Ripple, is finally going to launch its stable coin RLUSD. It is awaiting approval from the NYDFS which is expected on December 4. Let’s dive deeper and find why this stablecoin means a lot for the company and for the crypto ecosystem. Ripple Stablecoin : A Game Changer Ripple’s got a plan with RLUSD, and it’s not just any stablecoin. Think of it as their answer to all the legal chaos around XRP. Stablecoins are like the calm in a crypto storm—way more predictable than XRP’s rollercoaster price moves. Ripple’s acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company earlier this year paved the way for RLUSD, aligning Ripple with stringent NYDFS standards. Ripple is now taking on established stablecoin giants like Circle’s USDC and Paxos’ USDP. Partnerships with platforms like MoonPay and Uphold will make RLUSD accessible to a global audience. The goal? Integrate RLUSD into global remittance networks, making cross-border payments cheaper and faster than ever. XRP Price Surge The XRP token has been moving in a confined zone between $0.39 and $0.75 since March 2023. It took a breakout as the crypto market started pumping with the US election. Optimism around Ripple’s regulatory clarity and the potential of its stable coin seems to be the driving force behind this momentum. The company’s blockchain-based RippleNet system already challenges traditional systems like SWIFT. With RLUSD in the play, the company could capture a larger share of the cross-border payment market. New regulatory shifts like MiCA in Europe and the Trump administration in the US gives more strength to Ripple’s position. What’s Next? With NYDFS approval likely days away, RLUSD could launch as early as December 4, adding a fresh layer of stability to Ripple’s offerings. As the stablecoin market grows and global regulations become clearer, Ripple seems poised to not just survive but thrive. Could this finally be the breakthrough Ripple’s been hoping for? Maybe—only time will tell. Why is XRP going up? Optimism around regulatory clarity and Ripple’s stablecoin news is fueling the price surge. How high can XRP go? While predictions vary, some experts believe XRP could cross $2 by year end. What is stablecoin? A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, reducing volatility. Is XRP a good investment? XRP has huge potential, but market volatility and regulatory factors should be considered.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 03:34:20

Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 03:40:21

Legendary Trader Forecasts Next Price Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/how-high-can-dogecoin-go-legendary-trader/,"Dogecoin is one of the standout performers in the crypto market in the last weeks. Over the past 34 days, DOGE has rallied by 210%, climbing from $0.13 to above $0.41. The rally was fueled by excitement surrounding the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Dogecoin advocate Elon Musk under the forthcoming US President Donald Trump. However, the rally has plateaued, with DOGE experiencing a sideways movement over the last 16 days. Despite this, the daily DOGE/USD chart continues to exhibit a highly bullish outlook. Legendary trader Peter Brandt, in collaboration with the observations of a crypto analyst known by the handle @Kultigin83, has highlighted a “running continuation flag” on the DOGE/USD chart, forecasting a potential price target of $0.66. Is This The Next Dogecoin Price Target? @Kultigin83 commented on X, stating: “Mr. Peter helps us, and I want to help him (a small piece of advice from a student); this pattern is known as an upsloping flag.” In response, Peter Brandt replied , “Yes, if completed, this would indeed be considered a running continuation flag.” The running continuation flag is a classic chart pattern recognized for its bullish implications. It generally appears during a strong uptrend when the price briefly consolidates or moves slightly downward within a parallel or slightly expanding channel. This pattern is crucial because it suggests that despite the temporary pause, the predominant bullish momentum is still very much intact. In the case of Dogecoin, the pattern observed follows a significant upward movement where the price notably increased from a level below $0.19 to above $0.39 following the breakout of a head and shoulders pattern, creating the “pole” of the flag. This pole is a crucial component as it represents the initial surge before the consolidation phase. Following this surge, the DOGE price action started to consolidate, moving within the boundaries of $0.340 to $0.48, forming the body of the flag. The method to derive the price target from a flag pattern involves measuring the length of the pole — in this instance, approximately $0.20 (from around $0.19 to $0.39). This measurement is then applied to the potential breakout point, which for DOGE appears to be forming around the $0.50 mark. By adding the height of the pole to the breakout price, the forecast target is set at $0.70. The analysis provided by @Kultigin83 sets a slightly more conservative target at $0.66. If Dogecoin can maintain its momentum and break out from the upper boundary of its running continuation flag, the target of at least $0.66 seems the next logical price target. This technical pattern, endorsed by Peter Brandt’s expertise, provides a bullish outlook for DOGE, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is not yet done with its upward climb. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.",Dogecoin|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin price analysis|dogecoin technical analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 04:30:42

Here’s What Robert Kiyosaki Believes",https://coinpedia.org/news/can-bitcoin-cross-100000-heres-what-robert-kiyosaki-believes/,"The post Can Bitcoin Cross $100,000? Here’s What Robert Kiyosaki Believes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin crossing $100,000? It sounds wild, but that’s exactly what Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is saying. He believes Bitcoin’s price is about to shoot up, and once it does, it could be too expensive for the average person to get in on. But is this for real? Let’s dive into what Kiyosaki is predicting and what’s actually going on with the first crypto right now. Kiyosaki Thinks FOMO Will Drive Bitcoin’s Surge Kiyosaki thinks the next big wave of Bitcoin buying will come from a simple feeling: FOMO—Fear of Missing Out. He says as BTC moves closer to $100,000, more people are going to jump in before they miss their chance. But here’s the catch: once the largest crypto hits that $100K mark, it might be hard for regular investors to afford much of it. That’s because only the super-rich will be able to grab big chunks. THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad “Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Kiyosaki also doesn’t trust traditional currencies like the dollar or euro. He argues that inflation is slowly killing their value. For him, BTC is the way to go—protecting your wealth in a world where cash just isn’t cutting it anymore. Bitcoin Could Hit $100K Sooner Than We Think Right now, Bitcoin’s trading at about $96,662. It’s not far from that $100K mark, and some experts think it could hit it soon. The charts show a possible double bottom pattern, which could mean a price jump to $106,000 by Christmas. Trading volume is up 8.73%, so there’s definitely some action happening. It’s looking like BTC is on the move. With countries like Switzerland working towards regulating Bitcoin mining, the growth is unstoppable. Kiyosaki is also big on Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, who’s been buying huge amounts of Bitcoin. Kiyosaki calls him a “genius” for making his company’s balance sheet stronger by stacking up Bitcoin. So, What’s Next for Bitcoin? Will Bitcoin hit $100,000? It’s hard to say for sure, but all signs point to a big jump. Kiyosaki’s prediction is more than just about the price; it’s about Bitcoin changing the way we think about money. Will it really protect wealth like he says, or will it fall short? We’ll see soon enough, but it looks like we’re in for an interesting few months.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 04:41:25

In his detailed post “ How Libra Was Killed “, Marcus provides a complete overview of the political slugfest. He also details how US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen prevented Fed Chair Jerome Powell from giving it the go-ahead. Facebook Libra Was Killed Politically, Says David Marcus David Marcus, who led Facebook’s Libra project, later renamed Diem, shared how the political forces choked the project into non-existence despite creating regulatory hurdles. Libra, designed as a high-performance blockchain paired with a stablecoin, aimed to revolutionize global payments. Marcus said that he and his team at Meta envisioned a system capable of addressing financial crime, money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, and more. The project, announced in June 2019 with 28 partners, faced intense regulatory scrutiny from the outset. Just two following the launch of Libra, the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee called Marcus to testify. This led to his team conducting some exhaustive revisions for nearly two to address lawmakers’ concerns, before finally giving up on the project. Marcus said that by 2021, the Facebook Libra project met every regulatory requirement needed for a limited launch, and even supported by some Federal Reserve governors. However, he adds that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen instructed the Fed Chair that allowing Libra would be a “political suicide”. Soon thereafter, Powell instructed all regulated banks to stop supporting the project, ultimately leading to its demise. David Marcus wrote: “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100% a political kill—one that was executed through intimidation of captive banking institutions. That was the hardest part of this story for me personally. Not that we had failed, but that America, this country I immigrated to and became a proud citizen of because of its rule of law and value system, behaved in such a way for political reasons. It was a very tough pill to swallow”. Crypto Industry Leaders Back David Marcus’s Claims Crypto industry leaders including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , Gemini exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevos s, and Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long have all come out in support of David Marcus stressing that the Fed’s behavior was part of Operation Choke Point 2.0 , which involved forcing regulated banks to cut ties with crypto firms. Responding to Marcus’s post on X platform, Cameron Winklevoss wrote: “Can confirm. Gemini worked closely with David and his team at Meta to help launch Libra (fka Diem). We were on the one-yard line when Federal regulators murdered this project. It was all politics, no basis in law”. Caitlin Long , the CEO of Custodia Bank also affirmed stating: “David Marcus, that sounds familiar! Someday, like you just did, I’ll be able to tell the real story of what the Fed did to Custodia Bank, and how the Fed lied to achieve Biden/Warren political aims. There is so much corruption & I’m glad it’s pouring out in public now”. XRP Lawyer John Deaton recently demanded a detailed investigation into Operation Choke Point 2.0. He proposed that the incoming administration appoint an independent counsel to lead the investigation, recommending Nic Carter as a strong candidate for the investigative team Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Shares A Tip Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also said that the government, including Secretary Janet Yellen, pressured the banks from working with crypto firms and on the Facebook Libra project. Armstrong pointed to past events, including the launch of Meta’s Llama project, to emphasize the importance of releasing new technologies without seeking approval from regulators. Drawing parallels to the development of Bitcoin, Armstrong argued that decentralized technologies should be available as open-source software to avoid regulatory pushback. “Once these tools are out in the wild, they can’t be rolled back,” he stated. The Coinbase CEO asserted that this approach is critical for fostering innovation, with the Bitcoin network serving as a prime example of a successful, permissionless project. Armstrong also reiterated his belief that “code is speech,” highlighting the protection of software development under the First Amendment. Makes sense – the government pressured the banks (again). I think the lesson from Libra is that these tools should be released as open source software, and to not ask for permission. Once they are out in the wild they can't be rolled back. This is why Bitcoin worked, and it's… https://t.co/2Embd9jlNj — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 30, 2024 The Facebook Libra project is likely to open the door to disclosure from other crypto firms that suffered due to Operation Choke Point 2.0. With Donald Trump planning to have a ‘ crypto czar ‘ position at the White House, things could change for the betterment of the crypto industry. It will be interesting to see whether the Diem stablecoin project from Facebook will revive again.

BCB may prohibit centralized exchanges from permitting stablecoin withdrawals into self-custody wallets. This restriction targets “tokens denominated in foreign currencies” to ensure compliance with Brazilian financial regulations. The BCB gains crypto oversight under the 2022 law and sets new regulations BCB commented on the development; “The initiative reflects our commitment to adapting the financial system to the realities of digital assets while safeguarding the integrity of international capital flows.” – BCB This proposal enables the BCB to oversee the crypto industry as part of the December 2022 crypto law . Stakeholders can submit feedback on the proposal by February 28, 2025. Despite public opinions, the BCB is responsible for enforcing crypto laws. Additionally, crypto investments, whether inbound or outbound, would be subject to the same regulatory standards as traditional investments. External credit, direct foreign investment, and Brazilian capital abroad involving crypto would require adherence to existing international capital regulations. Under the public consultation, centralized exchanges would also need to obtain a foreign exchange license to offer stablecoin-related services. Brazil’s Central Bank proposes a stablecoin withdrawal ban to regulate the crypto market Brazil’s planned Stablecoin Withdrawal Ban highlights the growing significance of currencies in the financial sector. According to Brazil’s Internal Revenue Service, stablecoins accounted for 71.4% of September’s $4.2 billion crypto transactions, with Tether (USDT) leading the market. This critical book discusses the potential impacts of the new legislation on corporations and crypto traders. In addition to limiting withdrawals, the BCB recommends stringent rules for virtual asset service providers. Adhering to conventional investment standards guarantees these companies’ compliance with global capital regulations. This strategy strikes a compromise between Brazilian crypto industry innovation and financial stability.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 04:51:17

Beyond entertainment, GalaChain plays a key role in NFTs and memes, with Fuzzle and $WEN as frontliners. New developments and clever Innovations with real-life use cases that provide relatable solutions are emerging more frequently, making the Gala community one of the most innovative in the ecosystem. GalaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain developed by Gala to serve as a backbone for everything entertainment, including games, music, and film. It’s powered by a network of Founder’s and designed with a clear objective to cater to the demands of Web2 gaming while adding Web3 functions and extending unique features to other industries. The design philosophy behind the GalaChain is quite simple: it’s designed to seamlessly handle the intensive requirements of gaming with the ability to accommodate virtually any allocation or industry need. This has become the distinctive factor of GalaChain, making it the go-to for the tech demands of multiple platforms. Fuzzle Innovates On GalaChain The Gala community breeds innovators with ambitions to create the next big solutions and projects. The latest is Fuzzle launching its groundbreaking Web3 platform designed to fuel creativity and problem solving. An innovative platform that equips users with powerful AI tools to tackle a wide array of work challenges. The platform will automate the creation of videos, GIFs, articles, and comprehensive content campaigns tailored to individual needs and transform ideas into large-scale results with ease. Backed by the Fuzzle Prime DAO and six founder nodes, Fuzzle ensures robust support, security, and community-driven innovation. According to Gingerbreadman, the name behind Fuzzle, “the platform will give users powerful AI tools to handle all kinds of work challenges.” GingerbreadMan also won the block explorer bounty of 1 million $GALA for building the best-voted GalaChain block explorer, now known as GalaScan. $WEN takes Memes to New Heights on GalaChain While new memes on Solana look to steal the spotlight in recent times, $WEN has already taken centre stage preceding the current trend of meme sensation. The $WEN was created by a community member known as Lukabylie, who owns the platform galacoins.zyz. GalaCoins is a community developed site that covers different tokens in the GalaChain ecosystem. Recently launched on GalaChain, the token experienced a significant surge, reaching a market cap of $1 million within just a few weeks of its introduction. Token surges of this fashion only highlight a thriving community and underscore the health of the GalaChain ecosystem. Here’s what Lukabylie has to say about it all: “I got involved with Gala in 2021, I thought the in-game item ownership was a brilliant idea. A few years later I started playing Spider Tanks and on several occasions I wanted to analyze game data, which was available on the blockchain. When Gala came out with the Token creation Tool, I leveraged all of this into $WEN, a gamified token designed to belong to the community. It involved a reward mechanism for trading & holding & live trading data available to everyone. Over time tried to add more utility to the token by creating Galacoins.xyz, a platform designed to visualize data from Galaswap and empower other token creators”. $WEN creation came at the backdrop of a popular joke about delays. Since its creation, it has evolved to offer utility features, which include exclusive access to functionalities on galacoins.xyz. Unlike traditional meme coins that lack inherent value beyond speculative trading, $WEN offers its holders a form of fractional ownership, enabling individuals to win a fraction of valuable digital assets. The unique difference of $WEN compared to other meme coins points to the level of innovative ideas within the GalaChain ecosystem. The GalaChain Community Most successful projects and tokens in the blockchain industry are usually driven by a strong community. The GalaChain Community is exemplary not just for backing community-led innovations but for creating them. The rise of $WEN can be attributed to the active engagement of the community, while the sheer brilliance behind Fuzzle pays credence to elite builders and innovators within the ecosystem. As GalaChain evolves, so does the community. Together, a future of decentralized innovation is being built.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-11-30 04:53:37

However “community feedback and input” plays an important role in decisions related to which cryptocurrency to list. In a Cointelegraph interview at Aus Crypto Con 2024, Rachel Conlan said that teams responsible for listing go through a diligent process to go through the information regarding the founders behind the project’s involved people and the plans it potentially holds. This becomes necessary with the rise in the popularity of meme coins. Crypto exchanges have an increased responsibility to filter out any suspicious projects for the protection of the users. Moreover, Conlan said there is nothing “guaranteed” about what sets a project apart to be selected for listing on Binance. On the other hand, she also shared that the “secret research team” considers “a few different factors” like community feedback and input including community trends and insights regarding the project. She added these factors “are definitely important”. Memecoins with real use cases are the priority for Binance She added that because of no utility, meme coins have a lot of negative coverage. However “there are up-and-coming meme coins that have that utility built in”. It is the only functional requirement, explained Conlan. “What we should be talking about more is the innovation that’s going to come out, like the innovation that’s been prepped in this bear cycle. What people are building” – Rachel Conlan, Binance CMO Conlan believes that the crypto industry will have significant growth in the coming 18 to 24 months.

The growth accounts for 63%, leaving holders enthusiastic about its future. Hyperliquid held the largest airdrop in the DeFi protocol on November 29, giving out 310 million HYPE tokens to the community. The coin’s current market cap is nearly $2.2B. HYPE token supply plan is scheduled up to 2028 Hyperliquid, a layer one blockchain based on PoS consensus, can process up to 200,000 transactions per second. The token is critical to the ecosystem as it works as the staking asset and gas token for its Ethereum Virtual Machine Compatible Layer, HyperEVM. According to the protocol, Hyperliquid supplied 31% of its $1 billion tokens on its first airdrop. They reserved 38.8% for future emissions and community rewards, 6% went to the Hyper Foundation treasury, and 0.3% was directed to grants. According to the plans, core contributors will have 23.8% of the total supply during the first-year lock period, while the schedules will run beyond 2028. It didn’t reserve allocations for CEX, private investors, or market influencers. This airdrop is among the largest in De-Fi history So far, this airdrop is among the most historic on the DeFi protocol. In September 2020, another considerable airdrop was made by Uniswap. Uniswap’s airdrop distributed 400 UNI tokens each, to more than a quarter million addresses. By then, each token was about $3.40, which equaled almost $1,300 per recipient. Several users rushed to cash out their tokens after the airdrop, which worked in favor of the holders. The value of Uniswap rose to over $42 just a few months after the airdrop. The Arbitum protocol also had a memorable airdrop in 2023. It distributed its native token, Arbitrum, to 625,000 active wallets for a market value of $1.30 each, for a total of $812,500. Airdrop is not a new concept in the crypto space. In most cases, new or existing tokens are distributed for free to several users. The reasons for airdrops vary from promoting new tokens to giving incentives to early adopters. So far, data from CoinGecko indicates crypto tokens worth $26.6 billion have been distributed to users through airdrops.

They’ve got the kind of energy that turns internet jokes into billion-dollar sensations. From Dogecoin’s rocket-fuelled ride to Shiba Inus cult status, these coins have a way of grabbing headlines and making wallets dance. And guess what? This week, the spotlight shining on three standout contenders: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Book of Meme. Trust me, they’re not just making noise—they’re shaking things up! BTFD Coin’s presale is burning hot, roaring through its early stages like a meme-fuelled wildfire, while Moo Deng’s viral baby hippo charm is turning heads and winning hearts. And then there’s Book of Meme, the creative playground that’s giving meme lovers a platform to shine. Whether you’re here for the hype or the potential profits, these coins are proving that meme magic is alive and thriving. So, buckle up—it’s gonna be a wild ride! BTFD Coin: The Meme King in the Making BTFD Coin’s presale is already the talk of the crypto town, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now at $0.00005 in Stage 5, with the final listing price set at $0.0006. This meteoric price trajectory underscores its potential as the best meme coin to add right now. Its first day saw over $150,000 raised, and the tally has soared past $295,000, with 10 billion coins snapped up by eager investors. But it’s not just the presale numbers that are making waves. BTFD’s value proposition is packed with appeal: a play-to-earn (P2E) game that hooks gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, staking rewards that let holders earn passive income, and a vibrant, ever-growing community that’s ready to rally for the coin’s success. Imagine putting in $4,000 at Stage 5’s price of $0.00005 per coin—you’d snag 80 million BTFD coins. By the time it hits $0.0006 , your initial $4,000 investment would balloon to a whopping $48,000. That’s the kind of ROI dreams are made of. BTFD’s presale is slated to have 16 stages, which means there’s still room to hop on this rocket ship. With its robust roadmap, it’s no wonder analysts are calling it the best meme coin to add right now. Will you be part of its success story?

Today, the Ethereum vs Solana battle continues as both altcoins rank as the top performing cryptos to invest in. The Ethereum price has risen by about 37% in the past month, while the Solana price has soared by nearly 32%, causing speculation that another altcoin season is coming. However, Rollblock has surged by over 200% during its presale, causing investors to tip it as the top performing crypto to invest in right now. The new casino token has also raised over $6.2 million during its initial coin offering (ICO). But why is Rollblock causing so much FOMO among ETH and SOL investors ? Let’s find out. Ethereum crosses $3,600: Aims for new support at $4,000 Following the recent fall in the Bitcoin price, investors have shifted their attention to altcoins. As a result, the Ethereum price has experienced an upturn, increasing by approximately 37% within the last 30 days. On November 28, Ethereum crossed the $3,600 price point for the first time in 2024, causing optimistic conversations about a new altcoin season being in the offing. However, the rise in the Ethereum price in November has shown mixed feelings. Ethereum remains the second-worst performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, causing doubts about its ability to sustain the recent bullish trend. Solana remains one of the best-performing altcoins Solana has been a top performing crypto throughout 2024. The token has surged by over 330% in the past year, while Ethereum has only moved up by about 80%. SOL has overshadowed ETH in this battle of altcoins – thanks to its massively growing meme coin ecosystem, which has been attracting investors. Moreover, more developers are switching to Solana because of its faster throughput and lower fees. The Solana community has also given the blockchain and its token a massive boost as one of the best for investors, traders, and developers. The SOL price has reached about $240 at the time of writing, with optimistic Solana price predictions of $1,000 for 2025. Rollblock outperforms ETH and SOL during its presale Rollblock is in a world of its own, showing investors why its revolutionary GambleFi platform is the next big thing. The Rollblock (RBLK) token powers the Rollblock Casino ecosystem, incentivizing players and investors in various ways. One of the standout features of the casino is its reward system. The online gaming site has a unique revenue-sharing program that rewards RBLK token holders with a share of its weekly profits. These investors also get the opportunity to stake their tokens for up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY). On the player side, there are VIP bonuses for them and presale token holders to earn additional RBLK tokens based on their total holdings. They also get access to thousands of casino games that they can wager on for real money winnings. These, in addition to the daily, weekly, and monthly rakeback rewards, make Rollblock an exciting platform for their gambling needs. Conclusion The Rollblock presale is ongoing, allowing interested investors to key into the project. Investors can lock in the top performing crypto at $0.037 per unit in stage 8 before it increases to $0.041 in stage 9. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

He advises accumulating 10,000 XRP tokens before 2025, warning that those who fail to do so may miss out on significant future opportunities. Ripple’s Role in Global Finance In a recent analysis, Crypto Sensei highlighted the growing trust central banks place in Ripple’s technology. He explained that Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure positions XRP as a key player in the future of digital currencies, particularly central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Doyle emphasized that the token has maintained a leading position in blockchain innovation over the past decade, stating that its continued development and central bank partnerships are critical to its future success. According to Doyle, the asset offers advantages over stablecoins when settling international transactions. He said although stablecoins could offer price stability, they lack the decentralization and global liquidity XRP provides. He states that central banks need a cryptocurrency that can settle transactions instantly, highlighting the token as the one to fill the role. He believes the token’s technology could make it a central component in the tokenization of assets and the settlement of global trade flows. XRP Potential Value The analyst believes that as global financial institutions increasingly rely on the asset for cross-border payments, its value could reach between $100 and $9,999 per token. “If XRP becomes the hub for a lot of the world’s trade, you’re talking about an XRP value in the high three to four digits,” he suggested. Currently, the token is trading at $1.74, following a recent price increase of over 17% in the last day. Based on Doyle’s projections, those holding 10,000 XRP tokens today could see their holdings grow to between $1 million and $100 million if his high-end price predictions come true. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation and Criticism While Doyle’s predictions have captured the attention of many enthusiasts, they are not without skepticism. Critics point out that his projections are speculative and not guaranteed. Other analysts have expressed doubt that the token could reach anywhere near the $100 to $9,999 range within the next few years. They caution investors to consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and to be wary of overly optimistic predictions. Nonetheless, Doyle’s analysis highlights the token’s potential as digital currencies and blockchain technology continue to gain traction in the global financial system. Investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research and consider the potential rewards and risks before making significant investments.

Currently capitalizing on the current bull market , it is outperforming other tokens in spectacular fashion. The recent launch of ZK smart contracts further pushed ADA price higher, sending it on a massive price increase. This kind of performance could potentially push ADA back into the top echelons of the crypto market, but ADA is not the only token that is riding the bull market in style. Rollblock is also disrupting the GambleFi space, tearing up crypto rankings in the process. Let’s look at what these tokens offer ambitious investors bold enough to dive in and examine them. Rollblock is shaking up the GambleFi market Rollblock is a revolutionary online crypto casino that is causing a revolution in the GambleFi space, an industry that is worth more than half a trillion dollars. That is because it offers transparency in an opaque landscape, and online gamblers are flocking to it like addicted shoppers to Black Friday sales. However, Rollblock is more than a transparent, trustworthy gambling platform. It offers the latest tech and an extensive array of exciting games to give its users a comprehensive experience. It’s precisely why everyone keeps coming back for more! As a result, Rollblock is witnessing an expanding hub of active gamers, yet another reason why its presale continues to attract a massive influx of investors. More than $6 million has been raised, and given that it has an enticing entry price of $0.037, more investors are expected to jump on the bandwagon. That is because Rollblock holders not only get to realize massive profits when the coin moons, but they also get a slice of the revenue the platform generates every week. Once the project enters the limelight, there’s certain to be no going back, either. Experts believe it will go viral, ride the current b ull market to its destination, and net early investors the profits of their crypto careers! Cardano Unlocks ZK-Snarks smart contracts, ADA price explodes Cardano recently deployed its first zero-knowledge smart contract, an upgrade that introduces advanced scalability, privacy capabilities and expands its potential use cases. This was done in conjunction with Halo 2, an advanced zk-SNARK proving system integrated into Cardano’s ecosystem. After the launch, ADA price took off, trading at around $1. This is a major milestone given that it’s been more than two years since Cardano hit this price level. Crucially, it sets the ADA price prediction in an even more bullish mood. ADA price prediction: Is a Cardano ATH near? Cardano has been on a meteoric price rise in recent months, and the recent upgrade only adds fuel to the furnace. It bolstered ADA price, sending it into the top 10 coins by market cap. However, Cardano is currently about one-third of its ATH price, so it may take some time for ADA to break that record. But its current rally is enough to convince investors to take a stab at it. At the same time, it makes even more sense to take a bigger stake in Rollblock. Given its unknown status, Rollblock is well positioned to appreciate higher percentage-wise than ADA . No smart investor would want to miss out on it.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 05:50:00

The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience, and its current price action suggests a potential breakout at an aggressive pace if it can push above key resistance levels.

The next few days will determine whether SHIB can break above the $0.000026 resistance level. A successful breakout could continue its upward trajectory, driving SHIB toward its higher targets. However, failure to hold its current levels might lead to further consolidation. SHIB Testing Crucial Supply Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000258 after several days of volatile price action and market indecision. The price has fluctuated within a tight range, finding support near $0.000023 and facing resistance at $0.000028. This consolidation phase has kept traders on edge as they await a decisive breakout. If SHIB breaks above the critical $0.000026 resistance level, it could build the momentum needed to challenge the $0.000028 local high. A successful push above this level would likely signal the start of a more aggressive upward move, targeting the yearly highs at $0.000045. This level represents a significant milestone for SHIB, aligning with key technical and psychological factors that could further bolster its bullish trajectory. On the other hand, failure to break above these resistance levels might result in continued sideways trading or even a pullback toward the lower end of the range. The next few trading sessions will be crucial as market participants closely watch whether SHIB can sustain its bullish momentum and overcome these barriers.

Here’s What This Means to SHIB Price,https://timestabloid.com/1-billion-shib-within-an-hour-heres-what-this-means-to-shib-price/,"The Shiba Inu community has set a remarkable milestone by removing over 1.2 billion SHIB tokens from circulation within a day as 1 billion of this portion were burned within an hour. This significant development was reported by Shibburn, a blockchain tracker focused on SHIB burns. During this large-scale burn, SHIB’s price has shown signs of recovery, rising to $0.00002606 after a decline at this level earlier in the week. Shibburn reports that the burn rate for SHIB has surged by 2,050% in the last 24 hours. A total of 1,282,587,181 SHIB was transferred to dead wallets, effectively removing them from circulation. The most notable contribution came from a single anonymous wallet, which burned an astounding 1,003,266,585 SHIB in a single transaction. Additional burns included transfers of 209,312,491, 33,737,678, and 29,282,316 SHIB, spread across 14 transactions. This increase in burn activity suggests a coordinated effort to reduce the circulating supply, potentially boosting the token’s scarcity and value. Shytoshi Kusama’s Ambitious Vision Shytoshi Kusama , the enigmatic lead developer of Shiba Inu, has recently reiterated his goal of elevating the asset to the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In a recent tweet, Kusama emphasized the challenges of enhancing the utility of a meme-based cryptocurrency without a large budget, sharing an AI-generated image depicting a chaotic yet determined effort to achieve this vision. Kusama described the image as a metaphor for the journey to transform SHIB from its current rank of 14th on CoinMarketCap to a top-five position. In another tweet, he confirmed that this ambitious goal is firmly focused on Shiba Inu (SHIB). Kusama’s vision underscores the aspiration of the community to secure a prominent place among the leading digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Position At the time of press, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holds the 14th position on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of approximately $15.42 billion. The recent surge in burn activity has coincided with a modest price increase, as the token trades at $0.00002616. If the current burn momentum and market interest persist, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could rise further. However, its path to becoming a top-five cryptocurrency remains challenging, requiring continued innovation and community engagement. The recent burns highlight the community’s commitment to reducing supply and adding value. Whether these efforts will propel the asset to new heights remains to be seen, but the dedication of its developers and community suggests that the journey is far from over.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the NYDFS is expected to grant Ripple a Limited Purpose Trust Charter in the coming days, paving the way for the launch of RLUSD as early as December 4. The approval would allow Ripple to enter the heavily regulated U.S. stablecoin market, putting it in direct competition with industry leaders like Circle (USDC), Paxos (USDP), and Gemini (GUSD). The statute would allow Ripple to legally offer RLUSD to the public in New York, a state known for its strict regulatory standards for digital assets.

Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, played a central role in these transactions as a bridge currency. However, XRP has faced significant legal challenges in the US, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that it constitutes an unregistered security. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC, currently in the appeals phase, has kept XRP’s regulatory status in limbo. Despite these challenges, following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, the price of XRP rose to $1.90 on optimism that his administration will adopt crypto-friendly policies. XRP currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. *This is not investment advice.

Compared to Ethereum’s Uniswap (UNI) , Raydium’s volume is nearly double Uniswap’s $50 billion, making Raydium’s RAY one of the hottest new crypto tokens to hold. Thanks to the booming DeFi sector on Raydium , the price of RAY has surged over 67%, adding to its year-to-date uptick of 1365%. Uniswap’s UN I, on the other hand, is just starting to recover from a devastating drop of over 70% from its peak price of $44. Another new crypto DeFi project disrupting the market right now is Lunex Network . This DEX aggregator powered by institutional-grade liquidity is currently flying through its ICO with its LNEX utility token priced at $0.0033, Lunex has raised over $3.6 million. Lunex Network outshines legacy DEXs with its revolutionary new crypto Lunex is a new approach to DeFi, and expert analysts are already forecasting great upside potential for its token, LNEX. At its core, Lunex is a futuristic DEX and aggregator built on a speedy network that is capable of facilitating effortless cross-chain asset transfers. While most DEXs require the user to connect a DeFi wallet to swap tokens, all you need on Lunex is the receiving address of your non-custodial wallet, and you can trade across more than 50,000 currency pairs. That’s right, Lunex acts as a multi-chain bridge and swapping dApp that simplifies the process of swapping or trading tokens on a DEX. Its most revolutionary solution is its capacity to fetch deep liquidity across the Web3 landscape. Each trade is split across multiple chains to find the best price with zero slippage. Lunex also comes with a portfolio tracker that delivers accurate and up-to-date market intelligence to help with making data-driven decisions. With over $3.5 million worth of LNEX tokens sold so far, holders can enjoy additional perks such as the platform’s staking program. Raydium leads the charge as Solan’s DeFi ecosystem thrives Data from DeFi Llama shows that Solana’s DeFi ecosystem just surpassed a monthly trading volume of $100 billion, with Raydium leading the charge, given its 30-day trading volume of over $80 billion. That’s nearly double of Ethereum’s Uniswap volume of about $50 billion. Raydium thrives on the massive attention platforms such as Pump.fun has received amid a frenzy of new crypto meme coins that have taken the crypto space by storm. Can Raydium’s RAY surge past its previous ATH? Uniswap’s UNI starts to recover amid increasing bullish sentiment The price of Uniswap’s UNI has registered an uptick over the last 30 days of about 62% as bullish sentiment around Uniswap picks up speed. For the better part of 2024, UNI’ s price remained stagnant below the $15 resistance region, but a change in the tide is underway. Can Uniswap reclaim its position as a DeFi giant? Conclusion Raydium’s RAY and Uniswap’s UNI are soon going to be locked in a tight race for dominance in the DeFi space. RAY currently enjoys its position as a new crypto DEX token. However, Lunex’s LNEX could soon dethrone them both thanks to its deep liquidity and extensive range of useful features.

This collaboration introduces a dual-staking mechanism set to launch on December 2. The initiative allows users to stake SHIB tokens to earn SHIRO and vice versa, creating new opportunities for holders of both cryptocurrencies. The partnership has sparked interest due to its potential to enhance engagement within both communities. Shiba Inu’s Lead Developer Denies Involvement Following the announcement, concerns were raised by some community members regarding the legitimacy of the Shiro Neko project. Questions about transparency led Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, to address the issue. In response to a comment implying potential issues with the collaboration, Kusama clarified that he is not involved with Shiro Neko and requested that his name not be associated with the project. Dont @ me. I am not involved with Shiro. Tanks bunches. — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) November 28, 2024 Past Concerns About Shiro Neko Resurface Community concerns about Shiro Neko are not new. Last month, Susbarium, a community-managed scam awareness channel linked to Shiba Inu , warned the Shiba Inu community about the project. This warning came after Shiro Neko conducted a significant token burn, destroying 5.58 billion SHIB in a single transaction. Following the burn, Shiro Neko’s team sought a formal relationship with Shiba Inu, sparking skepticism about its motives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Susbarium advised the community to be cautious, highlighting that projects using large token burns as promotional tactics should be carefully evaluated. Although the channel did not label Shiro Neko a scam, it recommended investors conduct thorough research before engaging with the token. Mixed Reactions from the Community While some community members view the dual-staking initiative as an innovative way to increase the asset’s utility, others remain wary due to the concerns raised. The timing of the partnership, given past warnings, has led to further scrutiny. Despite this, the collaboration is moving forward, with supporters hopeful it will contribute to the growth of both ecosystems. As the dual-staking launch date approaches, investors are urged to remain cautious and informed. Conducting due diligence remains crucial in ensuring safe participation in cryptocurrency investment.

Yet, despite the challenges, the cryptocurrency has experienced an extraordinary surge in recent weeks. Since Donald Trump’s election win, XRP has rocketed by more than 273%. Is the rally here to stay, or are there warning signs ahead? Crypto analysts, including Maartunn, are urging caution. Let’s dive into the details and explore what’s driving XRP’s current momentum—and what could come next. XRP Outperforms the Market XRP, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has posted extraordinary gains. Over the past 30 days, it has surged by 262%, far exceeding the market average of 57%. In the last 24 hours, it jumped 21%—the highest among the top ten cryptocurrencies. By comparison, Bitcoin rose 0.6%, Ethereum 2.5%, and Solana 0.6%. Even Dogecoin, known for its volatility, gained only 4.1%. Caution, Investors! Maartunn, a prominent crypto analyst, warns that XRP’s rapid rise might be fueled by leveraged trading. He notes that similar scenarios in the past have led to significant market corrections, with drops of over 17%. Supporting this view, data shows that open interest in XRP futures has increased by 37%. This indicates heightened trading activity, which could amplify both gains and potential losses if investors start to close their positions. What’s Driving the XRP Price? A major factor driving XRP’s growth is Donald Trump’s recent election win. His presidency is seen as favorable for the crypto industry, boosting investor confidence. XRP has been a standout performer in this post-election rally. On November 5, XRP was trading at $0.50313. By November 16, it had surged to $1.11687, marking a significant gain in just over a week. Another major catalyst was the resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough stance on crypto, particularly against Ripple. Following this news on November 21, XRP jumped from $1.10064 to $1.24677. The next day, it hit a high of $1.47408. In the last four days, XRP has climbed over 35%, currently trading at $1.88521. Ripple’s Strategic Moves Ripple has also made key strategic moves, including investing in Bitwise’s XRP fund and launching its first tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger. These initiatives are designed to expand the XRP ecosystem and demonstrate Ripple’s confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. XRP’s recent surge is the result of favorable legal, political, and market developments. While the gains are impressive, analysts caution that the rally could face a correction if market dynamics shift.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 06:36:13

Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 06:47:00

This dramatic climb defines broader market trends, with daily trading volume jumping over $18 billion with a rise of over 160%, signalling investor interest. A couple of key drivers have triggered the massive rally, attracting huge liquidity. Regulatory Optimism—Rumors of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure have fueled hopes for a more crypto-friendly approach. Ripple’s legal battle resolution could further bolster XRP. Institutional Confidance: Growing interest in XRP ETFs (like Bitwise’s rebranded Physical XRP ETP) indicates rising support from major investors. These external factors are expected to have a major impact over the XRP price rally, which could help the XRP price break new milestones. The token began to rise positively by separating from the general market. While many people claim huge price targets like $20 or $30 for XRP in the coming days, here’s why these possibilities are pretty low, as the token could reach a $2 trillion market cap, which appears to be pretty difficult considering the current market dynamics. The weekly chart of XRP shows the bulls are now poised to lift the price beyond the ATH at $3.84 in the coming days after rising above 2021 highs. The momentum of the rally remained in bullish favour since the beginning, which could intensify hereafter as the Gaussian channel just turned bullish since the second half of the month. However, the RSI raises some concerns, displaying the probability of a small pullback as it has reached the levels not attained since 2021 at around 89. Back in 2018, the RSI surged further to reach 95, which elevated the levels to a new ATH. Therefore, the price, which is trading between the pivotal range between $1.7 and $2.08 at 0.5 & 0.618 FIB resp, is expected to test the support before triggering a rise above the resistance. Once the bulls settle above the range, the price is expected to rise to 1 FIB at the highs and further maintain a strong rise to 1.2 FIB at $4.15, forming the peak of the prevailing bull run. However, an extended bull run may pave the way for higher targets at $5.2 and $6.4 as well. The growing fundamentals have also attracted major countries like India onto the platform. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s digital rupee is taking shape with Ripple’s XRP ledger. The growing confidence of the authorities, institutions, bulls, and mainly the market participants is expected to back the XRP price rally, which aims to form new highs in 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 06:47:36

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Avalanche targets Cardano, but rising star IntelMarkets shines with QuantumX wallet and AI platform launch. Avalanche (AVAX) is gearing up to overtake one of the biggest winners of the last bull cycle-Cardano (ADA). But while these crypto giants strive for comebacks, a new star of the crypto space is putting all its foot on the table, IntelMarkets (INTL). By announcing the QuantumX wallet launch and an AI-driven platform, IntelMarkets promises more upside potential than standard altcoins. IntelMarkets: Leading the next wave of crypto innovation Quickly getting all the attention is IntelMarkets . Shaping up to be a leader in transforming the $36 billion crypto trading sector with a unique AI- DeFi narrative. QuantumX wallet is a first of its kind “future-proof” wallet. With the increase in cybersecurity attacks combined with the threat of quantum computing, IntelMarkets provides the first retail solution to address this problem. IntelMarkets has already shown its credibility in the presale phase, garnering well over $2.5 million. Currently, at the sixth presale stage, early investors saw a 500% increase from the initial price of $0.009, with INTL tokens now priced at $0.054. With low entry and high growth potential, IntelMarkets is an excellent investment for those who get in early.

Providing a platform based on solid fundamentals, AVAX went on to gain a reputation for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and robust DeFi ecosystem. Facing stiff competition in the Layer 1 space has caused Avalanche to go above and beyond to remain competitive. AVAX is not only competitive, but is preparing for a historic rally. Avalanche currently sits at $43.56, far below its all time high of $146.22, which was reached back in November 2021. In the last month, AVAX has risen by a whopping 67%, and is still on the rise. But, Avalanche’s outlook remains optimistic, with predictions claiming AVAX could surge to $70 by the end of the year. Cardano: Claiming $1 price tag with a 200% increase on the monthly charts One of the larger blockchain platforms, Car dano, was one of the biggest winners this cycle. Seeing large attention, Cardano placed their main focus on scalability and sustainability. A top 10 cryptocurrency, ADA has made strides, but hasn’t made the pivot back to its all time high of $3.10 back in September 2021. Currently, Cardano is traded at above $1, experiencing a triple from its price of $0.30. ADA has stepped up to a 25% increase over the past seven days, slowing down slightly. Cardano could rally to $1.50 by the end of 2024, but more external factors would have to go ADA’s way to reach its previous highs. Conclusion While Avalanche prepares to rally over Cardano, the $2.5 million presale is leading the way. With the QuantumX wallet and AI-powered features, IntelMarkets has significant upside potential. At just $0.054, INTL tokens have yielded early investors with 500% gains already.

This is the first time that Ether ETFs have achieved this milestone, since launch, showing a shift in investor sentiment. As a result, the ETH price surged another 4.27% moving past $3,720, setting the stage for the next rally to $5,000. Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows on the Rise Institutional demand for the spot Ether ETFs is slowly picking pace. Yesterday, the total inflows into US Ether ETFs stood at a staggering $332 million overtaking the Bitcoin ETF daily inflows of $320 million. This is the fifth consecutive trading session in which Ethereum ETFs saw net positive inflows. On Friday, the BlackRock Ether ETF (ETHA) alone accounted for $250 million in inflows followed by Fidelity’s FETH at $79.1 million in inflows, per the data from Farside Investors . Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, stated that the BlackRock Ether ETF (ETHA) has now surpassed $2 billion in total inflows since its launch in July, underscoring strong investor demand and growing institutional interest in Ethereum as a leading digital asset. Source: SosoValue On the other hand, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw $137.5 million in inflows yesterday. This shows that the capital rotation from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum (ETH) has begun. While inflows into Ether ETFs have been on the rise, the Bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed down recently. Earlier this week, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw zero inflows for two consecutive days in a row. Recent reports also suggest that BlackRock funds from the traditional portfolio have also been buying millions of IBIT shares recently. ETH Price Rally to $5,000? Market analysts have turned bullish on the Ethereum price while expecting new all-time highs above $5,000. At press time, ETH price has surged another 4% with bulls taking it beyond the crucial resistance $3,700, setting an immediate target of 4,000. Ethereum’s price chart has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, signaling potential bullish momentum ahead. Analyst ‘Trader Tardigrade’ suggests that a retest of the $3,538–$3,445 range could present a final buying opportunity at these levels before ETH targets the pattern’s projected high of $5,800.

This sudden rally has caught the attention of investors, who are now increasingly optimistic about the token’s future. With New Partnerships, IPO launch, ETFs, and Stablecoins all lined up in the coming months XRP is surely to hit a new ATH by December. Before that let’s understand what’s market looks like. Ripple vs. SEC Case: Will it Be Over Soon? The hopes for XRP price are rising because Brad Garlinghouse hinted in a recent interview that XRP may come out from a legal mess creating room for XRP growth. Speculation is growing that the case could be dismissed by 2025, giving XRP the regulatory clarity it has long sought. This optimism gained momentum after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his departure in January. Some legal experts, like Chris Giancarlo, believe the SEC might drop the case altogether, while others, such as lawyers Fred Rispoli and Jeremy Hogan, think the SEC might settle and reduce penalties. Additionally, interest is rising in creating XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), though the SEC has yet to approve any. If the case is dismissed, it could remove regulatory roadblocks that have hindered XRP’s adoption. This would give Ripple room to expand, potentially sending XRP’s price to new heights, with investors already factoring in this potential outcome. Brad Garlinghouse’s Upcoming 60 Minutes Appearance Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is set to appear on 60 Minutes, where he will discuss Ripple’s journey through the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. The interview, airing on December 1st, will showcase Ripple’s resilience and belief in future success, even amidst legal challenges. This comes at a time when XRP has surged to a multi-year high of $1.60, with growing optimism in the crypto market. XRP’s Strong Market Performance In the meanwhile, XRP is currently in a strong bull run, trading above $1.50, with a 6% gain in the past 24 hours and a 20% increase over the last week. It’s eyeing the $1.60 mark, though it faces resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If it breaks through, it could quickly hit $2. Analysts predict that if the price drops, solid support levels around $1.25 to $1.30 will prevent significant losses. If it breaks above $1.50 has already shifted previous resistance levels into support, setting XRP up for further growth. Looking Ahead: Positive Outlook for December Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, forecasts that XRP could continue its positive movement into December, potentially reaching as high as $2.57. This bullish prediction is supported by recent market trends and the anticipated launch of an XRP ETF, which could further influence the token’s price.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 07:20:21

Notably, burn statistics on Saturday indicated a whopping 7,400% uptick in the crypto’s weekly burn rate, as roughly 2 billion coins were destroyed. In turn, crypto enthusiasts are eyeing a potential $0.0004 target for the renowned dog-themed meme coin ahead amid a bullish Q4 market. SHIB Burn Surges 7,400% Weekly As Kaaldhairya Burns 80M Coins According to the official tracker Shibburn on X, the SHIB weekly burn soared 7,418% on Saturday, November 30. This colossal surge comes against the backdrop of 1.93 billion coins removed from the meme token’s market supply. Notably, with the massive burn surge weighing in, the dog-themed meme coin ‘s total supply at the time of reporting was evaluated as 589.26 trillion tokens. For context, the meme coin’s token burn mechanism helps in reducing the asset’s excessive market supply by transferring it to a null address. These tokens can never be retrieved, thereby delivering a considerable blow to the crypto’s supply. In turn, market watchers anticipate a bullish effect on the asset’s price, reflecting the law of supply and demand. Intriguingly, it’s also worth mentioning that Shiba Inu exec Kaaldhairya appears to have contributed significantly to the burn rate surge mentioned above. Kaal took to X as of November 30, revealing that the ecosystem’s semi/auto burns have been working for months, burning over 300M tokens to date. Moreover, the exec said, “I just burned 80M+ SHIB a few minutes ago and enjoyed the cool animation at the end.” While these statements solidified optimism about the meme coin’s long-term prospects, they also cleared any misconceptions about the auto-burns designed to reduce the excessive supply. Additionally, the same exec also revealed that the recent maintenance on Shibarium is complete and that the bridge is now fully functional. This development has further solidified the meme coin’s leading stance in the broader sector. On the other hand, Kaaldhairya also revealed that the team is “still working on upgrades for the burn contracts,” igniting additional discussions over future price movements. What’s Ahead For SHIB Price? At the time of reporting, SHIB price traded at $0.00002593, down marginally by 0.06%. Its intraday low and high were $0.00002551 and $0.00002633, respectively. Besides, the monthly chart for the coin shows a 39% uptick, underscoring optimism in light of the SHIB burn surge and community advancements. Simultaneously, a Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape Media revealed that the token eyes potential gains ahead, although the chances of a $1 target this year remain slim. Besides, if the coin sustains its monthly bullish momentum, it could break the resistance of $0.00003. This bullish drive could further pave the path for a $0.0004 price target in turn. Meanwhile, rising Shiba Inu whale accumulations have added to market optimism surrounding the coin’s price action ahead. CoinGape Media reported a major whale to have continued bagging the token amid a bull market. Simultaneously, crypto market participants continue to monitor the meme-themed coin for further price action shifts in light of optimistic statistics.

A CryptoQuant analyst, G a a h, recently shared insights indicating heightened selling pressure within the market, which could signal caution for traders. At the core of this analysis is the delta between buy and sell taker volumes—a key metric used to gauge the market’s behaviour . Bitcoin Faces Increased Selling Pressure According to the analyst, the buy and sell taker ratio metric has reached levels comparable to those recorded in July 2024. This marks a period of heightened selling activity, attributed to profit-taking by investors, market uncertainty, or mass liquidations. The analyst noted that these developments coincide with an uptick in volatility and aggressive actions in the futures market. Notably, $430 million in long positions were liquidated within a week, highlighting the significant reaction from sellers. G a a h also revealed that the liquidation of long positions, which reached its fourth-highest peak in 2024, has had a notable effect on Bitcoin’s price behaviour. This volume of liquidation often result in a “redistribution of capital,” leading to temporary reversals or consolidation phases, the CryptoQuant analyst noted. Historically, these liquidation-driven price movements have also acted as pivotal moments, either reinforcing support levels or triggering further sell-offs. Outlook and Precautions For BTC Traders The analyst pointed out that sustained selling pressure could negatively influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the short term. As such, continuous monitoring of market indicators and risk management is important for investors aiming to navigate these conditions. G a a h added: Defensive strategies [such as reducing leverage and setting stop-losses] and continuous monitoring of the market are recommended to avoid excessive exposure at this time of dominant selling pressure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued with its positive performance. Over the past day, the asset has increased by 1.6% bringing its price above $97,000 . Although Bitcoin is still 2.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $99,645, there appears to still be a form of bullish sentiment in its market. According to recent analysis from renowned crypto analyst known as Javon Marks on X, Bitcoin’s 2-hour time frame on the chart has “confirmed” a notable bullish signal. This confirmation makes the rally to $100,000 price mark imminent and the current target at $116,652. #Bitcoin (BTC)’s 2h chart has confirmed a high conviction signal for a full recovery and continuation!

The market has recently favored XRP as it has breached a long-standing descending trendline against Bitcoin. However, it has to cross crucial levels to begin the bull run. This trendline had previously acted as a formidable resistance, with XRP struggling to overcome it during an attempt in July 2021. However, it has now gained a remarkable 111% against Bitcoin in November alone, signaling a potential resurgence in investor interest. Analyzing the #XRP price in Dollars vs Bitcoin shows us how early we are in this bullrun. We are still 1,500% behind in Bitcoin value compared to early 2017. If we meet the same Bitcoin value $XRP price will be around $20. pic.twitter.com/ofxd6Izv5g — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 26, 2024 A Lofty Target for XRP According to CryptoBull’s analysis, the significance of this breakout lies in the historical context. Before the current market conditions, XRP had been underperforming Bitcoin for an extended period, since it reached its all-time high in early 2018. The prolonged period of XRP’s relative weakness against Bitcoin has now been challenged, as the asset appears to be regaining its footing. CryptoBull believes that XRP’s current bull run is still in its early phase, suggesting it still has room for further upside. The analyst’s projection is based on the premise that if XRP can reclaim its 2017 peak against Bitcoin, it could reach a price target of around $20. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In 2017, XRP’s peak against Bitcoin was 0.0002454 BTC. The cryptocurrency achieved this in May 2017, following a remarkable gain of over 300% against the leading cryptocurrency in the preceding three months. Currently, XRP is trading at a mere 0.00001544 BTC, indicating that it is still at almost 1,500% below the historical high. Given the recent positive momentum , CryptoBull believes that a similar rally to the one witnessed in early 2017 could propel the altcoin to its aforementioned $20 price target. Based on the current Bitcoin price of around $95,000, which would translate the 0.0002454 BTC peak into a $23.3 XRP price. CryptoBull’s projection has instilled optimism among XRP enthusiasts, who closely monitor the altcoin’s performance. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.87. Other crypto experts have predicted the $20 target for XRP. If it can repeat its 300% surge against Bitcoin, it could outperform Bitcoin in December and January next year to reach this level.

As a result, the majority of the cryptos, specifically altcoins, are trying to rise above their pivotal resistance, which may further assist them in marking new highs during the upcoming bull run. Moreover, the possibility of a strong altseason has also emerged as Ethereum, which is known as the base for the other altcoins, has launched a strong bullish attack. For the first time, Ethereum ETFs have outpaced the BTC ETF. The recent rise in the ETH price seems to have caught the investor’s attention, which has reflected in the spot ETH ETFs volumes. The ETFs witnessed a massive surge in net flows, recording $333 million, surpassing BTC, which is around $320 million, between November 22 and 27. Out of this, Blackrock alone accumulated over $250 million. Source: X As ETH continues to outshine, it’s clear that the investor’s confidence is shifting, which may further lead to a major change in its value. The ETH price is ready to surge higher with the trend continuation after the breakout of the inverse head-and-shoulder pattern followed by a successful retest. This suggests the interim target of the ETH price rally is somewhere above $5500. After a successful breakout in the short term, the ETH price has become favourable for bulls in the long term. The price, which is trading along an ascending support line, is about to test the final resistance zone below the ATH between $3870 and $4016. The bulls are trying for a breakout before reaching the apex of the ascending triangle as the RSI is incremental and the Gaussian channel has turned bullish. Therefore, the ETH price is believed to surpass the resistance zone and enter the final resistance at the ATH. Meanwhile, the volume raises some concerns, which remains pretty lower than the bull run range. However, these volumes seem to be flowing into the ETFs, which keeps the bullish hopes alive. According to some reports, the institutions are investing more in technology than the ETH price. Therefore, this suggests the growing confidence in the platform, which may keep up the elevated trend, reaching a 5-digit level too.",Price Analysis|Ethereum|Ethereum ETF,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 07:36:21

Web3, the next iteration of the web, promises a decentralized, transparent, and user-centric internet where control shifts from corporations to individuals. This paradigm shift isn’t just technological—it’s reshaping industries and creating a gold rush of new career opportunities. If you’re seeking to align your career with the cutting edge, Web3 might be the perfect frontier. What Is Web3? Web3, or the decentralized web, leverages blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries. It promises greater ownership, transparency, and democratization of data and assets. Unlike Web2, where platforms like Facebook and Google monopolize user data, Web3 empowers users through decentralized platforms, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts. But Web3 isn’t just about technology; it’s about culture, community, and a shift in how we think about value and ownership. And this transformation requires a new breed of professionals who can help build and sustain this digital ecosystem. Why Web3 Is the Career Frontier of the Future Web3 is more than a buzzword—it’s a rapidly expanding industry. In 2023, the global blockchain market was valued at over $10 billion, with projections to grow exponentially. Companies, from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, are heavily investing in blockchain, NFTs, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). For job seekers, this means a wealth of opportunities. As traditional industries like finance, gaming, and healthcare explore decentralized solutions, the demand for skilled Web3 professionals is skyrocketing. Unique Web3 Career Paths 1.

DAO Governance and Community Management Decentralized organizations operate without traditional hierarchies. They rely on governance models and engaged communities to thrive. If you’re a people person with organizational skills, this is your niche. Key Roles : DAO Strategist, Community Manager Key Skills : Communication, project management, understanding governance frameworks 4. Creative Roles: NFTs and the Metaverse The Web3 revolution isn’t just for coders. Artists, designers, and storytellers are crucial in shaping the metaverse and NFT landscapes. Virtual world builders, NFT creators, and immersive experience designers are integral to crafting this new digital reality. Key Roles : Metaverse Designer, NFT Artist Key Skills : 3D modeling, creative design, storytelling 5. Legal and Compliance Experts Web3 operates in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Lawyers specializing in blockchain, intellectual property for NFTs, and DAO regulations are critical to ensuring compliance and navigating legal challenges. Key Roles : Blockchain Legal Advisor, Compliance Officer Key Skills : Regulatory knowledge, blockchain ethics How to Start Your Web3 Career Learn the Basics : Familiarize yourself with blockchain fundamentals, cryptocurrency, and key Web3 concepts like DAOs and NFTs.

Why Web3 Is Worth the Leap Entering the Web3 space might feel like stepping into the Wild West—but that’s part of the appeal. The industry is still young, meaning you have the chance to shape its future while being part of a revolutionary movement. And with salaries for many Web3 roles surpassing their traditional Web2 counterparts, the financial incentives are hard to ignore. Beyond monetary rewards, working in Web3 means joining a mission-driven ecosystem that values decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment. Whether you’re a coder, an artist, a strategist, or a communicator, there’s a space for you to thrive.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 07:52:00

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that’s often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It’s backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo’s approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It’s a Layer-1 platform that’s eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It’s used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche’s technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today’s crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink’s services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today’s market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It’s designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers. With MANTRA, you get a blockchain that’s open to everyone but can also support applications that need special permissions. This means businesses can build on MANTRA without worrying about breaking any rules. What makes MANTRA stand out is its strong technology foundation. It’s built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it’s compatible with other blockchains and supports smart contracts through CosmWasm. It can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, so it’s ready for large-scale use. Plus, it offers tools to create and manage assets that comply with regulations. In today’s market, where many are looking for secure and compliant blockchain solutions, OM, the coin of MANTRA, looks promising. It could be a strong competitor to other coins that don’t focus on regulatory compliance, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion ONDO, AVAX, LINK, and OM are strong picks, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely merges memes and sports, aiming for 20,000% growth and poised to become a cultural icon.

Based on Martinez’s chart, it appears that Ethereum is in an ascending channel on the weekly time frame and the medium-term target price sits around the upper boundary of the channel. In technical analysis, an ascending channel consists of upward-sloping parallel trendlines and is an indication of a strong uptrend.

Martinez says that the flagship memecoin is at a “very critical resistance point.” The crypto analyst says that Dogecoin could plunge by up to 17% from current prices if it fails to convincingly cross above the major resistance area. “A sustained break above $0.40 will send it to $0.43, but failing to clear the $0.40 resistance will trigger another dip to $0.36 or even $0.34!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.41 at time of writing.

But now, he’s facing serious allegations that threaten to shake the trust he’s earned from millions of fans. With over 31.2 million followers, the popular YouTuber and entrepreneur is accused of using his platform to manipulate the cryptocurrency market for personal gain. Insider trading, misleading promotions, and pump-and-dump schemes are at the center of the controversy, with claims that MrBeast made over $23 million from crypto projects. We’re answering questions you don’t want to miss. Read on! Did MrBeast Manipulate Token Prices? According to a detailed investigation by expert researchers, MrBeast allegedly promoted specific tokens to artificially boost their value. Once the prices surged, he is said to have sold his holdings for a significant profit, leaving investors with steep losses. Here’s a breakdown of his reported earnings: $11.45M from $SUPER $4.65M from $ERN $1.72M from $PMON $1.31M from $STAK $1M from $AIOZ These promotional campaigns allegedly led to sharp price drops once MrBeast exited, resulting in heavy losses for investors. Crypto Scandals Are on the Rise MrBeast isn’t the first influencer to face criticism over crypto promotions. Others like Logan Paul, Jake Paul, and KSI have also been accused of pushing tokens in ways that misled their followers. However, MrBeast’s situation is particularly concerning because of his image as a philanthropist and a trusted public figure. Critics argue that such schemes further erode trust in the crypto industry, which is already grappling with a lack of regulation. Many retail investors, influenced by figures like MrBeast, have woken up to find their investments nearly worthless. When Will Crypto Be Better Regulated? The controversy has reignited calls for stricter rules on influencer marketing in the crypto space. Industry experts believe that more oversight is crucial to protect everyday investors from deceptive promotions. While MrBeast has yet to comment publicly on the accusations, the outcome of ongoing investigations could set a significant precedent, potentially bringing more accountability to the digital asset market.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|AIOZ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 08:14:55

According to Farside data , this figure eclipsed the previous record of $295.5 million set on November 11 by $37.4 million, marking a new high for investor interest in Ether-based ETFs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, played a pivotal role in the surge, contributing $250.4 million to the total inflows on November 29. BlackRock’s ETH ETF Attracts Over $2 Billion Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, highlighted on X that BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has already attracted over $2 billion in inflows since its launch on July 23. The massive inflows come as Ether’s price climbed 1.88% to $3,662 on November 29, according to CoinMarketCap data. Crypto analysts and commentators were quick to note that Ether ETFs outperformed their Bitcoin counterparts in daily inflows for the first time. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $320 million in inflows on the same day, slightly behind Ether ETFs. Ethereum Vibin, a crypto commentator, remarked on X that this was a significant moment as “ETH ETF flows have flipped BTC ETF flows for the first time.” Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, suggested the inflows signal Wall Street’s growing participation in the “alt rotation.” Today was the largest ETH ETF inflow day since inception. ETH saw larger $ inflows than BTC. Single day inflow near 10 bps the entire market cap or ETH. Don’t midcurve it, alt rotation has begun last week and wallstreet is officially joining the fun. https://t.co/tbBv2pJG3P — Felix Hartmann (@FelixOHartmann) November 30, 2024 The inflows come amid a broader trend of Ether ETFs maintaining stronger performance relative to Bitcoin ETFs. Between November 22 and 27, spot Ether ETFs saw net inflows of $224.9 million, compared to Bitcoin ETFs’ $35.2 million, which was weighed down by outflows on November 25. Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem also celebrated a legal victory in a U.S. court this week, potentially boosting investor confidence in the asset. Pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi summed up the sentiment in a post on X, saying, “Flows are finally picking up, and sellers are being absorbed. It only takes time.” Ethereum Surpasses Tron as Top Blockchain for Tether Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether (USDT), surpassing Tron with a supply of $60.3 billion. The milestone follows a 9.3% increase in USDT on Ethereum over the past week, while Tron experienced a 1.5% decline, bringing its supply to $58.1 billion. This marks Ethereum’s return to dominance for the first time since August 2022. The total USDT supply has reached an all-time high of $132.9 billion, a bullish indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. Stablecoins like Tether are critical for providing trading liquidity and facilitating capital flow within the ecosystem. Ethereum’s prominence stems from its adoption by financial institutions for tokenizing US dollar-backed assets. Meanwhile, Tron remains popular in high-inflation regions due to its low fees and fast transactions, enabling efficient savings in stablecoins like USDT. Ethereum solidified its lead on November 21, and the gap widened on November 23 when Tether minted $2 billion USDT on Ethereum compared to $1 billion on Tron. Other blockchains in the USDT supply rankings include BNB Chain ($4.58 billion), Arbitrum ($3.09 billion), and Avalanche ($1.31 billion).

This stunning surge has pushed XRP to its highest levels since 2021. With its market cap now sitting at a staggering $108 billion, many are asking: Could $2 be the next stop for XRP? But what’s driving this sudden surge, and is there more to come? Keep reading to find out more about what’s in store. What’s Driving XRP’s Rally? Several factors are behind XRP’s rapid price increase. Progress in the long-running Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has boosted market confidence. Additionally, speculation about a potential XRP-based ETF and rising trading activity have further fueled the bullish trend. Adding to this momentum, it was announced that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, coinciding with Donald Trump’s expected return to office. This has raised hopes for a resolution to Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, a key factor weighing on XRP’s price for years. Ripple’s RLUSD Burn Another major development is Ripple’s decision to burn 46.67 million RLUSD tokens, as reported by Coinpedia. This move leaves only 100,000 RLUSD tokens on each blockchain, which has sparked optimism among investors. What the Technicals Tell Us Despite the recent surge, technical indicators suggest there’s still potential for further growth. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 74.8 , signaling overbought conditions. However, XRP has historically reached RSI levels above 80 before experiencing corrections, hinting that the rally may not be over yet. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), another key metric, has turned positive at 0.08, indicating increased capital inflows. While this isn’t as high as during past bullish periods, it shows growing investor confidence and supports the case for continued upward momentum. Could $2 Be the Next Milestone? If current trends persist, XRP could soon test the $2 level—a significant psychological and technical milestone. Analysts suggest that breaking this barrier could open the door to even greater gains, potentially pushing XRP toward its all-time high of $3.38. However, traders should remain cautious. A slowdown in momentum could lead to a price correction, with support levels at $1.21 and $1.05 acting as safety nets. For now, though, the outlook remains positive, with market conditions and technical signals favoring further growth. The bulls are in control, but how long can they keep the rally alive?

Bitcoin inches closer to $100k, XRP is at its 52-week, and Ethereum presents a new breakout run. As the broader market anticipates a new spike in December 2024, the first week could be filled with massive inflows. So, let’s find out the upcoming price trends of the top cryptos and figure out the chances of the next bull run. Bitcoin Targets $100k In the 1-hour chart, the BTC price trend showcases a recovered rally, giving a trendline breakout. Overcoming a long-coming bearish influence, the BTC price has surpassed the $97,600 barrier to nearly reach the $99,000 mark. Bitcoin-Price-Analysis-30th-Nov-2024 Tradingview However, the higher price rejection led to a quick retest of the broken trendline. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $96,395. The BTC found support at the 50-EMA of the 1-hour chart and is now taking a positive test reversal. The bullish recovery has led to a golden crossover and a positive alignment of the 50, 100, and 200-EMA in the 1-hour chart. As the post-retest reversal gains momentum with four consecutive bullish candles, the MACD and signal lines are on the verge of giving a positive crossover. Based on the Fibonacci levels, a post-retest reversal sustaining dominance above the 78.6% Fibonacci level could surpass the $100,000 mark in the first week of December. Furthermore, the price trend could reach the $104,584 peak by next weekend. On the flip side, consolidation at the $96,000 mark could result in a bearish outcome and reach the $95,000 support level. Will Ethereum (ETH) Price Cross $4,000? The Ethereum price trend is showcasing a rising wedge pattern in the 4-hour chart. With the higher high and higher low trend facing a massive supply from a local resistance trendline, the Ethereum price trend is approaching a bottleneck. ETH Price Analysis 30th Nov 2024 Tradingview Currently, it is analyzing the overhead trendline and trading at $3,667. In supporting the upside trends, the MACD and signal lines are merged despite the consolidation range and could regain positive alignment.

With this recent purchase, its total Bitcoin holdings now exceed $5 billion, reinforcing its status as a dominant force in institutional Bitcoin investment. This bold move has signalled growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, especially with macroeconomic conditions favouring digital assets. However, MicroStrategy isn’t the only standout in the blockchain world. As Bitcoin maintains its stronghold, innovative projects like FX Guys (FXGuys) are pushing the boundaries of decentralised finance (DeFi) with unique reward opportunities. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE FXGuys: A Rising Star in DeFi FX Guys is gaining traction as one of the high-potential altcoins poised for massive growth. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, FXGuys has raised over $2.6 million, with its $FXG token priced at just $0.04. However, FX Guys is distinct in its multifaceted reward ecosystem, particularly its Trade2Earn program. The Trade2Earn program is a game-changer, allowing traders to earn $FXG tokens with every trade they execute. This incentive increases trading activity, bolstering liquidity and providing users with tangible benefits. Unlike many proprietary trading companies, FX Guys combines crypto trading with innovative DeFi mechanics, making it a top contender among the top DeFi coins .

The growing attention on high-potential altcoins could see the FXguys break through its presale valuation, with analysts predicting a significant upside as adoption accelerates. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion: A Dual Opportunity for Growth While MicroStrategy’s $5 billion Bitcoin bet underscores the growing institutional appetite for crypto, projects like FX Guys offer a unique opportunity for retail investors to benefit from decentralized finance innovations.

From VeChain’s transformative strides in sustainability and tokenisation to Toncoin’s symbiotic relationship with Telegram’s massive user base, blockchain’s real-world applications are becoming impossible to ignore. Yet, it’s not just about the giants; emerging players like Qubetics ($TICS) are carving a niche, offering bold new solutions to longstanding problems in the decentralised landscape. What sets $TICS apart? It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, designed to tackle privacy and transparency issues plaguing traditional platforms. Its decentralised architecture is set to revolutionise how investors engage with blockchain technology, offering a presale opportunity that’s already attracting thousands. Let’s explore why Qubetics, Toncoin, and VeChain deserve a spot on your radar as the top altcoins to watch for December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Privacy Pioneer and Presale Sensation Privacy is no longer optional in today’s interconnected world—it’s essential. Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, has privacy baked into its DNA, combining decentralised architecture with cutting-edge cryptography to protect users. Imagine this: as an investor, you log into a platform that doesn’t sell your data, doesn’t track your activity, and lets you make secure financial decisions. That’s Qubetics in action. Whether you’re navigating the volatile crypto market or making microtransactions, $TICS provides the peace of mind you’ve always needed but rarely received. Take, for example, a tech enthusiast who invests $10,000 during the ongoing presale at $0.025 per token. That investment secures 400,000 $TICS tokens. So far, Qubetics’ presale has captivated over 4,800 holders, raising $3.6 million and selling 239 million tokens. With prices set to rise 10% this weekend, time is of the essence for those eager to jump aboard this train. But it’s not just about profits. Qubetics’ decentralised design makes blockchain navigation intuitive and secure, tackling the trust issues that have plagued the space for years. If you’re searching for altcoins to watch for December 2024, $TICS stands as both a game-changer and a goldmine. Toncoin: Riding Telegram’s Wave of Innovation Toncoin’s integration with Telegram has been nothing short of revolutionary. The messaging app, used by nearly 900 million people, introduced crypto payments via Telegram Wallet earlier this year, pushing Toncoin to the forefront of decentralised finance. With features like cross-border money transfers and digital identity solutions, Toncoin has become synonymous with real-world blockchain applications. Let’s paint a scenario: imagine a freelancer working with clients globally. In the past, cross-border payments were a nightmare of fees and delays. With Toncoin’s ecosystem, payments are instant, cost-effective, and secure, making it a no-brainer for businesses and individuals alike. This synergy between Telegram and Toncoin is why it’s one of the top altcoins to watch for December 2024. Despite its price fluctuations—hovering between $5.1 and $5.5—Toncoin has displayed remarkable resilience, boasting weekly and monthly growth rates of 4.91% and 6.85%, respectively. As of late November, its value crossed the $6 mark, with analysts optimistic about its upward trajectory. The key lies in increasing buying interest. Should demand continue to grow, Toncoin could easily shatter its current range, offering investors a lucrative opportunity. Toncoin’s reliance on Telegram’s ecosystem isn’t just a partnership; it’s a masterstroke in blockchain adoption. It seamlessly bridges the gap between crypto enthusiasts and everyday users, proving that decentralisation can be practical and user-friendly. If you’ve ever wondered which altcoins to watch for December 2024, Toncoin’s Telegram-fuelled rise provides a compelling answer. VeChain: Championing $42 Trillion in Sustainability and Tokenisation When it comes to blending sustainability and tokenisation, VeChain isn’t playing small. Its mission—“With Web3 for Better”—underpins a bold vision: advancing a $26 trillion sustainability market and a $16 trillion tokenisation economy. This Layer-1 platform for smart contracts has been quietly building an empire of enterprise dApps since its 2015 inception, partnering with giants like Walmart China and BMW. Consider VeChain’s work with Walmart China. By using blockchain technology to trace food origins, the company ensures quality and safety for consumers, tackling the pervasive issue of supply chain opacity. Similarly, VeChain’s collaboration with BMW enhances supply chain transparency, reducing counterfeit risks in the automotive sector. These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re real-world applications with measurable impact. In May 2024, VeChain launched its Marketplace-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform, ushering in a new era of digital asset listing and ‘phygitals’—physical items with digital twins. This innovation alone has solidified its place as a leader in the tokenisation movement. Investors looking for altcoins to watch for December 2024 should take note: VeChain isn’t just about today’s gains; it’s about shaping tomorrow’s economy. From transforming agricultural waste into climate solutions with Carboneers to boosting ESG financing with Dimitra, VeChain is tackling sustainability challenges head-on. Analysts predict VET’s price could rise significantly as these initiatives gain traction. Whether you’re an environmental advocate or a crypto investor, VeChain’s progress is a win-win, making it one of December 2024’s standout altcoins. The Clock’s Ticking—Act Now! The cryptocurrency landscape is alive with opportunity this December. Whether it’s Qubetics ($TICS) rewriting the rules of privacy, Toncoin leveraging Telegram’s massive reach, or VeChain spearheading sustainability and tokenisation, these altcoins to watch for December 2024 offer a unique mix of innovation and investment potential. But timing is everything. The $TICS presale won’t last forever , and with prices set to jump, now’s the moment to seize the day. Dive into these projects, explore their ecosystems, and make your move. Your portfolio—and the future of blockchain—depends on it.

The firm’s latest analysis highlights the importance of the $98,400 resistance level for bullish momentum, as well as potential support levels that could trigger significant market reactions. According to MarktQuant, the biggest challenge for Bitcoin is the resistance at $98,400. The price needs to break out of this level to resume the uptrend. Failure to do so could lead to a pullback and potentially test support in the $90,000-$92,000 range. BTC price is trading at $97,500 at the time of writing. Related News: Wells Fargo Predicts How Many Times the Fed Will Cut Interest Rates in 2025 MarktQuant expects fresh buying interest to emerge around $90,000-$92,000 in the event of a pullback. This range also represents a critical area for futures traders, especially those using high leverage (around 16.67x or higher), and they will likely place stop-loss orders here. According to the analytics firm, if Bitcoin were to fall into this zone, the market could experience a drop of around 6.5%, which could trigger significant liquidations and increase volatility. MarktQuant’s analysis also highlighted significant liquidation clusters. The firm noted significant movement in the $94,000-$96,000 range, where leveraged positions, particularly long liquidations, are concentrated. These areas act as magnets for market volatility as prices approach these thresholds. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, could positively impact XRP’s price if launched soon, but its approval by the NYDFS remains uncertain. A Very Special Christmas for the XRP Army? Ripple’s XRP has been making the headlines in the past few weeks, registering an impressive price increase and outperforming its rivals. On November 29, it reached a three-year high of $1.67, while some analysts believe the bull run could take it to a new all-time high before Christmas. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko We decided to poke the AI brains of ChatGPT and see if it shares that thesis. The popular chatbot claimed such a scenario is unlikely but not entirely out of the cards. However, surpassing $3.84 (the ATH registered in 2018) will depend on multiple factors. Perhaps the most important is the shift in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not long ago, the current Chairman, Gary Gensler, confirmed he will step down on January 20, 2025. This has led to speculation that the next leader will be pro-crypto and not hamper the industry’s advancement with constant legal battles. To the uninitiated, the Commission filed countless lawsuits against cryptocurrency businesses over the years. Among those is the legal tussle versus Ripple, which has been ongoing for almost four years. According to ChatGPT, though, XRP might experience a significant pump once Gensler vacate his post. It is unlikely that he will do so before Christmas this year. Another essential element is the overall market sentiment. The AI-powered chatbot assumed that Ripple’s native token could head north if the entire cryptocurrency sector thrived. Despite a recent correction, the market’s condition remains quite bullish, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading well above $95,000 and Ethereum (ETH) tapping a six-month high of almost $3,700. Last but not least, ChatGPT reminded about XRP’s historical performance, noting that the asset is capable of charting double and even triple-digit gains in a short period of time . The Potential Role of RLUSD Another factor that may boost the valuation of XRP in the near future is the eventual launch of Ripple’s stablecoin – RLUSD. Earlier this week, X user Vet said almost all tokens have been burned , sparking rumors that the product is ready to see the light of day. Nonetheless, the community will have to wait for approval from the NYDFS. Monica Long (president of Ripple) recently stated : “It’s up to them. They are reviewing our trust application. It’s going to be in their hands when they are approving it.” The post We Asked ChatGPT if Ripple (XRP) Can Hit a New ATH Before Christmas appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-11-30 08:33:30

The digital asset has seen a remarkable resurgence recently, and analysts are predicting a massive rally in its immediate future. Technical analysis of the asset reveals several key metrics that support this bullish outlook. Despite some bearish signs, it might pull through and smash through milestones investors have been waiting for years to see. The asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a critical momentum indicator, currently sits in the neutral zone around 53. Although it could go in either direction, recent price performance leans toward continued bullish momentum. The RSI metric offers crucial context for understanding market momentum. Typically ranging from 0 to 100, this indicator helps traders assess whether an asset is potentially overvalued or undervalued. Image Source: TradingView XRP RSI During XRP’s recent rally between November 21 and 23, the RSI exceeded 70, signaling an overbought condition that typically precedes a potential price correction. The current reading of 53.2 suggests a stabilization phase, indicating an absence of excessive buying or selling pressure, and experts believe a big pump is coming . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More Technical Indicators Point to Bullish Momentum Complementing the RSI analysis, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) provides additional insights into capital movements. XRP’s CMF has recently transitioned to a slightly negative -0.05, down from a positive 0.10 during its price peak. Though not yet indicating a significant market reversal, this subtle shift suggests a marginal increase in selling pressure. The metric reflects a nuanced change in investor sentiment, with capital flows showing signs of potential redistribution. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines present another critical perspective on XRP’s market dynamics. XRP’s long and short-term moving averages are currently bullish, but the narrowing gap between them hints at potentially diminishing upward momentum, suggesting investors should remain vigilant. However, the overall market is bullish. These positive indicators pushed the digital asset to a multi-year high of $1.7664, and sustained buying pressure could push it further. If the asset cannot sustain its momentum, it could fall toward support levels at $1.27, with an extended correction to around $1.05. However, a well-respected trader recently predicted a massive rally if the digital asset can break through its $1.96 peak from April 2021. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $1.92, with a 19% price increase over the past 24 hours. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Operating without a central authority or bank account, XRP supports seamless currency transfers with resistance to censorship and counterfeiting. Launched with a supply of 100 billion tokens, 80 billion were allocated to Ripple to enhance development and network liquidity. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP aims to change digital finance by enabling efficient and secure global transactions. Cardano: A scalable and eco-friendly blockchain for smart contracts Cardano is a blockchain platform tailored for smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, focusing on sustainability and scalability. Powered by its native cryptocurrency, ADA, users can store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano employs Ouroboros, an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system, and features a two-layer architecture—one for transactions and another for smart contracts—allowing it to process up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. Its introduction of native tokens ensures secure, low-cost smart contract interactions. With its commitment to innovation and efficiency, Cardano stands as a key player in the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

President-elect Donald Trump has announced massive tariffs: 60% on Chinese imports and 10-20% on imports from other countries, including Europe. Lagarde warned that these measures, if unchallenged or met with a knee-jerk reaction, could start a global trade war that would benefit no one. Trump’s tariff plans are not entirely clear. While he revealed the numbers, he left out crucial details such as how they’ll be applied, which sectors they’ll target, or whether exceptions will be made. “We need to understand the scope,” Lagarde said. She compared targeted tariffs on products like electric vehicles to broad tariffs that would hit everything crossing U.S. borders. This lack of clarity makes it tough for Europe to predict the exact fallout. Europe’s response and the danger of escalation Lagarde has urged Europe to avoid falling into the tit-for-tat pattern that often characterizes trade disputes. She highlighted Trump’s style of negotiating, pointing to the 10-20% range as evidence that the U.S. might be open to discussions. “If you announce a range, you’re inviting negotiation,” she said. The European Commission has already started preparing for potential tariffs. Lagarde acknowledged this but warned against relying on what she called a “cheque book strategy” — throwing money at the problem. Instead, she suggested that Europe could make concessions by offering to buy more American products, such as liquefied natural gas or military equipment. This would show a willingness to cooperate without escalating tensions. A trade war, Lagarde said, would hurt everyone. GDP across the board would shrink, and no country would come out a winner. The impact wouldn’t stop at the U.S. and Europe. China, already the main target of Trump’s tariff plans, would likely reroute its exports to other markets, including Europe. This “rerouting scenario” would put extra pressure on European industries, which are already vulnerable. For now, Lagarde thinks free trade with China should remain reciprocal and beneficial for both sides. But if Trump’s policies disrupt this balance, Europe might need to consider defensive measures. Inflation, GDP, and the ripple effects Lagarde also addressed how these tariffs could affect Europe’s economy, particularly inflation and growth. She admitted the effects are tough to predict because they depend on the scope, duration, and exact targets of the tariffs. In the short term, she said, the tariffs might lead to slight inflation. But a trade war would ultimately drag down GDP and destabilize global markets. Inflation isn’t the only concern. Lagarde pointed out how uncertainty around tariffs has already shaken consumer and business confidence. Investment decisions are being delayed, and consumption has taken a hit. The ECB factored these risks into its September economic forecasts and will do so again in December. But if the situation escalates, the damage could go beyond current predictions. China’s role and Europe’s challenges China’s position in this trade dispute is another headache for Europe. Lagarde highlighted the risk of Chinese goods flooding European markets as they become less competitive in the U.S. This would disrupt local industries, forcing Europe to make tough decisions about whether to impose its own protective tariffs. Europe’s strategy in dealing with Trump’s tariffs will also set the tone for its economic future. Lagarde pointed to past examples where Europe avoided retaliation and chose negotiation instead. When Trump threatened steel tariffs in the past, the European Commission opted to sit down and talk. It worked. Lagarde suggested that the same approach could be successful now. Beyond tariffs, Lagarde used this moment to push for deeper reforms within Europe, especially the completion of the long-discussed capital markets union. For years, European leaders have talked about integrating financial markets across member states, but progress has been painfully slow. Lagarde argued that a fully functional capital markets union would make Europe more resilient to external shocks like U.S. tariffs. “Money matters,” she said, stressing the need for a single supervisory authority to replace the current system of 27 national regulators. This would mirror the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S., streamlining financial oversight and boosting investor confidence. Lagarde called this a “catalyst” for broader reforms, including better securitization and increased space on banks’ balance sheets to finance innovation. But Lagarde did acknowledge the political challenges of uniting Europe’s fragmented financial system . She cited past resistance to central supervision but noted that similar efforts, like the Single Supervisory Mechanism for banks, eventually succeeded. “It’s laborious, but it’s working,” she said. Europe’s falling competitiveness The region’s competitiveness has been slipping for decades, particularly in tech and finance. While the U.S. and China dominate artificial intelligence, Europe is lagging behind. Lagarde said Europe has the talent but struggles to keep its best minds from leaving for American or Chinese companies. She urged leaders to create an environment where innovation can thrive and companies can grow without looking overseas for funding. The financial sector is another weak spot. European banks, once on par with their American counterparts, have fallen far behind. Lagarde noted that the average European bank is now one-tenth the size of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs. Cross-border mergers, like the proposed UniCredit-Commerzbank deal, could help, but they often face political resistance. Without stronger banks, Europe risks falling further behind in global finance . Lagarde also took aim at Europe’s regulatory system, which she said places an excessive burden on businesses. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, struggle with the sheer volume of paperwork required to comply with environmental and other regulations. When asked about the U.S. administration’s push for deregulation and the stock market’s optimistic response, Lagarde acknowledged the possibility of market adjustments but dismissed fears of a financial crisis. “There has been a little bit of it and there will be more,” she said, referring to potential price corrections. However, she made it clear that deregulation alone wouldn’t trigger a repeat of the global financial crisis, adding confidently, “We stand ready anyway.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Economy|ECB|EUR|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-11-30 08:48:09

Discover three altcoins with potential to turn a $200 investment into millions by 2025 in the evolving crypto market. Table of Contents CYBRO Presale Surpasses $5.5M: The gateway to multichain DeFi success XRP: Transforming digital transactions with borderless efficiency Cardano: A scalable, sustainable blockchain for smart contracts Conclusion Imagine turning a modest sum into a fortune within a few years. Opportunities exist in the crypto market where a small investment today might grow exponentially by 2025. This article delves into three promising altcoins that could be the keys to transforming $200 into a multi-million dollar portfolio. CYBRO Presale Surpasses $5.5M: The gateway to multichain DeFi success CYBRO’s exclusive token presale has surpassed $5.5 million, attracting the interest of crypto whales and savvy investors alike. As a next-gen DeFi platform, CYBRO offers a unique chance to boost crypto returns across multiple blockchains. Currently, in its 8th stage of a 10-stage presale, investors have a limited window to grab CYBRO tokens at just $0.045 before the Token Generation Event (TGE). With only two stages left, this is one of the last opportunities to buy in before the anticipated price surge, with experts projecting an ROI of up to 1200% — making CYBRO an incredible investment prospect in the DeFi space. You might also like: Early Solana investors who made $150m on SOL rise now bet big on CYBRO Earn more with CYBRO points & airdrops Beyond token ownership, CYBRO has introduced an innovative Points system to amplify investor incentives. Holders of these Points gain automatic access to CYBRO Airdrops, with token allocations directly linked to the Points they hold. Each week, the platform distributes up to 1 million Points, which investors can earn through their positions in CYBRO’s DeFi Vaults, making every investment even more rewarding. Exclusive benefits await CYBRO token holders CYBRO token holders enjoy a variety of exclusive perks, including high-yield staking rewards, access to airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a comprehensive insurance program for added security. These benefits, combined with its unique multichain capabilities, make CYBRO an exceptional opportunity for those looking to grow their crypto portfolio. A limited-time opportunity to invest in CYBRO With just 21% of the total tokens allocated for the presale and over 100 million tokens already claimed, the opportunity to get in early is quickly disappearing. For investors ready to secure a stake in a project designed to be truly transformative, CYBRO offers a one-in-a-million chance. XRP: Transforming digital transactions with borderless efficiency XRP , powered by the XRP Ledger, is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed for fast, secure, and low-cost global transactions. It operates without central authority, enabling irreversible transfers and seamless currency exchanges without requiring a bank account. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP began with 100 billion tokens, 80 billion of which were allocated to Ripple for ecosystem development. Ripple, formerly OpenCoin Inc., leverages XRP to enhance liquidity and support its network, with 55 billion XRP held in escrow for controlled release. Named to signify “ripple credits,” XRP is engineered to facilitate smooth and efficient payment transfers worldwide. Cardano: A scalable, sustainable blockchain for smart contracts Cardano is an advanced blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling developers to create DeFi apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, functions like Ethereum’s ETH, allowing users to store value, process payments, and stake on the network. Cardano utilizes Ouroboros, an energy-efficient proof-of-stake system, in contrast to energy-intensive proof-of-work models. The platform features a dual-layer architecture: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design supports scalability, processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second, while its native tokens enable secure, low-cost interactions, driving efficiency and growth in blockchain technology. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like XRP and ADA may offer some growth, their short-term potential is limited. CYBRO , however, presents a remarkable opportunity for investors seeking to enhance their earnings. This advanced DeFi platform uses AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to maximize returns. Offering attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO ensures an exceptional user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Its commitment to transparency, compliance, and quality distinguishes it in the market. The strong interest from prominent crypto investors and influencers highlights CYBRO’s promise as a standout project. For those looking to expand their crypto portfolios, CYBRO represents a compelling option.

Data suggest that interest in Layer 1 blockchain solutions has soared, as these platforms provide the foundation for dApps and Smart Contracts, intensifying the race for L1 dominance. Unlikely Cryptos Take Center Stage According to the latest report by CoinGecko, Mantra (OM) has achieved a staggering 7,035.2% increase. This surge is partly driven by its partnership with Zand, a UAE-based digital bank enabling compliant tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) under Dubai’s VARA framework. Additionally, AIOZ Network (AIOZ) posted an impressive 427.6% YTD gain, fueled by the growing adoption of its decentralized content delivery network and ongoing ecosystem advancements. Sui (SUI) too secured its place among the top gainers with a 388.2% YTD rise, owing to the dApp launches that maximize its scalability, and developer-friendly tools. “Coming out of the trenches, 2024 has been a thrilling year for Layer 1 (L1) blockchains, with tokens skyrocketing by over 7,000% since January. In the fast-moving crypto space, a few unexpected tokens are redeeming the top performer spot this year.” Bitcoin, Ethereum: The OGs Remain Strong While mid- and small-cap Layer 1 tokens have experienced explosive growth, major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have proven to be resilient investments. Bitcoin demonstrated a solid 112.9% Year-to-Date (YTD) increase, while Ethereum gained 34.9%, though it lagged behind its smaller counterparts. Over the years, Ethereum’s dominance has slowly diminished with the rise of Layer 2 solutions and other competing blockchains, despite the introduction of the Ethereum Spot ETF in the US. Even so, ETH still managed to outperform the S&P 500, which saw a 24.8% increase in 2024. Meanwhile, Solana rebounded strongly from the impact of FTX’s 2022 collapse, rising 134.3% YTD. Most of its growth came in 2023, driven by memecoin excitement, as its price surged from $15 to $120. This trend was also reflected in networks like Tron (TRX), which rose 85.5% YTD. Toncoin (TON), capitalizing on its integration with Telegram to host dApps, saw an impressive 136.2% YTD increase, particularly as tap-to-earn games gained immense popularity within the app. The post Underdog Cryptos Shock the Market with Massive Gains in 2024’s Explosive Rally appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum (ETH) Price|Real World Assets (RWA)|Solana (SOL) Price,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIOZ,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-11-30 08:53:16

US users can now trade Solana and Pepe against the US dollar and the Euro through four spot trading pairs: SOL/USD, SOL/EUR, PEPE/USD, and PEPE/EUR on Bitstamp. Spotlight on Solana and PEPE Bitstamp’s decision to list PEPE and SOL aligns with a trend of increasing adoption among major exchanges. Notably, the recent listing of PEPE on Coinbase and Robinhood has amplified interest in the meme coin, while Solana’s expanding ecosystem continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain technology. With a robust ecosystem supporting decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming, and meme coins, Solana has gained popularity among developers and investors alike. Its native token, SOL, recently hit a record-breaking $263, reflecting a staggering 305% annual growth. Pepe, on the other hand, has emerged as one of the most buzzworthy meme coins on the Ethereum blockchain. Its price has experienced sharp rises in recent months, benefiting from a favorable market environment and new exchange listings. By introducing these tokens to US customers, Bitstamp aims to tap into a broader user base while meeting the evolving demands of the crypto community. Market reactions The listing announcement has generated positive momentum for both tokens. SOL’s price surged to $247 before retracting to $241.92 at press time, while PEPE saw a 6% increase, climbing to $0.000021 shortly after the news broke. The listing of these tokens underscores Bitstamp’s commitment to offering a diverse range of assets, capitalizing on the growing demand for both established blockchain projects like Solana and niche market favorites like PEPE. The new listings not only enhance the exchange’s asset portfolio but also position Bitstamp as a key player in facilitating access to innovative blockchain projects for US traders. The listings follow Bitstamp’s earlier achievements, including securing a MiFID Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license from European regulators. The exchange also holds regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services as a money transmitter and virtual currency business and continues to strengthen its compliance credentials.

The upcoming rules require crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to register for AML compliance. AML Framework The deadline for mandatory AML registration for crypto companies was initially January 1, 2025, but the FSC has pushed it forward by a month. In a November 28 statement , the regulator said that overseas entities offering virtual asset services in Taiwan must establish a local presence and complete the AML registration process under the Company Law. Currently, 26 crypto providers are approved to operate in the country, but all of them, registered or not, must comply with the updated AML requirements. To assist with compliance, the FSC issued a checklist to help the platforms identify suspicious activities. They were instructed to monitor customer details such as names, bank account information, IP locations, and account usage patterns. Additionally, they also have to look for unusual transaction activities, including frequent changes to account information, splitting funds, and using multiple accounts from the same IP address. Non-compliance could result in severe penalties, including fines of up to NT$5 million ($153,700) and imprisonment for as long as two years. This regulatory push follows the FSC’s decision to penalize two local exchanges, MaiCoin and BitoPro, for multiple violations. On Monday, the exchanges were fined NT$1.5 million each for non-compliance with AML regulations. According to the agency, the crypto firms did not improve customer due diligence, lacked sufficient knowledge of customers’ wealth sources, failed to keep adequate transaction records, and were ineffective in identifying suspicious transaction patterns. A Balanced Approach Taiwan has been actively advancing cryptocurrency regulations as part of its strategy to position itself as a global leader in the digital asset space. In September of last year, the FSC introduced ten guiding principles for VASPs to create self-regulatory frameworks. According to local media reports , these principles are designed to enhance transparency through improved information disclosure, establish clear standards for the listing and delisting of virtual assets, and ensure the proper separation and custody of client and company funds. More recently, it revealed plans to introduce a registration system requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the Taiwanese government by September 2025. While the government has tightened its oversight, it is also introducing measures to encourage growth in the sector. Last month, the Financial watchdog granted professional investors access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to foreign digital assets. Additionally, the regulator is preparing a pilot program for institutional cryptocurrency custody, with applications set to open in early 2025. Three private banks have already expressed interest in participating in the initiative.

Despite liquidations exceeding $500 million during the downturn, the event did not trigger the cascading sell-offs seen in previous market cycles. Bitcoin Open Interest Resets: Is $100,000 Next? The flagship cryptocurrency seems ready to make another attempt at the $100,000 milestone. According to crypto analyst Byzantine General, the recent BTC price pullback reset open interest to levels last observed when the asset first touched $90,000. Critically, Bitcoin held support around $90,875, signaling the potential establishment of a new consolidation phase before the next upward move. Byzantine General stated that BTC is poised to “take out the local highs and potentially take a stab at piercing 100k,” noting: A lot of the passive supply already got taken out in the previous attempt, so there’s a pretty good chance that we will see 100k soon. Byzantine General’s thoughts were echoed by prominent crypto trader Jelle, who said that $100,000 for BTC was “in sight.” The trader shared the following chart where BTC appears to be breaking through a downward-sloping trendline. At the same time, it is also forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern – typically a bullish indicator. Another crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades agreed that Bitcoin is within reaching distance of the $100,000 mark. As previously reported , some analysts believe that BTC is mirroring its price action from 2023, which could see the asset’s price reach as high as $200,000 by early 2025. Healthy Corrections Essential To Fuel Long-Term Growth Bitcoin was trading just above $69,000 on November 6 before surging past its previous ATH and reaching its current price of $97,150 – a staggering 40.8% gain in less than a month. However, such a rapid rally could signal an overextension. A slight correction to the low $90,000 level might just have been what was required for BTC to have a more sustained price momentum going forward. Further, it gives time to retail investors – who have been missing from the current market rally – to enter the market and potentially increase the demand-side pressure. The recent price pullback also cooled down the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index from extreme greed to more moderate levels, setting the stage for a more organic and sustainable rally across the cryptocurrency market. Speaking of long-term forecasts, Pantera Capital founder and managing partner Dan Morehead recently predicted an ambitious price target of $740,000 BTC by 2028. At press time, BTC trades at $97,150, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Price Forecast|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Liquidation|Crypto trader|cryptocurrency|digital asset|pantera capital,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 09:00:00

On November 29, spot Ether ETFs brought in a jaw-dropping $332.92 million in daily inflows, blowing past Bitcoin ETFs for the first time. It wasn’t even close. This milestone shows how Ether is not just a “second-best” crypto anymore—it’s carving out its own story in the world of ETFs. Ethereum Steps Up Big Time So, here’s the kicker: only three of the nine active Ether ETFs were responsible for this massive inflow. Crazy, right? Leading the charge was BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which brought in roughly $250 million—talk about stealing the show. Since launching in July, ETHA has stacked up over $2 billion, solidifying its place as a favorite among investors. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH added $79 million, and Grayscale chipped in $3.4 million. Not huge compared to ETHA, but still solid contributions. On the price side, Ethereum is holding steady at $3,695. That’s a 3.79% gain in the last 24 hours, with trading volume also up over 11%. Sure, it’s still about 24% below its 2021 all-time high of $4,891, but there’s a sense that the momentum could push it higher—if it can crack that $3,730 resistance level. Bitcoin Takes a Back Seat For once, Bitcoin wasn’t the main attraction. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $320 million in inflows on the same day, which is impressive but not enough to outshine Ether’s big win. And here’s the interesting part: only six out of twelve Bitcoin ETFs actually got inflows. Maybe the tide is turning? This isn’t just about one day, either. Over the past week, Ether ETFs have been quietly dominating. Between November 22 and 27, they raked in nearly $225 million, while Bitcoin ETFs only managed $35 million, mostly because of a big outflow on November 25. What’s Next So, what does this mean?

Combining meme culture with sports enthusiasm, XYZ aims to outperform previous tokens’ impressive gains. XYZVerse: The meme coin combining sports and profits As meme coins dominate the crypto scene, XYZVerse emerges as a must-have token for investors seeking the next big breakout. XYZ isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a gateway to a sports-fueled crypto ecosystem designed to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports while delivering explosive growth potential. Imagine the intensity of Polymarket’s $1 billion trading volume during the U.S. presidential election, amplified by the viral hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports.

Predictions for 2024 position XYZVerse as a top contender in the meme coin arena, with a staggering 14,900% growth target by the Token Generation Event (TGE).

Don’t wait for the crowd to storm the field—position yourself now for a front-row seat to the next crypto success story. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) , inspired by Dogecoin, emerged in August 2020 with a new twist on meme coins. Created by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. Starting with a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. His donation of SHIB to the India Covid Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the supply boosted SHIB’s profile in the crypto world. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB leverages Ethereum’s capabilities, enabling decentralized apps like ShibaSwap, its own exchange. Plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance showcase SHIB’s potential beyond being a meme coin. With growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), SHIB’s Ethereum integration positions it well within these trends. In the current market, SHIB’s active development and strong community support may attract those interested in emerging Ethereum projects. However, as with any cryptocurrency, buyers should exercise caution and do thorough research. Pepe PEPE is a memecoin launched on Ethereum to honor Pepe the Frog, the internet meme created by Matt Furie. It aims to join the likes of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin as a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With no taxes and a candid approach about its lack of utility, PEPE keeps things simple, appealing to meme enthusiasts. In late April to May 2023, its market cap soared to $1.6 billion, turning early investors into millionaires and building a strong community. This surge sparked a “memecoin season,” with other memecoins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes getting listed on CoinMarketCap, trending on Twitter, and securing spots on centralized exchanges, aiming for a “meme takeover.” As the crypto market anticipates the Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE showcases the potential of memecoins. Its rapid rise and dedicated community set it apart from other memecoins. For those fascinated by the meme coin trend, PEPE offers an interesting opportunity in the current market cycle. Bonk BONK, a new player in the crypto world, is turning heads. This Solana-based memecoin, with its Shiba Inu mascot, aims to shake up the scene by shifting power from big investors to the community. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK’s value soared over 100%. What’s more, it handed out half of its total supply to participants in Solana’s NFTs and DeFi projects. By mid-December 2023, it had become the third-largest memecoin by market cap and saw an astonishing year-to-date growth of over 10,000%. Despite the challenges of a huge supply and the wild nature of memecoins, BONK shows promise. It’s becoming a key part of Solana’s ecosystem, even launching its own decentralized exchange called BonkSwap. This integration with a booming network of decentralized apps sets it apart. In the current market cycle, where community-driven projects are gaining traction, BONK stands out as an attractive option. Compared to other memecoins, its strong community focus and real use cases could make it a noteworthy contender in the crypto space. SPX6900 In a digital world where numbers hold immense power, SPX6900 has emerged from the depths of internet culture as the newest meme token capturing everyone’s attention. Born with the audacious goal to surpass the S&P 500, SPX6900 sets its sights on a staggering $69 trillion market cap. The logic is simple yet bold: if 6900 is greater than 500, then SPX6900 must be superior to traditional financial instruments. In a market buzzing with innovation, SPX6900’s playful approach resonates with a generation that values creativity and disruption. Powered by the belief that bigger numbers mean better investments, it taps into the same spirit that propelled other meme coins like Dogecoin to fame. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream attention, SPX6900 stands out with its ambitious vision and community-driven momentum. Whether it will achieve its sky-high goals remains an open question, but it undoubtedly adds a new flavor to the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion Though SHIB, PEPE, BONK, and SPX are promising, XYZVerse merges meme culture with sports, aiming for 20,000% growth, making it a standout in the bull run.

NFT scams, including wash trading and other manipulative practices, threaten the integrity of digital art marketplaces. Understanding these risks and learning how to protect oneself is crucial if you are into this space. Here goes a deep dive into common threats and some practical ways of safeguarding your investments. What is NFT Wash Trading? NFT wash trading is a form of market manipulation where individuals repeatedly buy and sell the same NFT to give the appearance of value appreciation. The idea behind it is to create an illusion of high demand for the purpose of driving up prices artificially. This tactic misleads potential buyers into thinking the asset is more valuable or desirable than it really is. Key characteristics of NFT wash trading include: Repeated transactions: The same NFT changes hands frequently between the same parties. Inflated values: Transactions occur at prices far above the market average. Fake demand: Activity makes the NFT seem like a popular item, tricking buyers. This practice damages NFT market integrity by distorting genuine price signals and eroding trust in marketplaces. Understanding Other Common NFT Scams Setting aside the wash trading, the field of NFTs is teeming with scams targeting hapless users. Some common perils include the following: Rug pulls: Where a creator sells NFTs or tokens and then pulls out, never to materialize any of the roadmap promised; Phishing attacks: Fraudsters sending fake links or emails, hoping that someone would lose their wallet credentials; or just outright faking artworks and selling them as being the creations of themselves as some well-known creators. Pump-and-dump schemes: Bad actors inflate the price of an NFT and then sell their holdings, leaving buyers holding valueless assets. These scams make scam awareness in NFTs and thorough research a must when buying. How to Spot NFT Wash Trading and Scams For protection, knowing how to identify suspicious activity is paramount. Watch for the following warning signs: Red Flags Why It Matters Unusually high transaction volume May indicate wash trading. Check if the same wallet addresses are involved repeatedly. Extremely high prices for similar items Overpriced NFTs may signal fake demand or market manipulation. Lack of creator verification Unverified creators can more easily sell fake NFTs or disappear after rug pulls. Sudden spikes in activity Rapid price increases can be signs of pump-and-dump schemes. Requests for private wallet keys No legitimate platform or artist will ever ask for your private keys. By staying alert to these signs, you can better navigate the NFT marketplace securely. Steps to Protect Yourself from NFT Scams You don’t need to avoid NFTs altogether, but taking precautions can save you from becoming a victim. Here are practical ways to protect yourself: Verify creators: Only purchase NFTs from verified accounts or well-known platforms. Research transactions: Use blockchain explorers to analyze transaction history and look for repeated trades. Use secure wallets : That are able to protect your assets with their strong security features. Be careful with links: Never click on any unsolicited links since this may be phishing attempts. Understand market trends: Know what is a normal price for NFTs of the same categor Wash Trading Prevention and Market Integrity Ensuring NFT marketplace security is not only an individual responsibility but also a collective effort. Platforms and regulators are working to counteract fraudulent practices and improve trust. Some strategies include: Implementing stricter verification processes: NFT marketplaces can require ID verification for sellers and buyers. Using AI tools: Advanced algorithms can detect unusual transaction patterns indicative of wash trading. Educating users: Awareness campaigns help users recognize scams and protect their wallets. Monitoring and penalizing offenders: Platforms should blacklist wallets or impose penalties on users caught engaging in wash trading. Why Wash Trading and Scams Persist Despite these efforts, NFT fraud continues to be an issue. This is largely due to: Anonymity of blockchain: Users are allowed to create multiple wallets, making it difficult to track fraudulent activities. Lack of regulation: The NFT space is still largely unregulated, which provides opportunities for scammers. High profits for fraudsters: The potential gain is often much more than the risk of being caught. Understanding these challenges highlights why personal vigilance is critical. Best Practices for Safe NFT Trading Follow these best practices to minimize your risk: Tip Description Research creators and projects Check social media, reviews, and community discussions to verify legitimacy. Use reputable marketplaces Stick to established platforms with a history of reliable service and good security measures. Diversify your investments Avoid putting all your funds into one NFT or collection to reduce potential losses. Avoid impulsive purchases Scammers often create urgency to rush decisions. Take your time to assess any deal. Stay informed about trends and risks Regularly read about new scams and emerging security features in the NFT world. These practices can help you navigate the NFT space confidently. The Role of Community in Fighting NFT Scams The NFT community also plays a vital role in combating fraud. Sharing information about scams, reporting suspicious activity, and educating newcomers are all ways to contribute. Platforms can also benefit from user feedback to improve security measures and transparency. NFT wash trading and scams are serious risks for anyone involved in digital art or blockchain assets. Nevertheless, with proper knowledge and precautions, one can shield oneself and benefit from the marvels of this innovation.

This surge comes after Ripple’s favorable ruling in its case against the SEC. While Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan recently revealed that Ripple could easily cover its lawsuit penalty. He also pointed out a key market cap discrepancy, claiming XRP has already surpassed Solana, though it’s not reflected on some tracking platform Ripple’s 200 Million XRP Sale Can Cover Lawsuit Penalty Ripple regularly releases XRP from its escrow account, ensuring liquidity while maintaining a controlled token supply. According to Morgan, if Ripple sold 200 million XRP tokens recently released from escrow, it could cover the penalty ordered by Judge Torres three times over.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP.

XRP’s market capitalization surged past $100 billion, overtaking Binance’s BNB to claim the fifth spot in the crypto rankings. This milestone marks a powerful comeback for Ripple and the XRP community, three years into the SEC’s lawsuit that shook the digital asset’s foundation. The lawsuit, filed in December 2020, accused XRP of being a security—a claim Ripple fiercely contested. John E.

The cryptocurrency saw a significant jump in daily trading volume, defying broader market trends and reflecting heightened investor interest. Analysts suggest strong momentum could persist, with projections targeting a potential $2 valuation by the weekend. The impressive rally has positioned Ripple as a focal point for market attention as it edges closer to reclaiming its all-time high. XRP Price Soars 20%: Is a New All-Time High Imminent? In November, the value of XRP has seen a strong upward trend, climbing by 270%. Currently, it is trading at $1.93, and it has reached its highest level in years. The impressive rally has sparked speculation among analysts and investors about the possibility of a new all-time high. XRP, which hit an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, has been trading significantly below that level for years. However, this recent surge in price has renewed optimism within the cryptocurrency community. With the asset up nearly 50% since the start of the year, its momentum appears strong. If the bullish trend continues the Ripple price might soar to ATH soon. The Relative Strength Index is at $78, indicating an overbought market. XRP Price Chart: TradingView Crypto analysts tweeted about XRP nearing its highest monthly candle close, signaling a potential historic breakout. The tweet highlighted that XRP’s price chart shows significant bullish momentum. If the monthly close achieves this level, it could mark a major milestone for the cryptocurrency. Chart analysis suggests that XRP is approaching a key resistance zone, with traders speculating on whether it will break through. Historical performance indicates such movements often precede major price rallies or corrections. Source- X Will RIPPLE Price Hit $2 This Weekend?

37041245,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620364,1732959548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37041245.jpeg,Inside the Bitcoin megaforce that is MicroStrategy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/inside-bitcoin-megaforce-microstrategy/,"Once a fading software company struggling to stay relevant, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has outstandingly become the ultimate Bitcoin buying powerhouse, hoarding nearly 2% of the world’s entire BTC supply. What’s driving this wild transformation? Ambition, audacity, and billions in borrowed cash. In the past month alone, MicroStrategy announced plans to raise a staggering $42 billion through equity and debt. It also spent $10.2 billion snapping up Bitcoin. But the real spectacle was its fifth convertible bond offering of the year. The terms? ZERO interest and a conversion price set at a ridiculous 55% premium to its current stock price. Investors are essentially giving MicroStrategy free money, banking on Bitcoin’s price (and its stock) continuing to skyrocket. It’s no wonder the company’s stock has jumped over 450% this year, pushing its market cap to $90 billion. That’s a jaw-dropping number for a company whose original software business is bleeding cash and shrinking every quarter. The Bitcoin spiral: A high-stakes loop MicroStrategy’s entire business model now revolves around Bitcoin. Here’s how it works: they raise money through stock sales and convertible bonds. Then, they take that cash and buy Bitcoin —lots of it. These purchases boost Bitcoin’s value, which in turn raises MSTR’s price. The company can then raise even more funds at higher valuations. It’s a cycle so audacious that critics don’t know whether to call it genius or madness. Right now, MicroStrategy owns 386,700 bitcoins, worth $37 billion. But the company’s $90 billion market cap far exceeds the value of its Bitcoin reserves. Unlike companies like Tesla or Block, which dabble in Bitcoin by using surplus cash, MicroStrategy is all in. CEO Phong Le unveiled a plan called “21/21” last month, aiming to raise $42 billion over three years. Half of that will come from stock sales, and the other half from debt. The plan’s name is a cheeky nod to Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit and a reference to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy , where “42” is famously the answer to life’s ultimate question. If nothing else, the company’s confidence is almost as colossal as its balance sheet. Free money and big bets The $3 billion convertible bond issued this month was an unprecedented move, even by MicroStrategy’s standards. Investors lent the money with zero interest and a conversion price of $672 per share—a 55% premium over the current stock price of $406. The gamble here is obvious: if Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, MicroStrategy’s stock will follow, making the bonds profitable. If not, those investors are left holding the bag. But not everyone holding these bonds is just sitting around, waiting for Bitcoin to climb. Many are deploying sophisticated trading strategies. Techniques like gamma trading, delta hedging, and volatility arbitrage allow investors to profit from fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price or MicroStrategy’s stock. These tactics depend on volatility—a condition Bitcoin has delivered in spades, although its swings have calmed somewhat in recent years. The bond offering is essentially a massive bet on Bitcoin’s future. If the cryptocurrency’s price crashes or remains stagnant, the house of cards could collapse. Critics argue that the entire operation feels like a Ponzi scheme , where early investors profit while new ones push up the stock price. Regulators have kept a close eye on Bitcoin, and for now, it is safe from being labeled a security. The SEC has declared it an exception, much to the relief of Bitcoin enthusiasts and companies like MicroStrategy. But that’s not the only legal challenge. U.S. regulations discourage company executives from making speculative predictions about stock prices. Michael Saylor , MicroStrategy’s co-founder and Bitcoin evangelist, hasn’t been shy about sharing his opinions. He’s predicted Bitcoin will hit $13 million by 2045, making the company’s current Bitcoin holdings worth $4.3 trillion. Statements like these could invite scrutiny, especially if the company’s strategy begins to unravel. The Bitcoin monopoly MicroStrategy’s dominance over Bitcoin’s supply is raising eyebrows. BTC was designed to be decentralized, but MicroStrategy’s aggressive buying spree has caused concerns about corporate concentration. Despite these worries, MicroStrategy’s approach has inspired other companies to follow suit. Bitcoin miners like Marathon are now borrowing MicroStrategy’s playbook, issuing zero-interest bonds to fund their operations. Marathon’s recent bond sale carried a 42.6% premium, proving that MicroStrategy’s bold moves are reshaping how businesses interact with Bitcoin. But not everyone is impressed by MicroStrategy’s high-stakes strategy. Skeptics argue that it’s reckless, unsustainable, and heavily reliant on Bitcoin’s price continuing to rise. They point to Bitcoin ETFs as safer alternatives for investors who want exposure to cryptocurrency without the risks of MicroStrategy’s leveraged model. But supporters see it differently. They highlight the company’s ability to raise money at virtually no cost, thanks to its 0% bonds. They also argue that MicroStrategy offers more than just Bitcoin exposure. According to Saylor, the company provides flexibility for investors. Its stock can be leveraged, borrowed against, or even traded like an option. For now, Wall Street remains divided.

The wider market drop led to negative sentiments from several categories of traders. Solana remains key for an altcoin season after hitting levels above Ethereum in institutional flows. At press time, losses continue to accumulate for the community-dubbed ETH killer. SOL traded at $240, plunging 0.28% in the last 24 hours, bringing weekly losses to similar figures. Crypto assets retracing amid bullish markets come with high volatility. Solana Whale Dumps Asset Data from Lookonchain shows a Solana whale depositing 44,950 SOL worth approximately $10.5 million on Binance. The assets were withdrawn from staking to the centralized exchange, likely to prevent losses. Crypto movement to centralized exchanges usually indicates a sale due to the ease of transfers. On the other hand, transfers off exchanges to other custodians indicate long-term holdings. Another factor that affected Solana outflows in terms of whale address activity was Pump.fun’s transfer of 99,999 SOL worth about 22.7 million to Kraken. The transfer raised lots of eyebrows, and some users suggested a sale. Lookonchain previously wrote on X (formerly Twitter), calling it a sale before stating it was only a deposit. Pump.fun has gained traction since its launch as the community embraces the meme coin launch pad. Meme coins grew this quarter, with multiple tokens picking up double-digit wins before the price correction. Can Solana Change the Tide? Solana bulls are optimistic about an upward swing in prices. While bulls have locked in mo re positive targets, bears opine that recent setbacks could wipe out huge gains. However, on-chain factors tip a bullish scenario for the asset as the network fee drops. Crypto user Peter Horton explained the bullish scenario of the asset. “ Solana’s chain gdp reached a new ath in october, both in absolute terms ($300M) and in market share (45%). chain gdp takes the sum of all fees collected by projects on a network. in october, solana projects collected more fees than projects on Ethereum and its L2s combined.”",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-11-30 10:56:25

The largest crypto exchange Binance listing THENA marked a pivotal achievement in the partnership, supported by Orbs’ investment and technical expertise. It has expanded its offerings, attracting a broader user base and driving innovation in decentralized finance. Orbs and THENA Partnership Drives Innovation in DeFi Orbs has strengthened its position as a leading blockchain infrastructure provider through its collaboration with THENA, a decentralized exchange built on the BNB Chain, as reported in the ORBS press release . Since the partnership began in March 2023, Orbs has supported THENA with strategic investments, advanced Layer-3 trading technologies, and targeted market expansion efforts. This synergy has introduced advanced features like dTWAP, dLIMIT, and Liquidity Hub, boosting trading efficiency and liquidity management. The introduction of Perpetual Hub further enabled leveraged trading with reduced collateral, setting THENA apart in the DeFi space. A $600,000 investment also helped accelerate its roadmap and enhance long-term development. A breakthrough in their efforts was THENA’s listing on the leading crypto exchange Binance. The accompanying airdrop campaign drew significant user interest, elevating the platform’s visibility and adoption. These advancements highlight the impact of their collaboration in reshaping decentralized finance and on-chain trading. This partnership illustrates how forward-thinking technology and financial support can redefine blockchain innovation, showcasing the potential of next-generation infrastructure to transform DeFi ecosystems.

On-chain factors show the market is still in a bull phase; however, major indices differ from previous cycles. Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s CEO, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that retail investors are not at the Fear of Missing Out stage. He said the analysis was drawn from trading counts on all centralized exchanges and other markets. Reduced sentiments from smaller players are present amid a general bullish price for several reasons. A look at the charts shows a significant drop in retail holders compared to the previous crypto bull run. Traders Set Sights on Quick Profits The rapid growth of BTC prices above $99k changed the dynamics for various levels of traders. While several whales increased buying pressure, smaller investors looked to rake in profits. The recent pullback in prices heightened sales and movements to centralized exchanges. At the time of writing, the BTC price had nosedived to $96,310, a 0.4% drop today amid low sentiments. According to CryptoQuant, short-term Bitcoin holders are transferring assets at a loss to centralized exchanges, triggering panic among traders. These transactions are mostly retail traders, as most institutions continue to set price levels. Institutional appetite surged the market to present levels after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This group of holders targets a run above $100K, although some have taken profits. Profit-taking sends prices lower, with traders repositioning their assets for the next bull swing. Profit Taking On Binance Hits New Level The largest exchange by trading volumes has seen users offload assets to avoid losses. As Bitcoin takes a step back, the wider market is affected, with altcoins posting large outflows. Ethereum, Solana, and BNB dipped 3%, 2.2% and 1% respectively. Crypto traders have also liquidated holdings over fears of exits in institutional holdings. “ Tracking the realized profits of the Binance cohort provides valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and behavior, especially considering Binance consistently handles higher volumes than any other exchange. This metric helps us understand whether investors are taking profits aggressively (Above 10M) or steadily, which can be crucial to confirm the strength of the ongoing trend,” CryptoQuant wrote.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-11-30 11:10:58

Recently, ADA has experienced a remarkable surge, climbing by 211.1% in just 30 days—making it the top performer among the leading Layer 1 coins. But despite this impressive growth, ADA’s price of $1.1117 is still a long way from its all-time high of $3.101. So, could Cardano reach as high as $10 in this bull cycle? The potential is there, but what factors are truly driving this momentum? Let’s dive in. Whale Activity Signals Growing Momentum In the last 24 hours, whale transactions in Cardano have hit at least 26.09 billion ADA. Weekly data shows a substantial increase in whale holdings, jumping from 26 billion to 41.83 billion ADA. This uptick in whale activity suggests rising liquidity, which could set the stage for further price gains. If these large holders continue accumulating, ADA could see a strong upward push. Developer Activity Keeps Cardano Competitive Cardano is widely regarded as one of the most active Layer 1 networks in terms of development. The recent Chang hard fork introduced decentralized governance, while the Hydra Doom testing campaign showcased its ability to scale with community involvement. These continuous improvements enhance Cardano’s appeal and maintain user confidence, reinforcing its position as a leading Layer 1 blockchain. Bitcoin Correlation and Why It Matters Cardano has a correlation coefficient of 0.94 with Bitcoin, meaning its price often mirrors Bitcoin’s movements. In the past month, Bitcoin has gained 34.2%, hitting a record high of $98,888.09 on November 22. Currently trading at $96,732.87, Bitcoin is just 3.37% away from the $100K milestone. As institutional investors continue to back Bitcoin, many expect it to break $100K soon. This could positively impact Cardano, potentially driving ADA closer to its $10 target. Cardano’s price outlook is shaped by several factors: increasing whale activity, ongoing developer upgrades, and its strong link to Bitcoin. If these elements remain aligned, ADA could be well-positioned to approach the $10 mark. Cardano’s path to $10 is paved with innovation, liquidity, and a strong market correlation—an exciting future awaits.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 11:14:34

Top Indicators to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With an exceptional 30-day growth of 474.0%, Stellar has outperformed almost all the top ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, (34.1%), Ethereum (38.5%), Solana (38.6%), and even XRP (262.3%). The current XLM price of $0.5404 is just 36.102% lower than the 2021 peak of $0.7355. XLM enthusiasts anticipate that the XLM price could hit $1 by December. Let analyse whether the market’s technical and fundamental scenarios support this expectation. Ready? Stellar’s Impressive Price Performance On May 11, 2021, the price of Stellar stood at a yearly peak of $0.7355. On May 19, 2021, the price sharply plummeted from $0.6464 to $0.4429, marking a significant single-day drop of 31.48%. The current XLM price is the highest recorded since May 20, 2021. At the start of this month (November, 2024), the XLM market was at $0.0933. Since November 5, the market has surged by over 492.54%. During this upward momentum, the market experienced only one major correction; it was when the price sharply dropped from $0.5359 to $0.4384 between November 25 and 26, marking a 18.19% fall. However, with a sharp rebound of 25% between November 27 and 29, the market swiftly recovered from the correction. Yesterday, the market touched a peak of $0.5480..

Right now, both the 50-day SMA and 100-day SMA remain far above the 200-day SMA, indicating a strong bullish sentiment. The MACD indicator also reinforces the bullish outlook. However, XLM’s RSI ( Relative Strength Index )remains in the overbought zone at 77.57. This indicates that the Stellar market can experience a short-term correction before it continues its upward journey. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Cardano Price Prediction for 2024: Here’s Why ADA Price is Poised for a 40% Upswing in December , Stellar’s Fundamental Developments Grayscale Investments recently offered private placements for Stellar.

Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ believes that if this record high is achieved, it will be almost impossible for the average person to catch up, as he said in an X post on November 30. According to Kiyosaki, the real shift will occur once Bitcoin reaches $100,000. At that point, only the ultra-wealthy will have the financial power to acquire significant amounts of the maiden digital asset. He warned that the rich will get richer while the poor and middle class will fall further behind in such an environment. To this end, Kiyosaki stressed the importance of ‘Fear of Missing Out’ ( FOMO ), urging investors to act before the asset becomes more expensive. “The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000 only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind,” he said. While Kiyosaki is advocating for FOMO, this psychological effect can lead to poor financial decisions , such as spending beyond one’s means or making impulsive choices, potentially resulting in losses, especially if Bitcoin doesn’t perform as expected. Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin price prediction Notably, in anticipation of Bitcoin’s price growth, Kiyosaki has made a bold prediction , noting that the asset could reach a valuation of $500,000 by 2025. However, he clarified that this forecast comes from an unnamed artificial intelligence (AI) platform, not his analysis. Kiyosaki had previously forecasted that Bitcoin would hit $300,000 in 2024. Overall, the financial educator has maintained that Bitcoin is an ideal asset for wealth protection, as he predicts a possible massive economic crash. In addition to Bitcoin, the author has maintained that gold is another alternative while stressing that there should be no debate about which asset is better. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $96,280 by press time, correcting by less than 0.1% in the last 24 hours. The asset has shown weakness in the past week, down over 2%.

Here’s the Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-breaks-multi-year-resistance-heres-the-next-target/,"XRP has witnessed a significant price surge, recently breaking a multi-year resistance level. This breakout, highlighted by the prominent crypto analyst CryptoBull, positions XRP for a potential move toward $2. The analyst attached a chart showing XRP surpassing its critical resistance point, sparking bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, XRP has reached $1.86, reflecting an 11% increase over the past 24 hours. The digital asset also recorded a multi-year high of $1.92. CryptoBull also previously noted the importance of XRP’s resistance level. #XRP broke multi year resistance. Next is $2. pic.twitter.com/SrKmOe5VsJ — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 29, 2024 The current price action indicates that the asset remains on a strong upward trajectory. If XRP attains the predicted $2 level, it will exceed its 2021 peak of $1.96 and further solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency. Factors Fueling XRP’s Price Increase A combination of market optimism and regulatory developments appears to be fueling XRP’s rise. One key catalyst for the recent rally is the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, effective January 20, 2024. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by contentious regulatory actions in the form of frivolous lawsuits against major companies in the crypto industry, including a high-profile lawsuit against Ripple, XRP’s parent company. The news of his departure has reinvigorated confidence among investors and traders, contributing to XRP’s renewed momentum. Additionally, multiple applications for XRP-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are under review. The approval of these ETFs could provide institutional investors with easier access to XRP, potentially driving increased demand and price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market participants closely monitor these developments, as they may help to determine XRP’s medium- to long-term trajectory. While challenges remain, particularly near the $2 mark, the outlook for XRP appears increasingly promising. The technical indicators support a bullish scenario for XRP. The weekly chart shows strong upward momentum. When combined with these other factors, the digital asset might be unstoppable. With XRP approaching $2, it is important to note that trading veteran Peter Brandt has also weighed in on XRP’s outlook, suggesting that the asset could experience a significant price surge if it reclaims its 2021 peak. Such a move would validate the current bullish trend and pave the way for further price exploration above the $2 level, potentially targeting its all-time high of $3.84.

The project distributed a massive 310 million HYPE tokens to its community, valuing the giveaway at $1.2 billion based on an initial token price of $3.90, as reported by CoinGecko. The excitement surrounding HYPE skyrocketed soon after the launch. Within 12 hours, the token’s value surged by 63%, reaching $6.16 and propelling its market capitalization near the $2 billion threshold. The buzz reflects growing confidence in Hyperliquid’s ecosystem, built on a high-performance, proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain designed to process up to 200,000 transactions per second. Tokenomics and Strategic Allocation The genesis event distributed 31% of Hyperliquid’s one billion HYPE tokens, with the remaining supply allocated for sustained growth and ecosystem development. Approximately 38.8% is reserved for future emissions and community rewards, while 6% is designated for the Hyper Foundation treasury and 0.3% for grants. Notably, core contributors will receive 23.8% of the total supply, locked for one year with vesting schedules extending to 2028. Hyperliquid’s decision to exclude private investors, centralized exchanges, and market makers from token allocations underscores its commitment to community-focused decentralization. HYPE tokens serve as the backbone of the Hyperliquid ecosystem, acting as both the staking asset for its proof-of-stake consensus and the gas token for its Ethereum-compatible HyperEVM layer. This dual functionality positions the token as a critical driver of scalability and efficiency in the DeFi landscape. Joining the Ranks of Legendary Airdrops Hyperliquid’s monumental airdrop secures its place in DeFi history, rivaling iconic events like Uniswap’s 2020 distribution. During that airdrop, over 250,000 wallets received 400 UNI tokens each, initially valued at $3.40 per token. Recipients who held onto their tokens saw UNI’s value soar to over $42 during the 2021 DeFi boom. Another notable airdrop was Arbitrum’s 2023 event, which distributed native tokens to more than 625,000 eligible wallets, with a market value totaling $812,500 at launch. Airdrops have become a pivotal strategy in the crypto space, rewarding early adopters and amplifying project visibility. According to CoinGecko, more than $26.6 billion worth of tokens have been distributed through such events, showcasing the immense potential of this approach in fostering blockchain adoption. Hyperliquid’s successful launch and record-breaking airdrop highlight its ambition to become a cornerstone of the DeFi sector, setting the stage for further innovations.

Recent on-chain data indicated that the whale accumulated a whopping 120 million coins from a leading crypto exchange. In turn, market enthusiasts are expecting further gains in the asset’s price, given recent legal maneuvers that sided with the American blockchain payments company. XRP News: Whale Bags 120M Coins Amid Legal Developments According to the tracker Whale Alert’s data , as of November 30, a crypto market whale accumulated 120 million coins worth $228.71 million from the crypto exchange Bithumb. Per the data, the unknown wallet address that made this accumulation was recorded as rPy…DMZ. Notably, the massive accumulation has ignited optimism surrounding the crypto’s future movements, underscoring increased market interest in the asset amid an ongoing bull run. Notably, CoinGape Media reported that the lawsuit against the U.S. SEC could end under the “new SEC.” Primarily, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler announcing his exit and pro-crypto Donald Trump securing a win in the U.S. elections, market sentiments surrounding the XRP lawsuit have taken a paradigm shift. Attorneys Bill Morgan, Fred Rispoli, and Jeremy Hogan also revealed that the appeals are likely to get dismissed, hinting that the lawsuit could drop soon. Simultaneously, the recent legal maneuvers in favor of Ripple have added to optimism on the asset’s future, further escorted by the abovementioned accumulation. On the other hand, in another legal development, a recent California district court filing revealed that the court has granted the motion to amend the order pertaining to judgment and stay in the In re Ripple Labs litigation . Both parties in the lawsuit have agreed that there was no specific reason to delay the judgment in the lawsuit. Overall, these legal developments have emerged as notable XRP news, with the blockchain payments company’s native crypto experiencing a sustained price rally. Market Value Reaches Nears $2 Riding bullish waves leveraging massive buying, XRP gained 20% to hit a 24-hour high of $1.95. The price is currently trading at $1.88. Notably, the weekly and monthly charts for the asset indicated gains worth 22% and 260%, respectively. This rising trajectory, amid legal developments and rising whale accumulations, has sparked bullishness among investors. Simultaneously, Coinglass data indicated a 20% increase in the coin’s futures OI to $3.22 billion. Further, even the derivatives volume soared 127% to $25.65 billion. Overall, the derivatives data also indicated heightened investor interest in the asset. In addition, an XRP price analysis by CoinGape Media indicated that the token is eyeing further gains as it surged past a five-year resistance level in market dominance. Overall, market watchers continue to eye the token bullishly, expecting further gains in light of the latest XRP news mentioned above and a potential RLUSD launch next month.

RCO Finance soars as November’s top altcoin by offering unique AI features like an AI Robo Advisor, access to numerous assets, and 1000x leverage. With these features, experts believe that RCO Finance could witness double-digit gains with an investment of $500, yielding $50k by 2025. Let’s see how this could happen! >>> Join RCOF Presale Shiba Inu Secures Its Price Breakout With Massive Token Burns Shiba Inu’s successful breakout from its consolidation phase signals increased investor optimism. Yet, its recent activity hasn’t caused any significant changes in its price movement, as SHIB’s price has only witnessed a 1.9% gain over the past week. Recently, Shiba Inu shared its roadmap for removing 99% of SHIB tokens from circulation, which raised concerns among investors who saw this as an impossible feat. Despite the potential for Shiba Inu to witness increased demand from its massive token burns, experts believe that burning 99% of the token supply would make Shiba Inu too expensive. Due to the shortcomings of Shiba Inu’s planned burns, investors have targeted double-digit gains by 2025 on RCO Finance. Solana Faces Losses Due To Market-Wide Price Corrections Solana has experienced a price correction, falling to $234 due to market-wide corrections. This comes after a 30% pump over the past month. Despite this, Solana’s DEX ecosystem hit a new milestone of $125 billion monthly trading volume in November. Experts say this spike in DeFi trading volume results from Solana’s low transaction fees. It has also been driven by rising interest in meme coins minted on Solana’s Pump.Fun. However, the ongoing correction has led to slightly negative sentiments surrounding Solana’s price performance. This price retracement has also forced investors to shift attention to alternatives like RCO Finance, which has a huge potential for massive gains. RCO Finance’s Lucrative Presale And Superior AI Financial Tools Could Help It Surpass Other Tokens RCO Finance’s presale is one reason experts say the AI-based project can outrun Solana and Shiba Inu. Interested investors can now buy the RCOF token for $0.05 and earn a whopping 1,100% profit when the presale ends.

Speaking on Speak Up with Anthony Scaramucci, the Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder and chief investment officer touched on Bitcoin’s strong potential, fueled by historical trends and market dynamics. Lee attributed his bullish view to Bitcoin’s halving, a major event where the reward for mining Bitcoin blocks is cut in half, slowing the rate at which new coins are mined. This event, which has occurred previously this year, has historically preceded significant price increases. “The sweet spot for this price increase is towards the end of this year and into next year,” Lee said, adding that Bitcoin’s price has been closely followed by previous halving cycles. Another important factor in Lee’s optimism is the potential for positive U.S. government policies. Lee noted the new administration’s pro-Bitcoin stance and the possibility that the U.S. would accept Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. He said this move could significantly bolster Bitcoin’s legitimacy and increase demand. “If the U.S. government eventually reaches one million Bitcoins, it will be the largest holder of Bitcoin in the world,” Lee said, comparing the strategy to MicroStrategy’s successful use of Bitcoin as a balance sheet asset. Related News: Analytics Company Shares Key Price Levels That Will Determine Bitcoin's Fate While Lee is firm on his Bitcoin prediction, he also sees potential in other cryptocurrencies. Along with Ethereum and Solana, he expects altcoins to perform well, especially as Bitcoin’s dominance in the market could wane in 2025. “The stronger Bitcoin is, the stronger the ecosystem is,” Lee says, predicting a productive altcoin season next year. When pressed by Scaramucci for a definitive prediction, Lee confidently said, “I think a year from now Bitcoin will be something around $250,000.” *This is not investment advice.

In the meantime, the Cardano price , which had remained consolidated for quite a long time, has broken above the range. The price has surged over 200% in a month and a bullish close is expected to kick off a strong rally until the end of the yearly trade. Therefore, the price is expected to initiate a fresh rise, which could push the levels close to the ATH.

Analyst Sets Next Target After 4-Month High,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/worldcoin-wld-about-to-breakout-analyst-sets-next-target-after-4-month-high/,"Worldcoin (WLD) has seen a nearly 40% surge in the last week, briefly testing the $3 mark. The cryptocurrency hit a 4-month high after nearing the upper zone of a multi-month range. Its recent performance has fueled investors’ optimism about a possible breakout, which could send the token to new highs. Worldcoin Hits 4-Month High Worldcoin has seen a considerable decline since hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $11.74, retracing around 75% from its March high. During the Q3 retraces, the cryptocurrency lost the $3 support, diving below the $2 mark after August’s “Black Monday.” Since then, WLD has hovered between the $1.3-$3.2 price range, consolidating below the $2.5 for the past couple of months. Following the November Post-election rally, Worldcoin has surged around 75% in three weeks, reclaiming the $2 zone. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency’s momentum propelled WLD above the $2.5 resistance level for the first time in three months, turning it into support the following days. Moreover, the token surged 23% intraday, hitting its four-month high on November 28 after momentarily trading above the $3 mark. Crypto analyst Yuriy suggested that a “big move” is coming for the cryptocurrency. The analyst noted that WLD’s open interest (OI) has significantly surged this month, rising 135% since election day. According to Coinglass data , Worldcoin’s OI jumped from $184 million to $433 million in three weeks, recording its second-highest day on Wednesday. Additionally, it has seen a 9.65% in the last 24 hours and a 12% jump in the past hour, signaling heightened confidence and participation in the cryptocurrency. To Yuriy, the cryptocurrency could follow the steps of Cardano (ADA), which recently saw its price hit a 2-year high. Following its OI increase, the token recovered from its 75% decline and broke out of its multi-month consolidation range, reclaiming the long-awaited $1 mark. WLD’s Breakout To Target $3.5 The analyst explained that, after the recent WLD price action, the $2.8 mark is a crucial support level to confirm, as it served as a significant resistance level earlier this month. As a result, consolidating above this level could propel the token’s price to the next target . The token is nearing a breakout from the 4-month range, which could target the $3.5 price range in the short term. Analyst AMBcrypto pointed out that the $3.5 mark is the next major resistance for Worldcoin, indicating that a breakout from this level “will push it towards the previous high” of $11. As of this writing, Worldcoin trades above $2.9, having surged 31% in the last month. Additionally, the token has seen a 42% increase in daily activity, registering a trading volume of $1.67 billion in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency Market News|ADA|Cardano|crypto analyst|Crypto Bull Run 2024|crypto market|Crypto trader|US Elections|WLD|WLDUSDT|WorldCoin|Worldcoin Bullish Breakout,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|TRADING|WLD,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 12:00:59

It seems like hardly a day goes by without a new decentralized finance project promising to reshape how users think about money and investing. Lately, this trend has only intensified. You might also like: The transformative potential of Bitcoin in the job market | Opinion In the rapidly evolving DeFi world, new initiatives push the boundaries of what digital assets can offer. For many, the excitement surrounding these projects highlights the potential for a more transparent and accessible financial future. While DeFi protocols have the potential to disrupt and democratize finance, many of these projects face significant challenges in securing capital to develop innovative products and stay consistent with their roadmaps. We can chalk this up to a few key reasons that mainly stem from the core tenets of decentralized business models. For instance, traditional businesses can rely on bank loans or public markets to raise funds, a luxury that DeFi projects don’t have due to their reliance on decentralized governance and existing in an unclear regulatory environment. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. For one, many DeFi projects cannot access capital pools typically available to traditional tech startups. While venture capital firms specializing in web3 and crypto exist, the number of startups exceeds the number of VCs ready to invest, creating a highly competitive funding environment. The need for alternatives In recent years, the rise of entrepreneurship has heightened the demand for alternative funding solutions, which has caused funding avenues like crypto launchpads to gain popularity. It’s easy to see why—crypto launchpads provide a different route for projects by tapping into a global pool of investors and fostering a more inclusive network of contributors. However, the launchpad ecosystem has deteriorated as platforms rely heavily on token sale models, which prioritize short-term financial gain over sustained community engagement. Token sales can attract speculative investors looking for quick profits rather than those committed to the project’s vision. This approach often leads to an imbalanced distribution of funds, with little to no involvement from community members, affecting a project’s long-term success. So, projects have become disillusioned with the fundraising options available to them. They face either having to go down the VC route or deal with a hyper-competitive crypto launchpad marketplace that may not align with their needs. However, some projects have taken notice of this oversaturation and taken steps to provide an alternative. Astrovault , for example, has developed a new fundraising platform that draws from its experience as a decentralized exchange. The platform, titled Outbid, has been presented for integration directly into the Cosmos Hub to facilitate new ways for projects to raise funds. Outbid is a decentralized, gamified launchpad designed to create a transparent fundraising pipeline for projects in the vast, loosely integrated Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. By gamifying the fundraising process through an auction-style micro-sale mechanism, Astrovault has facilitated a way to get communities on Cosmos more actively involved in raising money for projects they see potential in. And since all projects are parameterized, Outbid’s platform can help fundraise for any type of deal or stage of development. The project suggests that the platform would be governed by any DAO selected by Cosmos, who would be responsible for overseeing marketing and business development activities. Additionally, the platform plans to support fundraising efforts by matching donations, allowing early-stage projects to gain exposure and backing from the community.

Table of Contents XRP on-chain indicators signal price growth XRP eyes retest of April 2021 peak XRP derivatives traders turn bullish Strategic considerations XRP on-chain indicators signal price growth XRP traders increased their on-chain activity between Nov. 16 and 29, and Santiment recorded several spikes in the active addresses metric. The spikes represent the increase in activity, accompanied by a spike in transaction volume across exchange platforms. The network realized profit/loss metric used to identify the net profit/loss of all tokens traded on a given day shows that XRP traders have been transacting profitably since Nov. 4. Positive spikes above the neutral line indicate traders’ profit-taking. Typically, large positive spikes are associated with the likelihood of higher selling pressure on XRP; traders need to watch this metric closely for signs of a reversal in trend. The ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss is 6.73, meaning profitable transactions are dominant as XRP price rallies. The on-chain metrics support a bullish thesis for XRP price alongside technical and other indicators.

A successful break past this level could erase the losses for traders for the past three years. The relative strength index reads 88, meaning XRP is overvalued. While typically, this is considered a sell signal and could indicate an impending correction in XRP, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator signals further gains are likely. Green histogram bars above the neutral line support a thesis of XRP price rally. The $3 target is a psychologically important level for XRP; in January 2018, the altcoin hit a record high at $3. The altcoin has yet to revisit the level in the past six years. XRP/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news XRP could find support between $1.2643 and $1.4033 in the imbalance zone. A correction could send the altcoin to this support zone before further correction. Once the fair value gap is filled, XRP could resume its climb toward the April 2021 peak of $1.9669.

This metric shows that a significant market movement in Bitcoin could impact the XRP price. Bitcoin started its recovery after the initial drawdown to the $90,700 level on Tuesday. If BTC records a major decline in its price in the coming weeks, the XRP price trend could be negatively impacted.

However, on-chain data platform IntoTheBlockchain indicates the company poses four major risks to BTC such as valuation premium, debt exposure, market volatility, and concentration risks, that investors need to take care of before taking major bets. Key Risks Posed By MicroStrategy to Bitcoin Earlier this week, MicroStrategy acquired 55,000 Bitcoins for a $5.4 billion investment value taking its total holdings to 386,700 BTC. This was the third consecutive strategic BTC purchase by the company following the Donald Trump victory in early November. The firm has financed these purchases majorly through corporate bonds with low interest rates. While MicroStrategy’s aggressive BTC accumulation has positioned it as a market leader, it comes with significant risks. Here are the four major risks that the firm poses to Bitcoin, as per IntoTheBlock report . MSTR Valuation Premium: At one point, the MSTR stock was trading at more than 3.2x its net asset value of Bitcoins. It led to concerns about a major valuation bubble that might deflate under adverse conditions. The MSTR stock has been extremely volatile as investors start to weigh the downside risks. Debt Exposure: As said, MicroStrategy has been buying most of its BTC through debt issuance and has over $7 billion in convertible notes. In the case of worsening market conditions, repayment or conversion to equity could force BTC sales. Market Volatility : MSTR stock price is highly sensitive to Bitcoin price swings, with current volatility at 4x that of BTC and 3x Ethereum. Past episodes, such as in 2021 and 2022, saw MSTR volatility reach 200%. Concentration Risks: Holding 1.9% of BTC’s supply makes the company vulnerable to market shocks. Any forced liquidation could significantly affect both Bitcoin’s price and MSTR stock value. MicroStrategy’s high-leverage Bitcoin strategy has so far paid off in a bullish market. However, the risks of debt exposure, market volatility, and concentration remain critical factors to watch. Where’s MSTR Stock Heading Next? After hitting an all-tiem high of $473 last week, the MSTR stock corrected over 35% thereby easing up the massive premium it commanded over BTC. After hitting a low of $355 this week, the stock has reversed its trajectory. Also, Bernstein analysts gave a massive $600 MSTR price target . The MicroStrategy stock is already up by 58% this month and 465% since the beginning of 2024. Some market analysts have advised caution for new investors on initiating a buy position. Experts believe there are other better opportunities like Marathon Digital (MARA) to look for instead of MSTR.

You’ve probably heard about Ethereum and Tether—names that dominate headlines—but there’s more to this dynamic world. Bittensor is diving deep into AI-powered ecosystems, Tezos is pioneering green blockchain technology, and, let’s not forget, Qubetics ($TICS). This underdog is stealing the spotlight with its game-changing approach to cross-border payments, thanks to the $TICS token. But here’s the kicker: while the crypto giants are flexing their muscles, Qubetics is quietly becoming the best crypto to buy now. It’s not just another blockchain project—it’s a revolution for banks and institutions, offering transparency, speed, and massive cost savings. If you’re looking for a crypto that combines innovation with serious ROI potential, Qubetics might just be your golden ticket. 1. Qubetics: Transforming Cross-Border Payments The Qubetics Network is turning heads for all the right reasons. Imagine a world where banks and financial institutions can zip payments across borders faster than you can finish your morning coffee. That’s exactly what Qubetics is doing with its $TICS token. Leveraging blockchain tech helps banks ditch outdated, clunky payment systems and replace them with something far more efficient. The result? Instant settlements, reduced costs, and unparalleled transparency. It’s no wonder so many institutions are rushing to partner with the Qubetics Network. And here’s why it’s the best crypto to buy now . Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 10, and things are heating up. At just $0.025 per $TICS token, you can snag about 4,000 tokens for a $100 investment. But don’t wait—prices jump 10% each week, and the final phase will see a whopping 20% increase. With over $3.8M raised, 239M tokens sold, and more than 4,800 holders, investors are clearly taking notice. Once the presale ends, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, promising a staggering 900% ROI. Remember that early birds catch the worm, especially in crypto, if you’re still on the fence. 2. Bittensor: AI Meets Blockchain Bittensor is carving out its niche by marrying artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. This forward-thinking project is building a decentralised network for AI models, allowing developers to train and monetise their creations without being beholden to tech giants. It’s a win-win situation: AI gets smarter, and developers get fairly compensated. What’s exciting is how Bittensor is designed to scale. The project is gaining traction among AI enthusiasts who see it as a fairer, more transparent alternative to centralised systems. Plus, its staking mechanism ensures that contributors are incentivised to keep improving the network. For anyone interested in the intersection of AI and blockchain, Bittensor is worth a second look. That’s why it made this list. 3. Tezos: Sustainability Meets Innovation Tezos has been a quiet disruptor in the crypto world, focusing on self-upgrading technology and sustainability. Unlike many blockchains that fork when upgrades are needed, Tezos can evolve without splitting into two chains. This feature alone makes it a top pick for developers looking for stability. Even better, Tezos has committed to being eco-friendly. Its proof-of-stake mechanism significantly reduces energy consumption compared to traditional mining systems. With gaming, art, and finance partnerships, Tezos is proving it’s not just another blockchain. It’s adaptable, green, and future-focused, so it earns its spot on this list. 4. Tether: The Stablecoin Powerhouse Tether (USDT) is the go-to stablecoin for millions of crypto users worldwide. Backed by fiat reserves, it offers the stability of traditional currency while maintaining the flexibility of crypto. Whether you’re trading, hedging, or moving funds across borders, Tether is a reliable choice. Its widespread adoption speaks volumes. Tether is integrated with nearly every major exchange and serves as a lifeline for investors during volatile market swings. If stability in a rollercoaster market is what you’re after, Tether is a no-brainer. That’s why it’s on this list. 5. Ethereum: The OG of Smart Contracts Ethereum doesn’t just sit at the top—it practically built the throne. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum opened the door for decentralised apps, DeFi, and NFTs. Its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0, with a proof-of-stake mechanism, has significantly reduced energy usage while improving scalability. Developers flock to Ethereum because of its massive ecosystem, and its unparalleled network effects. It’s a blockchain that continues to innovate, proving its staying power repeatedly. For anyone serious about crypto, Ethereum is a must-have. That’s why it’s here. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Now Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to buy now include Qubetics, Ethereum, Tether, Tezos, and Bittensor. Each coin offers something unique, whether it’s innovation, stability, or sustainability. But Qubetics stands out with its groundbreaking approach to cross-border payments and jaw-dropping ROI potential. If you’re still undecided, consider this: investing in Qubetics during its presale could be a life-changing move. With prices set to soar and the $TICS token already making waves, there’s no better time to jump in. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just dipping your toes into the crypto waters, Qubetics is the opportunity you don’t want to miss. So, why wait? Dive in and secure your piece of the future today.

This New ICO Could Change Your Mind,https://thecoinrise.com/thought-crypto-riches-were-out-of-reach-this-new-ico-could-change-your-mind/,"Have you ever wondered how different your life would look if you’d taken a chance on crypto early? Imagine being among the first to spot a promising ICO, but instead, you hesitated, unsure of its potential. For many, Tezos (XTZ) was one of those missed opportunities. As a blockchain project that introduced self-amending technology, Tezos had the potential to stand out from the crowd. Fast forward to today, and while Tezos remains a solid choice for long-term holders, its early investors were the ones who truly reaped the rewards. Now, if you’ve ever felt like you’re late to the crypto party, here’s the good news: Qubetics ($TICS) is shaping up to be a similar opportunity. Offering cutting-edge solutions like its multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is designed to fix the gaps that its predecessors struggled with. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, this might just be the moment you’ve been waiting for. Missing the Qubetics Presale Could Be a Big Loss Imagine a world where you can manage all your crypto assets in one place without breaking a sweat. That’s the vision behind the Qubetics multi-chain wallet . From feeless $TICS transfers to integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay, this wallet is redefining how people interact with digital assets. Whether you’re a business owner juggling international payments, a freelancer dealing with overseas clients, or someone who’s just tired of clunky crypto apps, Qubetics has got you covered. Picture a small business owner in the US paying suppliers in Europe. Instead of dealing with high bank fees and delays, they use the Qubetics wallet to convert $TICS into stablecoins, making payments faster and cheaper. Or imagine a freelancer in Asia who gets paid in crypto but needs to use those funds for daily expenses. With the Qubetics virtual card, they can make instant transactions without waiting for fiat conversions. The wallet’s planned instant crypto-to-stablecoin conversion ensures reliability for merchants and service providers, creating a seamless payment experience. The Qubetics presale is already making waves. Now in its 10th stage, over 239 million $TICS tokens have been sold to 4,800+ holders, raising $3.6 million. At $0.025 per token, it’s one of the best crypto to buy now. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, projections suggest $1 (3787% ROI), $5 (19,337% ROI), and even $15 after the mainnet launch (58,213% ROI). Here’s how it stacks up: a $25,000 investment today at $0.025 gets you 1,000,000 $TICS tokens. By the presale’s end, when $TICS hits $0.25, that $25,000 becomes $250,000. Post-presale, at $1, it jumps to $1,000,000. If $TICS reaches $5, you’re looking at $5,000,000. And if it climbs to $15, that same $25,000 turns into $15,000,000. Missing this presale isn’t just a loss—it’s walking away from life-changing potential. Tezos’ Journey and What It Means for Investors Tezos has always been a trailblazer. It introduced the concept of a self-amending blockchain, allowing it to upgrade itself without needing a hard fork. During its ICO in 2017, Tezos became one of the largest fundraising events in crypto history. Priced at just $0.47 per token, early investors watched their investments skyrocket when Tezos hit over $9 in 2021. Even though its current price is lower, Tezos remains a strong player, thanks to its focus on governance and adaptability. It has found its niche in areas like decentralised applications and tokenised assets, with a growing number of projects choosing its ecosystem. Analysts see steady growth potential, making Tezos a solid choice for long-term holders. The lesson is clear: the best opportunities often lie in early-stage projects. For those who missed Tezos’ ICO, Qubetics offers a second shot at being part of something transformative. This New ICO Could Be the Game-Changer You’ve Been Waiting For Crypto is full of stories about people who missed out. But the Qubetics presale is a chance to rewrite that narrative. With its innovative multi-chain wallet and a vision to make crypto accessible and practical for everyone, Qubetics is more than just a token—it’s a solution. At $0.025 per token, it’s easily the best crypto to buy now. With prices set to rise 10% in the next stage, waiting could mean missing out on a golden opportunity. Don’t let this presale pass you by. Visit Qubetics today and secure your $TICS tokens before it’s too late. This could be your ticket to turning missed chances into massive wins.

The regulatory green light is anticipated within days, potentially enabling the stablecoin’s launch as early as December 4. Ripple’s RLUSD is designed to serve the growing demand for trusted and transparent digital dollar solutions. This move represents Ripple’s strategic foray into the competitive stablecoin market, currently dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). A New Chapter in Cross-Border Payments Ripple Labs first announced its plans to develop RLUSD in April 2024, aiming to integrate the stablecoin into its cross-border payment ecosystem alongside XRP. The company envisions RLUSD as a complementary product, emphasizing that it will not replace XRP but instead enhance liquidity solutions. “There is a clear demand for stablecoins that deliver trust, stability, and utility,” Ripple stated earlier this year. With RLUSD’s impending launch , Ripple intends to leverage the stablecoin and XRP to streamline global payment flows, providing faster settlement and improved customer experiences. RLUSD has undergone rigorous testing on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet, with Ripple planning to expand support to additional blockchains. Moreover, the company has outlined a robust framework for transparency, committing to third-party audits and monthly reports on the stablecoin’s reserves, which will include cash and short-term equivalents. Ripple’s Expanding Ecosystem Ripple has already secured partnerships with prominent exchanges, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, and MoonPay, to facilitate RLUSD’s adoption. These alliances underscore Ripple’s commitment to building an extensive infrastructure for its stablecoin while maintaining regulatory compliance through its New York Trust Company Charter. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s co-founder and CEO, has reaffirmed the company’s dedication to advancing its broader ecosystem. He noted the dual role of XRP and RLUSD in enhancing liquidity and enabling seamless cross-border transactions. Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market aligns with its projection of a $2 trillion industry capitalization by 2028. The company sees ample room for innovation and competition, positioning RLUSD as a reliable and compliant alternative in the growing digital asset space.

These euro- and US dollar-referenced e-money tokens, issued on the Ethereum blockchain, reflect growing adoption of compliant stablecoin models. This trend aligns with increasing demand for transparency and regulatory adherence in the digital asset space. However, innovation in the crypto world continues to clash with regulatory pressures. Legal battles, such as those surrounding Tornado Cash, highlight the delicate balance between fostering technological advancement and addressing compliance concerns. As the crypto landscape advances, stablecoins are becoming more than just a tool for trading—they are a foundation for financial innovation. With institutional players increasing their stakes and regulated stablecoins gaining traction, the stage is set for the next phase of growth in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 12:34:21

Solana's DEX exceeded $100 billion in November 2024, attesting to its status as among the most promising cryptocurrencies. The SOL meme coin fever, which has seen rising activity from both whales and new retail investors, has helped to drive this surge in some measure. Though Solana has great momentum, other altcoins are starting to attract investors, including Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance, a radical participant in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization field, quietly creates waves as the market heats up and the crypto world watches for the next great thing. At less than $0.15, Rexas Finance is poised for a rapid climb, maybe rising 41x in six weeks. Let's examine more closely the reasons for the great confidence of analysts and specialists about this Solana substitute. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolutionary Platform with Strong Growth Potential Rexas Finance is changing the scene of asset tokenization. Unlike most blockchain initiatives, Rexas Finance is committed to making real-world asset tokenization available to anyone and provides a user-friendly interface that enables companies and people to quickly tokenize actual assets. Rexas Finance simplifies the procedure for property, vehicles, or other high-value assets, therefore introducing blockchain technologies' capabilities to sectors typically slower to embrace. Strong community support and a robust technological basis have drawn attention to the platform. Rexas Finance is a unique offer in a changing industry since it can democratize access to asset-backed tokens, therefore drawing investors from all walks of life who see great long-term potential. Rexas Finance has advanced remarkably since its early September 2024 inception, especially concerning its presale events. Having seen great demand for its RXS tokens, the project has effectively finished several phases. Rexas Finance is in Stage 8 of its presale as of writing; tokens run at $0.10—up from $0.09 in Stage 7. Out of a $20,750,000 target, the presale has already raised $16,853,181 with 251,029,539 tokens sold from a total supply of 290,000,000 tokens. The expanding understanding of Rexas Finance's special market position fuels this demand. Rexas Finance is a creative answer to a long-standing asset management issue unlike other crypto ventures, which can suffer volatility and lack real-world use cases. Rexas Finance is creating fresh opportunities for investment and financial development by letting individuals tokenize and exchange actual assets on the blockchain. Rexas Finance's Price Projections and Massive Upside Potential Rexas Finance presents an interesting chance in a market where many investors concentrate mostly on high profits. Based on Rexas Finance capitalizing on the continuous bull run and rising acceptance of its real-world asset tokenizing strategy, analysts are projecting a 41x gain in value inside the next 6 weeks. Currently less than $0.15, Rexas Finance offers a reasonable starting place for those wishing to profit from its expansion. Experts think that the value of RXS tokens could rise to as high as $4.00 by the end of this year as the platform picks more traction and enters more general market acceptance. This is in sharp contrast to well-known cryptocurrencies like Solana, whose price performance—despite its optimistic future—is projected to be limited in the near run due to overbought situations and resistance levels. Although Solana is a powerful competitor, Rexas Finance's creative strategy to address practical challenges offers it a possible edge that might result in more quick expansion. Why Rexas Finance is a Strong Solana Substitute Solana has a great reputation, but lately, its price trend has halted because of market conditions and rising competition. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has great potential to grow quickly in a short period since it leads the front in the unexplored sector of real-world asset tokenization. Moreover, the great interest produced by Rexas Finance's presale suggests that the initiative has great investor trust. Features like the Rexas Token Builder and AI Shield, together with strategic alliances and audits (like Certik's most recent verification), guarantee that Rexas Finance is a safe and scalable platform for consumers and investors. Rexas Finance stands to see a significant price increase as the token moves through its presale phases and final listing on main exchanges. Conclusion In terms of blockchain and asset management, the tokenizing platform of Rexas Finance offers a revolutionary prospect. Rexas Finance can rival big cryptocurrencies like Solana by using its creative strategy and strong market acceptance, thus becoming a major participant in the altcoin scene. Investing in Rexas Finance below $0.15 could be your way to diversify your crypto portfolio and experience a 41x return in the next few weeks—a possible growth opportunity that could surpass other prominent cryptocurrencies in a market ready for disturbance.

As stablecoins take center stage for liquidity and trading pairs, Bitcoin appears to be solidifying its status as a store of value rather than a transactional asset. This confluence of reduced sell pressure, increasing institutional trust, and market maturation creates an intriguing setup for Bitcoin. While short-term price movements remain unpredictable, the broader trends suggest that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory is underpinned by strengthening fundamentals. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the focus is shifting from short-term speculation to sustainable growth and adoption. Investors and enthusiasts alike should be prepared for Bitcoin to surprise the market once again, potentially rewriting expectations as it marches forward in its journey.

Among them was a 38-year-old investor who bet early on developing currencies such as Polkadot, Dogecoin, and Solana, thus turning his little existence into one of financial freedom. This investor is now offering his analysis on the 2025 bull run and the five tokens he thinks will define the next wave of crypto success using his outstanding track record and market sense. Unlike the speculative frenzy of past cycles, the investor sees projects with compelling use cases, scalability, and real-world integration favored in the 2025 bull run. Token solutions for actual problems are predicted to rule as institutional investors and governments further embrace blockchain technologies. His Top Five Selections For The Next Bull Run Are Here: Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenizing Real-World Assets Citing its innovative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is the old investors' top choice for the forthcoming cycle. Real estate, gold, and collectibles are among the tangible and intangible assets users of the platform can tokenize, therefore enabling fractional ownership and democratizing investing possibilities. Main Reasons to Track Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Growth At $0.10 in Stage 8 of its presale, RXS has raised almost $16.9 million thus far. Early investors have already experienced large paper returns; the token is slated to debut at $0.20 and presents notable upside potential. Rexas Finance's smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by CertiK, therefore guaranteeing a safe ecosystem given security is a priority. Listing on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko has improved RXS's profile and drawn retail and institutional investors. The platform's $1 million giveaway promotion, whereby 20 participants will each receive $50,000 in RXS, has stoked enthusiasm and community development even more. Utility-Driven Ecosystem: RXS is not merely buzz. Its practical uses— Tokenized fundraising, safe asset management, and DeFi integration—set it apart. The investor thinks RXS could follow in Ethereum's early success since it can transform conventional finance. Polkadot (DOT) Because of its innovative approach to interoperability, Polkadot (DOT) stays a mainstay in the investors' portfolio. Polkadot helps blockchains to easily share data and communicate, so building a single network of distributed apps. Why is Polkadot? Polkadot's unmatched scalability made possible by its parachain technology makes it a first choice for business solutions. Growing numbers of initiatives are based on Polkadot, therefore enhancing the value of the ecosystem. Investors can stake DOT to get pleasing returns, therefore generating a passive income source. The investor perceives Polkadot as inexpensive with untapped potential even though it’s currently valued at a mere fraction of its peak in 2021. Hedera (HBAR) Popular for its energy efficiency and fast transactions, the Enterprise Blockchain Hedera (HBAR) has grown to be a preferred choice for corporate blockchain solutions. Why Hedera Stands Out Enterprising Adoption Hedera's governing council consists of companies including Google, IBM, and Boeing, therefore highlighting its credibility. Low energy usage of HBAR fits with world sustainability targets, hence it is a popular alternative for environmentally minded investors. With a market valuation of $5.36 billion and trading at $0.1402, Hedera has shown fortitude in declining markets. The investor regards Hedera as a long-term investment tool for anyone looking for exposure to blockchain adoption pushed by businesses. Cronos, or Driving Blockchain Adoption via Crypto.com One of the biggest crypto exchanges worldwide, Cronos is the natural token of the Crypto.com ecosystem. The token's use covers staking incentives, trading fee discounts, and involvement in the DeFi ecosystem run of Crypto.com. CRO runs the Visa cards, NFT marketplace, DeFi services, and Crypto.com platform. The rising need for CRO is predicted as Crypto.com grows internationally. At $0.1874 with a market capitalization of almost $5 billion as of writing, the investor regards CRO as an inexpensive stock with great potential for growth. Cronos is positioned to gain from the growing acceptance of crypto services given its close integration into the ecosystem of Crypto.com. Kaspa, or High-Performance Blockchain Emerging blockchain platform Kaspa stresses decentralizing, scalability, and speed. Constructed using the blockDAG protocol, Kaspa is among the quickest blockchains available since it lets transactions be handled in parallel. Why he is Purchasing Kaspa? Kaspa's blockDAG design presents unparalleled scalability and speed, so it is a game-changer in blockchain architecture. The active community and developer environment of Kaspa guarantees ongoing innovation. Kaspa has great growth potential with a price of $0.1545 and a market capitalization of $3.89 billion. Kaspa presents to the investor a high-upside gamble on next-generation blockchain technologies. Conclusion The investor's approach stresses utility, creativity, and diversification as the 2025 bull run gets ready. Rexas Finance is his first choice as its real-world asset tokenizing system shows great expansion possibility. This portfolio is meant to strike the best of both worlds—stability and exponential gains—along with basics like Polkadot, Hedera, Cronos, and Kaspa. The window to act is available right now; for those brave enough to grab it, the benefits could be transformative for their life.

During its 140% rally, ADA reached a multi-year high of $0.80. However, ADA has faced a 5% pullback in the past day, trading at $0.78 as of this writing. However, the question remains: Can Cardano maintain its speed and reach the elusive $2 mark? Or can oncoming technical and market hurdles indicate otherwise? ADA's $2 Dream Might Take a Deeper Hit While ADA's recent gain has been spectacular, multiple technical signs signal that big challenges lay ahead. First, a bearish RSI divergence is emerging on ADA's daily chart, indicating that purchasing pressure is waning despite the market's rising trend. ADA RSI is currently near 68, approaching the overbought zone, indicating a possible correction. Second, the long-term resistance at $0.90 is a crucial obstacle. This level corresponds to key Fibonacci retracement trends and has previously indicated large sell-off zones for ADA. Past rallies have reversed sharply after reaching this stage, resulting in price declines of more than 65%. Furthermore, broader market dynamics, such as lower trading volumes and tighter liquidity in the altcoin sector, increase the possibility of a price reversal. To reach $2, ADA would need to overcome these limitations decisively—a feat that would necessitate considerable institutional interest and market sentiment. Although this feat is not elusive, experts predict it might now happen in 2024, as earlier projected. Instead, Q2 2025 is a more realistic timeframe for Cardano to reach the $2 milestone. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Might Be the Smarter Bet Right Now While Cardano’s projected climb to $2 confronts difficulties, another token is gaining traction: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is a transformational force in the cryptocurrency space, revolutionizing asset tokenization and capturing the market's attention with its creative ecosystem. Rexas Finance offers real-world asset (RWA) tokenization using blockchain technology, exposing investors to real estate, artwork, and commodities. This democratization of high-value markets lowers barriers, increases liquidity, and offers regular investors new opportunities. The project has seen phenomenal acceptance in the ongoing presale stages, with the first five phases completed ahead of schedule. Currently, in Stage 6, Rexas Finance has raised $11.5 million and sold 191 million RXS tokens. The token is currently priced at $0.08, with a price increase to $0.09 scheduled for Stage 7. After the presale, RXS will officially list on at least three tier-1 exchanges at $0.20, with tremendous upside potential for early investors. Notably, Rexas Finance stands out for its strategic decision to forego venture capital funding in favor of a full public presale to assure decentralization. This decision has resulted in a dedicated and involved community while upholding the project's essential ideals. Rexas Finance recently completed a Certik audit, strengthening the project's confidence and demonstrating its dedication to security and transparency. It has also been included on important tracking websites such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, increasing visibility and reaching a larger audience. For investors aiming to optimize their investments, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway. The top 20 winners will each receive $50,000 in RXS tokens. This effort not only rewards early adopters but also creates a thriving community around the coin. RXS is positioned for a significant rally thanks to its novel approach to the enormous RWA market, well-defined roadmap, and upcoming mega listings. Experts predict a huge increase in price once the coin is listed on major exchanges, making now the ideal moment to invest. Conclusion While Cardano's rally to $2 might face some technical issues, Rexas Finance appears as an intriguing alternative with unrivaled growth potential. Don't pass up the opportunity to participate in RXS during its presale stage—join Rexas Finance today and position yourself for future benefits.

Month Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price December $3.85 $4.635 $5.42 OM Price Prediction 2024 As the bullish trend continues, the security-first, RWA-focused layer-1 blockchain is likely to gain momentum. Mantra is built for institutions and developers and provides key features like Cosmos SDK, IBC compatibility, and CosmWasmsupport. As the traditional institutions move towards RWA tokenization, the demand for OM tokens is likely to surge.

37047530,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98187,1732971238,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,XRP Eyes Massive Wins On Trump Overhaul as Ex-CFTC Chair Says SEC May Drop Ripple Fight,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-massive-wins-on-trump-overhaul-as-ex-cftc-chair-says-sec-may-drop-ripple-fight/,"Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo has hinted at a potential pivot in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach to its high-profile legal battle against Ripple over XRP. In a Fox Business interview on Wednesday, Giancarlo suggested that the SEC might abandon its appeal against Ripple after a series of courtroom defeats. When asked by reporter Charles Gasparino, whether the SEC would drop the XRP case, Giancarlo responded, “I think they should… I bet they would ,” emphasizing the need for regulatory agencies to reconsider cases they’ve lost at the trial court level. “I would recommend, it’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases which they have lost at the trial court,” he noted. Giancarlo’s remarks come as optimism surges in the crypto community following Trump’s election victory, raising hopes for a more crypto-friendly agenda. This renewed confidence follows years of backlash against the “regulation by enforcement” approach championed by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, exemplified by the XRP lawsuit . Notably, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, accusing the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After years of legal battles, a landmark ruling in July 2023 concluded that XRP is not inherently a security, especially when sold on secondary markets. Later, Ripple Labs was fined $125 million for the improper sale of XRP tokens. However, both parties have since cross-appealed aspects of the decision, prolonging the case’s uncertain outcome. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been vocal about the impact of the lawsuit on Ripple’s U.S. operations. In a recent interview , Garlinghouse criticized the Biden administration’s “hostile” stance toward cryptocurrency, calling it an “unlawful war” on the industry. He expressed optimism that a Trump administration would provide the clarity and support needed for crypto to thrive in the U.S., potentially making the country a global leader in digital assets again. That said, Trump’s election victory has brought hope for regulatory change. According to the Kalshi prediction website, reports suggest that Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with a pro-innovation stance, is the frontrunner to replace Gensler. Atkins is widely respected for his deep understanding of cryptocurrencies and the SEC’s operations, making him a likely ally for the crypto industry. Additionally, Trump’s team has indicated plans to decentralize crypto oversight, potentially shifting some responsibilities to the CFTC and appointing a dedicated “crypto czar.” Meanwhile, the SEC’s potential retreat from its appeal against Ripple could signal a broader shift in crypto regulation. As the incoming administration prioritizes innovation and clarity, the crypto industry may see a significant turnaround in its U.S. prospects, paving the way for growth and investment.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-11-30 12:53:58
37047624,https://finbold.com/?p=215960,1732971531,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,AI predicts Algorand price for year-end as ALGO reaches new yearly high,https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-algorand-price-for-year-end-as-algo-reaches-new-yearly-high/,"Algorand ( ALGO ) has captured the spotlight in the cryptocurrency market, trading at $0.44 after a dramatic one-day gain of 17% and an impressive 47% rise over the past week. The token has surged above its yearly high of $0.32, established in March, reaching levels unseen since November 2022. With on-chain metrics signaling bullish momentum, ALGO has captured the attention of traders and investors who are speculating on its year-end price trajectory. ALGO seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold ALGO breaks key resistance levels ALGO’s current rally has propelled it beyond a long-term horizontal resistance area, cementing a new yearly high. This bullish move aligns with a broader market recovery and has been fueled by strong fundamentals within the Algorand ecosystem. Notably, Algorand’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has increased by 59% this week, rising from $117.39 million on November 22 to $187.55 million at the time of writing, according to DefiLlama . This growth indicates heightened user activity and ecosystem development, which are critical drivers of price appreciation. Simultaneously, CoinGlass data reveals that Algorand is showing strong bullish momentum, as evidenced by a 147.45% surge in derivatives trading volume, reaching $2.00 billion, and a 34.34% increase in open interest (OI) to $165.93 million. Algorand derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass These metrics reflect significant market interest and new capital entering the market, often a precursor to further price increases. The long/short ratio across platforms leans bullish, with Binance’s ALGO/USDT ratio at 1.2202 and OKX’s ratio at 1.09, indicating traders are largely optimistic. Liquidation data supports this sentiment, as 24-hour short liquidations totaled $2.98 million, significantly outpacing longs at $1.47 million, suggesting shorts are being squeezed as the price rises. Additionally, top trader data from Binance highlights a strong long bias, with a long/short position ratio of 1.9423. Overall, the data suggests a continued bullish outlook for ALGO, though traders should remain cautious of potential corrections given its rapid gains and overbought RSI levels. Finbold has also identified the buy signal flashed by ALGO last week, based on technical indicators aligning with the token’s impressive bullish momentum. Technical indicators: Strength and caution Technical indicators have also presented compelling bullish signals. The formation of a “ Golden Cross ,” where the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA, suggests a robust upward trend and has historically been a reliable buy signal. ALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView However, caution is warranted as the RSI stands at 71 on the weekly chart, indicating that ALGO has entered the overbought territory. This increases the likelihood of a short-term pullback or consolidation, which could present a strategic entry point for traders aiming to capitalize on the next potential upward move. AI prediction for Algorand by year-end Amid this backdrop, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o for insights into Algorand’s potential year-end price. According to the AI model, if the current bullish momentum continues and investor interest remains strong, ALGO could realistically reach $0.70 to $0.85 by the end of the year. ChatGPT outlook on Algorand price. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold In a more optimistic scenario, supported by a broader market recovery and continued ecosystem growth, ALGO could potentially push toward $1. It’s essential to note, however, that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and actual prices may differ from predictions. Thus, investors should conduct thorough research and consider multiple factors when evaluating potential investments.

The analysts predict that the Solana price could hit $5,000, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) , another emerging crypto gem, is poised to surge 50,000% before Christmas. Solana Price Surpasses ATH But This Analyst Sees A $5,000 Price Mark Ahead Two days ago, the Solana price hit its all-time high price and surpassed it reaching a new peak price of $263.93.

Following this analyst‘s projection for the Solana price, investors are on their toes as they keep tabs on Solana (SOL) and how it will perform especially with Christmas around the corner. The analyst prediction remains a speculation, however many traders and investors are optimistic as the Solana price holds as the token holds an 87% bullish sentiment on CoinMarketCap. For the record, Solana (SOL) has jumped by 50.56% in the past month. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Serves As A Golden Investment Opportunity In The Coming Bull Cycle Revered as one of the next best AI crypto token with immense potential for growth, WallitIQ (WLTQ) had succeeded in attracting a huge traction in its ongoing presale.

Remember the Dogecoin phenomenon? It skyrocketed from meme status to global fame, minting millionaires along the way. But if you didn’t get in early on Doge’s moon mission, you might’ve felt like you missed the train. Well, here’s the good news: the crypto universe always has room for the next big thing. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a revolutionary meme coin that’s making waves right out of the gate. With a presale price of just $0.000004 and an ambitious listing price of $0.0006, BTFD is positioning itself as a game-changer. The potential 15,000% ROI isn’t just a headline—it’s a clarion call for investors looking to capitalise on the next big crypto success story. BTFD Coin: The Best New Meme Coin Presale Stealing the Spotlight BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coins.

Launching at a presale price of $0.000004, BTFD is setting the stage for jaw-dropping gains. A post-presale listing at $0.0006 translates to a staggering 15,000% ROI for early investors. But there’s more to BTFD than just numbers. This coin is creating a full-fledged ecosystem that’s as fun as it is rewarding. At the heart of its appeal is a cutting-edge Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, allowing players to earn real rewards while diving into an immersive gaming experience. Think of it as gaming with financial perks—it’s where entertainment meets opportunity. For those looking to grow their portfolios passively, BTFD offers staking rewards with impressive APYs.

Riding the wave of internet culture, it launched with a bang, pulling in a loyal following and a hefty chunk of market share. Its quirky branding and community-driven ethos made it a standout, and the early returns? Nothing short of spectacular. At its peak, Brett was a hot commodity. Investors were cashing in on its viral appeal, with the coin’s value riding high on a wave of hype and optimism. But, as with many meme coins, its momentum faced a cooling-off period. While Brett remains a notable name in the space, its trajectory has levelled out, giving newer coins like BTFD the chance to shine. Brett’s strength lies in its community, which continues to champion its cause. But without additional innovations or significant market moves, it’s unclear whether Brett can reclaim its early glory.

Its Federation Council approved a federal bill on November 27, following its passage in the State Duma. The legislation, which awaits President Vladimir Putin’s signature to become law, classifies digital currencies as property and exempts crypto transactions from value-added tax (VAT). New Crypto Framework in Russia Under the new law , income from cryptocurrency sales will be subject to a personal income tax of 13%- 15%, aligning with the tax rates for securities transactions. Crypto mining operators, however, are also exempt from VAT on mined coins but are required to report their activities to tax authorities. Income derived from mining will be taxed based on the market value of the digital assets at the time of receipt. Non-compliance with reporting requirements will result in fines of 40,000 rubles, approximately $360. This move comes as Bitcoin reaches record highs against the Russian ruble, reflecting a growing interest in digital currencies within the nation. The bill also recognizes the use of digital currencies in foreign trade agreements under Russia’s experimental legal crypto framework. Notably, authorized mining infrastructure operators’ services will remain tax-free within the country. Once enacted, these measures aim to formalize Russia’s crypto economy, providing regulatory clarity while introducing oversight to align with the government’s tax objectives. The latest development comes a week after officials announced plans to curb cryptocurrency mining this winter to prevent electricity shortages. As reported earlier, mining will be suspended in Siberian regions like Irkutsk and Buryatia from December to mid-March and face similar seasonal bans through 2031. Year-round bans will take effect in 2024 in the North Caucasus and Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine, including Donetsk and Kherson. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak’s government commission approved the measure. Russia’s Crypto Exchange Traffic Climbs 8% Over the past month, Bitcoin has witnessed massive growth nearing $100,000 which spurred global excitement in the cryptocurrency market, including notable activity in Russia. Research by MegaFon, a leading Russian telecommunications provider, revealed that internet traffic to major crypto exchanges in the country grew by 8% in early November. In addition to Bitcoin’s price, this spike was also driven in part by recent changes in local cryptocurrency regulations. This mirrors a global trend, as MegaFon’s findings indicate an 8% to 10% month-over-month increase in web visits to the 20 most popular crypto exchanges. Russian users accounted for an estimated 27% to 30% of the overall traffic to these platforms, highlighting their growing interest in the evolving crypto market.

Community Feedback and Insights When asked what factors lead to a token being listed on Binance, Conlan clarified there are no guarantees. “A few different factors are considered by this secret research team,” she stated. “Community feedback and input, as well as watching what community trends and insights are around this, are definitely important,” Conlan added, emphasizing that hype alone does not drive listings. Conlan acknowledged the criticism surrounding memecoins, saying they often receive “a lot of negative coverage” due to their lack of utility. “But we know that there are up-and-coming memecoins that have that utility built in, which is really what we all need because we need that use case,” she explained. Keeping the Community Engaged Conlan predicted significant growth in the crypto community over the next 18 to 24 months. This, she said, will require a sharper focus on projects with real use cases. “It is born and frivolous at the beginning, but if you want to keep the community involved, it is critical,” she noted. Conlan highlighted the importance of innovation, stating, “What we should be talking about more is the innovation that’s going to come out, like the innovation that’s been prepped in this bear cycle. What people are building.” Her views echo those of Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who recently criticized the memecoin ecosystem. “Let’s build real applications using blockchain,” CZ wrote in a Nov. 26 X post, describing memecoins as becoming “a little” weird.

Here’s how the increasing liquidity could impact Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market. Can The Increasing Stablecoin Cap Push Bitcoin Price To $100,000? Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed in its weekly report that the stablecoin market capitalization has experienced notable growth in the past month. According to the crypto firm, the stablecoin market cap surged past $190 billion this week for the first time since late April 2022 when Bitcoin price was hovering around the $40,000 mark. This impressive growth comes on the back of Bitcoin’s unprecedented run to a six-figure valuation and the explosion of the total market capitalization to over $3.4 trillion. IntoTheBlock noted that stablecoins have seen increased adoption in the past few weeks, as investors continue to run toward riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Specifically, this expansion has primarily been in favor of Tether’s USDT, which continues to completely dominate the stablecoin market. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that USDT holds about 72% of the market share, with a market capitalization of over $133 billion — reminiscent of the crypto market highs of 2021. Interestingly, the demand for the Tether stablecoin appears to be climbing, with a weekly mint of over $3 billion of new USDT tokens. Most notably, over $13 billion USDT has been minted since the start of November, with the stablecoins largely flowing toward centralized exchanges. This injection of fresh liquidity into centralized exchanges has been reflected in the market, especially with the strong bullish momentum witnessed in the past few weeks. Historically, increasing stablecoin inflows into exchanges is positively correlated with market prices, as they often represent higher “buying power” for the investors. As such, the continuation of this positive trend could be pivotal to the dream of Bitcoin price surpassing $100,000. While the flagship cryptocurrency has seemingly recovered from its recent slump beneath the $93,000 level, it has not exactly shown strength sufficient to surpass the six-figure milestone. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin continues to hover around the $96,500 mark, reflecting a more than 2% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is still in the red on the weekly timeframe, with a 3% decline in the past seven days. BTC Market Becoming Stable And Mature: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock also disclosed in its weekly report that Bitcoin’s market climate seems to be maturing, as volatility is currently trending downwards. According to the blockchain platform, the market’s high volatility has been a long-standing criticism point for BTC as a store of value. However, IntoTheBlock noted that investors can expect the Bitcoin price performance to be more stable, as retail and institutional adoption increases and volatility diminishes. Hence, the premier cryptocurrency could become an even more reliable store of value.",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|BTCUSDT|IntoTheBlock|stablecoin|USDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 13:30:32

The digital asset defied market trends, steadily gaining value and capturing attention for its impressive rally. Analysts are optimistic, suggesting that Dogecoin’s upward momentum could continue, possibly reaching the ambitious $1 milestone. This bullish sentiment mirrors excitement around other major assets like XRP, signaling Dogecoin’s potential to rally further in the market. Will Dogecoin Price Skyrocket Past $1 Like XRP? Over the past month, Dogecoin’s value has soared by 150%, including significant gains recorded in the last week. The meme coin’s upward trend has rekindled hopes of it approaching its all-time high (ATH) again. Dogecoin’s ATH was $0.7376, achieved on May 8, 2021. Analysts are comparing it to XRP’s recent rally past $1, which began near the $0.50 mark and has now pushed the XRP price toward $1.90. This has led to speculation that Dogecoin might replicate XRP’s bullish trajectory. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView The price of Dogecoin has risen sharply, marking its highest level in over a week. Market speculation about Elon Musk’s potential plans to incorporate payment features into his social platforms is fueling this surge. The broader crypto market is also experiencing a surge, with Bitcoin trading above $97,000. Iif Bitcoin reaches the critical $100,000 mark, it could further catalyze Dogecoin’s price movement. Such momentum may push Dogecoin price prediction closer to or beyond the $1 milestone. At the time of writing, the DOGE price is at $0.4236, with a surge of 3% in the past 24-hours. Meme coins like Shiba Inu, PEPE, BONK, and WIF are also experiencing notable price increases. This collective performance has strengthened market confidence in Dogecoin’s potential rally. The positive sentiment across the cryptocurrency space continues to drive the enthusiasm behind Dogecoin’s impressive recovery. Analyst Predicts $1.3 Dogecoin Breakout Crypto expert has highlighted a bullish pennant pattern in Dogecoin’s daily chart, signaling potential gains. The expert suggests that DOGE is on the verge of breaking out from the pennant formation soon. Based on this technical analysis, the measured price target from the pole indicates a possible rally to $1.3. This projection has captured significant attention from market enthusiasts and Dogecoin supporters. Bullish pennants typically emerge during upward trends, and a breakout could further validate the strong buying sentiment around Dogecoin.

While some projects promise quick wealth and internet-fueled hype, they also pose major risks for users and platforms. Rachel Conlan, chief marketing officer at Binance, stated the importance of due diligence in evaluating such projects during her appearance at Aus Crypto Con 2024. “The team does a lot of due diligence on the founders of the project, who is involved, and what’s potentially on their roadmap,” Conlan stated in an interview. She highlighted the critical steps exchanges like Binance take before listing tokens . Despite the ongoing skepticism surrounding memecoins, she acknowledged the potential of some to evolve beyond hype and deliver genuine utility—a factor she believes is essential for long-term success. Memecoins: More Than Just Hype? Memecoins have historically attracted negative attention due to their perceived lack of utility and susceptibility to scams. Conlan noted that while the ecosystem has its share of frivolous projects, emerging tokens with real-world applications could shift the narrative. She stated: “But we know that there are up-and-coming memecoins that have that utility built in, which is really what we all need because we need that use case,” she explained. Binance’s listing process takes community feedback, trends, and project insights into account, though no single factor guarantees a token’s inclusion. Conlan also forecasted rapid growth in the crypto space over the next 18 to 24 months, urging the industry to focus on innovative blockchain applications being developed during the current bear market. Her sentiments echo those of Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who recently expressed frustration with the memecoin sector. In a November 26 post on X, CZ remarked that the ecosystem, once funny and engaging, had become increasingly “weird.” “Let’s build real applications using blockchain,” CZ urged, emphasizing the need for substance over speculation. High Risks, High Rewards Despite the controversies, memecoins continue to produce stories of financial success . A recent example involves a Solana-based memecoin trader who turned a modest $160 investment into millions by betting on a viral meme project. While such stories captivate audiences, they underscore the volatility and unpredictability of the space.

Notably, the Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will propose key proposals to reform government regulations and agencies. Analysts Dogecoin price could breakout above $1 and move further with a massive rally to $2.2. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, are rallying support for President-elect Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. The bipartisan interest in DOGE underscores growing momentum for cutting federal spending and increasing accountability in government operations. Besides, DOGE has also drawn support from a growing roster of private-sector leaders, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman,and former Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. “We are entrepreneurs, not politicians. We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs,” noted Musk and Ramaswamy in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. Musk’s activities and statements around political circles has grown increasingly, and he has even broadly stated that he would be firing some federal employees when Trump takes over. However,critics have raised concerns about the transparency and oversight of DOGE, due to its reliance on private-sector volunteers rather than traditional government officials.

Marcus took to microblogging platform X to reveal that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was indirectly involved in the project’s death. The former PayPal president decided to clear the air on the issue after Marc Andreessen discussed the project on the Joe Rogan Show. According to Marcus, the project was on course to become a transformative global payment system until political machinations led to its death. Marcus noted that he needed to shed light on the incidents that went on behind the scenes and ultimately led to the project’s failure. David Marcus discusses issues surrounding Libra’s lunch According to David Marcus, the company had the initiative to create a stablecoin-powered payments system based on a blockchain to solve the problem of cross-border payments in 2019. The initiative led to the birth of Libra, which Marcus concedes immediately started to raise eyebrows. He noted that even though the project was backed by about 28 companies, it immediately entered the crosshairs of regulators. How Libra Was Killed. I never shared this publicly before, but since @pmarca opened the floodgates on @joerogan ’s pod, it feels appropriate to shed more light on this. As a reminder, Libra (then Diem) was an advanced, high-performance, payments-centric blockchain paired with a… — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) November 30, 2024 Marcus mentioned that within weeks of the announcement, he faced the Senate Committee on Banking and the House Financial Services Committee to defend it. However, those summons were smaller compared to the scrutiny the project will face later. He mentioned that in the next two years after its unveiling, there were so many efforts to address certain concerns from regulators. Marcus noted that regulators had concerns related to financial crimes, money laundering, and consumer protection. After scaling through those concerns, the company eventually secured the green light for the project to move forward in 2021. However, he noted that the approval was for the limited pilot rollout and it was given by some members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. “By spring of 2021 (yes they slowly played us at every step), we had addressed every last possible regulatory concern across financial crime, money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, buffers, and so much more, and we were ready to launch,” Marcus added. Janet Yellen warned Fed Chair about backing Libra’s launch In his X post, David Marcus clarified that while the lead-up to the proposed launch did not come without hiccups, the company had been ready for a slow, small-scale pilot rollout. He even noted that Fed Chair Jay Powell and the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve supported the project. However, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen threw a wrench in their plans when she got involved in the discussion. Marcus highlighted that he was not in their bi-weekly meetings but as he was told, Yellen told the Fed Chair that if he backed the Libra project, it may result in “political suicide.” She went on to intimate that she wouldn’t be there to back him if it eventually happened. Notably, Marcus noted that he did not witness the conversation, but that was when the Libra dream died. “I wasn’t in the room when this conversation happened, so take these words with a grain of salt, but effectively this was the moment Libra was killed,” he said. After Yellen’s warnings, Marcus noted that the Fed called the financial institutions participating in the program, discouraging them from moving ahead with the project. Marcus said each bank got a statement that read: “We can’t stop you from moving forward and launching, but we are not comfortable with you doing so.”, noting that the banks started to pull out of it after that. Marcus mentioned that the project passed all regulatory and legal checks, meaning its death was politically motivated. However, Marcus said he left the ordeal with many lessons, noting that the design was hailed across the technology industry. He also highlighted that if any entity wants to build an open money grid for the world, it should do it on a neutral and decentralized network, just like Bitcoin. David Marcus has moved on from Libra and is currently working at Lightspark, an open payment method built on the lightning network.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 13:39:29

While speaking about the often-criticized nature of memecoins due to their perceived lack of real-world applications, Conlan said there has been a shift towards focusing on projects with built-in utility and strong community engagement. “Memecoins have gotten a lot of negative coverage because of their lack of use case,” Conlan acknowledged. “But we know there are new memecoins that have that use case, which is really what we all need because we need that use case.” Related News: Legendary Bullish Forecaster Tom Lee Assesses Bitcoin's $250,000 Target Next Year, Answers the Question of Whether Altcoin Season Will Come Conlan explained that Binance’s undercover research team uses a multi-faceted approach when evaluating potential listings, with a strong emphasis on community input and trends. “It’s definitely important to watch what the community trends and insights are on this topic, as well as feedback and input from the community,” Conlan said, rejecting the idea that hype alone drives listing decisions. The CMO also discussed the potential for exponential growth in the crypto community over the next 18 to 24 months.

With this, the bulls appear to have become active as the buying pressure has begun to mount. After a massive rise in the last week, the price remains consolidated within a range. Does this suggest the Bears are about to take over the rally? The weekly chart of LINK price suggests the bears are trying hard to gain control over the rally. The Gaussian channel has turned bearish while the 50/200 day MA is again trying for a bullish crossover after a failed attempt a few weeks before. However, the RSI remains elevated while the OBV levels undergo a small rise, suggesting the traders are bullish on LINK. Moreover, the trade setup suggests the next weekly candle could be a strong bullish one, incurring more than 30% gains and reaching 1 FIB at yearly highs close to $25. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum had a bearish beginning to its trading journey after hitting the highs; however, the token further raised to mark a new ATH at $2.4. Meanwhile, the token faced a massive pullback, marking the bottom, followed by a healthy rebound after a brief consolidation. Currently, the ARB price is in the middle of a fine ascending trend, with the upper targets at around $1.22. As seen in the above chart, the ARB price is testing the trend reversal zone just below $1 for the past few days. Unfortunately, the bears have held the range, which suggests yet another pullback could be fast approaching. Besides, the drop in buying volume suggests the MACD may undergo a bearish crossover, which substantiates the bearish claim. Therefore, the ARB price may head back to $0.92, followed by a rebound above $1 and reaching the upper resistance zone around $1.22 before the end of 2024. Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis Polygon or POL price has maintained a healthy ascending trend since the start of the month with a massive growth in buying volume. Moreover, the price has entered a crucial range, clearing which could revive a strong rise towards the higher targets. The technicals are in bullish favor, and hence, the price is believed to rise and reach the pivotal resistance soon. After a massive descending trend, the MATIC price has begun to rise, aiming to reach the crucial resistance. Meanwhile, the Gaussian channel turned bullish after remaining bearish for over 6 months. This suggests the price is expected to remain elevated as the 200-day MA is offering strong support to the price. Therefore, the price appears to be primed to rise and reach the important range, which is also the trend reversal level around $0.8 before the end of 2024.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LINK|TRADING|ZRX|ARB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 13:49:08

In 2024, the memecoins and meme coin creators count grown exponentially, especially with token launcher platforms like Pump.Fun, where millions of tokens have been launched in just a few months. One such token’s creator has made a major crypto transaction mistake, losing $150k within seconds, leaving the crypto community in shock as to how such an experienced individual could make such a foolish mistake. How The ‘I Have Nothing’ Meme Coin Creator Lost $150k? I Have Nothing meme coin creator DomTheTroll lost $15ok during a live stream while conducting a routine operation. This happened a few days ago, when DomTheTroll, a popular YouTuber and live-streamer, accidentally burned his tokens by transferring them to a burn address. This is one of the biggest transaction blunders, as the meme coin creator lost all of his crypto holdings worth around $150,000, that too in front of hundreds of viewers. As already clear, a burn address permanently locks the cryptos with no way to recover, which has put DomTheTroll in a major loss. Even the crypto community sympathized with the creator, as it was a very common mistake and has happened to many, where people missed cross-checking information before proceeding with crypto transactions. This “dev” accidentally burned $150k of tokens (everything he had) while live streaming pic.twitter.com/C6CRSzFaXE — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) November 27, 2024 Interestingly, it is normal for crypto investors to earn millions in the trading industry, but such hefty losses are also equally normal. Two More Crypto Users Made Similar Mistake Similar to the meme coin creator, a crypto trader lost millions as he transferred $3.08M worth of tokens to the wrong address. The trader intended to transfer funds to a receiving wallet but did not cross-check the entire wallet address and transferred the tokens to a scammer’s wallet. The scammer has been planning this scam for a long time. He custom-created a wallet address that has a similar character as the receiving wallet. He then created a transaction history with the crypto trader. In the end, the scammer got $3.08M after the victim transferred 7M PYTH. Additionally, another crypto user lost $25 Million after mistaking the safe module for the safe wallet. This happened at the beginning of the month when the user intended to transfer his Renzo Restaked ETH to a safe module. Instead, he sent these tokens to the safe module, which has locked these tokens in a Smart Contract forever. The only solution was to request the Renzo team to modify the Smart Contract, but due to compliance issues, they could not, leading the crypto user to a major loss. These are some of the examples that have happened this month, but there are more. Overall, this confirms how often such crypto transaction mistakes happen, leaving crypto investors in major losses. What’s The Lesson Here? In November alone, three prominent crypto transaction mistakes were noticed that have left crypto users in heavy losses. However, there are many more, and people are losing millions with a minor mistake. The popular Youtuber and meme coin creator lost $150k within a second while running a routine operation. More importantly, hundreds of people get to witness this incident live, leading to it becoming a major lesson for others.

The SEC also accused the firm of fraud in how it commingled and misappropriated investors’ funds. US SEC Charges Touzi Capital And Its CEO In a press release, the US SEC announced that it had filed a civil action against Touzi Capital and its CEO, Eng Taing, for allegedly defrauding over a thousand investors in unregistered securities offerings that raised over $100 million. The Commission’s complaint also alleges that the defendants misled investors in how they handled the proceeds from these offerings. The SEC stated that Touzi Capital and its CEO commingled and misappropriated investors’ funds and raised capital through false and misleading statements. These statements included ones about the liquidity of their investments and other factors related to their profitability. For context, Touzi Capital is a firm that offers investment opportunities in real estate, blockchain, and private equity. The US SEC handles issues related to securities violations, with their regulatory oversight extending to the crypto industry. However, CoinGape recently reported that Donald Trump plans to give the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of the $3 trillion crypto market, which will include matters related to blockchain technology. Further Details Of The Commission’s Complaint According to the US SEC’s complaint, between 2021 and early 2023, Touzi Capital and Taing conducted unregistered securities offerings of its crypto asset mining funds. The firm stated that these funds were to finance the operations of a particular crypto asset mining entity and raised almost $95 million from over 1,200 investors nationwide. However, the firm looks to have misled investors in this regard. The Commission alleges that the defendants commingled these funds among its various businesses, some unrelated to crypto asset mining. The CEO’s involvement was also highlighted as he allegedly misappropriated some of these funds for personal use while misleading investors on how much profit they were making from their business operations. Similarly, the US SEC alleges that Touzi Capital raised almost $23 million for its debt rehabilitation business but commingled these funds with those of its crypto asset mining business and other unrelated businesses. The Commission also allegedly misled investors about the stability of these investments, comparing them to high-yield money market accounts when, in fact, the investments were risky and illiquid. Despite this, the SEC said that Touzi continued to recruit more investments even after the investments began failing. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgement interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. It also wants an officer and director bar against Taing. Amid this development, another case is also in focus, as ex-CFTC and XRP lawyers say that the Commission could drop its appeal in the Ripple lawsuit .

ChainLink’s oracle technology remains the gold standard for connecting blockchain data to the real world. Avalanche offers lightning-fast transactions and scalability. As innovation continues in the DeFi sector, 1FUEL (OFT) is the latest player to bring so many benefits to the table. With its support for one-click cross chain transactions, 1FUEL is the bridge that connects many blockchain networks together. It does not come as a surprise that analysts regard 1FUEL as important to the DeFi ecosystem as Avalanche and ChainLink. As for investors, where are they placing their bets – Avalanche, ChainLink, or 1FUEL? Avalanche: Building DeFi Avalanche has an important role to play in the DeFi space. Its native utility token is called AVAX. It powers transactions, projects, and smart contracts within its ecosystem. Avalanche’s TVL has been rising. The layer-1 network stands out among its competitors due to its advanced features and user-friendly design. It is based on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This makes it energy-efficient and scalable. Avalanche attracts a wide range of DeFi users and investors due to its innovative features. How to Simplify DeFi With 1FUEL The DeFi ecosystem still has room for growth despite its achievements in the last few years. This prompted the creation of 1FUEL, a secure crypto wallet for cross-chain transactions. As a privacy-focused cryptocurrency it is changing how users interact with blockchain transactions. It has a built-in mixer to anonymize transactions. This helps users hide their digital trail and protect themselves from prying eyes. One of 1FUEL’s most important features is cold storage for crypto. Crypto users have lost more than $70 million in hacks in November alone. Hackers target hot wallets such as exchange wallets. With 1FUEL’s military-grade cold storage for crypto, users are assured that their holdings are safely locked away from potential exploits. This new project has been called one of the top crypto presales of 2024 because of its investor-friendly tokenomics. 1 billion 1FUEL tokens have been minted, with half of the token supply reserved for presale buyers. Holders can also earn passive income through generous staking rewards, in addition to that 1FUEL offers physical and virtual debit cards to users. These cards are linked to users’ 1FUEL wallets, allowing real-time crypto transactions. Its P2P exchange is great for converting fiat to crypto or vice versa. Many people have been burned while trying to cash out their digital holdings. Moreover, the underbanked have no clear access to crypto. With the P2P exchange platform, 1FUEL is the great equalizer. Another important factor is security. Many projects have been hacked because of lax security infrastructure. The team behind 1FUEL is staying on top of the game by constantly having its smart contract audited for potential exploits. The smart contract audits have indicated a clean bill of health so far. ChainLink Unveils Technical Milestone ChainLink recently launched two privacy-enhancing features as it aims to beef up its capabilities. The first product to be added is CCIP Private Transaction, a decentralized encryption protocol. The second feature is Blockchain Privacy Manager. This feature connects institutions to private networks, enhancing anonymity. These developments come naturally in 1FUEL’s set of innovative features. ChainLink has hit the nail on the head with this set of features, making it more attractive to DeFi users. Conclusion The secure crypto wallet 1Fuel is the best cryptocurrency to buy now. It offers innovative features that resonate well with investors and DeFi users. Users interested in safe crypto transactions should own the 1FUEL wallet. This secure crypto wallet will eventually extend support for Avalanche and ChainLink. As the year comes to a close, investors are flocking to 1FUEL’s token presale in anticipation of substantial gains.

For example, a coin like Dogecoin rose from its humble beginnings to a market cap of a staggering $64.2 billion at the time of writing). A more recent example is the success of PEPE in captivating the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. These successes have put a stamp on the immense potential of digital assets to give astronomical returns. While these meme coins have created excitement, the smart investor is now looking at another kind of innovation FUEL, a next-generation cryptocurrency wallet positioned to change asset management in the blockchain space. The market evolution: From Dogecoin to PEPE Dogecoin has grown to become the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market cap with a market cap of $59.3 billion thanks to its simplicity, widespread adoption and celebrity endorsements. In recent weeks, Dogecoin has lost double-digit values as the crypto market experienced a temporary dip. However, the coin has since recouped its losses and is now up 2% in the past week. This growth trajectory will continue in the anticipated bull run this December. Meanwhile, the PEPE coin was designed to satisfy crypto investors’ appetite for speculative investments. The coin, which promises no utility to its investors, quickly gained success after launch, growing to become the 19th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $8.3 billion. At the time of writing, PEPE is up 107% in the past month. Like Dogecoin, it has experienced significant declines in the past weeks, dropping by over 7% in the last 7 days. Although temporary, the recent declines in Dogecoin and PEPE have prompted investors to seek more rewarding investments, and what better coin to turn to than 1FUEL. This coin is expected to give over 100X returns post-launch? Why investors are turning to 1FUEL? Investors are flocking to 1FUEL, drawn by its innovative solutions to simplify cryptocurrency transactions and enhance security. Unlike traditional wallets, 1FUEL’s one-click cross-chain transactions make it easy to trade across networks like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain without juggling multiple tokens. This streamlined experience minimizes errors and appeals to both newcomers and seasoned traders. Security and privacy are at the heart of 1FUEL’s appeal. Advanced cryptographic techniques, disposable wallets, and a built-in mixer ensure transactions remain anonymous, while multi-layered security protects assets from hacks. For those seeking safer, smarter ways to manage crypto, 1FUEL delivers. Its integrated peer-to-peer exchange allows direct, cost-efficient trading without intermediaries, even across different blockchains—all powered by a single asset: 1FUEL. This versatility positions it as a leader in cross-chain trading. Bridging the gap between digital assets and everyday spending, 1FUEL’s virtual and physical debit cards let users spend crypto like fiat, making it practical for real-world transactions. With such features, 1FUEL is rapidly becoming a must-watch token for forward-thinking investors. The bigger picture: Utility over hype Where Dogecoin and PEPE enjoyed massive attention, their long-term sustainability is highly reliant on community hype and speculative trading. In contrast, 1FUEL provides real utility, solving actual problems that stand in the way of cryptocurrency adoption. With 1FUEL still making waves in its presale, this is the perfect time for investors to join the revolution.

According to data from Farside, the $332 million figure surpasses the previous inflow record of $295 million set on November 11. Much of the credit can be directed towards BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, accounting for about $250 million of the total inflows recorded on November 29. Spot Ether ETFs daily inflow record by months. Source: Farside According to the ETF Store’s president, BlackRock’s ETHA has done well since its launch on July 29. Geraci pointed out that the investment vehicle has inched above $2 billion in inflows since its creation. Ethereum has had a moderate reaction to the development, trading at $3,662, with a small rise of 1.88% in the last 24 hours. ETH may be primed for a rally as Ether ETF inflows grow Many analysts see Bitcoin’s declining dominance of the overall crypto market share as the perfect opportunity for altcoins, including Ethereum to make their mark in the bull market. According to pseudonymous trader Pentoshi, this is the early sign of what is to happen to Ethereum. He noted that with increased inflows, sellers begin to get absorbed, which can lead to a surge. Meanwhile, another analyst also pointed out a remarkable achievement, noting that Ether ETF inflows were higher than Bitcoin ETFs on the day. Although only a difference of $10 million, it is still a remarkable feat for the second-largest digital asset according to market cap. Hartmann Capital founder Felix Hartmann was happy with the achievement, noting that Wall Street has decided to join the fun. “Don’t midcurve it, alt rotation has begun last week and Wall Street is officially joining the fun,” he said . Ethereum becomes top USDT network Ethereum ETF inflows are increasing at a time when Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing outflows. For instance, Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of $224 million between November 22 and 27. In comparison, Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $35 million, largely affected by the outflows recorded on November 25. Ethereum was also boosted by its decentralized finance (DeFi) system’s legal victory this week, boosting investor confidence. Meanwhile, Ethereum has inched above TRON as the blockchain for USDT, with a supply of $60 billion. Ethereum flipped TRON due to a 9.5% increase of USDT on the network, coupled with a drop of 1.5% of USDT on TRON. With TRON dropping to around $58 billion, Ethereum finally has its first lead since August 2022. Total USDT supply also closed at $132 million, with the all-time high figure seen as a reflection of the wider bullish trend in the crypto market. Tether, as a stablecoin, has been integral to the progress of the crypto industry, providing liquidity and facilitating capital glows within the system. Ethereum’s dominance may be linked to its large-scale use by financial institutions to tokenize US dollar-backed assets. Meanwhile, TRON is still the go-to in inflation-prone countries because of its low fees and transaction speed, helping users save more USDT. Ethereum’s lead began on November 21 and increased the gap on November 23. This was due to Tether choosing to mint $2 billion on Ethereum compared to $1 billion on TRON.

Ethereum Upgrades to Proof-of-Stake Technology The London hard fork is a significant Ethereum blockchain upgrade. It changed the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter). He explained how Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is more decentralized than Proof-of-Work (PoW). Notable Ethereum Blockchain Upgrades in 5 Years Here are some key upgrades in the past five years that shaped Ethereum as the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. 2024 : Cancun-Deneb (“Dencun”) : This upgrade aimed to improve Ethereum’s scalability, security, and usability, setting the stage for further enhancements. 2023 : Shanghai-Capella (“Shapella”) : Enabled the withdrawal of staked Ether (ETH), marking a significant milestone in Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. 2022 : Paris (The Merge) : Successfully transitioned Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, reducing energy consumption and increasing security. Bellatrix : Prepared the Ethereum network for The Merge by introducing the necessary PoS consensus logic. Gray Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring a smooth transition to PoS. 2021 : Arrow Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” again, providing more time for the transition to PoS. Altair : Introduced several improvements to the Beacon Chain, including better validator incentives and enhanced security. London : Implemented the highly anticipated EIP-1559, which reformed the transaction fee market, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Berlin : Introduced several protocol upgrades, including improved gas efficiency and enhanced security features. 2020 : Beacon Chain genesis : Launched the Beacon Chain, marking the beginning of Ethereum’s transition to PoS. Staking deposit contract deployed : Enabled users to deposit ETH and participate in the PoS consensus algorithm. Muir Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” to ensure a smooth transition to PoS. How ETH Gas Affects Ethereum Price The blockchain upgrades Ethereum receives aim to solve the trilemma of blockchain, i.e., balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. The switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) enhanced these aspects. Ethereum’s transaction fees (gas fees) plummeted post-upgrade, drawing more investors. Gas fees are like taxes, measured in Gwei, required for secure transactions. As of November 30, the gas fee for a transaction on the ETH network as of No data found for ethereum on 2 hours ago is 14 Gwei. When Ethereum’s on-chain value grows, presenting opportunities, investors flock, driving gas fees up. This typically occurs during market upswings, peaking at all-time highs.

While European and Asian markets barely managed to tread water, U.S. stocks were off breaking records like they didn’t get the memo about inflation and tariffs. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% during a week where half of Wall Street was on holiday and Trump’s latest trade threats were making headlines. It wasn’t even close. Europe’s Stoxx 600 scraped up a measly 0.4%, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index did slightly better with 0.8%. American markets are running circles around the rest of the world, and they look set to keep doing so. U.S. large-cap stocks are about to close out their best year against global competitors since 1997. Corporate America’s borrowing machine is running smoothly, even with interest rates, and day traders are raking in profits on everything from leveraged ETFs to crypto. It’s fascinating to witness. Trump, tariffs, and treasury yields This week was pure chaos for us geopolitically, but you wouldn’t know it by looking at the S&P 500. Trump announced his pick for Treasury Secretary, sending investors into a frenzy of optimism. A few days later, he stirred up more volatility with brand new threats of aggressive tariffs against close U.S. trading partners. Meanwhile, inflation data for October came in hot, showing prices climbing yet again. Did any of this faze Wall Street? Not even a little. The S&P 500 ended the week in the green, while the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) (the market’s fear gauge) dropped to its lowest level in four months. Treasury yields took a nosedive, with the 10-year benchmark falling 22 basis points. For context, French bonds had a rough week thanks to yet another political drama, hitting their widest yield gap against German bonds since 2012. EPFR data from Barclays showed that while money poured into U.S. stocks, Europe and emerging markets saw outflows. Japan’s yen was a rare bright spot, strengthening past 150 against the dollar for the first time in over a month. Tokyo inflation data came in higher than expected, with core prices rising in line with estimates. Traders are now betting on a 60% chance that the Bank of Japan will hike rates next month. That’s big news for Japan, but it’s not enough to steal Wall Street’s thunder. China, meanwhile, is struggling to keep up. Miners like Anglo American Plc got a boost from speculation that Beijing might roll out new stimulus measures, but overall, Asian markets are lagging. Wall Street has beaten global markets in 13 of the last 15 years. Frankly, Europe and Asia are just background noise at this point. The Wall Street machine Why does Wall Street keep winning? Simple: the U.S. economy is literally built differently. Since the pandemic, American growth has outpaced every other developed nation. Trump’s policies—whether you love them or hate them—are laser-focused on boosting domestic markets. Economists are raising their growth forecasts for the U.S. next year while cutting projections for Europe. The numbers don’t lie. Ben Kumar, head of equity strategy at Seven Investment Management, explained it like this: “You have to own the U.S. because it’s just doing something different.” He’s not wrong. The S&P 500 is packed with companies that print money like it’s a hobby. Tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are leading the charge, and the market is rewarding them handsomely. For UBS, it’s all about operational leverage. The U.S. has the lowest among major markets, meaning it’s better positioned to weather a global slowdown. Add potential tax cuts and deregulation to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for continued dominance. “The U.S. should benefit from Trump relative to elsewhere,” the strategists wrote . The risks are still real Of course, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Trump’s tariff threats could backfire spectacularly if other countries retaliate with their own trade barriers. Adam Slater at Oxford Economics warned that the market’s optimism might be “premature” if this turns into a full-blown trade war. That’s a valid concern, but investors are too busy raking in profits. The Federal Reserve is also in play. Speculation about rate cuts has been a major driver of this year’s gains, especially for speculative assets like crypto. Max Kettner, chief strategist at HSBC Holdings, pointed out the parallels to 2019, when trade tensions were at their peak, but the Nasdaq was on fire. “This is still a cutting cycle. It’s a fantastic set-up,” he said. Nobody knows for sure how long this streak will last, but Wall Street isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. With $141 billion flowing into U.S. equities this month alone, the market is firing on all cylinders.

The impressive performance has brought XRP into the spotlight, highlighting market dynamics influenced by investor sentiment, technical indicators, and broader developments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Profit Realization and Market Dynamics According to recent data , profit-taking among XRP investors reached levels not seen since April 2021. This is a typical response to significant price rallies, driven by investors’ propensity to secure gains after extended periods of price stagnation or growth. However, this does not necessarily reflect a shift in long-term sentiment towards the token. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a critical metric for assessing market sentiment and valuation, surged to 217% earlier this week. This data, derived from the blockchain analytics platform Santiment , suggests that XRP’s market valuation is much higher than its average purchase price. While a high MVRV ratio underscores the profitability of current holders, it also signals a potential overvaluation, which could temper the rapid pace of XRP’s price increase. The MVRV ratio is calculated by dividing the total market value of a cryptocurrency by the aggregate realized value (the price at which coins last moved on the blockchain). Elevated MVRV values often precede corrections, as overvaluation can prompt additional profit-taking or cautious sentiment among investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Strategic Investments Ripple Labs’ strategic moves have also supported XRP’s strong performance. On Wednesday, Ripple announced plans to invest in the newly rebranded Bitwise Physical XRP Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) , previously known as the ETC Group Physical XRP. The investment underscores Ripple’s commitment to expanding XRP’s presence in institutional markets. This ETP, trading under the ticker GXRP on Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA, provides European investors, with a secure and regulated avenue to gain exposure to XRP. The product is fully backed by XRP, ensuring transparency and credibility. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the growing global demand for crypto-backed investment products, stating, “With the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear, this trend is poised to accelerate, further driving demand for crypto ETPs, such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP.” Outlook for XRP The recent developments surrounding XRP reflect both the opportunities and challenges within the cryptocurrency market. While the significant profit realization and elevated MVRV ratio may indicate a short-term cooling period, the combination of regulatory clarity, innovative projects, and strategic investments positions XRP for sustained interest among retail and institutional investors. As the market continues to evolve, the long-term trajectory of XRP will likely depend on broader market conditions, technological advancements, and Ripple’s ability to drive adoption through initiatives like the GXRP ETP.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 14:57:00

Ripple is preparing for a potential launch as early as December 4, Fox Business reported , citing sources close to the matter. The anticipated approval positions Ripple to enter New York’s heavily regulated digital finance market, further solidifying its presence in the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple’s Business Revolves Around RippleNet Ripple’s flagship business revolves around RippleNet, a decentralized payments network offering a faster and cost-efficient alternative to traditional banking systems like SWIFT. The network relies on blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border transactions. While RippleNet’s operations are closely tied to its native cryptocurrency, XRP, the token faces legal scrutiny in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security, a case now under appeal in the Second Circuit. The ongoing legal battle has fueled volatility in XRP’s price, which surged to $1.70 following Donald Trump’s electoral victory, amid expectations of regulatory leniency under his administration. New York Regulator To Approve Ripple’s Regulated Stablecoin, RLUSD, By December 4 Ripple is poised to launch its regulated stablecoin, RLUSD, on December 4th, pending approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This milestone would make RLUSD a compliant… pic.twitter.com/74jh0udNk2 — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 30, 2024 Ripple’s move to introduce RLUSD reflects a strategic shift. By offering a regulated stablecoin, the company can provide customers with a reliable digital asset insulated from the price swings and regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP. RLUSD’s approval would pit Ripple against established U.S. stablecoin issuers like Circle, Paxos, and Gemini, all operating under New York’s stringent regulatory framework. The NYDFS is renowned for its high standards, requiring companies to meet rigorous criteria for transparency, security, and consumer protection. Ripple has positioned itself for this regulatory milestone through its June acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company, a limited-purpose trust chartered by the NYDFS. This acquisition allowed Ripple to fast-track the issuance of RLUSD, as Standard Custody already held licenses to provide custodial services for digital assets. RLUSD will serve as a key element in Ripple’s efforts to compete in the $190 billion global stablecoin market, which is poised for further growth under a pro-crypto federal government. Ripple Labs CEO Faces Backlash for Shilling XRP and CBDCs in Alleged Trump Meeting Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently come under fire after rumors surfaced of a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump where he promoted XRP and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). At the time, former Messari CEO Ryan Selkis accused Garlinghouse of “shilling XRP and CBDC implementations.” Speculation about the meeting’s role in the rally has added fuel to the ongoing controversy. During a recent Fox Business appearance, Garlinghouse declined to confirm or deny the meeting but praised Trump’s relationship with the crypto industry. “Trump has embraced the crypto industry, and I think he recognizes its potential for innovation and entrepreneurship,” Garlinghouse said, expressing optimism about the sector’s future under the new administration. Garlinghouse also noted the market’s positive response to Trump’s election victory, citing the hostile stance of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler as a major factor suppressing U.S.-based crypto projects. Trump’s promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office has garnered widespread support from crypto enthusiasts.

The prominent crypto asset recently surged to $8.81, representing its highest price point in the past five months. However, as the Polkadot market remains ravaged with positive sentiments driven by price action and recent network reports , crypto market expert with X username Rekt Capital has shared a valuable cautionary insight. Polkadot Must Stay Above $8.60 — Analyst In a recent post on X , Rekt Capital highlighted a crucial support level needed for DOT to maintain its current upward trajectory. The analyst explains that following its recent 35% rally in the past seven days, Polkadot has now recorded a weekly close above $8.60, a previous resistance level now turned support. Rekt Capital predicts the altcoin is likely to retest to this price level in a move that previously spurred a bullish run to the token’s current all-time high of $55.00 in 2021. However, the crypto pundit notes that Polkadot has also experienced a failed retest at this support zone in April 2024 sliding to $5.8 i.e. a potential 32% decline from the asset’s current market price. Therefore, DOT bulls need to ensure a successful retest of $8.6 to ensure the coin maintains its current upward momentum. Importantly, a monthly close above this support level indicates the potential for significant price gains in the coming weeks. If this successful retest occurs, Polkadot is expected to rise to $12.61, suggesting a possible 46.11% increase in the asset’s price. Interestingly, Rekt Capital’s DOT prediction is similar to that of fellow analyst Ali Martinez who had forecasted the coin to reach $11 following a breakout to $6 one week ago. DOT Price Overview According to data from CoinMarketCap, Polkadot continues to trade at $8.68 following a 2.12% gain in the past. In tandem, the altcoin’s daily trading volume has surged by 21.78% and is now valued at $795.37 million. Data from Coincodex shows that general market sentiment on the altcoin remains highly bullish as indicated by multiple factors including a Fear & Greed Index of 78 that represents extreme greed. Furthermore, stablecoins adoption on Polkadot continues to grow as the total valuation of USDT and USDC on the blockchain network recently reached $120 million . This development indicates increased liquidity and trading activity that could spur demand and price increases for DOT. Considering these factors combined with a booting altseason and high market enthusiasm towards the incoming Donald Trump administration, Polkadot is tipped largely to retain its upward trajectory. However, these projections are not guaranteed and are subjective to all market conditions.",Polkadot|DOT|DOTUSD|DOTUSDT|polkadot|Rekt Capital|support zone,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|DOT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 15:00:42

This move is part of a broader effort to align cryptocurrency operations with traditional financial regulations and address risks related to investor protection and market stability. The draft proposal, unveiled on November 29, specifically targets stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies. If approved, cryptocurrency exchanges in Brazil would no longer allow users to move these tokens to private wallets. The regulation aims to treat cryptocurrencies similarly to other financial assets like foreign direct investments and international credit, requiring service providers to adhere to global financial rules and share customer information with the central bank. While the central bank acknowledges the potential benefits of virtual assets—such as improving foreign exchange efficiency and expanding investment opportunities—it also highlights risks like cybersecurity threats, illicit activities, and economic instability. These concerns underline the necessity of stricter rules, according to the regulator. Brazil’s crypto market has seen massive growth, with over $90 billion in digital assets traded between July 2023 and June 2024, according to data from Chainalysis. Stablecoins , particularly USD-backed tokens, have played a pivotal role, accounting for 70% of all crypto transactions between domestic and international platforms. These tokens are popular for their stability and are frequently used in cross-border transactions , especially by businesses seeking to preserve value. However, industry analysts warn that this new restriction could hamper Brazil’s thriving crypto sector, which has become a leader in Latin America. Stablecoins are integral to the ecosystem, with the global market cap of these tokens now reaching $190 billion. The public can provide feedback on the proposal until February 28, 2025, though the central bank will have the final say on implementing the rules. Critics argue that while regulation may provide clarity and address risks , such restrictions could limit innovation and growth in the rapidly expanding sector.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-11-30 15:13:23

In a note to clients, the exchange explained that the move had been triggered by “new requirements for e-money tokens” that are expected to come into effect with the upcoming adoption of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations in the region. USDC Reward Program Set for Sunsetting The USDC rewards program allows Coinbase users in over 100 jurisdictions to earn interest on their stablecoin holdings. The yield, whose rate varies from country to country, is paid monthly and automatically deposited into users’ accounts. According to the note , eligible users living within the EAA will continue earning interest on their USDC until November 30, with the program sunsetting the following day. Additionally, the exchange confirmed that customers will still be able to receive their payouts from the scheme within the first ten business days of December. That gives them until December 13 to claim their funds. Crypto Companies Adjusting to MiCA MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the European Union (EU) to govern the crypto sector. It creates a uniform set of rules for the issuance, trading, and provision of crypto-related services across all 27 EU members. It has caused many digital asset companies operating in Europe to rejig their offerings to stay compliant. In October, Coinbase announced that it would remove all non-compliant stablecoins from its EU platform. On its part, Bitstamp has delisted Euro Tether (EURt), Tether’s euro-pegged stablecoin, which it said did not satisfy MiCA requirements. Tether is developing MiCA-compliant products following its acquisition of a stake in Quantoz, a fintech company based in the Netherlands. It also stated it would stop supporting EURt, with holders given until November 27, 2025, to redeem their tokens. While Coinbase’s decree covers customers across the EAA, three countries, Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein, are not members of the EU, where MiCA will be active. However, to ensure their participation in the EU’s internal market, they often adopt many of the measures fronted by the union. As such, while not automatically bound by MiCA, analysts believe they may choose to adopt similar regulations.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/projects-like-xrp-and-hedera-will-soon-be-bigger-than-bitcoin-heres-why/,"Nick, known as “Crypto Crusader” on X, has stirred conversation in the cryptocurrency community with his views on the future of Bitcoin. He predicts that projects with utility like XRP and Hedera (HBAR) will ultimately surpass Bitcoin in terms of value and relevance as the market evolves toward prioritizing real-world applications. Nick questioned Bitcoin’s reliance on the “store of value” narrative, arguing that the market’s shift toward utility-driven valuation could render older technologies less competitive. He emphasized that newer cryptocurrencies with advanced technology and established use cases are better positioned to dominate in the long term. At some point in the future projects like $XRP & $HBAR will be bigger than #Bitcoin . Many will read that and laugh or say that it's impossible. Let me ask you this serious question. When this space's value is determined by utility, what utility does Bitcoin actually provide?… — Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) November 27, 2024 Community Responses Highlight Diverging Opinions The tweet sparked varying reactions. Some community members supported Nick’s perspective, while others raised counterarguments. One user suggested that Bitcoin’s scarcity and the potential for governments to accumulate it could reinforce its status as “digital gold,” potentially offsetting its lack of utility. Others were critical of Nick’s guidance. A user regretted advice he gave in the past, arguing that Bitcoin’s performance over the last few years would have been a more profitable investment. Nick countered this by highlighting the recent outperformance of assets like XRP, Stellar (XLM), and Telcoin (TEL) compared to Bitcoin’s gains over a month. He also acknowledged Bitcoin’s significant rally from $15,000 to nearly $100,000 but maintained that utility-focused projects could achieve even greater results in the future. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Debate on Bitcoin’s Role Nick’s comments reflect a broader debate in the cryptocurrency space about Bitcoin’s relevance as newer blockchain technologies emerge. While Bitcoin remains the most recognized and widely adopted cryptocurrency, critics often cite its energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism and limited scalability as drawbacks. Supporters of Bitcoin argue that its simplicity, security, and decentralized nature make it unparalleled as a digital store of value. Institutional interest, including the possibility of government accumulation, could further cement its position as a reliable hedge against inflation and a digital equivalent of gold. However, proponents of newer projects argue that cryptocurrencies like XRP and HBAR offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and practical applications that Bitcoin cannot match. These features could make them more attractive for enterprise use and global adoption , particularly as blockchain technology integrates into various industries. The future of cryptocurrency hinges on how the market values different attributes such as security, decentralization, and utility. While Bitcoin’s historical significance and growing institutional adoption cannot be overlooked, its position as the leading cryptocurrency may be challenged as utility becomes a more prominent driver of value.

The banking giant, originally expecting the move in January, now believes December will be the tipping point for a larger rate cut. Their reasoning? “Economic data is unraveling faster than anyone anticipated.” Eurozone business activity shrank in November. Inflation in Germany missed forecasts, and the core inflation rate for the region didn’t budge as expected. These signals, according to JPMorgan, make a strong case for the ECB to take more aggressive action. Traders wasted no time reacting. Money markets doubled their bets on a 50-basis-point cut, raising the odds to 20%, up from 10% just days earlier. German bonds followed, with two-year yields dropping five basis points to 1.95%—a level not seen since late 2022. JPMorgan economist Greg Fuzesi, in a client note, explained the shift, citing several factors. The sharp decline in the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), sluggish service-sector inflation, persistent trade uncertainties, and rates that remain overly restrictive formed the backbone of his argument. Divided ECB leadership fuels speculation The ECB is no stranger to mixed messaging, and this time is no different. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a Governing Council member, called for continued rate cuts but stopped short of specifying the pace. He left the door open for future decisions to be based on evolving conditions. Isabel Schnabel, however, had a sharper take earlier this week. She argued that borrowing costs were already near a neutral level, suggesting further cuts might not be as urgent. Despite these differing views, JPMorgan’s Fuzesi thinks the data speaks louder than internal politics. “Even though internal dynamics in the Governing Council can at times result in hard-to-understand outcomes, the data have moved in a way that makes a 50bps cut compelling already in December,” he wrote. The upcoming rate decision will mark the ECB’s fourth cut this year. Markets have largely priced in a smaller 25-basis-point reduction, but the case for something bigger is gaining momentum. Inflation in the eurozone climbed to 2.3% in November, back above the ECB’s 2% target. Core inflation—excluding volatile items like energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco—held steady at 2.7% for the third straight month. The stickiness of inflation in services, which dropped slightly to 3.9% from 4%, adds another wrinkle to the ECB’s calculations. Economists had expected higher inflation in Germany, but it failed to materialize, adding more pressure on policymakers to act decisively. Economic data sets the stage for December The eurozone’s economic backdrop is looking shaky. Business activity, as measured by the PMI, continues to decline. Inflationary pressures, while ticking upward overall, remain uneven across sectors. The recent rise to 2.3% from 2% in October comes after months of softer figures, partly due to energy price deflation fading from the equation. Despite this, the ECB isn’t operating in a vacuum. External factors, like the global fallout from Donald Trump’s recent election as U.S. president, add layers of uncertainty. Trade tariffs, if implemented, could choke European exports, further complicating the ECB’s task. These risks will weigh heavily on the central bank’s updated staff projections, expected just before its December 12 meeting. Melanie Debono, senior Euro economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doubts a half-point cut is in the cards. She points to the bloc’s record-low unemployment and higher wage growth in the third quarter as factors that might hold the ECB back. “The final decision will remain a close call,” Debono said, predicting the ECB will likely stick to a smaller 25-basis-point move in December, with similar cuts following in January and March. Markets are jittery but remain cautious. Speculation of a larger cut faded after slightly improved growth forecasts and rebounding inflation in October. ECB policymakers, including Schnabel, have also stressed the importance of measured action, signaling that going big might not be the answer just yet. Bond markets and political risks Beyond inflation and growth concerns, the ECB faces pressure from bond markets. German bonds surged after JPMorgan’s report, but not everyone is convinced the central bank will intervene aggressively. Governing Council member Joachim Nagel made it clear the ECB won’t act to address government bond fluctuations caused by political risks. Speaking in Frankfurt, Nagel said, “What happens with individual government bonds is typically a reflection of what may be happening politically in the country at the time.” The ECB has tools like the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) to stabilize markets when monetary policy is at risk. Introduced in 2022, the TPI allows the ECB to buy government bonds under strict conditions. However, Nagel dismissed using this mechanism for political issues, saying, “It’s not the task of monetary policy to bail out individual countries.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",Economy|ECB,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-11-30 15:22:01

Yet, XRP outperformed most cryptocurrencies in November, threatening to surpass SOL in the capitalization rank. As of this writing, Solana goes with a $115.2 billion market cap, trading at $242.49 per token. Meanwhile, XRP has a recently accomplished $104.7 billion capitalization, at $1.84 per token, according to data from Finbold. Solana (SOL) and XRP market capitalization and price. Source: Finbold Both cryptocurrencies have earned institutional and retail investors’ interest throughout the years, experiencing remarkable growth in market demand and valuation. This happened despite having considerably high supply inflation in comparison to other less-capitalized projects, challenging known economic fundamentals and reason. xAI’s Grok 2 weighs in an XRP or Solana buy for 2025 In this context, Finbold turned to xAI ’s Grok 2, looking for insights on whether SOL or XRP make a better buy for 2025’s upcoming “ mother of all bull markets ” or “ the biggest crypto bull run ever ,” according to analysts. Grok has itself made headlines by challenging Google ’s and other artificial intelligence (AI) models’ dominance. The xAI stands out against its competitors by being able to real-time scan the web and X for up-to-date data. Analysis of XRP vs. Solana for 2025 investment Notably, Grok mentions XRP’s solid fundamentals for cross-border payments and real-world utility backed by Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions. The main price catalyst, according to the AI, is related to a potential favorable resolution of the ongoing legal battle against the Securities and Exchange (SEC) commission. “​Given the bullish sentiment and potential regulatory resolution, XRP might aim for $4 to $6 if market conditions are highly favorable, according to some expert predictions. However, a more conservative estimate might place it around $1.5 to $2, considering a moderate growth scenario.​” – Grok 2 On the other hand, Solana is noted for its high transaction throughput and low costs, directly competing with Ethereum ( ETH ). The main price catalyst, in this case, was the memecoin boom, attracting significant retail capital. Moreover, Grok mentions positive expectations related to a SOL exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) to earn institutional interest and capital. “Analysts predict a wide range for Solana due to its innovative capabilities. Predictions go from a conservative $300 to an optimistic scenario where it might reach $1,000 or even higher if the bull run is particularly strong.” – Grok Analysis of XRP vs. Solana for 2025 investment. Source: Grok / X / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Conclusion: XRP or SOL for 2025? In conclusion, Grok’s AI believes XRP is a better buy for investors looking for potential regulatory clarity, while Solana has a higher appeal for those interested in robust technological infrastructure and other blockchain applications besides finance. “Solana might have a slight edge in terms of technological innovation and ecosystem development, but XRP’s clearer path toward regulatory resolution could make it a more immediate choice for those betting on a recovery triggered by legal clarity.” – Grok Conclusion on XRP or SOL price predictions for 2025. Source: Grok / X / Finbold / Vini Barbosa The AI predicts XRP could trade around $2 to $3 by the end of 2025, and SOL could hit or exceed $500 by then.

The case focuses on unregistered securities offerings tied to crypto mining and debt rehabilitation businesses. According to the SEC complaint, Taing and Touzi Capital raised $95 million for cryptocurrency mining projects and another $23 million for debt rehabilitation initiatives between 2021 and early 2023. The investments were marketed as “stable and predictable,” and Taing reportedly likened them to high-yield savings accounts. But the SEC alleges the investments were far from safe, describing them as “highly speculative and illiquid” ventures that relied on risky third-party operations.

The central bank’s latest financial stability report didn’t hold back, detailing how higher restrictions on international trade are shaking up economic growth and creating massive uncertainty around inflation. It’s a cocktail of risks that’s already affecting financial markets, with borrowing costs creeping higher for both businesses and households. The message from Threadneedle Street is pretty much: ‘Brace yourselves.’ But the fallout doesn’t stop there. The BoE pointed to a growing breakdown in international financial cooperation, which could seriously destabilize the system’s ability to absorb shocks. Translation: if global regulators can’t get their act together, future crises could hit much harder than they need to. And while the BoE didn’t name names, the timing of this report—just days after President Donald Trump issued his very first trade threats—feels far from accidental. The UK’s fragile spot in a shaky world BoE Governor Andrew Bailey, ever the diplomat, dodged questions about the direct impact of Trump’s win. Instead, he kept the focus broad, saying, “We are seeing increased risk of global fragmentation. But I would say this: there are quite a lot of causes of that, and I don’t think it’s right to pin it on one particular event.” Still, the risks for the UK are uniquely worrying. As an economy that thrives on openness and global trade, Britain’s financial system is wide open to shocks from outside. The BoE acknowledged that households and banks are in decent shape for now, but it flagged serious vulnerabilities. The report highlighted public debt levels worldwide as a major concern, along with the unpredictable nature of financial markets. “Uncertainty around, and risks to, the outlook have increased,” the BoE said. Meanwhile, new Finance Minister Rachel Reeves has accused the central bank of stifling growth by being too heavy-handed with regulations. Bailey pushed back, saying, “Put simply, there is not a trade-off between financial stability and growth. This is a fundamental point.” But he admitted that regulators have some wiggle room in how rules are applied. Case in point: the BoE will now conduct full stress tests on banks every two years instead of annually, a move Bailey says will help make the financial sector more competitive. Volatile markets and the hedge fund wild card The report also pulled no punches about financial markets, calling them “vulnerable to a sharp correction.” Rising trade barriers, growth risks, and inflation jitters are creating the perfect storm. If markets go into a tailspin, borrowing costs could skyrocket, hitting UK businesses and households where it hurts most. And then there’s the wildcard: hedge funds and other non-bank financial institutions. These players might look like big shots on paper, but the BoE isn’t buying it. Hedge funds, the report warned, could face a sudden shock that forces them into a fire sale of assets like British corporate bonds. Such a move could spread chaos through financial markets, further cranking up borrowing costs. The BoE is watching these risks closely, but the reality is that non-banks operate outside its traditional sphere of control. On the brighter side, UK banks are holding up well. They’re well-capitalized and flush with liquidity, passing the BoE’s resilience tests with flying colors. But even here, the central bank is easing up. Starting in 2025, those stress tests will shift to a biennial schedule, freeing up resources to focus on other risks. During off years, the BoE will conduct less intensive desk-based reviews as needed. The central bank is keeping its countercyclical capital buffer steady at 2%. This so-called “rainy day fund” is meant to help banks weather tough times. But with so many unknowns on the horizon—fragmenting global ties, shaky markets, and towering public debt—the BoE is clearly keeping its options open.

Bitcoin’s dominance continues to decline after recently reaching its peak, and we are seeing an influx into smaller projects. Numerous large-cap altcoins have witnessed incredible gains as investors shift their focus in preparation for the altcoin season. The altcoin market has seen a resurgence as investors search for the next profit-making machine. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade around the $96,600 range, altcoins, such as Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM), recorded triple-digit gains over the past month. Join us as we explore the altcoin market and investigate the hottest projects expected to rocket in 2025. Stellar (XLM) Gains Over 460% in 30-Day Charts Stellar (XLM) made headlines in recent weeks for its massive gains. Over the past 30 days, XLM gained nearly 470%, currently trading at $0.52 . The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. XLM, in conjunction with XRP, is expected to play a significant role in the new global financial system. XRP is uniquely designed to optimize institutional liquidity for cross-border transactions, while XLM’s infrastructure, on the other hand, was built to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and retail-level remittances efficiently. Financial experts envision a two-tiered monetary framework using XRP and XLM at different levels for specific purposes. Algorand (ALGO) Gains Nearly 50% Algorand (ALGO) is a self-sustaining, decentralized blockchain network that supports a wide array of applications. The platform was built to process many transactions at higher speeds and lower costs, and it is one of Ethereum’s biggest competitors. The platform’s native currency, ALGO, secures the Algorand blockchain and is used to pay the processing fees for Algorand-based transactions. ALGO recently caught the attention of investors, resulting in a 288% surge in value over the last month. The project is one of the top altcoins, gaining nearly 50% in the past week alone to trade at $0.48 . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $15.7 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 225%. SHIB is one of the biggest Solana-based memecoins, which quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 13th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). SHIB surged in popularity thanks to its dedicated community of investors, its charm, and the support of industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. SHIB gained over 45% over the past month and is expected to be one of the most significant gaining altcoins in the next bull run. Husky Inu (HINU) to Thrive in 2025 With renewed optimism and interest in the crypto market since Donald Trump’s election win, crypto projects are expected to surge as the president-elect plans to implement pro-crypto policy. Husky Inu (HINU), the latest memecoin sensation from the Solana network, will surely reap the rewards of industry news. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $588,000, with numbers expected to rise rapidly as the crypto market explodes. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu is close to hitting its fundraising target, so investors are urged to hurry before missing the opportunity to take a stake in this exciting project.

This is a 350% YoY increase and the largest total since the 2021 bull market. Recovering from a Slump Indonesia’s crypto journey has been turbulent since its peak of $54 billion in 2021. In 2022, transactions fell sharply to $19.4 billion due to new tax policies, including a 0.1% levy on crypto gains alongside standard taxation. The decline continued into 2023, with only $6.5 billion recorded in transactions. However, 2024 has seen a great rebound, with transaction volumes exceeding those of the last two years combined. This recovery underlines Indonesia’s resilience and its position as a key player in the Oceana/Asia cryptocurrency ecosystem. Indonesia’s Position in Global Crypto Adoption Indonesia ranks third in Chainalysis’ Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, behind India and Nigeria. In fact, seven of the top ten countries in the index are from Asia and Oceana. A key factor driving adoption in Indonesia is the country’s young demographic. More than 60% of crypto investors in Indonesia are under 30 years old, highlighting a shift to digital asset investment among the younger generation. This contrasts with the older, more traditional markets of Europe and the US, where crypto adoption comes from an older age bracket. Policies and Market Impact Government regulations have also played a role in Indonesia’s crypto resurgence. CoFTRA Regulation PerBa Number 9 of 2024, which eased restrictions on institutional investments, had a great influence on the September market rally. On the top, the newly elected government led by President Prabowo Subianto revisits financial policies, including the dual taxation policy on crypto, considered highly controversial. These efforts will go toward smoothing the regulatory environment and giving way to growth in the digital asset sector. Future Prospects Indonesia’s $30 billion milestone marks the country’s rising importance in the global crypto landscape. With potential policy reforms and a strong base for adoption, the nation is poised to continue growing well past its previous highs. As Asia and Oceana remain at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption, Indonesia remains a very important market to watch. By fostering innovation and relaxing restrictions, it could become a hub for global cryptocurrency activity.",Blockchain|DeFi|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-11-30 16:17:31

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 16:20:00

Wright’s claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto faced a legal blow as the court dismissed his appeal application. Court Refutes The Craig Wright Allegations of Judicial Bias According to the report, Lord Justice Arnold stated Wright lacked a reasonable prospect of success, and his evidence proved insufficient to support his claims. Wright had appealed based on the grounds of alleged judicial bias against him and improper treatment of presented evidence, However, Lord Justice Arnold pointed out that Wright’s claims reflected his disagreement with the judge’s ruling. He emphasized that Wright lacked substantiated evidence to back his claims of actual or apparent bias against him. According to Lord Arnold, the previous judge offered Wright a fair trial. Furthermore, the court ruled that Wright’s prayers to serve as a substitute expert witness were needless. Notably, Wright had a suitably qualified expert witness, and the judge maintained that his criticism of the treatment of expert witnesses lacked merit. According to the judge, Wright’s expert witness largely agreed with COPA’s witness on several crucial issues. This alignment in views weakens Wright’s case. Repeated Setbacks in the Quest for Recognition In an earlier ruling, the UK’s Supreme Court dismissed Wright’s case , claiming the identity of the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In that case, Peter McCormack, a renowned Bitcoin advocate, had challenged Wright’s claims of being Nakamoto. Wright responded by trying to use legal means to silence his critics. However, the UK’s Supreme Court blocked the move. Wright’s various attempts to gain recognition as Nakamoto have failed over the years, and he has been accused of plagiarism several times. In March, a UK court granted a worldwide freezing order (WFO) application instituted by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). Judge James Mellor then froze £6 million in Wright’s assets . The Elusive Identity of Satoshi Nakamoto The identity of Satosi Nakamoto remains an unsolved puzzle and a subject of interest in the cryptocurrency world. HBO even claimed it would reveal Nakamoto’s identity in a documentary to end the speculation about the creator of Bitcoin’s true identity. However, no conclusive evidence has supported all claims of unveiling Nakamoto.

These rates represent a substantial cut from the standard fees, giving users a cost-effective entry into the TON blockchain ecosystem. To participate in the campaign, users simply need to open the Tonkeeper app, navigate to the Browser Tab and select Mercuryo. By leveraging Mercuryo’s seamless integration with Tonkeeper, users can enjoy a streamlined experience with reduced fees and no hidden costs. The Emerging Hotspot For Crypto Adoption Notably, Indonesia is emerging as a hotspot for crypto adoption, fueled by a tech-savvy population, a rapidly growing digital economy, and increasing access to blockchain-based financial tools. Indonesia has particularly witnessed a surge in cryptocurrency interest among younger generation, looking for alternative investment opportunities and digital payment solutions. Additionally, the government’s receptive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, along with widespread mobile payment adoption through platforms like QRIS, DANA, and ShopeePay, has created a fruitful ground for crypto growth. The Black Friday Special This collaboration underscores Tonkeeper’s commitment to delivering value to its global user base. It is kicking off with an Early Bird Black Friday Special for Indonesian users, enabling greater participation in the TON blockchain ecosystem. Running until December 15, the campaign enables Indonesian users to save on crypto purchases while exploring Tonkeeper app’s robust features, including secure wallet management and app integrations. Indonesia Hits Record Transactions In a recent development, Indonesian crypto transactions have hit a new record of 475 trillion rupiah ($30 billion) in 2024. This marks a 350% jump from $6.5 billion in 2023. Indonesia’s crypto market shows strong growth in the global space, with crypto transaction numbers reaching all-time highs and setting new benchmarks for digital asset adoption in Southeast Asia. The country now has 21 million traders, marking significant market penetration. Of these, 716,000 use local registered exchanges, making Indonesia one of the world’s biggest crypto markets and a key player in global digital asset trading.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SPONSORED|TON,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 16:27:04

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 299,900 followers on the social media platform X that altcoin/Bitcoin ( BTC ) pairs are flashing bullish signals. “Best case here is BTC goes sideways for a week and alts pop off in turns over the weekend. Many alt/Bitcoin charts are indicating this is a likely scenario.” Bluntz goes on to name prominent layer-1 blockchains – including Ethereum ( ETH ), BNB Chain ( BNB ) and Sei ( SEI ) – that are positioned to take advantage of Bitcoin’s sideways action. “Should be a good weekend for layer-1s. SEI, NEAR, INJ, BNB, hell even ETH all look good in USD and more importantly BTC pairs.” According to the strategist, Near Protocol ( NEAR ) skyrocketing is “imminent.” “Not only has [the] NEAR/USD pair already broken out but NEAR/BTC breaking out now too. The sending is imminent.” Source: Bluntz/X NEAR is trading for $6.87 at time of writing, a 1% increase during the last 24 hours. Other digital assets that Bluntz says are on the cusp of a breakout include popular meme asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Jupiter ( JUP ). According to Bluntz, Jupiter should hit a new all-time high this cycle. “Even despite being up 100% from the lows, JUP looks like it’s been accumulating for six months and the real mark up phase hasn’t even really begun. No doubt in my mind this sees fresh all-time highs before this cycle is done in my opinion. Many SOL [ecosystem] coins look similar.” JUP is trading for $0.00087 at time of writing, a 9.1% decrease on the day.

The analyst further provided insights into what is to come next for Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Completes First Bull Phase In an X post, KrissPax mentioned that the Dogecoin price has completed its first up-phase this bull cycle, similar to the 2021 and 2017 bull runs . He noted that those previous cycles recorded two additional up-phases with huge percentage gains. Based on this, Dogecoin could record two more up-phases before its price tops in this market cycle. The crypto analyst called for patience with the Dogecoin price while it chops sideways a bit, possibly until the next leg of the up-phase begins. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also mentioned how Dogecoin would test market participants’ patience in this parabolic run. He added that, just like in 2017 and 2020, the TD Sequential has shown a sell signal, which could lead to a brief correction before the bull rally continues. Meanwhile, in a previous analysis, KrissPax provided insights into how high the Dogecoin price could reach in this market cycle and what levels could mark the local tops for remaining up-phases. The crypto analyst predicted that Dogecoin could reach $3 in this bull run. However, he said the first step is for DOGE to reach $1. Therefore, the next up-phase could lead the Dogecoin price to $1. Once that is done, the next up-phase could be a rally to $3, as KrissPax predicted. However, Martinez’s chart showed a channel that could lead DOGE to rally to as high as $14 if it gets to the upper boundary of the channel. The median of the channel puts Dogecoin just above $1.5. Almost Time For The Next Leg Up Crypto analyst Kevin Capital suggested that it is almost time for the Dogecoin price to enjoy its next leg up. In an X post, he stated that Dogecoin has consolidated long enough and that the meme coin has also reset some key indicators on the daily time frame. In line with this, he believes Dogecoin will start heading higher. The crypto analyst added that the next leg will give market participants a good idea of the macro top for the Dogecoin price down the line. Crypto analyst Master Kenobi suggested that the next leg for Dogecoin will come unexpectedly. In an X post, he said that when it happens, it will happen fast. His accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price will break above its current all-time high (ATH) on its next leg up and rally to as high as $1.08. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.42, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 16:30:50

In recent days, SOL appears to be consolidating, while during the same period, XRP has soared nearly 95%, reaching a market capitalization of $106.5 billion by outperforming Binance Coin (BNB). Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels However, this consolidation on the four-hour time frame appears as a bearish inverted head-and-shoulders price action pattern. According to expert technical analysis, SOL appears bearish, and if it fails to hold the $226 level, there is a strong possibility of a 10% decline, potentially reaching the support level at $202. Source: Trading View Conversely, if SOL closes a four-hour candle above the $245 level, this bearish thesis may fail. On the positive side, SOL is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both daily and four-hour time frames, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that the altcoin still has the potential to rally in the coming days. Currently, SOL’s RSI stands at 49, near the oversold area, further highlighting a potential buying opportunity. Whale Activity Signals Interest in SOL In addition to technical analysis, on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that whales have shown strong interest in the altcoin. According to SOL spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have recorded a significant outflow of $182 million worth of SOL since November 23, 2024. This notable outflow suggests that whales may be transferring the tokens from exchanges to their wallets. Source: Coinglass The crypto community views this significant token withdrawal as a potential buying opportunity, suggesting a possible upside rally. SOL Current Price Momentum At press time, SOL is trading near $240 and has registered a price drop of 1.75% in the past 24 hours.

Notably, the cryptocurrency market remains on edge, anticipating Bitcoin’s push to the six-figure valuation amid the ongoing post-election rally. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to rally in December following the United States presidential election years. Specifically, during the last two such cycles, the cryptocurrency posted significant December gains of 30% and 46%. For 2024, on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez has suggested that history might repeat itself, potentially propelling Bitcoin to trade between $125,000 and $140,000 in December, he said in an X post on November 30. Bitcoin monthly returns. Source: Ali_charts Indeed, on-chain metrics hint at the possibility of Bitcoin rising higher in the coming days. Data shared by Martinez indicates that over 55,000 Bitcoins (worth approximately $5.34 billion) have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past 72 hours. Bitcoin balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode/Ali_charts These movements point to the possibility of reduced selling pressure and increased long-term holding. Such outflows have historically preceded price rallies as they lead to a supply squeeze, which can boost Bitcoin’s ongoing momentum amid sustained demand for the digital currency. Bitcoin’s need for a decisive breakout On the flip side, crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted Bitcoin’s struggle to break above a one-week lower-high trendline, which is a critical resistance level. In this case, a daily close above $97,000 could propel BTC toward $100,000, but failure to do so risks further rejection and potential moves to lower levels. The analyst noted that the asset needs to make a decisive breakout to alleviate any fears of a possible correction below $90,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting that Bitcoin has faltered in its push to claim the $100,000 level—a bullish move that gained traction following Donald Trump’s election . Bitcoin narrowly missed the $100,000 mark last week before experiencing a recent pullback. The drop has been welcomed by some quarters, as it alleviates fears of the asset being overbought. At the same time, the maiden digital asset might face further volatility in the short term, considering that such movements are typical towards the end of the month. Additionally, the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision is likely to impact the asset’s price in December. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,682, having declined by about 1.6% in the past 24 hours. In the weekly timeframe, BTC is down by over 2%.

However, investors awaiting further upward movement should note that Bitcoin’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is nearing overbought territory.

Ives, who works at Wedbush Securities, highlighted that automobile and technology company’s share could experience a major boost due to its foray into the technology. Aside from AI, Tesla has also been majoring in autonomous driving. Ives noted in an interview with CNBC that self-driving cars are also expected to increase the company’s value, noting that it is presently what most car manufacturers are trying to achieve. He added that the two ventures could be the decisive trigger to drive the company’s growth in the next 18 months. Wall Street analyst highlights AI’s influence on Tesla’s growth Ives mentioned that the market needs to watch and see how the company’s stock doubles from now till over 18 months. “I think get the popcorn out because I believe Tesla’s stock could ultimately double from here over the next 18 months. It’s been obviously a parabolic move, but as you talk about autonomous itself, we think it’s worth $1 trillion,” he said. He explained that while Tesla has been enjoying a nice surge, the stock still has the potential to grow. According to Ives, he feels that with the company’s autonomous driving and AI ventures, its stock could go as high as $600 over the predicted period. He also talked about the firm’s stabilized margin, an indicator that would boost investor confidence. Although skeptics have dismissed the company’s potential for growth in the future, Ives believes that they are refusing to see the bigger picture. He also believes the company’s market cap could hit $2 trillion, projecting it to happen in the same time frame. With Tesla already making its mark in the automobile industry, Ives feels it could become a key player in the sector over the next few years. Trump’s impact and the future of Tesla Ives believes Tesla stock will benefit greatly from Donald Trump’s second administration. With close ties between Donald Trump and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, Ives believes that autonomous driving could be something to expect on a federal level. He added that the removal of a $7,500 tax credit on electric vehicles could also help Tesla’s market position. Meanwhile, other analysts are still skeptical about the company’s AI venture. One such is UBS analyst, Joseph Spak, who has warned about the dangers of speculating on the company’s valuation, shattering the optimism shared by Dan Ives. Spak said he still maintains a sell rating for the stock, despite pushing his target from $197 to $226. “We understand that the market increasingly views TSLA as an AI play rather than an EV player. However, when the value you can tangibly attribute to the auto business reaches the recent average (~17%), the stock tends to enter a downward channel,” he said. $TSLA going out at a 32-month closing high.

According to another analyst Larry Tentarelli on X, the stock still has the potential to rise, provided it stays above the $300 mark. He added that the $TSLA has the potential for a monthly Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO), fuelling optimism.

Table of Contents Bullish price predictions for SHIB fuel optimism Shiba Inu vs. DTX Exchange: New DeFi project to overtake the top meme coin? DTX Exchange: Profits on the way DTX Exchange raises over $8 million in its presale When Bitcoin surges, meme coins spike. But with Bitcoin’ s uptrend slowing down, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other top crypto projects are now in the spotlights as experts debate what directions they might take. One analyst is tipping SHIB to hit the $0.0002 mark. While that would be quite impressive, the DTX Exchange (DTX) project is contending with Shiba Inu, and experts predict bigger surges for the new project than the meme coin. Here’s more on the two impressive crypto projects! Bullish price predictions for SHIB fuel optimism Since Bitcoin started its bullish run after the US elections, Shiba Inu’s SHIB has been on an impressive run. The top meme coin has gained 46% in the monthly timeframe. But now that the Bitcoin pump is losing steam, observers have become unsure what to expect from Shiba Inu. One expert, Charting Guy, has made bold, bullish predictions for the SHIB token. His prediction supports a Shiba Inu rally. The SHIB price can jump to $0.0002 if Shiba Inu continues pumping. The SHIB price is currently about $0.0000253 on CoinMarketCap, and with some other market experts sharing the same opinion about the meme coin, one can look forward to Shiba Inu making impressive movements on the price charts.

Shiba Inu is getting the bullish nod from most of its investors, and the next question is how long that streak will last. Sure enough, users seem to have been accumulating for the past few months, as the amount of SHIB in centralized exchanges is at an all-time low, but we all know how fast a meme coin can switch. The new DTX Exchange platform, on the other hand, has a plan for longevity, as its hybrid features are clearly the pick of the market. DTX Exchange offers multiple trading markets at once, ensuring that users have enough investment opportunities to stay in profit almost every time. Frankly, simply holding onto DTX tokens is enough to bring profits from the platform. It’s a horde of trading options on DTX Exchange, and a lowdown is waiting for users who are itching to know more about the project. DTX Exchange: Profits on the way It’s a crypto exchange, but that doesn’t mean DTX Exchange will only be favorable to the traders. While the platform sports a horde of features to upgrade DeFi trading generally, DTX investors could still get quite the returns on their investments. First, there’s staking. That’s the staple on any PoS network launching these days, and on DTX Exchange , deposits are significant to the platform’s progress. Staked assets on DTX add to the liquidity on the exchange, ensuring that traders and their activities are well-regulated by the protocol. Then, there’s DTX Exchange’s plan to reward every token holder. The reward comprises users getting a percentage of the daily trading revenue, which is essentially traders’ fees from the day. The community on DTX Exchange will have very little choice but to be active. While the platform is still under development for launch, DTX Exchange has prepared the Phoenix Wallet for downloads and beta testing. The wallet allows web3 enthusiasts to access various operations in the web3 space from their DTX Exchange accounts. Phoenix wallet still differs from the DTX Unified wallet, where DTX traders can monitor their portfolios at a glance. DTX Exchange raises over $8 million in its presale The Shiba Inu meme coin price might be rising, but DTX Exchange is stealing the spotlight quickly. The presale has gone on for only a few months, but everyone—traders and investors alike—is going bullish on the project, and it has now raised over $8 million. The presale is in Stage 5 now, where each token is worth $0.10. There’s a 100% ROI expected from the presale when the token launches at $0.20, but that’s nothing compared with the anticipated 100x post-launch surge analysts are projecting for the DTX token.

Wall Street lit up, the dollar flexed its muscles, and Bitcoin charged ahead like it had something to prove. And prove, it did. But not everyone got a piece of the pie. While U.S. assets soaked up investor dollars, European currencies, Mexico’s peso, and tariff-sensitive industries felt the heat. It’s been a month of winners and losers, with Trump’s economic shadow looming over global trade and investment. Now, December is knocking, and it’s looking more like a minefield than a red-carpet runway. Analysts warn of a potential bond market backlash to Trump’s fiscal policies. Inflation is also lurking, fueled by tariff-driven supply chain snarls. BCA Research said : “Elevated (U.S.) equity valuations reflect complacency as the more challenging environment we expect is not priced in.” Currency carnage as the dollar dominates The dollar crushed its rivals in November, rising 2% against major currencies and steamrolling markets that weren’t ready for Trump’s tariff threats. The euro, in particular, had its worst month since 2022, dropping nearly 3% to around $1.05. A weak German economy and political headaches in France added to the euro’s tumble. The question now: How low can it go? Mexico’s peso didn’t fare much better, sliding 2% against the dollar. This isn’t just a bad exchange rate—it’s a reflection of fears about Mexico’s future under Trump’s trade policies. Sterling dropped over 1%, while China’s offshore yuan fell 1.5%. Even the Korean won and Canadian dollar couldn’t escape the dollar’s bulldozer effect, joining the list of currencies losing value since late September. Bitcoin blows past expectations If there’s one asset that truly stole the show in November, it’s Bitcoin. The apex crypto exploded by 37%, inching dangerously close to the $100,000 milestone, falling only $300 short. Expectations of crypto-friendly regulations under Trump lit a fire under it. The last time Bitcoin went on a rally like this was back in February when demand for new exchange-traded Bitcoin products shot through the roof. But Bitcoin’s volatility is no joke, and some analysts fear that the recent surge could pave the way for a steep correction. If the market overshoots, unprepared investors might find themselves caught in a sharp downturn. Still, hitting the $100,000 mark would be a landmark event, thrusting Bitcoin further into the mainstream, especially as it looks clear that President Trump is coming through with all the promises he made to the industry. Tech thrives, but risks remain The tech sector has had a field day in November too, with the Nasdaq 100 recording its best month since June. Trump’s election sent Tesla soaring by 33%, while Nvidia basked in the glow of unrelenting AI hype. But not everything in tech land is sunshine and rainbows. Trump’s tariff plans could wreak havoc on global supply chains, hitting tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon where it hurts. Some investors are already hitting the brakes on AI stocks. The European Central Bank piled on, warning about the ripple effects if the AI bubble bursts. For now, tech stocks are riding high, but there’s a sense that the sector is skating on thin ice. But the month was actually a tale of two banking sectors. In the U.S., banking stocks skyrocketed by 13%, their best month in a year. Investors are betting on deregulation and a Trump-fueled economic boom to keep banks flush with cash. European banks? Not so lucky. The sector slid 5%, weighed down by a weakening economy and expectations of rate cuts. But here’s the twist: European banks have still managed a 16% gain year-to-date, thanks to earlier rate hikes. Hedge funds, however, remain skeptical. JPMorgan reported that hedge funds are net sellers of European banks, even with their recent performance. Deutsche Bank suggested that European banks need to move toward higher-margin businesses like wealth management and investment banking to stay competitive. Trump’s win has clearly tilted the scales for everyone. Bond markets break rank But the bond market’s usual rhythm has been thrown off, with major regions moving in wildly different directions. U.S. Treasury yields stayed mostly flat for the month but have risen 60 basis points since mid-September. Strong economic data and Trump’s promises of fiscal largesse are driving expectations for higher inflation and larger deficits. Capital Economics predicts that U.S. Treasury yields could hit 4.5% by the end of the year, up from their current 4.24%. Germany, though, saw the opposite trend. Its 10-year yields dropped nearly 30 basis points to 2.11%, marking their biggest monthly fall this year. Economic weakness, Trump’s tariff threats, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict all contributed to the decline. Japan, meanwhile, experienced a sharp rise in bond yields, partly due to speculation about a potential rate hike following the yen’s post-election slide.

This happens amid the Brazilian Real (BRL) hitting an all-time low against the US Dollar (USD), raising local economic concerns, as Finbold reported . The draft regulation aims to tighten control over cryptocurrency operations, in particular foreign-backed stablecoins, aligning them with traditional financial regulations. Brazil’s Central Bank targets stablecoins and self-custody On November 29, the BCB released a public consultation proposal to include virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in the foreign exchange ( forex ) market regulations. The move specifically targets stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies, like the USD-backed Tether ( USDT ), which is widely used in Brazil. Notably, a Chainalysis study from October 2024 highlights an impressive growth in stablecoins’ value received by local exchanges in Brazil. The volume of stablecoins in Brazilian exchanges from July 2023 to July 2024 surged by more than 200% over the last period. Year-over-year growth in Brazil value received by exchange types and asset types. Source: Chainalysis According to the proposal, VASPs would be prohibited from transferring stablecoins to self-custodial wallets like Ledger or MetaMask. Instead, all operations would need to occur within regulated platforms. Livecoins , a local crypto media outlet, reported on the matter on X. 🚨Banco Central propõe restrição para saques de stablecoins para carteiras próprias (auto custódia). Consulta pública que regula corretoras de criptomoedas no mercado de câmbio: ""É vedado à prestadora de serviços de ativos virtuais efetuar transmissão de ativo virtual… https://t.co/GDRW2OxjND pic.twitter.com/7KYGRo4ok4 — Livecoins (@livecoinsBR) November 29, 2024 The BCB emphasizes that only authorized VASPs can operate in the foreign exchange market, and they must collect detailed customer information, including transaction purposes and counterparties. “These measures aim to enhance legal security and allow the development of new business models, increasing market efficiency,” the BCB stated in its note. BRL collapse spurs regulatory actions Interestingly, the BRL has reached a historic low in the forex market, trading at R$6.11 per USD. This surpasses the previous record from May 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the currency’s collapse intensified after Finance Minister Fernando Haddad announced cost-saving plans that failed to convince foreign investors. USD/BRL – US Dollar vs. Brazilian Real, weekly forex chart from ICE. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Consequently, the weakening Brazilian Real has raised concerns about economic stability, potentially leading to the increased control attempt over stablecoins. The Central Bank cites “instability” as a reason for stricter regulations on foreign-backed currencies that work as a more accessible alternative for the Brazilian people. While the regulator claims it aims to mitigate risks related to consumer protection, illicit activities, and fiscal integrity, critics argue that the measure will have the opposite effect. Industry reacts to proposed stablecoins ban to self-custody wallets The crypto community in Brazil has expressed significant concerns over the proposed ban on the self-custody of stablecoins. Legal expert Pedro Torres criticized the measure, arguing that it infringes on constitutional rights. “The ban on self-custody of stablecoins violates fundamental principles like free enterprise and property rights,” Torres told Livecoins . “It undermines the very essence of decentralization and user autonomy that cryptocurrencies offer.” Industry analysts warn that restricting self-custody could hinder Brazil’s burgeoning crypto sector. Stablecoins account for 70% of all crypto transactions between domestic and international platforms in the country. With over $90 billion in digital assets traded between July 2023 and June 2024, Brazil has emerged as a Latin American leader in cryptocurrency adoption. The public consultation on the proposal is open until February 28, 2025. The Central Bank invites feedback on several key questions, including the necessity of additional limits for VASPs and mechanisms for valuing transacted virtual assets in sovereign currency terms. In closing, the Central Bank’s proposal marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in Brazil. As the BRL struggles against the USD, authorities are seeking to tighten control over digital assets to allegedly protect economic stability and investor interests. However, the proposed restrictions on stablecoin transfers to self-custody wallets have sparked debate about user rights, intervention in foreign exchange markets, and the future of crypto innovation in the country. The coming months will be crucial as stakeholders provide input and the BCB considers adjustments to its regulatory approach. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Over the past day alone, ADA gained over 7%, depicting its revival with the onset of the bull market. Furthermore, a crucial on-chain metric has reached heights last seen over two years ago, further validating the bullish thesis. Catalysts Fueling ADA’s Run IntoTheBlock’s latest on-chain data highlights an impressive uptick in network activity, with over 840,000 transactions recorded recently, generating total fees of 279,000 ADA. This surge in usage mirrors levels last seen in March 2022, demonstrating increased interest and adoption within the Cardano ecosystem. An analyst citing ITB data said, “Few months before this time, $ADA was mostly used as a speculative asset. However, $ADA recorded sustained growth in the number of holders from July 2022 till today. This suggests growing confidence in the Cardano Blockchain/ ecosystem.” ADA has been one of the best-performing crypto assets this bull run, reclaiming the crucial $1 mark. During this week’s minor dip, large ADA investors were observed to have bought over 130 million tokens worth approximately $130 million. This acquisition tightens the supply, potentially boosting the asset’s value if demand remains constant or grows. Additionally, these significant purchases might signal confidence to smaller investors, inspiring them to enter the market. Zooming out, ADA whales have accumulated $10 million worth of tokens in the past month alone, thereby increasing their positions by a staggering 146% Milestone for Cardano Ecosystem On the ecosystem side, Cardano recently reached a critical milestone with the successful deployment of its first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract, Halo2, on the mainnet through the Plutus v3 ledger language. This move essentially allows zero-knowledge applications and integration with partner chains like Midnight. On November 25, the Input-Output (IO) Research team demonstrated Halo2’s capabilities by verifying the Ad-hoc Threshold Multi-signatures scheme (ATMS) on the mainnet, confirming 50 out of 90 signatures. The transactions included a 0.16 ADA fee for locking funds and 2.03 ADA for unlocking them after proof verification.

While it appeared highly bullish daily, we may see a small pullback before rallying hard. This month saw Algo through its highest buying volatile period since it initiated a major correction in the first quarter of the year. It encountered resistance last week and took a little break after posting over 200% gain. It advanced bullish this week and broke out to mark a new yearly high at $0.484 a few hours ago. That high was slightly rejected but the bulls are still showing signs of interest. If they push higher, we can expect more gains to surface. April’s 2022 low is the closest level to watch for tests. Following yesterday’s breakout, Algo may pullback a little to retest the broken resistance before resuming bullish at full speed. A deep pullback may bring us back into the $0.20 range before finding a solid ground. While the bulls are gaining control from a short-term perspective, they may face tougher hurdles until the price reaches its current all-time high. So far, it has increased by over 3x since the price bounced back from a low of $0.1 earlier this month. Bigger moves lie ahead. Algo’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above today’s high, the immediate resistance level to watch for a test is $0.537. The next resistance above this level is $0.7, followed by the key $1 level. The $0.4 level has produced support for the market in the past hours. A fall below this level could trigger a pullback to the $0.33 support that broke as resistance yesterday. Another support level for drops is $0.25.

Losing momentum briefly, it resurged this week but is yet to break higher due to a rejection. The recent surge in ADA’s price has been remarkable as the price rallied through key resistance levels without any hassle. Despite several bearish interceptions, it has continued to show strength as the bulls commit well. Following the monthly rally, the trend now appears extremely bullish on the lower timeframe, though things are still looking good as the crypto maintained a higher high and higher low pattern on the 4-hour chart. Facing a slight rejection in the past hours, ADA failed to push above the previous high and now trades calmly around $1 – its opening price. A daily close below it could trigger a small drop as the market seemed due for a correction from a short-term outlook. If that happens, we may see a double-top formation as the price may roll back under $0.8. A further surge in volatility should bring more growth before making a pullback. One of the things to pay attention to right now is the daily volume indicator, which has been falling for weeks. Technically, the price is expected to mirror this volume direction soon. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview If ADA breaks up the suppressing $1.154 resistance level, the next rally point would be the $1.25 and $1.4 levels in the near term. Long-term targets are $2, $3 and $4 respectively. In case of a drop, $0.875 is the level to consider for support. Breaking down this level could roll the price back to the $0.765 and $0.65 levels. $0.6 and $0.522 are lower supports to watch for a deep retracement. Key Resistance Levels: $1.154, $1.25, $1.4 Key Support Levels: $0.875, $0.765, $0.69 Price: $1 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The increase follows the U.S. elections, which saw positive sentiment ripple through cryptocurrency markets. The token’s momentum places it as a standout in the meme coin sector, with discussions growing around its potential to reach $1. Despite minor market corrections, SHIB’s trajectory reflects promising growth trends that continue to energize its community. Will Shiba Inu Price Hit $1 in 2024? Shiba Inu price remains a focal point as meme coin season captures attention across the cryptocurrency market. A recent surge in interest in meme coins, including DOGE and Pepe, has created a vibrant market environment. This wave of enthusiasm has fueled speculation about Shiba Inu’s potential price trajectory. Shiba Inu burn activity recently saw a remarkable 7,400% spike over the past week. This surge was driven by the destruction of nearly 2 billion SHIB tokens. Notably, a single transaction by a project executive burned 80 million tokens, demonstrating the community’s commitment to reducing supply. Several meme coins have achieved record-breaking highs, reflecting strong investor confidence in this niche. Shiba Inu, widely recognized as a “Doge-killer,” could benefit significantly from this rally. New and experienced crypto enthusiasts closely monitor the coin as market optimism builds. The ongoing crypto bull run, marked by Bitcoin surpassing $97,000 and Ethereum reaching $3,600, has further lifted market sentiment. This momentum has created a ripple effect, benefiting altcoins like Shiba Inu. The coin’s price has shown upward momentum in response to this broader market rally. Shiba Inu price prediction could experience substantial price growth if market trends remain favorable, reinforcing its reputation as a key player in the meme coin niche. Shiba Inu Price Soars 40% Amid Bullish Trend The Shiba Inu Coin price has surged by 50%, signaling a notable recovery in the meme coin market. The SHIB price is trading at $0.00002688 at the reporting, reflecting a 4% gain over the past 24 hours. SHIB’s price movements show a consistent upward trend throughout the day, with the lowest price at $0.00002562 and the highest at $0.00002746. Despite being significantly lower than its all-time high of $0.00008845 on October 28, 2021, the token’s recent price activity suggests renewed market momentum. Shiba Inu Price Chart: TradingView The combination of rising burn rates, strong market sentiment, and a thriving meme coin sector suggests a promising outlook for Shiba Inu. While the $1 price target remains ambitious, ongoing market conditions could provide the momentum needed to bring SHIB closer to this milestone.

Now teetering just below this critical psychological level , Bitcoin appears primed for a breakout that could propel it to new highs. Despite losing some market dominance amid an ongoing altcoin surge, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency sector, supported by strong technical patterns and robust fundamental drivers. Technical outlook: Key levels and bullish signals Notably, prominent analyst RLinda highlights Bitcoin’s consolidation phase as a precursor to significant growth. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency has formed an ascending triangle pattern, a classic bullish indicator that reflects sustained buyer interest and mounting pressure to breach resistance. BTC price analysis. Source: RLinda/TradingView Currently, key support levels are established at $94,700, $91,250, and $89,200, while resistance lies at $99,000 and $100,000. The $99,000 mark is identified as a critical trigger point. Breaking this level could open the door for Bitcoin to test the $105,000 milestone and potentially move even higher. RLinda also notes that recent pullbacks have likely served as liquidity traps, designed to attract large institutional buyers ahead of the next leg up. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the ascending price channel reflects strong market confidence and growing institutional interest, further solidifying the bullish outlook. Fundamentals driving Bitcoin’s rally Bitcoin’s rally is underpinned by strong fundamentals, driven by large-scale accumulation by whales and institutional investors, reflecting long-term confidence in its growth potential. During the recent market correction, whales strategically accumulated 16,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.5 billion, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira. Whales take advantage and accumulate US$1.5 billion in #Bitcoin “On Tuesday, almost 16,000 $BTC entered whale reserves, a number that continued to increase yesterday, corresponding to almost US$1.5 billion in on-chain accumulation.” – By @caueconomy More details 👇… pic.twitter.com/hOTP43YmHU — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 28, 2024 This buying followed the sale of nearly $4 billion in BTC at a loss by short-term holders, showcasing the ability of larger market participants to capitalize on market dips. This whale activity is consistent with broader institutional movements. MicroStrategy, for instance, has significantly expanded its holdings, adding Bitcoin worth $5.4 billion to its reserves. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs from major issuers like BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK ) and Fidelity Investments have attracted $6.2 billion in inflows throughout November, surpassing February’s previous peak of $6 billion. Favorable policy discussions and renewed market interest in cryptocurrencies have further fueled the rally. Figures like Donald Trump continue to play a pivotal role in driving sentiment toward digital assets. Despite Bitcoin’s market dominance slightly declining due to an active altcoin season, its strong fundamentals, combined with historical performance, suggest significant upside potential. Historical data provides further optimism for Bitcoin’s trajectory. According to analyst Ali Martinez , Bitcoin has historically surged by 30% and 46% in December following the U.S. presidential elections, achieving significant gains in the last two cycles. Martinez suggests that this trend could repeat, potentially propelling Bitcoin’s price to trade between $125,000 and $140,000 by the end of December. BTC price analysis: Momentum builds for the next move As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $96,682, reflecting a 1.6% decline over the past 24 hours. However, on the monthly chart, BTC remains resilient, showing an impressive 36% gain, signaling robust upward momentum. BTC one-week price chart. Source: Finbold As Bitcoin hovers near the pivotal $100,000 milestone, both technical and fundamental indicators continue to align in favor of a bullish trajectory. The combination of strong institutional demand, accumulation by whales, and favorable market sentiment strengthens Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. With momentum steadily building, Bitcoin is on track to not only break this psychological barrier but to set new milestones, reaffirming its position as the flagship leader of the cryptocurrency market.

The meme coin world is buzzing with fresh opportunities that could turn a modest investment into jaw-dropping returns. While these tokens were once dismissed as mere internet jokes, they’ve transformed into serious contenders in the crypto space, powered by innovative features, strong communities, and a little bit of that signature meme magic. One coin making waves is BTFD Coin , a rising star in the presale scene, already setting records and attracting a flood of investors. If you’ve been waiting to get in early on a project with serious potential, BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. It’s selling fast, and the price is set to rise in the next stage, meaning this is your moment to dive in before it’s too late. Let’s look at three meme coins currently redefining what it means to mix fun and finances: BTFD Coin, Snek, and Pepe Coin. BTFD Coin: The Meme King with Utility Built around the ethos of seizing opportunities during market downturns, BTFD Coin is all about making the most of the lows for maximum highs. But it’s not all slogans and memes; the project has serious utility baked in. The ongoing BTFD Coin presale is gaining momentum like a bull on a sugar rush. With over 10 billion tokens sold to more than 900 holders, it’s already raised $300,000. The current presale price is $0.00005, but this won’t last long. Once the presale ends, the price is set to rocket to $0.0006. For early-stage buyers, this means a potential 15x ROI—or nearly 1,479% returns. That’s what makes this coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. Imagine putting $7,000 into BTFD Coin during its presale at $0.00005. That investment secures over 150 million tokens. Once the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your initial $7,000 could grow to an impressive $100,000. Not bad for a coin that’s just getting started! BTFD Coin stands out with unique features like its high-APY staking rewards (an impressive 90% on average), a play-to-earn (P2E) game that offers token rewards, and its community-centric Bulls Squad. Each Bull character—like Nerdy Bull and Peoples Bull—brings personality and collective hype to the project. Snek: Slithering into the Spotlight If you thought meme coins were all about dogs and cats, think again. Snek slithered into the crypto scene with a unique, reptilian twist that sets it apart from the usual furry contenders. What started as a quirky token has grown into a strong community-driven project. Snek doesn’t overpromise but delivers on what matters most: a tight-knit community and a clear roadmap for growth. With its low entry price and high volatility, it’s a favorite among risk-tolerant traders looking for their next meme coin moonshot. Snek’s charm lies in its meme-worthy branding, and it’s quickly becoming a cult favorite. With a strong meme narrative and a loyal following, Snek is steadily climbing the charts. For those looking for the best new meme coins to invest in right now, this slithery contender deserves a spot on the radar. Pepe Coin: The OG Meme Powerhouse No meme coin roundup would be complete without Pepe Coin, the frog that hopped into the hearts of crypto enthusiasts everywhere. Pepe Coin pays homage to the internet’s favourite amphibian, combining nostalgia with high-octane trading action. Pepe Coin has had its share of wild price swings, but that’s part of the allure. Traders who thrive on volatility have found it irresistible, making it a mainstay on the meme coin leaderboard. While Pepe Coin’s early adopters saw meteoric gains, it remains a solid option for investors who believe in its cultural staying power. Even though Pepe Coin isn’t as “new” as some of its peers, it continues to hold its own, thanks to a robust community and meme-driven marketing. It’s a living testament to the power of internet culture in driving financial ecosystems. Why Meme Coins Are Worth a Second Look Meme coins are more than just fun—they’re a testament to the creativity and community spirit of the crypto world. They’ve proven time and again that they’re capable of delivering massive returns, making them some of the best new meme coins to invest in right now. The key is knowing which coins have the potential to go from meme to mogul. For investors looking to tap into this exciting market, coins like BTFD Coin , Snek, and Pepe Coin offer a mix of innovation, community support, and the potential for significant returns.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHEMUSK.

Notably, the DeFi protocol Hyperliquid is now one of the largest airdrops in history with its genesis event on Nov. 29, as it distributed 310 million HYPE tokens to its community. At the launch, the HYPE token was valued at $3.90, placing the total distribution at $1.2 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. HYPE is currently trading at $8.4, up over a massive 60% in the last 24 hours. It has already hit a market cap of $2.84 billion. According to the protocol, it has distributed 31% of its $1 billion HYPE tokens on the genesis event, with 38.8% of the remaining supply allocated for future emissions and community rewards, 6% to the Hyper Foundation Treasury, and 0.3% to grants. Core contributors will receive 23.8% of the total supply under a 1-year lock period, with vesting schedules ending after 2028. Notably, there are no allocations for private investors, centralized exchanges, or market makers, said Hyperliquid in a statement. Crypto Community Lauds HYPE Airdrop The crypto community is all praises for Hyerliquid’s approach to airdrop. Notably, one of the biggest whales received 508,985 tokens through the HYPE airdrop, making almost $350 million per current price. Someone commented that they had already made $300,000 in profits from the airdrop influence HYPE price rally. Evan Luthra, a notable crypto entrepreneur, also went on to explain why Hyperliquid could be the BNB of this crypto cycle. He noted that HYPE is the token of 2024 and has the adoption, real utility (gas, staking, and more), and volume to hit $100B+ market cap. He noted that while most tokens launch with big promises, HYPE is delivering before it even starts. You missed $BNB and $UNI at launch?

But Will The Momentum Sustain? However, what is concerning is that most crypto tokens with airdrop end up tumbling down right after the launch due to building selling pressure. The same happened with the X Empire and Hamster Kombat, with their prices struggling till date. However, this is not the case with HYPE, with the price soaring higher since its launch. $HYPE chart doesnt even seem real lol…infinite twap w. 0 sellers. fwiw it'll eventually have some pullback but I don't know if it comes before $10. at some price, investors will take profits. but it's got such great tokenomics/community that any dips will be shallow. pic.twitter.com/C6AmNQbb3k — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) November 30, 2024 There are more than 333 million HYPE tokens in circulation.

Ten year-old Kinley Maner raised and sold six chickens for a stellar $2,100 at auction, reports the Phoenix-based news station KTVK. Kinley received a check from the Small Stock Association and initiated an electronic deposit using Chase’s mobile app. But instead of giving her the money, the bank shuttered her account the very next day. Kinley’s dad, J.R., says the family spent hours talking to representatives at the bank and were told the check appeared to be fraudulent. “Their ultimate response is that, sorry, Kinley is not going to get her money back. And there’s nothing we can do unless we can verify that check.” Chase told the family it tried to contact the Small Stock Association and determined that the organization – which is legitimate – is out of service. After the debacle, a full year later, Kinley still did not have her money back. At that point, the family contacted KTVK. Just hours after the news station contacted Chase, J.R. says Chase called Kinley and said they would immediately send her a $2,100 check. “I think, if we wouldn’t have contacted [the media], it was pretty much a dead end.

In his speech on November 29, Leung highlighted the upcoming regulations as part of Hong Kong’s broader efforts to increase transparency and oversight in the burgeoning digital asset space. Leung also touched on developments in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) sector. He announced that five ESG rating and data product providers have expressed their intention to adopt a newly introduced voluntary code. The rules, which were launched last month, focus on four key areas: governance, systems and controls, conflict of interest management and transparency.

According to a screenshot shared by Marina Markezic, Coinbase is letting European Economic Area (EEA) clients know that USDC staking is coming to an end due to Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. “MICA is kicking in -> Sunsetting USDC Rewards in the EU Due to MiCA.” Source: Marina Markezic/X Said Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz on the matter, “It’s funny how often regulations prevent companies from doing things that are unarguably pro-consumer.” It was reported in October that Coinbase would end support for non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins. “Given our commitment to compliance, we intend to restrict the provision of services to EEA users in connection with stablecoins that do not meet the MiCA requirements by December 30, 2024.” MiCA provides rules covering the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of crypto assets. The legislation includes measures that aim to reduce financial crimes including market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing. MiCA also placed stablecoin issuers under the European Banking Authority and is requiring them to hold sufficient liquid reserves. The part of the legislation covering stablecoins took effect in June, while the rest is scheduled to roll out in December.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) was introduced in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Created by software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it features the Shiba Inu dog from the “Doge” meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin is designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially perceived as a joke, it quickly developed a substantial online community and gained attention for its playful approach to digital currency. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge in value, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization with a total value exceeding $50 billion. This growth was influenced by social media activity and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. The coin is based on Litecoin’s technology, offering quick transaction times and low fees. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains a widely recognized cryptocurrency with active community support. Its accessibility and active trading make it a notable participant in the crypto market. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum. It was created as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme by Matt Furie, which gained popularity in the early 2000s. The project aims to capitalize on the success of other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE seeks to establish itself among the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. It appeals to the crypto community with a no-tax policy and transparency about its lack of utility, embracing its identity as a pure memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market cap reaching a high of $1.6 billion at one point. Early holders saw substantial gains, and a strong community formed around the coin. This surge contributed to what some refer to as a “memecoin season,” with many new memecoins experiencing rapid price movements. The PEPE roadmap includes three phases, starting with listings on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter, progressing to listings on centralized exchanges, and culminating in “tier 1” exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” The coin’s performance reflects the dynamic nature of the memecoin market in the current cycle. First Neiro On Ethereum (NEIRO) Neiro Token is a new cryptocurrency launched on the Ethereum blockchain, inspired by Neiro, a recently adopted Shiba Inu dog owned by the same woman who cared for Kabosu, the famous dog behind the Doge meme. This project serves as a tribute to Neiro and is the first token dedicated to her on Ethereum. Completely owned and managed by its community, Neiro Token aims to build a supportive network around the charm of Neiro. Utilizing Ethereum’s established blockchain technology, Neiro Token benefits from a secure and decentralized platform. The community-driven nature of the project allows holders to influence its development and direction. In the current market cycle, where community engagement and meme-inspired tokens have significant attention, Neiro Token adds a new dimension by connecting to the legacy of the Doge meme. Its appeal lies in the combination of a beloved cultural icon and the active participation of its community members. Popcat (POPCAT) The POPCAT token is a meme coin that draws inspiration from the Popcat internet meme of October 2020. The meme features two images of a cat named Oatmeal—one with a closed mouth and another edited to show an open, ‘O’-shaped mouth. This simple yet amusing meme gained widespread popularity online. The POPCAT token captures the essence of the meme, existing as a token with no inherent value or financial expectations. It is intended solely for entertainment purposes. As a meme coin, the POPCAT token draws attention through its connection to a popular internet meme. It leverages community engagement and social media buzz. In the current market cycle, where meme coins have seen significant interest, the POPCAT token may pique curiosity among enthusiasts. Its appeal lies in its entertainment value and its potential to foster an online community centered around the Popcat meme. Conclusion Embracing meme coins like DOGE, PEPE, NEIRO, and POPCAT can lead to gains, but XYZVerse (XYZ) combines sports and memes for unmatched potential this bull run.

33767162,[object Object],1732989600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Is Bitcoin Price Top At $146,000? Here’s Why CryptoQuant Thinks So",https://bitcoinist.com/is-bitcoin-price-top-a-146000-cryptoquant-thinks-so/,"The call of the Bitcoin price reaching $100,000 cooled off this past week, especially after the premier cryptocurrency slipped beneath $93,000 during the last seven-day span. Fortunately, BTC has somewhat recovered from the slump, climbing as high as $98,500 on Friday, November 29. Following the recent Bitcoin price decline, investors have been left wondering if the market cycle top is close — or if there is still more room for growth. A prominent on-chain analytics firm has revealed that the crypto market is still in a bullish phase. Bitcoin Still In A Bull Market, But Blockchain Firm Sounds Warning In its latest report, the market analytics platform CryptoQuant has put forward a target for the Bitcoin price top in the current cycle. According to the blockchain firm, the market leader’s price top is more in the range of a six-figure valuation. The major rationale behind this projection is based on the realized price valuation metric, which measures the price at which each coin was last transacted. From a historical perspective, this Bitcoin price band has often acted as an indicator of the market top in past cycles. According to CryptoQuant, the realized price metric is currently pointing to $146,000 as the possible peak in this cycle. As shown in the chart below, the price band (the red line), currently around $147,000, acted as the market top around April and May 2021. Furthermore, the holdings of new investors are yet to reach an extreme level, which was a signal in the past two market tops. As of now, the value held by new Bitcoin investors represents a little above 50% of the total money in BTC; this figure significantly pales compared to 90% and 80% witnessed in 2017 and 2021, respectively. CryptoQuant warned: Bitcoin price tops typically occur when new investors enter the market to buy at extremely high prices, which causes them to hold a large proportion of the total value invested. Moreover, the retail trading activity is yet to hit levels often associated with Bitcoin price peaks. Historically, bull cycles have been seen to top out when BTC retail investors are accumulating coins aggressively. However, this phenomenon is still absent in the current market condition. It is worth mentioning that CryptoQuant expects a pullback for the Bitcoin price in the short term. According to the on-chain intelligence firm, MicroStrategy’s stock price is becoming overheated relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings value. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $96,500, reflecting an almost 3% increase in the past 24 hours. While this single-day rally has helped shave off some of BTC’s loss in the past week, the premier cryptocurrency is still down by over 2% within the timeframe.

Interestingly, popular analyst EGRAG Crypto has weighed in on the discourse around a highly-anticipated altseason, predicting a potential market inflow of $627 billion. Bitcoin Dominance To Crash By 33% As Altcoins Fly – Analyst In an X post on Friday , EGRAG Crypto provided valuable insight on the market growth potential of altcoins in the upcoming altseason. The analyst employed the Volume Range Visible Profile (VRVP), an analysis tool to identify key support and resistance levels based on trading volume, to study the trading activity of Bitcoin across different dominance levels. For context, the alt season is a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation. It is characterized by a relative decline in Bitcoin’s market share as capital moves into other cryptocurrencies. As shown in the weekly chart below, EGRAG Crypto notes that Bitcoin’s dominance is closing below its Value Area High (VAH) i.e. the upper boundary of heavy trading activity which currently acts as a resistance zone. This development is particularly bullish for altcoins as it signals increasing selling pressure on Bitcoin which may weaken its dominance over other assets. Importantly, EGRAG Crypto also highlights the Value Area Low (VAL) i.e. lower boundary of heavy trading activity which is likely to act as support and target level for Bitcoin dominance in this altseason. According to values drawn by the analyst, BTC Dominance will decline by 33.04% if it reaches its Value Area Low. Therefore, considering Bitcoin’s current market cap of $1.91 trillion, the altcoins are likely to record new inflows of $627 billion in the forthcoming weeks. In addition, EGRAG Crypto also states Bitcoin Dominance will have a Point of Control (POC) target of 42% in this altseason. The POC represents a pivotal price/dominance level with the most trading volume and a decline below which signals a confirmative shift in market interest from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies. Ethereum Remains Key To Altseason Charge With more expert commentary on the altseason, analyst Michaël Van de Poppe has appraised the positive price performances of altcoins in the past month. Furthermore, the analyst states that if Ethereum (ETH) , the largest altcoin by market cap, closes above 0.035 on the ETH/BTC chart for November, it will suggest a strong bullish period for altcoins in December. At the time of writing, the altcoin market remains valued at $1.39 trillion representing 41.4% of the total crypto market cap.",Altcoin|altcoins|altseason|bitcoin dominance|Egrag Crypto|ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 18:00:47

These assets have raised their heads high amid discussions about their long-term potential. As these cryptos strive for a bullish success story, Rollblock, a new crypto, has entered the arena, capturing investors’ imagination with an exceptional use case that is hard to ignore. Rollblock’s innovation makes it a pioneering figure revitalizing the online gambling industry, worth over $500 billion and projected to grow by 50% in 2025. This text has everything we know about these developments and what they mean for investors. Rollblock: The breakout crypto sensation takes the market by storm While XRP and ADA make a show of their unprecedented rallies, Rollblock, the new crypto sensation, is quietly building steam and capturing investors’ interest as it prepares for its upcoming bullish trend. Experts believe Rollblock will dominate the upcoming bull run with its explosive presale momentum. Also, as the demand for GambleFi tokens like Rollblock continues to reach new heights, analysts predict that this new crypto will break out soon – delivering over 880% gains for its early adopters. Another reason behind the optimism surrounding the Rollblock token is the rich fundamentals that set it apart in the crowded crypto space. Besides big gains, Rollblock appeals to investors with its unique revenue-sharing model, which allows holders to enjoy passive income. Weekly, Rollblock allows its early investors to get a 40% share of its revenue through staking rewards on the platform. The remaining 60% will be used for regular token buybacks that are burned immediately to ensure the RBLK price soars to new heights. ADA growth to continue fueled by ecosystem expansion ADA’s recent performance has been impressive, with the Cardano price gaining over 40% from last month’s high. This growth emanates from ADA’s increasing network growth and rising user engagement. Analysts believe this growth will continue steadily to ADA’s ATH at $3. After a brief consolidation in Uptober, the Cardano price is gaining momentum again, and the on-chain metrics show its upward trend will continue in 2025. In addition to these positive sentiments, ADA’s ecosystem enhancement following the successful launch of the first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on the Cardano mainnet is propelling it to new resistance levels. This marks a major milestone in the layer-1 network, already reflected in the Cardano price. Ripple’s regulatory clarity drives optimism Like the Cardano price, XRP is riding positive momentum as its price spiked to $1.46 and gained over 25% from last month. This shift in momentum for the XRP price has given its token holders hope for a more lenient regulatory standing with the SEC. The XRP wave of positive momentum is poised to continue following the announcement of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation, scheduled for early 2025. Several XRP predictions have been made, with a more conservative approach predicting an XRP price surge to $1.70. However, more bullish predictions are seeing the Ripple price surge past its ATH and close to $4. Conclusion The momentum behind the Cardano price and XRP reflects the resilience and innovativeness of the crypto market, offering investors promising investment opportunities. For those seeking diversification, the Rollblock token presale presents a high-reward opportunity at $0.037. Take action before it’s too late!

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 18:04:23

The platform’s foray into live-streaming content, initially designed to engage and attract users, ultimately took a dark turn. The platform faced an overwhelming backlash that was impossible to ignore. This comes as the streams were flooded with disturbing content, including explicit material, violence, and death, making it impossible to ignore. Amid growing calls for its shutdown, Pump.fun finally pulled the plug on its live-stream function, but the fallout was immediate and severe. Pump.fun Sees A Sharp Decline in User Activity The immediate consequence of the livestream suspension has been a sharp decline in user engagement. According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of addresses creating new tokens fell by 50%. The platform saw an influx of 37,134 token creators slashed in half to just 14,952 in 24 hours. This loss of activity is hitting Pump.fun hard, especially in terms of its revenue from fees. Previously, the platform enjoyed steady daily fee revenues of over $2 million, with a peak of $14.35 million in November. 23. However, by November. 28, those figures took a dramatic turn, dipping under $2 million for the first time in nearly two weeks. This revenue plunge directly results from the falling user engagement and the steep drop in new token creators. Pump.fun’s Livestream Shutdown Takes a Heavy Toll The livestream feature had become central to the platform’s success, and its removal has left a void. In November. 27, active users peaked at 282,560, while new users hit 152,358. However, by November 28, those numbers had plummeted. Active users on the platform have dropped by 69.4%, falling to 86,245, and new users decreased by 76.5%, down to just 35,711. Even trading volumes took a massive hit, sinking by over 60%. Daily transactions fell from 3.27 million to 1.29 million, dragging total volumes from $283.62 million to $103.31 million. The Future of Pump.fun: Can It Recover? With the livestream feature now suspended, many are speculating what the future holds for Pump.fun. The platform’s decline in user activity suggests that the livestream was not just a side feature but a core driver of engagement. Some believe the team may reinstate live streaming once they improve content moderation controls. However, whether the platform can recover from this setback remains uncertain. One thing is clear: Pump.fun now faces a significant challenge. It is still being determined whether or not it can regain its footing without the controversial livestream feature. The next few weeks will reveal if it can maintain its position in the competitive world of crypto-based platforms.

37057846,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=620501,1732991048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37057846.jpeg,Russia’s economy might’ve never been as strong as it looked,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/russias-economy-mightve-never-been-as-strong/,"Russia’s economy is wobbling under a mountain of pressure, and the cracks are becoming harder to hide. This week, the ruble plunged to 114 against the dollar, its weakest since the chaotic days following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The timing couldn’t be worse for President Vlad Putin, whose forces are still bombing Ukrainian cities and eking out incremental gains on the eastern front. While Russia insists it has everything under control, the numbers paint a different story, one that suggests the economy may never have been as strong as the Kremlin made it out to be. Putin is not worried The latest ruble crash followed a fresh round of U.S. sanctions targeting Gazprombank, Russia’s primary financial artery for energy payments. These sanctions hit hard, disrupting Moscow’s ability to fund its ongoing war efforts. Russia’s Central Bank had to step in, halting foreign purchases of rubles to stabilize its battered currency. The intervention brought minor relief, with the ruble trading at 110 against the dollar by Thursday. But the damage is already done, and experts are questioning how long Moscow can keep up the facade of economic strength. Putin, as expected, brushed off concerns, saying seasonal factors and budget-related issues triggered the ruble’s slide. “There are absolutely no grounds for panic,” he told reporters. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also claimed the currency’s performance won’t affect ordinary Russians since their incomes are in rubles anyway. But for a country neck-deep in sanctions and fighting a costly war, this optimism feels like wishful thinking. China: Russia’s lifeline under sanctions Meanwhile, Moscow has found an unlikely savior in China. Beijing has become Russia’s largest supplier of goods banned under Western sanctions, filling critical gaps in everything from technology to machinery. The two countries now bypass the dollar in their transactions, relying heavily on the yuan. Economists warn that this dynamic could backfire in the long run. It’s easy to see why. The ruble’s decline isn’t just about sanctions. Inflation in Russia is climbing, fueled by skyrocketing government spending on the war. The Central Bank’s tight monetary policies are meant to keep inflation in check, but they’ve triggered a clash within Russia’s power circles. Officially, Russia’s economy seems to be holding up. The International Monetary Fund predicts 3.6% GDP growth for 2024, putting Russia among the world’s fastest-growing economies outside India and China. Russian officials proudly cite growth rates of 5.4% and 4.1% for the first two quarters of 2023. On paper, this looks like a victory for Mr. Putin. But critics argue that these numbers are more propaganda than reality. Since the invasion, the Kremlin has weaponized economic data, using it to project an image of resilience. Vladimir Milov, an economist and exiled opposition activist, has questioned the reliability of these figures, noting that the government’s tight grip on data makes it impossible to separate fact from fiction. Even William Pomeranz of the Wilson Center has warned that the economy might be sitting on a “social explosion,” with rising costs and falling incomes pushing Russians to the brink. Labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are adding to the strain. The war has drained Russia’s workforce, leaving industries scrambling to fill gaps. Meanwhile, the cost of living continues to rise, with food and energy prices putting extra pressure on households. The government has tried to put the blame on Western sanctions, calling them the main driver of inflation. Even the military budget, which has ballooned since the invasion, is feeling the squeeze. A recent decree cut state payments for certain categories of wounded soldiers, which brought outrage. Balancing butter and guns Moscow’s “guns over butter” strategy has its limits, and the flaws are showing. Putin has denied that rising defense spending comes at the expense of ordinary Russians. The government is pouring money into weapons production and military operations, leaving little room for other priorities. This imbalance is unsustainable, especially as sanctions tighten and oil revenues become less reliable. Energy exports have been Russia’s saving grace, keeping cash flowing even as Western markets shut their doors. Countries willing to ignore the war, like China and India, have continued buying Russian oil and gas. But even this lifeline is under threat. The global push for renewable energy and falling oil prices are eroding Russia’s energy dominance, leaving the Kremlin with fewer options. The IMF’s latest forecast predicts a sharp slowdown in 2025, with growth expected to drop to just 1.3%. Slower wage growth, reduced private investment, and a tightening labor market are all contributing factors. While Russia may claim short-term victories, the long-term outlook is bleak.

The Bank of Uganda says police are launching an investigation into the theft of 62 billion Ugandan shillings, worth $16.8 million, reports Reuters. The hacking group “Waste” claims it’s responsible for the breach, according to the state-owned news outlet Vision. State minister of finance, Henry Musasizi, says some initial reports on the hack are overblown. “It is true our accounts were hacked into but not to the extent of what is being reported. When this happened, we instituted an audit and at the same time, and investigation.” As the investigation kicks off, Vision says unnamed sources at the bank say some of the money has been sent to Japan, and half of the money that was taken has been successfully recovered. Meanwhile, the Daily Monitor, which is the largest independent newspaper in the country, says early indications suggest the breach may have been at least partially an inside job.

VIRTUAL Price Analysis: Is the Rally Losing Momentumn? The VIRTUAL price seems to be at a turning point as technical indicators suggest a potential correction. VIRTUAL / USDT 4H chart, potential correction. Source: Binance. VIRTUAL appears to be facing a similar fate to other coins that have experienced significant crashes in recent days, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) deeply lodged in overbought territory at 81. When the RSI reaches such levels, it typically signals that the asset has been exhausted by its recent gains, making a correction the natural and healthy next step to find more stable footing for its next leg up. Given the new highs VIRTUAL has reached, it is now in a discovery phase, sussing out its technical supports. The $1.1234 support does seem like a credible bottom, reaffirming the consistent support provided by the 50SMA. Catslap Technicals Ring Bullish: Could it See Bigger Gains? While VIRTUAL certainly holds potential, the near term may see a slowdown in its recent gains as it overcomes its overbought state. Holders could benefit from taking profits and diversifying into coins primed for gains. As ”meme coin supercycle” sentiment sees coins like $ACT and $PNUT have experienced sudden rises to prominence, newer high-potential low cap meme coins present an appealing opportunity. Among them, Catslap ($SLAP) stands out as a credible contender to the likes of Popcat, Mogcat, and Mew, and it’s on the tail end of its recent correction.

FTX was a leading cryptocurrency exchange, known for its innovative products and services, including derivatives, spot markets, and tokenized stocks. However, it is essential to clarify that FTX is not a publicly traded company , meaning there is no “FTX stock” available for trading on traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. FTX operated as a private company, backed by significant venture capital investments before its widely publicized collapse in 2022. FTX and Equity Investment Pre-Collapse Equity Funding Before its bankruptcy, FTX attracted substantial funding from leading venture capital firms and institutional investors, including: Sequoia Capital SoftBank Tiger Global Management These investments valued the company at $32 billion at its peak, making it one of the most valuable companies in the cryptocurrency sector. Tokenized Stocks FTX offered tokenized stocks, which allowed users to gain exposure to traditional equities in a crypto-friendly format. These products mirrored the price of real stocks but were not FTX equity themselves. Why There’s No FTX Stock Available Private Ownership FTX was a privately held company and did not go public, meaning retail investors could not buy shares through traditional stock exchanges. Bankruptcy Proceedings Following its collapse in November 2022 due to liquidity issues and allegations of fraud, FTX entered bankruptcy proceedings. Any potential equity associated with the company has been tied up in legal disputes and liquidation efforts. What Happened to FTX? Collapse Overview FTX faced a liquidity crisis in late 2022, exacerbated by mismanagement of customer funds and financial practices involving its sister company, Alameda Research. The scandal led to: CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s Resignation Global Regulatory Investigations Billions in Customer Losses Legal and Financial Fallout The collapse has triggered ongoing lawsuits, with investors, customers, and creditors seeking to recover lost funds. Lessons from FTX’s Downfall 1. Importance of Transparency The lack of financial transparency in FTX’s operations highlights the need for stricter regulations in the crypto space. 2. Risks in Centralized Platforms FTX’s failure underscores the risks associated with centralized exchanges, prompting a shift toward decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. 3. Due Diligence in Investing Investors are reminded to carefully vet companies, especially in volatile sectors like cryptocurrency. Future of Cryptocurrency Exchange Stocks Publicly Traded Crypto Companies While FTX itself is not a tradable stock, other crypto companies like Coinbase ($COIN) and Robinhood ($HOOD) are available on traditional stock exchanges. Potential Revival or Acquisition There have been discussions about the possibility of restructuring or relaunching FTX under new management. Any such revival could potentially involve equity offerings in the future. Conclusion: The Current State of FTX Stock Although there is no FTX stock available, the story of FTX serves as a cautionary tale about the risks and rewards of investing in the crypto sector. As the industry matures, investors will need to remain vigilant and informed, particularly when considering opportunities in cryptocurrency-related equities.

According to CryptoQuant, the realized price —representing the average price at which Bitcoin was last moved on-chain—has historically provided critical insights into market cycles. The highest target price of $146K corresponds to the upper resistance band within the realized price framework. Notably, Bitcoin touched this upper band during its April-May 2021 rally, a period that coincided with the cryptocurrency’s cycle peak. What is Realized Price Valuation? 1. Realized Price Defined The realized price is an on-chain metric that calculates the average acquisition cost of Bitcoin across the network. Unlike the market price, which reflects current trading activity, realized price focuses on the value stored on the blockchain: Calculation Method: Realized price is the total value of all Bitcoins at their last on-chain transaction price divided by the total supply. Significance: It provides a deeper understanding of market sentiment and investor behavior. 2. Upper Resistance Band CryptoQuant uses the realized price to create valuation bands, with the upper band serving as a resistance level historically associated with market cycle tops. Historical Context: 2021 Bitcoin Rally During Bitcoin’s April-May 2021 rally, the price touched the upper resistance band derived from realized price. At that time: Cycle Peak: Bitcoin achieved its highest value in that market cycle, surpassing $60,000. Resistance Confirmation: The realized price band acted as a reliable indicator for overbought conditions, marking the market’s eventual pullback. Why $146K? Key Factors Behind the Target 1. Market Cycles and Realized Price Trends Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests a strong correlation between realized price resistance and market cycle peaks. The current cycle may follow a similar trajectory, with $146K representing the next potential peak based on these patterns. 2. Growing Institutional Adoption Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has accelerated, driven by: The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Increased participation from financial institutions. Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a hedge against inflation. 3. On-Chain Metrics Supporting Bullish Momentum Other on-chain indicators, such as the long-term holder cost basis and supply dynamics , align with CryptoQuant’s projection, indicating that the market is poised for further growth. Caveats and Risks to Consider 1. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s inherent volatility could lead to significant deviations from the projected target. External factors, such as macroeconomic conditions or regulatory developments, may impact its trajectory. 2. Over-Reliance on Historical Patterns While realized price has been a reliable indicator in the past, market conditions evolve, and historical patterns may not always predict future outcomes. 3. Resistance at Key Levels Bitcoin’s ability to break through psychological and technical resistance levels—such as $100K—will be crucial in achieving the $146K target. What Needs to Happen for Bitcoin to Hit $146K? 1. Sustained Bullish Momentum The broader cryptocurrency market must maintain its current upward trajectory, supported by strong trading volumes and positive sentiment. 2. Institutional Support Increased inflows from institutional investors, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs, could drive the price higher. 3. Macro and Regulatory Tailwinds Favorable macroeconomic conditions and regulatory clarity will be critical in fostering market confidence and sustained demand. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook with Caveats CryptoQuant’s $146K Bitcoin price target, based on realized price valuation, reflects a bullish outlook grounded in historical data and on-chain analysis. While the metric has proven reliable in identifying cycle peaks, achieving this target will depend on favorable market conditions and sustained demand. Investors should approach such projections with caution, balancing optimism with the inherent volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market.

He promotes Bitcoin as a safe investment, alongside gold and silver, and advises against saving cash in traditional ways. Robert Kiyosaki believes that saving money the old way will cause people to lose wealth over time and it’s not a better way to get rich. He adds that investing in tangible assets like Bitcoin is a better way to protect and grow one’s wealth. In an X post , Kiyosaki warned that once Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, the average and middle-class person will find it difficult to get involved in the crypto market. He believes that the ultra-rich, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will definitely dominate Bitcoin ownership as its price increases. Kiyosaki’s warning has created different opinions. Many of his followers on X disagreed with his statement, saying that Bitcoin is decentralized and can be bought in small fractions, and it will be accessible to anyone, no matter their wealth position. They even argued if Bitcoin hits $1 million, people can still invest in it with smaller amounts. Kiyosaki’s investment plan De spite his warnings, Kiyosaki revealed he plans to continue purchasing Bitcoin until it breaks the $100,000 barrier. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author shared his belief in the importance of owning safe assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, adding that holding cash is not a wise strategy today. He stated “Cash is trash,” a reminder to not rely on traditional currencies like the dollar or euro. Kiyosaki’s recent remarks on Bitcoin’s future come as the coin sees a 154% increase on a year-to-date and a 35% jump in the past month alone. Once Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, he stated that he will stop buying, to caution against greedy. Robert Kiyosaki’s strategy is to buy assets when prices are low and sell them once their value increases – something traders will refer to as “long-term value rather than short-term speculation.” The American businessman isn’t the only one predicting big things for Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, predicts that Bitcoin could hit $500,000 by 2025 and even reach over $1 million by 2030. Kiyosaki believes Bitcoin could go as high as $13 million per coin in the next decade.

According to data from Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency, this marks a 350% year-on-year increase, the highest figure since the 2021 bull market. This resurgence follows a turbulent period marked by declining volumes in 2022, largely due to government-imposed double taxation policies on cryptocurrency gains. Despite these challenges, 2024 has proven to be a pivotal year for the Indonesian crypto market, signaling renewed investor confidence and growing adoption. Key Highlights of Indonesia’s Crypto Trading Volume in 2024 1.

Market Volatility Price Swings: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies continues to pose risks for both retail and institutional investors.

37058299,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105787,1732992338,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Brazil’s Central Bank Considers Ban on Stablecoin Withdrawals to Self-Custody Wallets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brazils-central-bank-considers-ban-on-stablecoin-withdrawals-to-self-custody-wallets/,"Brazil Proposes Stablecoin Withdrawal Ban to Self-Custody Wallets The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) has announced plans to regulate the withdrawal of stablecoins from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) to self-custody wallets. This proposed measure, aimed at protecting international capital flow integrity, signals a significant shift in how digital assets may be governed in Brazil. According to a report by CryptoSlate , the BCB’s proposed regulation is part of a broader effort to integrate digital assets into the country’s financial system while maintaining robust oversight. A public consultation period, open until February 28, 2025, will allow stakeholders to provide input on the potential impacts of the measure. Key Details of the Proposed Regulation 1. Targeting Stablecoin Withdrawals The regulation specifically focuses on stablecoins, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies or other assets, due to their perceived risk in cross-border financial flows. Why Stablecoins? Stablecoins offer the stability of fiat currencies with the efficiency of blockchain technology, making them a preferred choice for remittances and cross-border transactions. Centralized vs. Self-Custody: The proposed rule would limit users to keeping stablecoins within CEXs, restricting transfers to private wallets where the central bank has no visibility. 2. Protecting Capital Flows The BCB highlighted its commitment to ensuring the integrity of international capital flows. Preventing Illegal Activities: Limiting self-custody could reduce risks related to money laundering and tax evasion. Increased Transparency: Keeping stablecoins within regulated platforms would enhance monitoring and compliance. 3. Public Consultation Period The regulation’s public consultation phase, ending February 28, 2025, invites market participants to share their opinions and concerns. Inclusivity in Decision-Making: This approach reflects the central bank’s effort to balance innovation with regulation. Potential Adjustments: Stakeholder feedback may influence the final version of the regulation. Implications for Users and the Market For Individual Users: Loss of Autonomy: Restricting access to self-custody wallets could undermine the core principles of decentralization and financial sovereignty. Increased Reliance on CEXs: Users may have to trust centralized exchanges for storing and managing stablecoins, raising concerns about security and custodial risks. For Exchanges: Operational Adjustments: CEXs may need to implement additional compliance measures to align with the new regulation. Potential User Outflows: Restrictions could drive users toward decentralized platforms or non-stablecoin assets. For the Crypto Ecosystem: Impact on Innovation: Limiting self-custody could stifle innovation in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). Global Repercussions: Brazil’s approach could set a precedent for other countries evaluating stablecoin regulations. Why Is Brazil Considering This Regulation? 1. Aligning with Global Standards Brazil’s move mirrors global discussions on regulating stablecoins. G7 Recommendations: The G7 has emphasized the importance of regulating stablecoins to mitigate risks to financial stability. Other Jurisdictions: Countries like the United States and the European Union are also exploring frameworks for stablecoin oversight. 2. Integrating Digital Assets into Financial Systems The BCB aims to create a regulatory framework that integrates digital assets while ensuring financial system integrity. 3. Combating Financial Crimes Restricting self-custody wallets can enhance oversight and reduce opportunities for illicit financial activities. Concerns and Criticisms 1. Erosion of Financial Sovereignty Critics argue that restricting self-custody wallets undermines users’ ability to control their assets. 2. Potential for Overregulation Overly restrictive measures could drive innovation and economic activity away from Brazil to jurisdictions with more favorable policies. 3. Security Risks with CEXs Mandating the use of centralized exchanges increases reliance on custodial platforms, which are more vulnerable to hacks and operational failures. What’s Next? Public Consultation Phase: The consultation period provides an opportunity for stakeholders to voice concerns and propose alternatives. Potential Outcomes: The BCB may revise the regulation based on feedback. If implemented, the regulation could reshape how stablecoins are used in Brazil. Global Influence: As one of the leading economies in Latin America, Brazil’s regulatory approach could influence how other countries address stablecoin self-custody. Conclusion: Balancing Innovation and Regulation Brazil’s proposed regulation on stablecoin withdrawals reflects its commitment to maintaining financial oversight while integrating digital assets into the mainstream economy. While the measure aims to enhance transparency and security, it raises significant concerns about user autonomy and the future of decentralized finance. As the public consultation progresses, market participants will play a crucial role in shaping the outcome. The final decision will likely have far-reaching implications, both within Brazil and globally.

The index remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone, signaling heightened bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Provided by Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely-used indicator of market emotions, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). The index reflects the collective sentiment of market participants and can often predict potential shifts in market trends. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index How the Index Works The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is calculated using six weighted factors: Volatility (25%) – Measures recent price swings and compares them to average volatility. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) – Tracks trading volume and momentum to identify surges in buying activity.

Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Evaluates Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) – Measures interest in cryptocurrency-related searches. A score above 75 places the market in the Extreme Greed zone, while a score below 25 indicates Extreme Fear . What Does an Index Score of 84 Indicate? 1. Elevated Market Optimism The current score reflects widespread bullish sentiment, driven by: Improved Market Conditions: Recent rallies in Bitcoin and altcoins have renewed confidence among investors. Increased Participation: Higher trading volumes and social media activity point to growing interest. 2. Potential Overextension While a high score can signal optimism, it may also suggest that the market is overheated. Risk of Corrections: Extreme Greed often precedes market pullbacks as over-leveraged positions unwind. Factors Driving the Current Sentiment 1. Bitcoin’s Price Performance Bitcoin’s recent stability above key support levels has bolstered market sentiment. As the leading cryptocurrency, its performance heavily influences the index. 2. Strong Altcoin Momentum The Altcoin Season Index also reflects robust altcoin activity, complementing Bitcoin’s dominance and further boosting investor confidence. 3. Social Media Buzz Social platforms are rife with bullish discussions, signaling increased retail investor engagement. Memecoins and high-profile project updates have added to the excitement. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Bullish Scenarios: Continued Momentum: If Bitcoin and altcoins maintain their upward trajectory, the index could stay in Extreme Greed for an extended period. Institutional Support: Positive news from institutions or regulatory clarity could further strengthen sentiment. Bearish Risks: Market Corrections: A sudden downturn could shift the index back toward Neutral or Fear zones. Over-Leverage: High levels of leverage in the market increase the risk of liquidations during pullbacks. How to Use the Fear & Greed Index as an Investor 1. Identifying Market Extremes The index helps investors understand whether the market is overbought or oversold: Extreme Fear: May signal buying opportunities as prices tend to be lower. Extreme Greed: Indicates caution, as the market could be nearing a peak. 2. Managing Risk High greed scores suggest heightened market volatility, encouraging prudent risk management. 3. Timing Entry and Exit Points Combining the index with technical analysis can help refine entry and exit strategies. Conclusion: Navigating the Extreme Greed Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 84 underscores the current bullish sentiment driving the cryptocurrency market. While the optimism is encouraging, investors should remain vigilant, as Extreme Greed often signals potential corrections ahead.

According to a recent report by CryptoRank.io , Binance and Gemini have experienced increases in their Bitcoin reserves, while Kraken and Bybit have seen significant reductions. These shifts highlight broader market dynamics influenced by Bitcoin price movements and trading activity. Bitcoin Reserves: A Year-to-Date Comparison Binance and Gemini: Increases in Reserves Binance: Bitcoin reserves rose from 579,000 to 586,000, reflecting increased user deposits and confidence in the exchange. Gemini: Reserves grew from 124,000 to 127,000, signaling steady demand for the platform’s secure custody services. Kraken and Bybit: Declines in Reserves Kraken: Reported a reduction in Bitcoin holdings, indicative of outflows to private wallets or alternative platforms. Bybit: Experienced a similar trend, with users withdrawing Bitcoin, possibly due to market volatility or operational preferences. Understanding the Broader Trend 1. Rising Bitcoin Prices and Market Activity Periods of rising Bitcoin prices often correlate with reduced reserves on centralized exchanges. This trend occurs as: Investors Move to Private Wallets: Users secure their holdings in private wallets to safeguard against exchange risks. Increased Trading Activity: Higher market activity can lead to fluctuations in reserves as Bitcoin is moved in and out of exchanges for trading. 2. Exchange-Specific Factors Binance and Gemini’s Growth: Binance’s increase may reflect its dominance as the world’s largest crypto exchange, attracting new deposits. Gemini’s focus on institutional-grade security and regulatory compliance appeals to long-term holders. Kraken and Bybit’s Declines: Outflows from Kraken and Bybit could be driven by users seeking alternative platforms or non-custodial solutions. Why Bitcoin Reserves Matter Bitcoin reserves on exchanges serve as a key metric for understanding market sentiment and liquidity: Low Reserves: Often signal reduced selling pressure as users move Bitcoin off exchanges, indicating bullish sentiment. High Reserves: Suggest greater liquidity, enabling easier transactions but potentially increasing selling pressure during downturns. Potential Implications for the Crypto Market 1. Increased Institutional Interest The growth in reserves at regulated platforms like Gemini may indicate rising institutional participation. Institutions often prefer exchanges with robust security and compliance measures. 2. Bullish Indicators The decline in reserves at Kraken and Bybit aligns with a broader trend of users securing their holdings, a behavior typically observed during bull markets. 3. Shifting User Preferences User behavior varies by platform, influenced by factors like: Fee structures. Security features. Accessibility and trading options. How Exchanges Are Adapting to Reserve Shifts Binance: Continuing to dominate with its wide range of trading pairs, liquidity, and user incentives. Gemini: Focusing on security, regulatory compliance, and institutional services to attract long-term investors. Kraken and Bybit: Potentially reviewing strategies to retain users and mitigate reserve declines, such as introducing new features or improving user experience. Conclusion: A Dynamic Market Landscape The shifts in Bitcoin reserves at Binance, Gemini, Kraken, and Bybit reflect evolving market trends and user behavior. While Binance and Gemini show growth driven by user confidence and institutional interest, Kraken and Bybit face challenges in retaining reserves. For investors, these reserve trends offer valuable insights into market sentiment and liquidity dynamics.

Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. An index score of 65 indicates that a majority of altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin, underscoring the dominance of altcoins in the current market cycle. What Is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures market dynamics by analyzing whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin: Altcoin Season (Score: 50-100): Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Bitcoin Season (Score: 1-49): Indicates Bitcoin dominance, where 25% or fewer of the top altcoins outperform Bitcoin. The index, updated daily, provides a snapshot of market sentiment and trends. Key Takeaways from the Current Index Reading 1. Market is Firmly in Altcoin Season The sustained score of 65 suggests that altcoins have maintained their lead over Bitcoin, reflecting strong investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. 2. Stability in the Market Cycle The unchanged score from the previous day indicates a period of relative market stability, with no significant shifts in Bitcoin or altcoin performance. 3. Broader Implications for Investors Altcoin Investors: A favorable time for altcoin investors, as the majority of coins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Holders: Could signal reduced dominance and slower short-term growth for Bitcoin relative to altcoins. How the Altcoin Season Index Works Exclusion Criteria Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the index calculation to ensure a more accurate reflection of altcoin performance. Data Collection The index tracks price changes for the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC over a rolling 90-day period. Outperformance Threshold: For the market to qualify as Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the tracked altcoins must outperform Bitcoin. Daily Updates: Scores are recalculated daily, reflecting the latest market data. What’s Driving Altcoin Performance? 1. DeFi and Layer-2 Innovations Altcoins powering decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer-2 solutions continue to see increased adoption, contributing to their strong performance. 2. NFT Market Resurgence Altcoins associated with non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems, such as Ethereum-based tokens, are benefiting from renewed interest in digital collectibles. 3. Broader Adoption Trends Institutional and retail interest in altcoins beyond Bitcoin has fueled demand, as investors diversify their portfolios. Impact on Bitcoin and the Market as a Whole Bitcoin’s Role in Altcoin Season While Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency, its underperformance relative to altcoins during Altcoin Season highlights: Reduced Short-Term Dominance: Investors are shifting focus to alternative projects with higher growth potential. Catalyst for Diversification: The current market dynamics encourage diversification into high-performing altcoins. Overall Market Health Altcoin Season often signals a healthy cryptocurrency market, characterized by increased activity, innovation, and investment. What Could Shift the Market Back to Bitcoin Season? Bitcoin Price Surge: A significant rally in Bitcoin’s price could attract capital back to BTC, reducing altcoin dominance. Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity or restrictions impacting altcoins could tilt market dynamics in Bitcoin’s favor. Market Corrections: A broad market downturn could see investors consolidating assets in Bitcoin as a “safe haven.” Conclusion: Altcoin Season Shows No Signs of Slowing The Altcoin Season Index’s steady reading of 65 reinforces the strong performance of altcoins in the current market environment. For investors, this is an opportune time to explore alternative cryptocurrencies as they continue to outshine Bitcoin. As innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain technology drives the market forward, altcoins are likely to remain a focal point for growth and diversification.

CryptoPunks Outpaces Competing Collections Comparative Performance: While the NFT market saw an average floor price increase of 34.5% across major collections in November, CryptoPunks stood out with a 47% surge, significantly outperforming its peers. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC): +7% Milady Maker: +34% Pudgy Penguins: +28% This disparity underscores CryptoPunks’ resilience and continued appeal, even amid fluctuating market conditions. Why CryptoPunks Stands Out: Historical Significance: As one of the first NFT projects, CryptoPunks holds cultural and historical value in the digital art space.

Competitive Landscape As newer NFT projects and metaverse initiatives emerge, established collections like CryptoPunks must innovate to maintain their market leadership. 3. Institutional Involvement The growing participation of institutional investors could provide long-term stability and drive higher valuations for blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks. Conclusion: CryptoPunks Reaffirms Its Market Dominance The surge in CryptoPunks’ floor price to 37.3 ETH in November underscores its resilience and leadership in the NFT market. While competitors like BAYC, Milady Maker, and Pudgy Penguins also saw gains, CryptoPunks’ 47% rise sets it apart as the standout performer.

The platform’s rapid growth highlights the increasing appeal of memecoin trading and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions in the crypto market. According to an on-chain analysis shared by @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter), Pump.fun has processed an impressive 1,527,143 SOL in fees, averaging $1.54 million in daily revenue over the past eight months. Unparalleled Transaction Volume on Pump.fun With 388 million monthly transactions, Pump.fun has nearly doubled the transaction volume of competing decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Key Metrics Driving Pump.fun’s Success: Transaction Volume: The platform processes millions of transactions monthly, showcasing its scalability and user activity. Fee Revenue: Daily fee revenue of $1.54 million underscores the platform’s profitability and robust user engagement. Market Leadership: Pump.fun’s ability to outpace other DEXs highlights its strong position in the Solana ecosystem. Why Pump.fun Stands Out in the Memecoin Market 1. Leveraging Solana’s Speed and Efficiency Pump.fun capitalizes on Solana’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain infrastructure, enabling seamless transactions for memecoin enthusiasts. Low Transaction Fees: Solana’s cost-effective network makes it ideal for high-volume trading. Scalability: The platform can handle massive transaction loads without significant delays or congestion. 2. Community-Driven Approach Memecoins thrive on community engagement, and Pump.fun has successfully tapped into this dynamic. User-Friendly Interface: The platform’s intuitive design attracts both new and experienced traders. Active Community: Social media campaigns and interactive features keep users engaged. 3. Outpacing Competitors By generating nearly double the transaction volume of other DEXs, Pump.fun has positioned itself as a leader in the DeFi and memecoin sectors. Revenue Breakdown: A Snapshot of Pump.fun’s Growth Since its launch, Pump.fun has averaged: $1.54 Million Daily Revenue: A consistent performance driven by high transaction activity. 1.527 Million SOL in Total Fees: Demonstrating significant user activity and fee-based profitability. 388 Million Monthly Transactions: Highlighting its dominance in the Solana-based DEX space. The Future of Pump.fun in the Memecoin Ecosystem Pump.fun’s impressive performance raises questions about its potential long-term impact on the memecoin and DeFi landscapes. 1. Expanding User Base As memecoins continue to attract retail and institutional interest, Pump.fun’s user base is likely to grow. Attracting New Users: The platform’s robust infrastructure and community-centric approach position it as a go-to hub for memecoin trading. Scaling Solutions: Leveraging Solana’s network ensures Pump.fun can accommodate increased demand. 2. Diversifying Offerings To maintain its competitive edge, Pump.fun may explore new features, such as: Yield Farming: Offering staking and liquidity incentives to users. Multi-Chain Integration: Expanding beyond Solana to tap into other blockchain ecosystems. 3. Competition with Traditional DEXs Pump.fun’s dominance in transaction volume highlights its ability to challenge established DEXs, pushing the boundaries of what memecoin platforms can achieve. Challenges and Risks Ahead While Pump.fun’s growth is impressive, it must navigate several challenges: Market Volatility: The memecoin market is highly speculative, and shifts in sentiment could impact activity. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased interest in DeFi may attract regulatory oversight, posing potential hurdles. Sustainability: Maintaining high transaction volumes and revenue in a competitive market will require continuous innovation. Conclusion: Pump.fun’s Stellar Rise Reflects Memecoin Popularity Pump.fun’s $368 million revenue milestone underscores its rapid ascent in the crypto space. By leveraging Solana’s technology, fostering community engagement, and delivering unmatched transaction volumes, the platform has positioned itself as a leader in the memecoin and DeFi ecosystems. As the platform continues to grow, its impact on the broader cryptocurrency landscape will be closely watched. With plans to expand its offerings and user base, Pump.fun is poised to remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving crypto market.

This marks the second consecutive trading day of net inflows, showcasing sustained investor confidence in Bitcoin-focused ETFs. Among the key players, BlackRock’s IBIT emerged as the frontrunner, securing the largest share of inflows at $137.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $106.5 million, while other notable ETFs, including VanEck’s HODL, Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s mini BTC, and ARK Invest’s ARKB, contributed to the impressive tally. Breakdown of ETF Inflows on November 29 Top ETFs by Net Inflows: BlackRock’s IBIT: $137.5 million Fidelity’s FBTC: $106.5 million VanEck’s HODL: $33.1 million Bitwise’s BITB: $26.5 million Grayscale’s Mini BTC: $8.6 million ARK Invest’s ARKB: $7.8 million Meanwhile, the remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no significant net inflows or outflows, highlighting a concentration of capital among the top-performing funds. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Capital? 1. Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Institutional investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, spurring demand for regulated investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s Leadership: BlackRock’s IBIT, leading the inflow tally, reflects its strong reputation and ability to attract institutional capital. Diversification Appeal: ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and VanEck’s HODL enable investors to diversify their portfolios while gaining exposure to Bitcoin. 2. Simplicity and Accessibility Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a user-friendly alternative for those seeking Bitcoin exposure without the complexity of directly purchasing and managing the cryptocurrency. Regulated Investment Vehicle: These ETFs are backed by actual Bitcoin holdings, providing transparency and security. Ease of Use: Investors can trade ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts, avoiding the need for crypto wallets or exchanges. 3. Positive Market Sentiment The broader cryptocurrency market has been buoyed by optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s resilience and its potential to serve as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The consistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs reflect this bullish sentiment. BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the Charge BlackRock’s IBIT ETF stood out on November 29, recording a net inflow of $137.5 million. This significant contribution underscores the trust investors place in BlackRock as a global asset management leader. What Sets IBIT Apart? Market Leadership: BlackRock’s extensive resources and expertise provide confidence to institutional and retail investors alike. Robust Infrastructure: The fund’s seamless integration with traditional financial systems enhances its appeal. Impact on the Broader Bitcoin Market 1. Increased Liquidity The $320 million inflows add liquidity to the Bitcoin market, potentially reducing volatility and encouraging stable price movements. 2. Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs signals growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a mainstream investment option. This shift could attract additional institutional interest, further bolstering the market. 3. Potential Price Implications As capital flows into ETFs backed by physical Bitcoin holdings, demand for the cryptocurrency is likely to rise, potentially driving its price upward in the near term. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Optimistic Outlook Sustained Growth: The consistent inflows suggest continued investor interest, positioning spot Bitcoin ETFs as a key growth area in the cryptocurrency market. Market Expansion: As more ETFs join the space and regulatory clarity improves, the market could see further inflows. Challenges to Watch: Regulatory Scrutiny: While ETFs provide a regulated investment option, the broader cryptocurrency market remains under scrutiny, which could impact fund operations. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility may influence investor behavior, affecting future inflows. Conclusion: A Milestone for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs The $320 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on November 29 highlights growing confidence in Bitcoin-focused investment products. With BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC leading the charge, the market is witnessing robust institutional participation. As the demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure grows, spot Bitcoin ETFs are poised to play a pivotal role in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. Investors should watch closely as these products continue to shape the future of the crypto investment landscape.

This marks the second consecutive day of positive inflows for the sector, indicating growing investor interest in Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds. Breakdown of Inflows by ETF Data from Farside Investors reveals the distribution of net inflows among major ETFs: BlackRock’s IBIT: $137.5 million Fidelity’s FBTC: $106.5 million VanEck’s HODL: $33.1 million Bitwise’s BITB: $26.5 million Grayscale’s Mini BTC: $8.6 million ARK Invest’s ARKB: $7.8 million Meanwhile, other spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no significant inflows or outflows on the day, suggesting that investors are concentrating their capital in established funds. Key Drivers of Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows 1. Institutional Interest in Bitcoin The influx of $320 million into spot Bitcoin ETFs underscores growing confidence among institutional investors. BlackRock’s Leadership: As the largest contributor, BlackRock’s IBIT inflows highlight its dominance in attracting institutional capital. Market Diversification: ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC and VanEck’s HODL also benefited from the inflows, reflecting broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin exposure. 2. Increasing Demand for Regulated Products Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated avenue for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Transparency and Security: These funds provide an accessible and secure investment vehicle, appealing to risk-averse institutional and retail investors. 3. Bullish Sentiment in the Crypto Market Recent developments in the cryptocurrency space, including regulatory clarity and Bitcoin’s resilience, have fueled optimism. The sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs align with the broader bullish sentiment. The Significance of BlackRock’s IBIT Performance BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the pack with $137.5 million in net inflows, cementing its position as a market leader. The ETF’s strong performance reflects its reputation and ability to attract institutional capital. Why IBIT Stands Out: Brand Trust: As a global asset management giant, BlackRock’s entry into Bitcoin ETFs has significantly boosted confidence in the sector. Robust Infrastructure: The firm’s ETF benefits from advanced management strategies and market accessibility. What This Means for the Broader Market 1. Increased Market Liquidity The cumulative $320 million inflows provide additional liquidity to the Bitcoin market, potentially stabilizing price movements. 2. Validation of Bitcoin’s Mainstream Appeal The growing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs signifies Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche asset to a mainstream investment choice. 3. Potential Impact on Bitcoin Price As capital flows into these ETFs, demand for Bitcoin could increase, potentially driving its price upward in the short to medium term. Conclusion: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Signal Growing Market Maturity The $320 million net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on November 29 highlight the increasing institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure. With BlackRock, Fidelity, and other prominent players leading the charge, this trend signals the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable investment asset. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, spot Bitcoin ETFs are likely to play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.

37058535,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=105759,1732992696,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,XRP Targets $2 as Golden Cross Sparks Bullish Momentum,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-targets-2-as-golden-cross-sparks-bullish-momentum/,"XRP Eyes $2 Amid Bullish Golden Cross Setup XRP, one of the most prominent altcoins in the cryptocurrency market, is showing strong bullish momentum as technical indicators align for a potential breakout. The asset is currently trading at $1.89, marking a 19.64% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. With its 50-week moving average nearing a crossover with the 200-week moving average—a golden cross—investors and analysts are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s trajectory. The formation of a golden cross is a significant technical signal often associated with long-term bullish trends. If confirmed, this setup could drive XRP to test its next psychological resistance at $2 and possibly push toward its all-time high of $3.31. However, as with any market movement, there are critical resistance levels and potential risks that must be considered. Key Resistance Levels XRP Must Overcome 1. Immediate Resistance: $1.88 to $1.96 XRP is currently testing resistance at $1.88, with $1.96 acting as a crucial hurdle. These levels are significant for short-term price action, as breaking above them would signal a continuation of the bullish trend. Veteran analyst Peter Brandt has pointed out that $1.96 is a key inflection point. Should XRP decisively break through this level, it could trigger a wave of buying interest, setting the stage for a rally toward $2. 2. Psychological Resistance: $2 The $2 mark holds psychological importance for XRP traders and investors. Breaking above this level would not only boost market sentiment but could also attract fresh capital inflows from both retail and institutional players. 3. Long-Term Target: $3.31 If XRP sustains its upward momentum, it could aim for its previous all-time high of $3.31. This milestone, achieved during earlier bull cycles, represents a critical resistance zone that would require strong market support to overcome. The Significance of the Golden Cross for XRP The golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, such as the 50-week MA, crosses above a longer-term moving average, like the 200-week MA. This technical pattern is widely regarded as a bullish signal that suggests sustained upward momentum. Why the Golden Cross Matters: Historical Precedence: In traditional and cryptocurrency markets, golden crosses have often preceded significant price rallies. Market Sentiment: The pattern reinforces investor confidence, encouraging both retail and institutional participation. Long-Term Implications: Unlike short-term price fluctuations, a golden cross hints at a broader shift in market dynamics, favoring a prolonged bullish trend. According to technical analysts, XRP’s current setup closely mirrors conditions observed in previous bull runs, adding weight to the optimism surrounding its price movement. Broader Market Context Boosting XRP’s Momentum 1. Positive Sentiment Surrounding Ripple’s Legal Battle Ripple, the parent company behind XRP, has made progress in its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Positive developments in the case have bolstered investor confidence, driving demand for XRP. 2. Increased Adoption and Use Cases Ripple’s global payment solutions continue to expand, enhancing the utility of XRP in cross-border transactions. The growing adoption of Ripple’s technology by financial institutions worldwide has contributed to the increasing relevance of XRP in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 3. Market-Wide Bullish Trends XRP’s rally aligns with broader bullish trends in the cryptocurrency market, where several assets have seen significant price increases. This macro environment further supports XRP’s upward momentum. On-Chain Metrics Signal Continued Growth for XRP Analysts have identified several on-chain metrics that support XRP’s bullish outlook: New Capital Inflows: Metrics such as “mean dollar invested age” indicate an increase in fresh capital entering the market, a precursor to higher prices. Reduced Selling Pressure: The amount of XRP held on exchanges has decreased, suggesting reduced sell-side pressure and a higher likelihood of sustained rallies. Volume Trends: On-chain volume remains below historical highs, indicating potential for further growth as trading activity increases. These factors collectively paint a positive picture for XRP, signaling a continuation of its upward trajectory. Potential Risks and Challenges for XRP 1. Failure to Break Resistance Levels While XRP has demonstrated strong momentum, failing to break above the $1.96 or $2 levels could result in a pullback. Key support levels at $1.75 and $1.60 would then become critical to watch. 2. Broader Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and sudden shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic conditions could impact XRP’s price. 3. Regulatory Uncertainty Despite progress in Ripple’s legal battle, the outcome remains uncertain. Adverse rulings could dampen investor enthusiasm and affect XRP’s performance. Conclusion: Is XRP Ready to Break Out? XRP is positioned for a significant breakout as it approaches a golden cross and tests critical resistance levels. Breaking above $1.96 could pave the way for XRP to reach $2, a key psychological level, and potentially target its all-time high of $3.31. While the bullish momentum and positive on-chain metrics are encouraging, investors should remain cautious of potential risks, including resistance at key levels and broader market volatility. With its growing adoption, strong technical setup, and positive sentiment surrounding Ripple, XRP appears well-positioned to capitalize on the current market environment.

He said that the effects have led to long-term financial and psychological damages, and called on the industry to act as one and fight for new laws banning such activities from happening again. Cardano Founder Stance on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 In a recent X (previously Twitter) post, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed his concerns about the global implications of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. He said the campaign is a systematic process of harassing, fining, auditing, and denying services to cryptocurrency businesses across the globe. These comments align with pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton’s stance that the Trump administration should investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The global fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0. So many people put their head in the sand for political reasons, saying it's not as bad as the industry was making it out to be. It is worse and global. So many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed. It has… https://t.co/kKu2qGp8Ae — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 30, 2024 He said that the operation went beyond the United States, which made the banks move to debank cryptocurrency entities out of fear of losing their correspondent relationships with American banks. Charles Hoskinson also pointed to the implications that this has for companies and people within the cryptocurrency space in terms of economic and emotional pain. He called on the industry to capitalize on the situation in order to lobby for laws against future actions of this kind. “We have a small window of time to get a law passed,” he wrote, stressing the urgency of collaborative action. Industry Leaders Speak Out on Debanking Crisis The remarks by the Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson echoes the sentiments of many in the industry as they criticize Operation Chokepoint 2.0. An entrepreneur from Barbados – Gabriel Abed told his story about how First Citizens Caribbean Bank closed his account after he received a deposit from Kraken related to Bitcoin. He said that the bank closed his account because the bank had concerns over the U.S. correspondent relationships while he had been banking with them for ten years. Faryar Shirzad from Coinbase, Chief Policy Officer, provided similar examples of other players in the field, citing the research by Nic Carter. Shirzad has urged the need to enhance the public disclosure and the rule of law to the actions of such government agencies. He also stressed the importance of supervising the banks in order not to let such politically motivated campaigns happen again. Ripple CTO and Others Condemn Indirect Regulation Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz also joined the discussion to describe debanking as a form of indirect regulation. According to Schwartz, those actions violate basic legal concepts such as due process, freedom of speech, and prohibitions against unlawful searches. “It is easier to force banks to stop doing business with undesirable clients than to make this business unlawful,” he said, calling on the government to use legal and transparent means to address the matter. Many prominent tech individuals have also reported cases of debanking. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian was debanked by JPMorgan Chase in late 2022, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has made FOIA requests to discover the extent of government involvement. Armstrong called the campaign “unethical” and claimed that top-tier personalities like Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler were instrumental in the effort The post Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Breaks Silence On Operation Chokepoint 2.0 appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|Cardano founder|Charles Hoskinson|Operation Choke Point 2.0,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-11-30 18:51:44

The ETH token was trading at $3,725, its highest level since June 7, and 75% above its lowest level in August. Crypto analysts are bullish on Ethereum price The crypto community is largely divided about Ethereum as it continues to lose market share to Solana, Sui, and layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. Ethereum’s critics point to its weak inflows in the exchange-traded funds (ETF) industry. Recently, however, we have seen some movement as inflows have risen. The cumulative total inflows jumped to over $573 million, with most of these funds flowing on November 29, when they rose by $332 million. In an X post, Wolf, a popular crypto analyst with over 100k followers, predicted that Ethereum price would hit between 9k and 10k by May next year. He pointed to technicals, which included patterns like falling wedges and regressions. If his ETH forecast is accurate, it means that the coin will jump by 177% from the current level. Such gains are common in the crypto industry, as evidenced by the recent rallies by Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple (XRP) have jumped by over 200% in the past few weeks. Freedom by 40, another crypto analyst, predicte that the coin would make a parabolic move soon. He cited the fact that it was in an impulsive Elliot wave pattern, which is often a bullish sign. His view is that the coin has been in the fourth wave, and that the bullish fifth wave was starting. Freedom By 40 @Freedom_By_40 · Follow $ETH Testing a pretty big level right now but when it does break then all of a sudden Ethereum will be cool again and it’ll move quickly imo. 5:29 PM · Nov 30, 2024 119 Reply Copy link Read 9 replies ETH price analysis: golden cross points to more gains The daily chart shows that the ETH price bottomed at $2,125 in August, and has now jumped by over 70% to the current $3,675. It has moved above several key resistance levels, with the most recent one being at $3,552, its highest level on July 22nd. The coin has also jumped above the key resistance level at $2,810, its highest level on August 24 and its lowest swing on May 1. It has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since September 6. Ether has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). In most periods, this is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. It has also jumped above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $3,488. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued pointing upwards, a sign that it has momentum. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the ETH coin is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $4,093, its highest point this year, which is about 12% above the current level. The bullish view will be contigent on whether Bitcoin continues rising, and possibly pierces the important resistance at $100,000. If this happens, Ethereum could jump to over $5,000 in December. Ethereum has strong fundamentals Despite all its woes, Ethereum still has some of the best fundamentals in the crypto industry. Its DeFi total value locked (TVL) rose by 40% in the past 30 days to over $71 billion. This amount means that it is bigger than the other ten networks, combined. The biggest players in Ethereum’s DeFi network are the likes of Lido, AAVE, EigenLayer, Maker, Uniswap, Spark, and Ethena. Ethereum is still a big player in the DEX industry, where its DEX protocols have handled volume worth over $3.12 trillion over time. The biggest of these protocols are Uniswap, Curve Finance, Pendle, Balancer, and PancakeSwap. Ethereum is still the cash king in the crypto industry as it has made over $2.5 billion in fees this year. The other top networks are Tether, Tron, Lido Finance, and Bitcoin.

AAVE: The One That Got Away AAVE’s journey has been nothing short of spectacular. As a leading decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, AAVE allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. It’s like a financial revolution in your pocket, and its growth reflects just how much people are buying into that vision. In the past month alone, AAVE’s price surged by over 24%, leaving investors speculating whether it could hit $200 soon. Analysts are optimistic, citing increasing adoption and new developments in the protocol. AAVE continues to expand its offerings, from allowing users to earn on stablecoins to introducing features that reduce borrowing costs. But here’s the catch: if you weren’t on the AAVE bandwagon early, jumping in now might not offer the same jaw-dropping returns. For many, AAVE feels like a missed lottery ticket—a reminder that timing is everything in crypto. So, what’s the next best crypto to buy in November 2024 ? That’s where Qubetics comes into play, offering what AAVE might not anymore: untapped potential. Qubetics: Revolutionising Blockchain Connectivity If you’re looking for more than just the buzz, Qubetics is a name you’ll want to remember. It’s not about riding the hype—it’s about solving real problems. Tackling Real-Life Issues Unlike most blockchain projects that operate in silos, Qubetics acts as a Web3 aggregator. Think of it as the Swiss Army knife of blockchain: it bridges networks, enabling smooth asset transfers and seamless collaboration. Whether you’re a developer tired of jumping through hoops or a business seeking reliable cross-chain solutions, Qubetics has you covered. Take its Decentralised VPN (dVPN), for example. In a world where centralised VPNs often fail to protect user privacy, Qubetics flips the script. It decentralises data routing, ensuring that users’ information isn’t stored on a single server vulnerable to attacks. Imagine running your online business without worrying about hackers or data leaks—that’s the power of Qubetics. And for individuals? Say goodbye to geo-restrictions and targeted ads based on your browsing history. With Qubetics’ dVPN, you control your online footprint. The Numbers Don’t Lie Here’s the part that should make you sit up: Qubetics is still in its presale stage, currently selling $TICS tokens for just $0.025 each. Over 239 million tokens have been sold to more than 5000 holders, raising $3.8 million. But here’s the kicker—analysts predict $TICS could hit $15 after its mainnet launch. That’s a staggering 58,213% ROI for early investors. Think about it: an investment of $5,000 at today’s price could fetch you 200,000 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches $1, your $5,000 grows to $200,000. And if it hits $15? You’re looking at a cool $3 million. Why Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Buy Now What sets Qubetics apart isn’t just its potential for astronomical returns; it’s the utility. From asset tokenisation to decentralised internet access, Qubetics is building tools that people will actually use. Take asset tokenisation, for example. Imagine you’re a small business owner wanting to raise capital. Instead of relying on banks, you can tokenize your assets and sell fractional ownership to investors worldwide. Artists can tokenize their works, enabling fans to own a piece of their creations. Even real estate moguls can unlock liquidity by tokenizing properties. Qubetics turns abstract blockchain concepts into real-world solutions. It’s not just another crypto; it’s a gateway to new possibilities. Don’t Miss Out If AAVE taught us anything, it’s that being late to the party can sting. But the good news? Opportunities like Qubetics don’t come around often. With the presale in full swing and prices set to increase by 10% in just a few days, now’s the time to act. So, what’s holding you back? Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy now . Secure your $TICS tokens today and be part of the next big thing in crypto. Don’t let this one slip through your fingers—you might not get another shot like this.

Seven US-based bitcoin mining companies, who spoke anonymously, claimed that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had directed the CBP to hold certain deliveries of Bitmain ASIC miners. Interestingly, other Chinese producers of ASIC mining equipment, like MicroBT and Canaan, have not been subjected to the same treatment. Miners Face Months-Long Delay According to Blockspace’s latest report , some shipments have been delayed for up to two months. The hold-ups occurred at ports across the country, including those in San Francisco and Detroit. The affected imports include Bitmain’s latest Antminer S21 and T21 models. Although the CBP has acknowledged the detention of these goods, it has not provided clarity on the reasons for the hold or a timeline for releasing the shipments. A source dealing with extended delays, now spanning “months,” said that CBP detentions exceeding 30 days without any formal requests to the Importer of Record (IOR) are highly uncommon and fall well below expected standards. They also mentioned observing Advanced Targeting Unit (ATU) personnel at certain ports and noted that businesses are increasingly advising peers to avoid specific entry points, particularly those along the West Coast. Another individual revealed that the CBP is withholding roughly 200 units. Despite repeated appeals for clarity, both the CBP and FCC have declined to respond while continuing to levy daily holding fees that have surpassed $200,000. To address the matter, the affected company has engaged a legal team to seek answers from the FCC. Sophgo’s Huawei Link Putting Antminers in the Crosshairs? While the exact cause remains unknown, one possible explanation is the presence of Sophgo chips in Antminer control boards. Sophgo has come under scrutiny for allegedly breaching US sanctions by supplying chips to Huawei, a company subject to trade restrictions since 2019. Sophgo and Bitmain share the same CEO, Micree Zhan. After a Sophgo chip was reportedly found in a Huawei device, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ended its business relationship with the company. Although no definitive link has been established between the import halts and this controversy, sources verified that Bitmain uses the Sophgo CV1835 chip in the Antminer T21 and certain S19 models, including the S19 XP, S19 Pro, and S19j Pro.

Since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, XRP has soared over 270%, marking the highest gain among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. XRP Beat Binance Coin (BNB), Eyes on SOL Amid this rally, XRP surpassed top cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Investor optimism grows as SEC Chair Gary Gensler prepares to depart. ETH ETFs saw $90 million in inflows on Friday, fueling bullish sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) is now trading above $3,700, a five-month high, as its price has climbed by 40% over the past four weeks. This strong performance has analysts predicting ETH will soon break $4,000.

While Bitcoin has struggled to achieve its dream of a $100,000 valuation, tokens like Toncoin (TON), Stellar (XLM), and XRP have continued to soar with double-digit returns. Specifically, TON seems to be finally coming to life after a somewhat sluggish start to the month of November. However, the question that would probably be lingering on several investors’ minds is — how long can the Toncoin price sustain this bullish momentum? Is TON Price Going To Continue Upward Trend? In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost shared an exciting analysis for the price of Toncoin over the next few weeks. According to the pundit, on-chain signals are currently bullish for the altcoin’s price. The relevant metric here is the “90-day percent return,” which measures the percentage change in the price of an asset over the last 90 days. It typically tracks the performance of the cryptocurrency within that period while providing insight into its short-term trend and momentum. According to data from CryptoQuant , the TON 90-day percent return recently turned positive following the upward movement of the Toncoin price. From a historical standpoint, when this metric flips to positive, the price action that follows is usually with significant momentum. Ultimately, this shift in the 90-day percent return suggests that investors’ confidence is increasing and are more willing to hold their assets. This is usually in anticipation of higher prices , as investors are expecting the bullish trend to continue. According to the Quicktake analyst, another on-chain signal that supports the bullish prognosis is the percentage change in open interest. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the on-chain metric has also flipped to positive, suggesting a continuation of the current bullish trend. Toncoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Toncoin stands at around $6.526, reflecting no significant change in the past day. The altcoin is still up by almost 18% on the weekly timeframe, according to CoinGecko data. This recent bullish run pushed the price of TON back above $6.5 for the first time since late August. Following the token’s fall to around $4.5 in September, the price has been moving mostly sideways before climbing the latest high this month.",Toncoin (TON)|cryptoquant|TON|Toncoin|Toncoin price|TONUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TON,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 19:30:48

According to an announcement , the exchange has launched a crypto trading platform and a self-custodial wallet for users in Belgium. This new service allows Belgian residents to access various crypto services, helping OKX strengthen its presence in the European digital asset market. OKX Expansion to Belgium Brings Lots of Benefits This platform also allows Belgian customers to trade and convert over 200 cryptocurrencies, including 60 trading pairs with the euro. This wide range of options will appeal to experienced traders and those new to cryptocurrency. However, the launch is yet to get direct approval from Belgian authorities. Instead, OKX operates in Belgium with a non-rejection status, using its Malta-registered entity, Okcoin Europe, licensed by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Meanwhile, OKX has added Bancontact, a popular payment system in Belgium, to make euro transactions easier. Customers can also use SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) for more options to deposit and withdraw money, ensuring smooth and efficient transactions. The onboarding process for Belgium users is now easier through the Itsme app, a trusted digital ID tool. Furthermore, the new self-custodial wallet gives Belgian users better control over their digital assets while prioritizing security and transparency. This change meets the increasing demand for decentralized financial solutions in Europe. OKX Expansion and Global Outreach Recall that, the Web3 technology company launched its centralized crypto exchange and OKX wallet in the Netherlands in June. Likewise, in February, OKX launched crypto exchange services and its Web3 wallet in Argentina , marking a strategic move to capitalize on the region’s increasing interest in crypto and blockchain technology. Similarly, in January, OKX obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in Dubai , signaling its commitment to serving the Middle Eastern market and a clear expansion strategy across different clients. Robinhood Expands Crypto Capabilities in Europe Retail investing platform Robinhood has expanded its crypto offerings in Europe . European users can now transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of the platform. The platform also affirmed that EU customers can deposit and withdraw over 20 digital currencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and USD Coin. The functionality allows users to “self-custody” their assets, meaning they can manage their wallets instead of relying on third-party custodians. Robinhood’s expansion comes on the heels of the EU’s efforts to standardize cryptocurrency regulations across its member states. Robinhood offered a limited-time promotion for European customers, as part of the rollout. Users will receive 1% of the value of any crypto they deposit on the platform.

Fowler says the records in question contain full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, family members, social media accounts, criminal record histories, death and birth certificates, court records, vehicle records, property ownership reports and background checks. The database was located in an 713 gigabyte unencrypted Amazon S3 bucket. Fowler says he can’t determine how long the database was exposed or if anyone else has gained access to it. “Only an internal forensic audit could identify additional access or potentially suspicious activity. I did not receive a response from SL Data Services/Propertyrec after my disclosure notice or at any time before publication. It is not known if the database was owned and managed by SL Data Services/Propertyrec or a third-party contractor.” The incident follows a separate breach from a background check service company.

According to a new post on the social media platform X by BitMEX Research sharing the decision against Dr. Wright, the judge in the case has decided that there is no way that Wright created BTC. “Among the key reasons for his decision were that [the judge’s] conclusions that (i) Dr. Wright had lied repeatedly and extensively to the court in his evidence and (ii) Dr. Wright had forged a large number of documents which he relied upon in support of his claim.

First, that Dr. Wright is NOT the author of the Bitcoin White Paper. Second, Dr. Wright is NOT the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011.

BTFD Coin is poised to take the meme coin world by storm, flaunting unique features designed to engage users and foster a strong community. With its presale, kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, many are starting to wonder if this could be the best meme coin presale to join today. Analysts are buzzing about the potential for BTFD Coin to replicate or even exceed the hype that Shiba Inu generated. Let’s dive into what makes BTFD Coin a compelling opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. BTFD Coin: The New Player in the Meme Coin Game BTFD Coin is not just another entry in the crowded meme coin market; it’s crafted with purpose and a vision for the future. One of its standout features is the Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which invites users to engage with the platform while earning rewards in BTFD tokens. Imagine diving into a fun gaming experience where your skills not only entertain you but also pad your wallet! This gamified approach is designed to keep users engaged and foster a sense of community among holders. In addition to its P2E game , BTFD Coin offers attractive staking rewards. By participating in staking, holders can earn a solid annual percentage yield (APY) just for keeping their tokens. This feature is especially appealing for those looking to grow their investment passively while remaining part of a vibrant community. The combination of earning through gaming and staking creates a unique value proposition that could attract both seasoned investors and new crypto enthusiasts alike. Moreover, the BTFD community, known as the “Bulls Squad,” is a key aspect of the coin’s strategy. This initiative encourages participation and rewards engagement, creating a strong sense of belonging among its members. The more active you are, the more you stand to gain—not just in terms of tokens but in recognition and community standing. This focus on community is crucial, as a dedicated user base can propel a project to new heights. As for price predictions, analysts are optimistic about BTFD Coin’s potential. With a initial presale price of $0.000004 and a projected listing price of $0.0006, early investors could see significant returns. For instance, if you had invested $7,500 during the first stage of the presale, your investment could grow to about $112,500 when the price reaches $0.0006. That’s a staggering potential return that could get anyone excited about this project! Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin stands out as one of the best meme coin presales to join today due to its innovative features, community-driven approach, and potential for impressive returns. With a low entry price and engaging developments, it’s a prime opportunity for anyone looking to dive into the meme coin market. Shiba Inu: The Hype Machine Now, let’s take a moment to appreciate Shiba Inu, the meme coin that captured the hearts (and wallets) of many. Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu was created as an experiment in decentralized community building. Dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” it quickly garnered attention and built a massive following. The Shiba Inu community, affectionately known as the “Shib Army,” rallied together, driving the coin’s popularity and value to astronomical heights. One of the remarkable features of Shiba Inu is its commitment to charity and social good. The community has raised significant funds for various causes, including the COVID-19 relief efforts in India. This sense of purpose has helped solidify its standing in the crypto world, showing that meme coins can do more than just provide entertainment—they can also make a positive impact. Shiba Inu’s rise was also fueled by social media hype and endorsements from influential figures. Much like Dogecoin, it became a staple in memes and discussions across platforms like Twitter and Reddit. This viral marketing strategy created a perfect storm for its price to skyrocket, leading many to wonder if they had missed the boat. However, with great hype comes great volatility. While many early investors celebrated massive gains, others faced significant losses due to dramatic price fluctuations. The unpredictability of meme coins can be both thrilling and nerve-wracking. As the market evolves, Shiba Inu continues to maintain a loyal user base, but it faces increasing competition from new entrants like BTFD Coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? Shiba Inu has solidified its position as a legendary meme coin, thanks to its strong community and cultural significance. While it has provided significant returns for early investors, the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency means that new opportunities, like BTFD Coin, are emerging. Don’t Miss Your Chance! If you’re looking to dive into the exciting world of meme coins, BTFD Coin offers a fresh opportunity that you won’t want to miss. With its innovative features, engaging community, and attractive presale price, BTFD Coin could very well be the next phenomenon in the meme coin space. As the presale continues, the excitement is palpable, and analysts are optimistic about potential returns. If you’re searching for the best meme coin presale to join today, consider signing up for the BTFD Coin presale before it swings past you. Your chance to be part of the next big wave in the crypto world is here—don’t let it slip away!

Investors are flocking to acquire PCHAIN at the lowest price before the price increases drastically in the next stage. Let’s examine the project in detail and understand the reasons behind the increasing demand for the PCHAIN token presale. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Project’s Vision Real estate has been one of the most sought-after investment instruments for decades, and the industry has undergone significant changes. Despite this gradual evolution, real estate investors often face opaque pricing, fraud risks, low liquidity, and heavy reliance on intermediaries. PropiChain aims to address these issues and transform the sector using blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse. It has integrated these modern tools and technologies into its investment platform to create a more efficient future for real estate. Using blockchain, PropiChain has improved security and transparency for property investments. It has converted all properties into tokens, allowing users to trade real estate on the blockchain. The tokens represent fractions of the property, providing users with the benefits of fractional ownership, such as improved liquidity and more diversification opportunities. PropiChain users also have increased accessibility as multiple investors can combine their capital to acquire any property, regardless of value. Many investors have been impressed by the advanced platform and its features and are participating in the token presale to become a part of the future of real estate. Let’s examine these features and understand how they boost investors’ confidence in the token presale success. Revolutionizing Real Estate With AI and The Metaverse PropiChain offers an array of AI features to improve user experience. Users have 24/7 access to AI chatbots and virtual assistants, which solve any queries and guide investors throughout the investment process, assisting with complex and tedious paperwork. The PropiChain AI provides further investment help by providing accurate property valuations using the Advanced Valuation Models. These AI-powered algorithms analyze historical sales data and monitor current market conditions to generate valuations that match the actual property price in the real estate market. Investors can use these valuations to filter the real estate they want to invest in and virtually assess these properties. The Metaverse generates immersive 3D rendering of the properties, allowing users to experience them without traveling long distances. Thus, using the Metaverse PropiChain has broken the geographical entry barrier to real estate investment and amplified its users’ reach, allowing them to feel and invest in any real estate globally from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, PropiChain offers automated transactions to simplify the investment process further. Once the user has finalized a property after assessment through the Metaverse, they can just provide the AI with the exact valuation for which they want to purchase the property. When the property hits the specified valuation, the AI automatically executes the order and stores the details on the platform’s decentralized ledger to maintain investment security and transparency. After users purchase a property, PropiChain also provides the feature of automatic lease creation with the platform’s smart contracts. Users do not require manual paperwork and expensive lawyers, as smart contracts automatically trigger the lease upon signatures and completion of the fund transfers. The smart contracts also simplify rental payments. Tenants can set the rent amount, and the smart contracts automatically transfer the rent to the landlord. Landlords may also set a fixed late rent penalty, which will be added to the next cycle. The native token, PCHAIN , brings the entire platform to life. It is currently in stage one of the token presale. Let’s analyze the potential token presale returns and how to maximize them. Capture Enormous Returns With The PCHAIN Token Presale PCHAIN is valued at $0.004 in the first stage of the token presale. The tokens are selling out quickly as investors rush to acquire PCHAIN at the lowest price before it surges. PCHAIN will gain 175% within a few days as the price will hike to $0.011 by the next presale stage. Thus, the token presale can turn a $1,000 investment into $2,750 by the second stage and $8,000 when PCHAIN is launched at $0.032. Moreover, analysts foreshadow that PCHAIN will undergo a massive rally during the next bull run after the token presale and suggest that investors can capture up to 10,000x returns by investing in the first stage. Conclusion PropiChain is transforming real estate by using blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to solve prevalent issues. AI simplifies the investment process, smart contracts simplify property leasing, and the Metaverse amplifies users’ investment range. Collectively, these platform features create an efficient and secure investment environment. For safety, the leading blockchain security firm, BlockAudit , has conducted rigorous platform testing and reported zero security vulnerabilities and complete regulatory compliance for PropiChain. Moreover, PCHAIN has already been listed on CoinMarketCap in the token presale phase. This early CMC listing has boosted the presale and the project’s growth. Thus, token holders can expect PCHAIN’s value to grow faster and the project to complete more crucial milestones soon. PCHAIN is currently available at the lowest price of $0.004 and offers a steady 800% gain by the end of the token presale. Additionally, experts predict PCHAIN will grow tremendously after the presale and say early investors can generate up to 10,000x returns.

The move stormed the community, with several analysts flagging reduced sentiments. This month, Ethereum and other crypto assets recorded huge gains, leading to bulls changing positions. While profit-taking soared, some traders bought the last dip, setting new highs. On-chain crypto firms flagged Wilcke’s transfers as a sale following a history of similar transactions. Despite the sale, Wilcke holds 106,006 ETH worth $384 million. Crypto assets tend to lose steam when bulls sell assets because of the influence of their holdings. Whale transfers usually shape small trader’s sentiments. Similarly, asset flows to centralized exchanges indicate possible sales, while transfers to other custodians signify long-term holdings. Series of Massive Transfers The wider community notes Wilcke’s transfer for several reasons. In May, he deposited 10,000 ETH worth $37.3 million before the market crash. He previously received 463,203 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation, which is currently worth $1.6 billion. From that stash, he transferred 356,805 ETH to exchanges. Before the 2021 bull run, Wilcke moved 290,505 ETH to exchanges but didn’t repeat the same in the 2022 bear season. In 2023, he began moving assets to exchanges as the crypto markets gained momentum. “ Jeffrey Wilcke, the Co-founder of #Ethereum, deposited 10K $ETH($37.36M) to #Kraken again 2 hours ago and currently holds 125,738 $ETH($472M). Jeffrey Wilcke has deposited a total of 46.3K $ETH($116.4M) to #Kraken at an average price of $2,515 over the past year.” What’s Next For ETH Price? As stated earlier, crypto prices are influenced by whale movements to exchanges. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,691, surging 2.9% in the last 24 hours. This plunging sentiment has taken out a chunk of weekly price gains after slightly recovering this week. Most analysts expect a rebound from this drop, setting higher price targets and citing macro factors. Institutional investors are still positive on Ethereum making a breakout and leading the altcoin season. These sentiments are shared across the board following massive gains seen after the U.S. elections. Clear-cut regulations in the United States will spur positive sentiments globally, leading to more inflows.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-11-30 20:03:06

During a recent conversation, Deaton stated that SBF, who is the head of an offshore exchange that was involved in a controversy, got access to the US regulators as well as the politicians in an unusual manner. Deaton also noted that Sam Bankman-Fried got preferential treatment because he donated money to the Biden administration and had close contacts with the officials. John Deaton Comes For Sam Bankman-Fried In a recent post on X , John Deaton reiterated his stance that Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) enjoyed unprecedented access to U.S. regulators despite heading an offshore crypto exchange. Deaton points out that SBF’s political donations played a role in securing this preferential treatment. Bankman-Fried’s total political donations amounted to $72 million, with $10 million going to the current administration. This has fueled speculation of potential regulatory favoritism. Deaton highlights a series of meetings that SBF had with key figures, including SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. According to Deaton, while Gensler met with Bankman-Fried on at least two occasions, the SEC chair refused to meet with U.S.-based crypto executives, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The XRP lawyer suggests that this discrepancy raises questions about why the SEC was willing to engage only with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). He argues that this selective engagement warrants further scrutiny. Moreover, Deaton urged the Trump administration to investigate these allegations stating, “One way to end all the speculation and rumors related to SBF is to release all correspondence and meeting notes related to him.” Tagging Donald Trump, Musk, and Vivek Ramaswamy, the XRP lawyer added, “Please assign me to lead the investigation into this and/or Chokepoint 2.0. I’ll do it for free and save the taxpayers money.” Sam Bankman-Fried’s Family Ties to Politics Under Scrutiny Also, John Deaton questioned why no criminal charges have been filed against SBF’s parents. Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, the two individuals who have been exposed as having received stolen FTX funds, have not been punished. He stressed that the couple bought tens of millions of dollars of property in the Bahamas, funded by clients’ assets. John Deaton pointed out that SBF’s parents were politically connected, Joe Bankman was involved in the formulation of Elizabeth Warren’s tax policy. In addition, Barbara Fried supported a progressive PAC, which only strengthened their political connections. Amid growing concerns, John Deaton has called for an investigation into what he refers to as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This alleged initiative, according to Deaton, targets crypto companies and aims to debank entities associated with the industry. Deaton claims that Kraken’s Jesse Powell and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, among others, have faced similar issues with U.S. financial institutions. Consequently, the lawyer has called for a probe into Operation Chokepoint 2.0 , urging government figures, including President-elect Donald Trump, to investigate. He suggests that an independent counsel be appointed to probe the issue. More so, Deaton mentioned Nic Carter as a potential candidate to lead the investigation. Deaton also criticized figures such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been accused of supporting the debanking efforts.
