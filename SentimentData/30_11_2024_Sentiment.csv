The regulator issued a warning to GEDI, a publisher in the country against sharing its data archives with OpenAI, citing a potential breach of the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This follows a partnership between GEDI and OpenAI, which would allow OpenAI to train its ChatGPT models on Italian language content. GEDI is a media company owned by the Agnelli family. It publishes daily newspapers, La Repubblica and La Stampa, and it announced a partnership with OpenAI in September. The partnership involves delivering Italian language content from the publisher’s news portfolio to help train and improve OpenAI’s products. GPDP frowns on GEDI’s partnership with OpenAI John Elkann, Chairman of GEDI, said, “The partnership signed with OpenAI is part of GEDI’s digital transformation journey and recognizes its leadership in producing high-quality content within the Italian media landscape.” However, the GPDP warns that this partnership could potentially lead to a breach of the EU’s GDPR. The GDPR sets a global standard for privacy laws, emphasizing user consent, transparency, and accountability. It was also the first to propose an AI regulatory framework , which it claims will promote safe and responsible use of AI. “If GEDI, on the basis of the agreement signed with OpenAI, were to disclose the personal data contained in its archive, it could violate EU regulation, with all the consequences, including those of a sanctioning nature,” the GPDP stated. GDPR violations can cost offending companies up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover. Contrasting global perspectives on AI usage This latest episode with GEDI further escalates the tensions between technological advancement and compliance with privacy regulations in the EU. Clearview AI , an American company, was fined about €30 million by the Dutch Data Protection Authority, citing privacy breach and violation of user rights under the GDPR. Earlier this year, the GPDP temporarily banned ChatGPT over concerns about unlawful collection and processing of user data. The U.S. has taken a relaxed and market-driven approach to AI, favoring innovation and emphasizing self-regulation within the space. The “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence”, which was issued in October 2023 alludes to this. The lack of clear legislation, especially on a federal level, has led to states leading the way in regulating the industry. California’s Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) is an example of state-level AI legislation. China has also put a regulatory framework in place. In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued regulations on the use of generative AI. It also plans to formulate over 50 standards for AI by 2026 . These regulations would apply to both local and international providers of AI services.

According to the report , the exchanges include Bybit Fintech Limited, MEXC Global , Bitget Limited, KuCoin, and Bitcastle LLC Unregistered Operations and Customer Risks Notably, all five crypto exchanges have been accused of operating in Japan without appropriate registration. None of the five entities has the authorization of the FSA or any other local financial bureaus. This implies that the crypto exchanges are providing unauthorized services to their users based in Japan. A broader implication of the violation by the five cryptocurrency exchanges is that the Financial Services Agency cannot supervise their activities. Hence, customers and their assets lack protection should there be trouble or any unforeseen issue requiring regulatory intervention. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, customers of the five exchanges are not covered by asset protection or compensation as stated in Japanese law. Customers have no coverage and are very exposed to all forms of financial risks. Japan’s FSA Efforts Toward Crypto Regulation The FSA’s warning comes as a warning to users of this platform to know the risks facing their financial assets. Over the years, Japan has adopted a strict regulatory approach to maintain the integrity of its market and protect customers from heavy financial losses. Meanwhile, as per a report, Japan recently reorganized its Web3 leadership to ensure regulatory clarity. This move aims to provide support for innovation in digital assets. Additionally, it will help to grow users’ confidence and trust levels in cryptocurrency. Is Japan’s FSA Pushing for a Crypto-Friendly Landscape? Perhaps Japan’s regulatory body, the FSA’s proposal to adjust the country’s crypto tax rates, is geared towards encouraging compliance. The proposal made in August 2024 is for the 2025 financial year. Currently, Japan imposes a hefty tax on profits, which could range from 15% to 55%, depending on the taxpayer’s income bracket. The FSA’s proposal resulted from widespread calls from stakeholders in Japan’s crypto sector for a more friendly tax environment. The FSA’s response in pushing for reform remains subject to legislative approval by the country’s national legislature.

XRP Bulls Rally Toward $2 Mark,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/explosive-breakout-ahead-xrp-bulls-rally-toward-2-mark/,"Recently, XRP has been on a robust positive run; some predict that the altcoin will hit $2 in the following weeks. This hope coincides with increasing whale activity, as technical signs suggest that the price might cross significant barrier levels. Starting in early November, XRP’s explosion has inspired experts and investors. Whales Fuel Price Movement Whale purchase activity is one of the main causes of XRP’s recent rise . Widely seen as a positive sign, large altcoin holders have been accumulating millions of XRP tokens. $XRP to $2 isn’t even a question. $8-20 is inevitable 1. Bullish patterns = long-term setup2. Whales accumulating hard3. MACD cooling off + RSI neutral4. $1.60, then no resistance to $25.

Notable transactions, like a 150 million XRP trade valued at $227 million, have drawn attention from market watchers. Technical Indicators Point To Continued Growth Technical study also indicates XRP’s bright future. Expert in cryptocurrencies, CrediBull, informs us that XRP is currently experiencing a “five-wave impulse climb,” typical of long-term increasing trajectory. He predicts that if the price remains over $1.05, XRP may break out above $2 in the next weeks. On the other hand, if the price falls below this critical support level, it may indicate a correction before the next upward impulse. Another expert, Egrag Crypto, is keeping a careful eye on XRP’s market rise, which is approaching crucial levels. The analyst focuses on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, which is now at 2.57%. #XRP Dominance – FIB 0.5: IT’S TIME! Trend lines often get invalidated, but they provide a visual guide for market structure. Add Fibonacci extensions into the mix, and you have a leading indicator to anticipate what’s next. Key Levels to Watch:On the monthly timeframe,… pic.twitter.com/ZqMyiAoomS — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 28, 2024 If XRP closes above this level by the end of the month, it might lead to more gains. Analysts are also looking at the 0.702 Fibonacci level as the next goal for domination, which might lead to further price gains. XRP Path To $2 Promising XRP’s price has already grown by 16% in the last week , and it is now trading around $1.47, with a daily rise of 5%. The coin has demonstrated steady upward momentum, breaking through critical resistance zones and finding support at $1.30. If XRP maintains these levels, there is speculation that it could approach $2. Possible gains in the coming weeks are being paved by whale activity, strong technical patterns, and increasing market domination. The success of XRP hinges on its ability to retain strong support levels and continue its upward trajectory as it gains momentum. If the upward trend continues, XRP has the potential to hit new highs in the near future.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-29 22:12:00

On its previous day of trades, Nov. 28, Bitwise’s $BITB led at $48.05 million with Fidelity’s $FDT at $40.24 million as no other ETF inflows or outflows were recorded. Bitwise sees strong appetite for digital assets BITB, CEO Hunter Horsley revealed in a post on X platform adding the bull run was suggestive of strong demand for digital assets by investors. “$26,000,000 of inflows into $BITB today and $82M of volume in just 3.5 hours with short market day,” wrote Horsley. “People want more Bitcoin. Things are just getting started. Happy Thanksgiving!” Horsley. This comes as Bitwise filed to start a 10-Crypto index exchange-traded fund (ETF) meant to provide exposure to the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Uniswap and Polkadot. Once approved, the 10-Crypto Index ETF is expected to expand the two-way access between mainstream and the digital asset market, which will immensely interest both institutional and retail investors. Coinbase Custody will store the assets while the Bank of New York Mellon will act as the fund’s cash custodian and administrator. Bitwise reangles its European operations targeting institutional investors Bitwise has a history of supporting new and advanced crypto investment products, as last year the company submitted requests for ETFs based on Solana and XRP. The company has also spread its operations to Europe. Meanwhile, the asset management firm has announced the rebranding of its European XRP ETF to Bitwise Physical XRP ETP. The European operation, which was known as ETF Group Physical XRP will trade in Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA under the ticker GXRP. In a Wednesday blog, Bitwise indicated the move was part of a strategic overhaul of the company’s European product lineup. This was also meant to enhance its appeal to institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to XRP. The operation launched in 2022 under the ETC group and remains backed by physical XRP. Horsley spoke of a strong track record and evolving capabilities of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) a blockchain with more than a decade of proven reliability. “We’re thrilled to provide investors with access to this innovative asset through an institutional-quality product,” Horsley noted, signaling the product’s potential to attract significant institutional interest.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $9.97 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF’s price may surge to $16.21. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $3.29 Market cap $3,281,696,199.18 Trading volume $603,437,301.43 Circulating supply 998,844,854.96 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $3.33 24-hour low $3.05 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $10.52 (227.25%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 19.16% 50-day SMA $2.75 14-Day RSI 53.18 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $2.42 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF struggles to break past $3.389 TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis shows consolidation. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at $3.389. WIF’s support level is present at $3.056. The Dogwifhat price analysis for November 29 shows price consolidation, after a failed attempt to break past $3.389. Having seen massive gains over the past month (over 28%), and a rebound afterward, the bulls have been unable to push WIF to its previous highs. What next for Dogwifhat ($WIF)? Continued consolidation or a bullish breakout? Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF sees 8% daily gain, but continues to consolidate The WIF/USD 1-day price chart analysis shows that the token has seen about 8.1% gains today, but has struggled to break past $3.389 over the past 4 price candles. WIF’s immediate support is present at $3.056. A breakdown below this level could see WIF drop to $2.907. WIF sees 8% daily gain but continues to consolidate In the event of a bullish breakout, $WIF could recapture $3.5 or even higher. The RSI indicator shows 55.61, suggesting the market is neutral with no clear overbought or oversold signals, aligning with the token’s recent consolidation and current market conditions. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF is in an uptrend in the short-term The WIF/USD 4-hour price analysis reflects an uptrend in the short term, with the coin trading close to the upper Bollinger Band at $3.307. Immediate support is present at $3.117. A bearish reversal could see WIF settle below $3. If the current momentum persists, traders can anticipate a breakout towards $3.5. WIF is in an uptrend in the short-term Likewise, the MACD indicator suggests bullish momentum, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power shows that sellers are gaining a significant advantage, indicating the possibility of a trend reversal.

The 4-hour and 1-day charts point to a short-term bullish trend for WIF. However, a price correction could be on the horizon with RSI nearing overbought levels. Monitoring trading volume and key support/resistance levels will help gauge if the rally can hold. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $10 and $13. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, Orca, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? The recent decline in Dogwifhat’s price is due to a market correction after a bullish surge, high open interest levels, bearish technical signals, large whale sell-offs, shifts in market sentiment, long position liquidations, and breaches of key support levels. Will WIF reach $10? Having already reached about $5 on March 31, 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Predictions by analysts suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2028. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $5 by 2025 and $15 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The 24X National Exchange, a Stamford, Connecticut-based trading platform, is set to launch with an almost uninterrupted schedule. Designed to serve both retail and institutional investors, this exchange plans to operate on business days from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. But that’s not the big deal. Pending final approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 24X might extend operations to 8:00 p.m. ET on Sundays through 7:00 p.m. ET on Fridays—essentially open for 23 hours a day with just a one-hour pause. This is the closest the U.S. has ever come to a stock exchange that barely sleeps. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, which stick to standard hours and shut down on holidays, 24X is rewriting the rules. The company is leaning into the global nature of trading, wanting to accommodate markets in Asia-Pacific (APAC), where U.S. equities are hot commodities, even when Wall Street is fast asleep. Why now? – The crypto connection Let’s not pretend this is a coincidence. Cryptocurrencies, which have been trading nonstop since Bitcoin’s debut, have been schooling traditional markets on what 24/7 access looks like. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase thrive on constant availability, and traders have gotten used to the idea of instant action, regardless of the time or day. Stocks, on the other hand, have stayed in their lane, sticking to opening bells and closing times. Sure, brokerage firms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have extended trading hours for some securities, but those windows still don’t come close to crypto’s round-the-clock hustle. The 24X National Exchange seems to be taking a page from the crypto playbook, recognizing the demand for seamless trading across time zones and asset classes. Dmitri Galinov, the brains behind the exchange, knows what’s at stake. “Traders are most at risk when the market is closed in their geographic location,” Galinov said in a statement . His solution? Bring U.S. equities trading to a global audience and make it as accessible as crypto. The 24X National Exchange is powered by technology from MEMX Technologies, a company known for its high-performance systems. The exchange claims it plans to use its advanced infrastructure to adapt quickly to customer feedback, so it can build trust with traders tired of rigid systems. Yet, for all its ambition, 24X isn’t abandoning tradition entirely. The exchange will stick to U.S. market holidays, closing in sync with NYSE and Nasdaq. A bigger picture Traders who have flocked to crypto markets for their constant availability might now have a compelling reason to split their attention. A stock market that’s almost always open could siphon off some of the volume that’s been a hallmark of crypto trading. And let’s talk liquidity. Extended trading hours mean more opportunities to buy and sell, potentially stabilizing prices in both the stock and crypto markets. But with liquidity comes volatility. Markets that never really close are like roller coasters without brakes. Every global event, every piece of breaking news, could trigger reactions that ripple across time zones. This isn’t just about traders though. Regulators will need to step up their game too. A near-24-hour stock exchange is uncharted territory, and it could push the SEC to rethink how markets are overseen. Don’t be surprised if this leads to clearer coexistence between crypto and equities. The overlap between the two worlds is becoming harder to ignore. Winners, losers, and the retail dilemma But the truth is, not everyone will be cheering for 24X. Retail investors, for one, might find the idea of nearly nonstop trading overwhelming. Let’s face it, not everyone has the stomach for markets that are always open, which is understandable. While institutional players will likely thrive in this environment, retail traders could struggle to keep up, widening the gap between Wall Street pros and Main Street novices. There’s also the risk of market manipulation. Longer trading hours mean more chances for bad actors to exploit loopholes. But for those who can adapt, the opportunities are huge. Arbitrage traders, for instance, could find gold in the overlapping hours between stocks and crypto. Global participation might also see a boost, with investors from different time zones jumping in when it suits them. Whether 24X succeeds or fails, it’s pretty clear that the way we think about markets is about to change forever, even if it is just through President Donald Trump.

The stablecoin issuer had just minted another 3B USDT last Sunday. The company has pushed its total minted USDT to 14 billion since November 8. CCData revealed that USDT has remained dominant in the stablecoin ecosystem, commanding approximately 69% of the total stablecoin market share. The high volume of Tether’s stablecoin activity was the primary driver behind the network’s $2.5 billion in earnings during Q3 2024. Tether’s CEO claims additional USDT for inventory replenishment PSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Tron Network. Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps. — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) August 20, 2024 Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, explained that the minting is a “USDT inventory replenish,” meaning the tokens are only authorized but not yet issued. Ardoino revealed that the tokens are added to Tether’s inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps. According to the company’s CEO, the approach will help ensure sufficient supply for effective liquidity management, with tokens released into circulation once officially issued. Ardoino is confident that the more stablecoins become available, traders will have greater flexibility in the market, and it can enhance market stability and efficiency. Data from on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously revealed that Tether mints the USDT and sends it to its multisignature wallet, where the funds are transferred to its treasury. The data also disclosed that the transaction featured zero fees. The company’s strategic minting depicts its ongoing efforts to maintain a robust supply of USDT to meet market demands. Tether’s newly minted USDT impacts the crypto market Research by Dr. Aman Saggu, together with Blockchain Research Lab, indicated that Tether’s continued issuance of USDT has a significant impact on the crypto ecosystem. The study evaluates and identifies every USDT minting and burning event on every blockchain ever used by Tether over the 2014 to 2021 period. The research revealed that Bitcoin prices tend to rise shortly after Tether mints new USDT. The study highlighted that Bitcoin prices increased by approximately 0.4% after 5 minutes and 0.8% after 30 minutes following a $1 billion USDT minting event. Saggu’s research suggested that investors view USDT minting as positive news due to its increased liquidity and demand signaled in the market. The study also confirmed that investors do not react similarly to USDT burning events. However, the study confirmed that the market does not perceive a reduction in USDT supply as negative news. Instead, it highlighted that Bitcoin’s price response to USDT minting is more driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) during periods of strong market sentiment and bullish conditions. CCData reported that the stablecoin market has surged in the past month. Tether marked an increase in its market capitalization to $190 billion and $1.8 trillion in trading volumes. The firm revealed in a post that USDT’s market cap rose last month by 0.57% to mark its thirteenth consecutive month of growth. Cryptocurrency traders and investors utilize stablecoin supply like Tether’s as a proxy to gauge market sentiment and investor interest. The rise in the level of newly minted stablecoins depicts bullish momentum, suggesting that traders are speculating on price movements. On the contrary, a reduction in supply would hint at lower interest and market activity.

The exchange’s website highlighted that traders can now access SOL/USD, SOL/EUR, PEPE/USD, and PEPE/EUR spot trading pairs. The exchange will debut PEPE, the third largest memecoin by market cap, which significantly surged in price after the listing announcement. The listing comes amid a prior “permanent” suspension trading ban of Solana on Bitstamp. Bitstamp believes relisting SOL demonstrates its dedication to bringing diverse options to U.S. customers.

Start now: https://t.co/sPXIuEAQ2H @pepecoineth @solana pic.twitter.com/nsbIQ2NoXe — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) November 29, 2024 Bitstamp supports several projects across decentralized finance, non-fungible token marketplace, and memecoins. The company shared that it is listing the third-largest memecoin by market cap. The PEPE memecoin has surged in price in the past few months amid a broader market uptick. The announcement was shared on the company’s official X account. The listing news comes at a time when the U.S expects a myriad of changes to the it’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, following Donald Trump’s presidential election win. The price of PEPE jumped to $0.000021 amid the news, and was up by 6% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing. The memecoin has now entrenched itself as the third-largest memecoin by market cap. SOL also bounced to highs of $247 after the news. Bitstamp reverses previous SOL trading suspension In August 2023, Bitstamp announced that it would no longer recognize SOL and six other cryptocurrencies. The decision followed allegations that Solana and six other digital assets were unregistered securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, the tokens were suspended from trading on the Bitstamp exchange. Even though only two crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved under the previous administration, the market is expecting a bigger shift following Trump’s win. ETF issuers are making applications for Solana, XRP, and HBAR ETFs, among others. A potential candidate for the next SEC chair, Teresa Guillén, also advocates to “make crypto great again.” Gary Gensler’s stepping down as SEC chairman has hinted towards a new approach to crypto regulation that could be more friendly. As a result, crypto exchange platforms like Bitstamp are embracing the new environment with their new listings in anticipation of a more relaxed regulatory environment. Multiple crypto platforms have begun adapting to the prospects of an improved regulatory environment. For example, MetaMask now allows US users to buy crypto directly using Venmo as an additional payment method. Bitstamp’s CEO, Bobby Zagotta, explained his renewed confidence in the stablecoin market in an interview on November 5. Zagotta revealed that the stablecoin market has the potential to grow from $175 billion to $5 trillion. The CEO backed his confidence by acknowledging that stablecoins have already played a crucial role in the development of the crypto ecosystem. Zagotta maintained that stablecoins have reduced frictions in terms of transfer value, collateral, and lending. Zagotta also revealed he is confident the stablecoin market will grow as other fiat currencies continue gaining traction in crypto. The crypto mogul compared the potential growth of the stablecoin market to the growth of the foreign exchange market.

Dogecoin Is Currently Showing A Pattern Similar To Previous Bull Runs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that has formed for Dogecoin’s weekly price recently. The “ TD Sequential ” refers to a technical analysis (TA) indicator that points out locations of probable tops and bottoms in a given asset’s price. This indicator involves two phases: the setup and the countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. Once the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be complete, and a reversal in the asset may be expected. Naturally, the price would start heading down if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were green, while it would catch an updraft if the candles were red. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown begins. This phase of the indicator works similarly to the setup, except for the fact that it lasts for thirteen candles. After these thirteen candles are also in, the asset may be considered to have arrived at another likely point of turnaround. Dogecoin has recently completed the TD Sequential phase of the first type, as the below chart for its weekly price shared by the analyst highlights. As is visible in the graph, Dogecoin has finished the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the indicator has just given a sell signal for the memecoin. Considering the indictor’s history, it’s possible that this would lead to a drawdown for the asset. That said, history would also inform us of another thing, as Martinez has highlighted in the chart. It would appear that during each of the last two bull runs , DOGE observed a similar TD Sequential setup in the initial leg of the rally as the one witnessed recently. These signals led into declines for the coin, but the bearish momentum didn’t last very long on either occasion, as the rally renewed each time after a temporary setback. If this trend is to go by, it’s possible that the latest TD Sequential sell signal may also prove to be only a minor obstacle on the way up for the cryptocurrency’s price. From the graph, it’s also visible that the last two Dogecoin bull runs both fit neatly into an ascending parallel channel . The channel has also continued to hold in the current cycle so far, meaning that if DOGE is going to rise all the way toward its upper channel, it might break through the $14 mark. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the asset would repeat the pattern or if this cycle is going to be different from the last two. DOGE Price Dogecoin has hit the snooze during the last couple of weeks as its price has continued to move sideways around the $0.41 mark.",Dogecoin|doge|Dogecoin Bull Run|Dogecoin Sell Signal|Dogecoin TD Sell|Dogecoin TD Sequential|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-29 23:00:42

In a new blog post, the crypto exchange says that its US branch is adding support for smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) and Pepe ( PEPE ), a frog-themed meme asset built on top altcoin Ethereum ( ETH ). “The day US fans of Solana and Pepe have been waiting for is finally here! We’re excited to announce that well-known Solana and the popular meme coin Pepe are now available for trading on Bitstamp in the US.” News of the listings sent both SOL and PEPE flying, as Solana went from a low of $235 on November 28th to a peak of $246 the next day while PEPE went from a low of $0.00001941 to a peak of $0.00002101 during the same time frame. Both SOL and PEPE have since retraced and are trading for $240 and $0.00002038 at time of writing, respectively. In its post, Bitstamp describes Solana as “a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to deliver fast and scalable transactions” and Pepe as a charming token inspired by the legendary Pepe the Frog character that has no actual utility beyond collecting and trading. Earlier this year, retail trading giant Robinhood announced that it would be acquiring Bitstamp – which was founded in 2011 in Luxembourg – for $200 million despite getting hit with a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

BONK and DOGE Lag",https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elon-maga-elonmaga-solana-memecoin-to-rally-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-lag/,"Elon MAGA could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-29 23:08:00

The multimodal AI model is thought to be a boon to Amazon’s AWS offering. Additionally, Olympus is expected to reduce Amazon’s reliance on external AI providers while strengthening its own cloud computing service. Amazon’s Olympus can analyze videos Amazon is reportedly working on a new AI tool, Olympus, which could analyze videos, images, and text. AI functionalities software developer, Tibor Blaho, explained in a post on X that the multimodal AI model is designed to help businesses in specific industries. It can reportedly perform tasks like searching through videos using text prompts or automatically analyzing footage in detail. scoop w/ @KevKubernetes : Amazon has developed new generative AI that can process images and video, in addition to text. Amazon could launch the model (code-named Olympus) next week at re:Invent in Las Vegas to lessen its reliance on 3-party models https://t.co/7cwB65zT5T — Anissa Gardizy (@anissagardizy8) November 28, 2024 But, what is Amazon getting out of this AI tool? Well, it is claimed that it will reduce Amazon’s dependency on other AI companies, like Anthropic. Blaho says that an official statement may come during Amazon’s AWS re :Invent conference in the upcoming week. Notably, AWS or Amazon Web Services comes under Amazon which provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs. From the information, we infer that oil and gas companies could use Olympus to analyze drone footage and identify problems with underwater equipment. These inspections are usually long and costly and Olympus might cut the time and cost. Another application is potentially to create sports highlights and analyze archives. Video-related features are something that mainstream AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have not captured. Amazon’s cloud computing customers could benefit from the launch . AWS offerings can benefit from Olympus integration AWS is a pay-as-you-go pricing model that deploys applications globally. It is not only known for applications that scale computing and add various features , it provides security services and AI tools as well . For instance, Amazon’s Olympus could enhance the capabilities of Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock with in-house multimodal capabilities. Its integration with products like SageMaker means building complex applications can become simple. Potentially, developers could access Olympus as a pre-trained model for multimodal tasks. Amazon’s Olympus could be an AI game-changer | Image is AI generated Last year, AI commentator Rowan Cheung reported that Olympus is Amazon’s attempt to enter the competitive generative AI space. Especially when companies in the sector, like NVIDIA, have been making fast-paced advancements in high-speed model training. In September 2023, Deloitte said in a press release that it teamed up with AWS to create Olympus, a cloud accelerator fund. Forrest Danson, principal and global chief commercial officer of the Amazon/AWS alliance, Deloitte Consulting LLP, explained that the partnership would help businesses quickly adopt advanced cloud-based tools and technologies like AI to solve problems. Meanwhile, AI launches continue to hit the markets. Tesla chief Elon Musk is bracing for his artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, to launch an AI-powered gaming studio. Telecommunications company Orange announced a partnership with OpenAI and Meta to develop AI models in regional languages. Amid these offerings, Amazon’s Olympus AI tool could add additional capabilities to the technology sector.

The latest model reportedly outshines OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini models on some specific benchmarks, such as the AIME and MATH tests, which evaluate AI models’ performance in logic puzzles and math problems. Alibaba has made QwQ-32B-Preview for download. According to the retail giant, Alibaba’s new model is capable of tackling complex and intricate problems compared to normal large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5. An article by Benzinga indicates that the QwQ-32B-Preview is one of the few available under a permissive license, enabling users to download and use it. The model is now available on the AI development platform Hugging Face. However, Alibaba released certain components of the model to limit full replication of the model or insights into its working. Alibaba’s latest model boasts 32.5 billion parameters which allows it to handle prompts of up to 32,000 words. With the model’s significant capabilities and semi-open accessibility, Alibaba’s new entrant sets the stage for a transformative leap in AI reasoning technologies. Alibaba’s transparent announcement, which underscores its model’s sophistication, OpenAI has kept its parameter counts under wraps. The coming of this model comes at a time when OpenAI is making significant strides in the AI sector. In October, OpenAI’s valuation jumped to $157 billion following a successful funding round. Earlier this week, SoftBank Group SFTBF reportedly increased its stake in the ChatGPT maker through a $1.5 billion employee share buyout. OpenAI is also said to be exploring the development of its own web browser to challenge Alphabet’s subsidiary Google Chrome browser after pressure coming from the US Department of Justice to divest it. Alibaba admits the model has flaws too Although it possesses some unique strengths, the new model also has limitations. According to the group, QwQ-32B-Preview has issues like unexpected language switches, which could potentially confuse users. The model also underperforms in tasks requiring common-sense reasoning, which is common with many AI systems. According to AutoGPT , the model may get caught in logical loops, delaying responses. Despite its shortcomings, its reasoning capabilities allow it to fact-check itself, therefore cutting on errors but increasing resolution time. By reasoning through tasks and planning steps, Alibaba’s model avoids some pitfalls that affect traditional AI systems. But this approach demands extra time which might limit real-time application. According to Benzinga, QwQ-32B-Preview’ responses align with Chinese regulatory standards , avoiding politically sensitive topics. For example, politically sensitive topics like Taiwan will give responses that are aligned with the Chinese government’s stance. Additionally, prompts about events like Tiananmen Square result in no responses coming up, showing the model’s cautious design. While this might be ideal for the Chinese market, it can also limit its appeal on the global market. However, the model is a significant step into the world of reasoning AI. While its limitations may narrow its global appeal, its other components like logic and semi-open nature makes it a big competitor for OpenAI. According to AutoGPT, QwQ-32B-Preview highlight the potential, and challenges, of this exciting frontier where AI labs across the world are working towards refining reasoning technology.

Amidst the chaos, investors always look for the best crypto to buy today, navigating the noise to uncover hidden gems with explosive potential. While major market players are making headlines, there’s growing buzz around new innovations like Qubetics ($TICS), whose presale has the crypto world sitting up and paying attention. But first, let’s glance at the drama surrounding Binance and SEI’s recent breakout. Then, we’ll dive into why Qubetics could be your ticket to massive returns. This article will break down the latest developments for Qubetics, Binance, and SEI while helping you uncover the best crypto to buy today. Qubetics Wallet: Where Innovation Meets Convenience The Qubetics Wallet is set to revolutionise how we interact with digital assets. Designed for everyday users, it’s all about making crypto management easy, secure, and accessible. Whether you’re on iOS, Android, or a desktop, this wallet offers seamless functionality across platforms , letting you control your $TICS tokens and other digital assets like a pro.

This bold step merges traditional and digital finance, giving users more control and flexibility in their financial lives. It’s not just a wallet; it’s a gateway to your financial future. Binance Faces Whistleblower Allegations and Legal Troubles Binance, one of the biggest names in crypto, is under fire again. A former executive, Amrita Srivastava, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit in the UK, claiming wrongful termination. She alleges she was fired for reporting a colleague who requested a bribe from a customer in exchange for preferential treatment. Binance denies these allegations, stating her dismissal was due to performance issues. Meanwhile, Nigerian authorities have accused Binance of laundering $35.4 million and operating without a license. These controversies could cast a shadow on Binance’s reputation, leaving investors questioning its ethics and long-term stability. SEI’s Meteoric Rise: A 60% Surge and Bullish Momentum SEI has been turning heads with an impressive 60% surge over the past two weeks, driven by strong market interest and bullish momentum. After a slight pullback to the 50% Fibonacci level, the coin has rebounded to $0.5264, marking a 14% gain in just 24 hours. With trading volume hitting $783.84 million and TVL standing at $207.32 million, SEI is clearly on an upward trajectory. However, liquidation risks loom as shorts face increasing pressure. Key resistance at $0.5460 and support at $0.4414 suggest volatility ahead, especially around liquidation clusters. Whether SEI continues its climb or sees a correction, it’s a coin worth keeping on your radar. Qubetics Presale Phase 10 Ending Soon If you’re wondering about the best crypto to buy today, Qubetics is hard to beat. Currently, in Presale Phase 10, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, with over $3.6 million already raised. Here’s the kicker: each week, the token price climbs by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike in the final stage. That means the earlier you get in, the more you stand to gain. Let’s talk numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could skyrocket to $10 or even $15 in the future. What does that mean for you? A modest $200 investment at today’s price could turn into a staggering $80,000 at $10 per token—or an eye-popping $195,000 if it hits $15. That’s an ROI of up to 59,900%! With opportunities like this, it’s no wonder Qubetics is making waves as the best crypto to buy today . Conclusion: The Crypto Revolution Awaits In a market full of opportunities, Qubetics, Binance, and SEI are making waves for different reasons. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy today, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out with its innovative wallet, practical payment integrations, and the jaw-dropping ROI potential of its presale.

Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground, preparing for a potential Wave 4 breakout that could take it higher. Algorand (ALGO) is on fire, showcasing a “W” breakout pattern that analysts believe could catapult its price by 300% to $1.26. But stealing the show is Qubetics ($TICS) , the new best crypto presale to buy now, which has already sold over 239 million tokens, raising a jaw-dropping $3.6 million. What makes Qubetics different? It’s not just another token; it’s a solution-driven platform addressing real-world issues that older blockchain systems couldn’t crack. With tools like its Multi-Chain Wallet, Qubetics is setting a new standard for usability, security, and innovation. If you’re hunting for the best opportunities in crypto , here’s everything you need to know about these three projects. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Qubetics is the talk of the town for all the right reasons. At its core lies the Multi-Chain Wallet , a revolutionary tool designed to simplify people’s crypto management. Think of it as a universal remote for your digital assets—seamlessly handling transactions across multiple blockchains without hassle. Imagine you’re a small business owner juggling Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana payments. With Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet, you no longer need to switch between apps or worry about compatibility. It’s all under one roof, making life simpler and more secure. For professionals, this wallet eliminates the headaches of managing diverse portfolios. And for everyday users? It’s the easiest way to send, receive, and store crypto without the steep learning curve. Qubetics isn’t just about innovation—it’s also about delivering massive ROI potential. In its 10th presale stage, the project has sold over 239 million $TICS tokens to 4,800+ holders, raising more than $3.6 million. Priced at $0.0257, this is the new best crypto presale to buy now—especially with a 10% price jump coming this weekend. Analysts are bullish, predicting $TICS will hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS could surge to $1, delivering a 3,787% ROI. If the mainnet launch hits its stride, the token might reach $15—a mind-blowing 58,213% ROI. To put that into perspective, a $4,000 investment at $0.0257 nets you about 155,250 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $15, your $4,000 becomes a staggering $2,328,750. It’s not just an opportunity; it’s a potential financial revolution. No wonder crypto analysts consider it the new best crypto presale to buy now . Cardano (ADA): Waiting for the Wave 4 Breakout Cardano has always been a crowd favourite, and its recent performance keeps investors intrigued. After breaking above $1, ADA is eyeing its next move. Analysts call this a Wave 4 setup—a critical phase where the price consolidates before potentially breaking out. The key support zones to watch are between $0.85 and $0.60, with the most critical level at $0.702. Despite a recent pullback, ADA hasn’t lost its bullish spark. The Fibonacci support levels between $0.88 and $0.778 have held strong, providing a base for the next leg up. What’s exciting is the potential for higher prices. If ADA breaks resistance around $1.14 and $1.12, it could soar to $1.87—a significant leap for holders. But here’s the kicker: the recent pullback from the November 23 high was in three waves rather than five. This opens the door for an upward move, making ADA one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for those seeking medium-term gains. ADA’s current range is a balancing act between risk and reward for traders and investors. If the price dips, support at $0.85 and $0.77 offers potential re-entry points. But if it pushes higher, the upside could be substantial. Algorand (ALGO): Aiming for the Moon with a “W” Breakout Pattern Algorand is catching fire, and it’s easy to see why. The token is trading around $0.30, but a “W” breakout pattern has analysts predicting a 300% rally to $1.26. This classic double-bottom setup often reverses the trend, and ALGO seems primed for liftoff. The critical resistance lies between $0.30 and $0.32. A daily close above this range would validate the bullish pattern, potentially triggering a massive upward move. The projected target of $1.26 isn’t just hype; it’s backed by solid technical analysis. The pattern’s height adds credibility to the prediction, and traders closely monitor volume to confirm the breakout. But there are risks. If ALGO fails to break $0.32, the price could retreat to its $0.15 support level. However, the overall sentiment remains positive, with rising trading volumes indicating strong interest. For those looking at the best cryptos to buy now, ALGO offers an exciting mix of short-term potential and medium-term growth. Seize the Moment with the Best Crypto Opportunities When it comes to the new best crypto presale to buy now, Qubetics is leading the charge. Its Multi-Chain Wallet is a game-changer, and the ROI potential is off the charts. Meanwhile, Cardano is setting up for a Wave 4 breakout that could take it to new highs, and Algorand’s “W” breakout pattern offers an enticing 300% rally target. But time is of the essence. The Qubetics presale is in its final stages, with a price hike just days away. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Secure your $TICS tokens now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. What are you waiting for? Dive in today and make your move before the market does!

As per a November 29 filing, the company reported converting 14,200 ETH into approximately 515 BTC in an open-market deal worth more than $49 million. The Ethereum had been acquired at an average cost of $2,777 per ETH, totaling $39.45 million. Following the transaction, Boyaa now holds 3,183 BTC, with an average purchase price of $57,724 per coin. The company emphasized that the move is in line with its strategy to expand its Bitcoin reserves, considering the market outlook for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. According to the board, converting existing Ether holdings into is a timely decision. In March, Boyaa announced the approval of a $100 million initiative to allocate $45 million of corporate funds to Bitcoin, $45 million to Ethereum, and $10 million to stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed firm disclosed a $1 million investment in the UTXO Management Bitcoin Ecosystem Fund in July.

Notably, the correction has given rise to the formation of a bullish pennant on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. This development might be the bullish momentum needed to eventually break past the $100,000 price threshold. However, the anticipated breakout is not just above $100,000, but a run that would send the cryptocurrency to $145,000. Bullish Pennant Emerges On Bitcoin Price Chart Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the $96,000 price level after spending the majority of the week on a correction path . Particularly, this correction saw the Bitcoin price hitting a low of $91,000 as many traders took profit. Notably, this back-and-forth movement of the BTC price has given rise to the formation of a small bull pennant. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, known for his technical analyses, pointed out this formation on social media platform X. In his post, he stated , “Small Pennant Big Target,” while pointing to the formation on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. A bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that often emerges during strong uptrends. It begins with a sharp price movement (the flagpole), followed by a consolidation phase (the pennant), before potentially breaking out in the same direction as the initial trend. The emergence of this bullish pennant on Bitcoin’s 3-day chart suggests that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for another leg higher. However, the formation suggests that the Bitcoin price could still continue to consolidate for a while as the liquidity in the pennant is yet to be filled. Nonetheless, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis highlights the longer-term implications of this formation. According to his projections, once Bitcoin completes its consolidation and breaks out of the pennant, it could surge toward an ambitious price target of $145,000. The $145,000 price target has become somewhat recurring among crypto analysts. For instance, this price target also made its way into an analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino, whose analysis pointed to the Bitcoin price top for this cycle at around $145,000. $100,000 Price Target Still In Play At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $96,070 and is up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours but down by 3.3% in the past seven days. The possibility of the Bitcoin price reaching the $100,000 price mark is not a matter of if at this point but of when. Speaking of when, the BTC price is about to witness another catalyst that could finally send it above $100,000. Bitcoin is about to undergo its largest monthly options expiry of 2024 on Friday, involving a total exposure of $13.6 billion. This expiry event could provide the momentum needed for bullish traders to drive Bitcoin’s price past the $100,000 milestone in the coming week.",Bitcoin|analyst|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 00:00:25

Morocco becoming the first African country to support a pro-crypto regulatory framework is big news for the global market and will drive the prices further up. Widespread adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and other front runners could potentially be beneficial to blockchain platforms like Near Protocol (NEAR). However, a new player could see the most out of this surge, IntelMarkets (INTL). Bitcoin Price: $5K Down Since Its ATH Bitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Being the largest crypto ever, Bitcoin’s massive price swings are nothing new. Its finite supply of 21 million coins and secure network has made it a popular store of value and an investment asset often referred to as “digital gold.” As per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $95,100, a 40% increase since last month. BTC seems to hold onto this upward trajectory due to favorable crypto policies being implemented around the world, together with rising institutional interest. Morocco’s progressive legislation is one example that will aid in BTC adoption in that part of the world. Bitcoin is the go-to long-term investment for many traders because it offers stability like none others. However, its massive market cap of $1.88T means that BTC has a limit on its upside. Many investors are looking to invest in shorter-term, higher-return projects. One of those projects that they’ve turned their heads to is IntelMarkets (INTL), which is becoming the game changer for those who seek higher returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Struggling To Reach Its Former Glory, Down 3% Near Protocol (NEAR) has made its name in the blockchain world with its focus on scalability, developer accessibility and user friendly applications. It uses a unique sharding technology called “Nightshade” to achieve high throughput and efficiency. NEAR, which is trading at $6.53, has repeatedly failed to recapture its former glory — its ATH of $20.42 in January of 2022. NEAR’s price instability shouldn’t diminish the fact that the token is still a solid choice for long-term investors as its ecosystem expands. With increased decentralized applications and partnership adoption, experts target a conservative $7 by the end of 2024. But since NEAR’s market cap is over $8 billion, explosive growth is far less likely than that of low-cap gems. NEAR is a safe entry for steady gains, but IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a unique opportunity for investors wanting to maximize returns utilizing a brand-new AI-driven approach. IntelMarkets (INTL): Revolutionizing Crypto Trading The project you should be looking out for during the following months is IntelMarkets (INTL). IntelMarkets combines AI, blockchain, and DeFi in one platform, offering traders a hassle free experience. The self learning AI trading bots analyze data at incredible speeds and enable a user to make profits on compelling opportunities across asset classes. The market has been excited by IntelMarkets ’ forward thinking approach, and so it was no surprise that investors have poured over $2.4 million into its presale. Some of INTL’s Key Features: AI Integration: Real-time self-learning bots that learn by optimizing their trading strategies. Dual-Chain Architecture: Scalable and efficient because it supports both Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Low Entry Price: With tokens sold at $0.055, there is plenty of room for early investors to get in. Massive Upside Potential: A top pick for life-changing gains, analysts predict a 75x rally post-launch. Exponential Growth Potential: As a low cap token, IntelMarkets (INTL) is predicted to outperform Bitcoin and NEAR on an upside basis, due to their limitations. Key Takeaways While Bitcoin (BTC) and Near Protocol (NEAR) remain attractive options for long-term investors looking for moderate gains, IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a rare opportunity to achieve life-changing returns. Its cutting-edge AI technology, low entry price, and immense growth potential make it the best investment choice in 2024. With Morocco’s crypto-friendly policy adding fuel to the market, INTL is poised to lead the next wave of innovation and surge.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 00:13:00

If approved, Ripple will be able to issue its stablecoin under a limited-purpose trust charter. This will position the company as a key player in the regulated U.S. digital finance market. The potential launch date is set for December 4, 2024, pending final regulatory approval. Ripple Labs Set to Launch RLUSD Stablecoin as New York Approval Nears According to a recent Fox Business report , Ripple labs is on the verge of receiving approval from New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD. This approval is crucial for Ripple as it seeks to enter the regulated U.S. market for stablecoins. The NYDFS is known for its stringent regulatory standards, ensuring that companies meet high levels of transparency before offering digital assets. Once approved, Ripple will be able to issue RLUSD under a limited-purpose trust charter, a common regulatory pathway for digital asset firms in New York. This regulatory approach allows Ripple to offer stablecoins without the more complex regulatory requirements faced by traditional banks. If all goes as planned, Ripple could launch RLUSD as soon as December 4, 2024. This is a significant step for the company in its pursuit of expanding its offerings in the U.S. digital finance sector. According to a recent report, Ripple Labs is expanding its partnership with Mercy Corps through the “Unlocking Opportunities” program. The initiative will drive the adoption of RLUSD, promoting financial inclusion in cases such as savings, and micropayments. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Aims to Offer Stability More so, Ripple’s stablecoin will provide a stable alternative to XRP, which has been prone to volatility. By being pegged to a stable asset, RLUSD will attract customers seeking a more predictable and reliable digital currency. Stablecoins are typically pegged to assets with stable valuations, such as the U.S. dollar. They also serve as a store of value and help facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions. Ripple’s move into the stablecoin market places it in direct competition with other established U.S. issuers like Circle, Paxos, and Gemini. Additionally, for the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple labs will collaborate with several well-known payment providers, including Bitstamp, Moonpay, and Uphold. These partnerships will help Ripple expand RLUSD’s reach, offering users more access to payments and remittances. Keith Grossman, president of Enterprise at MoonPay, stated that the launch is a positive development for the stablecoin market. Grossman emphasized, “For another well-capitalized, highly regulated player to enter into the global stablecoin marketplace – especially as MiCA regulation in Europe is about to be implemented – is a win-win and MoonPay is proud to provide access to RLUSD for our partners and customers on day one of Ripple’s launch.” Meanwhile, XRP whales have moved over 139 million coins, sparking speculation as the Ripple Labs vs. SEC lawsuit nears a potential resolution. These large transactions come amid growing optimism that the legal case could favor Ripple, with XRP price rising.

XRP is currently trading above the crucial $1.50 level and is up by more than six percent in the last 24 hours. The altcoin has gained 20 percent in the past week and is now eyeing to break the $1.60 level. As for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is trading above the $97k level and has slipped into the red zone. XRP Continues Bull Run Although many cryptocurrencies move in waves, XRP tends to follow a straight upward trajectory, especially during bull markets. At the moment, XRP is facing some resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If XRP breaks above $1.70, it could easily hit $2 soon. Watch for the breakout above $1.70 to confirm this possibility. Support Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, in case of a pullback, XRP has solid support around $1.25 to $1.30. This range has acted as major support in recent times, so if the price drops, it is likely to bounce back from there. Short-Term Outlook: Breakout and Resistance XRP has successfully broken out from a triangle pattern. Although the breakout was slightly delayed, it is now heading towards the target price of $1.77. Short-term resistance may appear around $1.70, but once that level is cleared, XRP is expected to continue its upward movement. Previous Resistance Becomes Support The breakout above $1.50-$1.51 marks a significant shift. Once this resistance level was cleared, XRP’s price surged higher. Now, those previous resistance levels should act as new support. Watch for support around $1.62 to $1.63, and further support around $1.56 or $1.50 if the price pulls back.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 00:25:03

Despite the resistance, the HBAR price at press time was trading at $0.1823, a 25% surge from the intra-day low. During the rally, HBAR’s trading volume and market capitalization soared by 261% and 25% respectively, reaching $954.36 million and $6.92 billion. Hedera (HBAR) Price Jumps 25% Hedera (HBAR) price has displayed strong upward momentum, reinforced by technical indicators suggesting continued bullish trends after skyrocketing over 25%. The HBAR price recently crossed both its 50-day (SMA 50) and 200-day (SMA 200) simple moving averages, forming a “golden cross”. The SMA 50 is currently at $0.07545, while the SMA 200 is positioned at $0.07169, both well below the current price. HBAR/USD price chart (Source: TradingView) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for HBAR has reached 78.56, nearing the overbought zone of 80. This suggests strong buying activity but also indicates a potential price consolidation as traders may take profits. However, analysts remain optimistic, with one Javon Marks forecasting a possible rally to $0.504, representing a 192% increase from current levels. Increased Market Activity Boosts Investor Confidence HBAR’s price rally has been accompanied by heightened trading activity and open interest, indicating growing market participation. Trading volume surged by 261% to $954.36 million in 24 hours, while open interest grew by 48.26% to $208.25 million. This increase suggests that new capital is entering the market, which could support sustained upward price movement. According to More Crypto Online, HBAR’s current movement aligns with Elliott Wave theory, suggesting one more high is likely in the short term. Analysts are monitoring key resistance levels at $0.176, $0.20, and $0.23. A breakout above these levels could further validate the bullish trend. Federal Reserve Collaboration Fuels Positive Sentiment HBAR’s recent price surge is also being supported by its growing role in blockchain-based federal payment systems. Hedera is integrated into the Federal Reserve’s FedNow payment platform through Dropp, enabling real-time payments with increased efficiency and security. In addition, Ripple (XRP), which has partnered with Hedera for USD transactions, is expected to receive regulatory approval to launch its RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024. This partnership could enhance interoperability between Hedera and Ripple, further bolstering HBAR’s adoption in the payments sector. Concurrently, HBAR traders are also optimistic due to speculation about the potential approval of a Hedera exchange-traded fund (ETF) submitted by Canary Capital to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With Gary Gensler stepping down as SEC chairman, an ETF approval, which is likely under Trump’s administration, is possible hence could provide broader exposure to institutional investors, fueling additional HBAR price gains.

Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP beat Binance Coin (BNB) in terms of market capitalization, with XRP having a market capitalization of $100 billion above BNB’s $94 billion. This surge puts XRP in the elite $100 billion club. Currently valued at $1.74, XRP has risen by 17% in the last 24 hours and a stunning 200% in the past month, its best showing since December 2017. The cryptocurrency has continued to surge, reaching $1.7, a price it last touched in April of 2021. Currently, XRP is trailing behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Solana (SOL). On the daily chart, the XRP shows a steep upward trend from $0.50 to $1.72 in a parabolic trend this month. The RSI stands at 88.09, indicating that the asset is overbought, while the MACD at 0.25022 points towards the buying pressure. Support levels are at $1.40 and $1.50 while major resistance levels are at $1.80. A pullback to the $1.50 area, accompanied by a bullish breakout, could be a decent entry opportunity, with the price rallying above $1.80 if volume remains on the rise. Speculations surrounding changes within the US Security and Exchange Commission have boosted investor confidence. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch in December Ripple Labs is making headlines again with its RLUSD stablecoin, a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that is overcollaterized. According to sources , the New York Department of Financial Services is expected to provide its green light to the stablecoin as early as December, which may lead to the trading of the token. Ripple first unveiled its plans to launch the RLUSD in April 2024 as a way of challenging other stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. The company has forecast that the stablecoin market will be $2 trillion by 2028. The pilot of RLUSD was launched in August on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet, with the intention of adding more blockchains. Ripple has also ensured it partners with exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, and other exchanges that support RLUSD.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 232,200 followers on the social media platform X that Sei ( SEI ) looks bullish after breaking out of a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart. A rounding bottom formation is a bullish reversal structure suggesting that an asset is ready to witness a new uptrend. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “Fundamentals-wise, I think there needs to be a bit more built on there for people to gamble on but all in all, it looks really good for higher. Grabbing a bag a bit lower if it comes. Something like $0.60 would be a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.66. Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is the smart contract platform Fantom ( FTM ). According to the crypto strategist, FTM looks solid for long-term investors given its strong fundamentals. He also says the coin looks bullish after breaking out from a multi-month accumulation period. “FTM: there’s a lot to like with this chart and project IMO (in my opinion): -Andre [Cronje] cracked dev -high float/not as much sell pressure from VCs (venture capitalists) -Sonic rebrand coming that hits all the narratives -chart-wise, almost a two-year accumulation period followed by some big moves and clean levels. I’m in. Don’t really recommend you buy at this current level, to be frank, but I think that buying any dips is a good thing. Still believe that this is a pretty decent one to hold if you’re looking for older 2021 movers that have high float/supply out (others like AVAX might be considered).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FTM is facing one big resistance level at $1.10. At time of writing, FTM is trading at $1.00. Looking at fellow layer-1 (L1) protocol Near ( NEAR ), the trader shares a chart suggesting that the altcoin may target its resistance at $8.29 after moving above $6.50. “NEAR has pretty slow grinding price action and isn’t really a great active trade right now. That said, I do think that this hits a lot of narratives for this cycle in terms of AI (artificial intelligence) and L1. Would like to see more growth on there / more degen stuff but I do have a bag of this.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X NEAR is trading at $6.97 at time of writing.

Whale Moves Signal Big Rally Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-10-within-reach-for-cardano-whale-moves-signal-big-rally-ahead/,"Cardano (ADA) has achieved a significant milestone by breaking past the $1 barrier , a level that appeared unattainable for the majority of 2023. The cryptocurrency’s recent price surge has captivated the attention of both analysts and investors, as it has been unable to overcome this psychological level for years. Although the token has recently experienced some price consolidation, analysts anticipate that this is merely the commencement of a much more substantial rally. Cardano: Consolidation Phase ADA’s momentum weakened after it crossed the $1 threshold, and it has been hovering just below this mark. Cardano has entered a phase of consolidation around the $0.99 to $1.00 range, contrary to the expectations of many investors who anticipated that the rally would persist. While this may appear to be a temporary setback, analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He perceives this consolidation as a positive indicator of redistribution, a prerequisite for the ADA to continue its upward trajectory. For years through the bear market, many didn’t think $ADA would ever hit $1 again. Many holders have been waiting to sell at $1. Now that we’ve reached $1, it’s great to see a consolidation and redistribution. After this phase is over, Cardano can focus on $5 and $10. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) November 27, 2024 Gambardello anticipates that Cardano may pursue significantly higher price points after this segment concludes, potentially achieving a range of $5 to $10. Increase In Whale Activities The increase in whale activity during Cardano’s latest performance is among the most fascinating features. ADA whales have been rapidly rising their numbers over the last few weeks, particularly following the token’s $1 breakthrough. According to reports, over 130 million ADA tokens are owned by millionaires, and that exceeds over 3.2 billion. Such accumulation is taken as a strong vote for the token, which would keep the price going high. Despite profit-taking, the ADA adoption has kept its positive optimism. Whale Appetite Up As Bitcoin approaches $100,000, there is a transition in focus to other cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano. The market capitalization of ADA has increased by more than 30% in the past week, reaching an impressive $35 billion. Because of the rise in whale activity and the possibility of a good regulatory environment, investors are very optimistic about Cardano’s future. The level of excitement has also been raised by rumors about Cardano’s founder and possible partnerships with incoming US President Donald Trump. Although these factors are still considered speculative, they contribute to the increasing conviction that Cardano may achieve new price milestones in the near future. Cardano’s most recent performance has demonstrated that it is once again competitive. ADA may soon achieve new heights due to the expanding market sentiment and robust whale support. The $5 to $10 price range may appear to be an ambitious goal; however, it is now feasible with the appropriate catalysts.
