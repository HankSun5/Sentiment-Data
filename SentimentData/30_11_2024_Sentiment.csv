The regulator issued a warning to GEDI, a publisher in the country against sharing its data archives with OpenAI, citing a potential breach of the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This follows a partnership between GEDI and OpenAI, which would allow OpenAI to train its ChatGPT models on Italian language content. GEDI is a media company owned by the Agnelli family. It publishes daily newspapers, La Repubblica and La Stampa, and it announced a partnership with OpenAI in September. The partnership involves delivering Italian language content from the publisher’s news portfolio to help train and improve OpenAI’s products. GPDP frowns on GEDI’s partnership with OpenAI John Elkann, Chairman of GEDI, said, “The partnership signed with OpenAI is part of GEDI’s digital transformation journey and recognizes its leadership in producing high-quality content within the Italian media landscape.” However, the GPDP warns that this partnership could potentially lead to a breach of the EU’s GDPR. The GDPR sets a global standard for privacy laws, emphasizing user consent, transparency, and accountability. It was also the first to propose an AI regulatory framework , which it claims will promote safe and responsible use of AI. “If GEDI, on the basis of the agreement signed with OpenAI, were to disclose the personal data contained in its archive, it could violate EU regulation, with all the consequences, including those of a sanctioning nature,” the GPDP stated. GDPR violations can cost offending companies up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover. Contrasting global perspectives on AI usage This latest episode with GEDI further escalates the tensions between technological advancement and compliance with privacy regulations in the EU. Clearview AI , an American company, was fined about €30 million by the Dutch Data Protection Authority, citing privacy breach and violation of user rights under the GDPR. Earlier this year, the GPDP temporarily banned ChatGPT over concerns about unlawful collection and processing of user data. The U.S. has taken a relaxed and market-driven approach to AI, favoring innovation and emphasizing self-regulation within the space. The “Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence”, which was issued in October 2023 alludes to this. The lack of clear legislation, especially on a federal level, has led to states leading the way in regulating the industry. California’s Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) is an example of state-level AI legislation. China has also put a regulatory framework in place. In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued regulations on the use of generative AI. It also plans to formulate over 50 standards for AI by 2026 . These regulations would apply to both local and international providers of AI services.

According to the report , the exchanges include Bybit Fintech Limited, MEXC Global , Bitget Limited, KuCoin, and Bitcastle LLC Unregistered Operations and Customer Risks Notably, all five crypto exchanges have been accused of operating in Japan without appropriate registration. None of the five entities has the authorization of the FSA or any other local financial bureaus. This implies that the crypto exchanges are providing unauthorized services to their users based in Japan. A broader implication of the violation by the five cryptocurrency exchanges is that the Financial Services Agency cannot supervise their activities. Hence, customers and their assets lack protection should there be trouble or any unforeseen issue requiring regulatory intervention. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, customers of the five exchanges are not covered by asset protection or compensation as stated in Japanese law. Customers have no coverage and are very exposed to all forms of financial risks. Japan’s FSA Efforts Toward Crypto Regulation The FSA’s warning comes as a warning to users of this platform to know the risks facing their financial assets. Over the years, Japan has adopted a strict regulatory approach to maintain the integrity of its market and protect customers from heavy financial losses. Meanwhile, as per a report, Japan recently reorganized its Web3 leadership to ensure regulatory clarity. This move aims to provide support for innovation in digital assets. Additionally, it will help to grow users’ confidence and trust levels in cryptocurrency. Is Japan’s FSA Pushing for a Crypto-Friendly Landscape? Perhaps Japan’s regulatory body, the FSA’s proposal to adjust the country’s crypto tax rates, is geared towards encouraging compliance. The proposal made in August 2024 is for the 2025 financial year. Currently, Japan imposes a hefty tax on profits, which could range from 15% to 55%, depending on the taxpayer’s income bracket. The FSA’s proposal resulted from widespread calls from stakeholders in Japan’s crypto sector for a more friendly tax environment. The FSA’s response in pushing for reform remains subject to legislative approval by the country’s national legislature.

XRP Bulls Rally Toward $2 Mark,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/explosive-breakout-ahead-xrp-bulls-rally-toward-2-mark/,"Recently, XRP has been on a robust positive run; some predict that the altcoin will hit $2 in the following weeks. This hope coincides with increasing whale activity, as technical signs suggest that the price might cross significant barrier levels. Starting in early November, XRP’s explosion has inspired experts and investors. Whales Fuel Price Movement Whale purchase activity is one of the main causes of XRP’s recent rise . Widely seen as a positive sign, large altcoin holders have been accumulating millions of XRP tokens. $XRP to $2 isn’t even a question. $8-20 is inevitable 1. Bullish patterns = long-term setup2. Whales accumulating hard3. MACD cooling off + RSI neutral4. $1.60, then no resistance to $25.

Notable transactions, like a 150 million XRP trade valued at $227 million, have drawn attention from market watchers. Technical Indicators Point To Continued Growth Technical study also indicates XRP’s bright future. Expert in cryptocurrencies, CrediBull, informs us that XRP is currently experiencing a “five-wave impulse climb,” typical of long-term increasing trajectory. He predicts that if the price remains over $1.05, XRP may break out above $2 in the next weeks. On the other hand, if the price falls below this critical support level, it may indicate a correction before the next upward impulse. Another expert, Egrag Crypto, is keeping a careful eye on XRP’s market rise, which is approaching crucial levels. The analyst focuses on the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, which is now at 2.57%. #XRP Dominance – FIB 0.5: IT’S TIME! Trend lines often get invalidated, but they provide a visual guide for market structure. Add Fibonacci extensions into the mix, and you have a leading indicator to anticipate what’s next. Key Levels to Watch:On the monthly timeframe,… pic.twitter.com/ZqMyiAoomS — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 28, 2024 If XRP closes above this level by the end of the month, it might lead to more gains. Analysts are also looking at the 0.702 Fibonacci level as the next goal for domination, which might lead to further price gains. XRP Path To $2 Promising XRP’s price has already grown by 16% in the last week , and it is now trading around $1.47, with a daily rise of 5%. The coin has demonstrated steady upward momentum, breaking through critical resistance zones and finding support at $1.30. If XRP maintains these levels, there is speculation that it could approach $2. Possible gains in the coming weeks are being paved by whale activity, strong technical patterns, and increasing market domination. The success of XRP hinges on its ability to retain strong support levels and continue its upward trajectory as it gains momentum. If the upward trend continues, XRP has the potential to hit new highs in the near future.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-29 22:12:00

On its previous day of trades, Nov. 28, Bitwise’s $BITB led at $48.05 million with Fidelity’s $FDT at $40.24 million as no other ETF inflows or outflows were recorded. Bitwise sees strong appetite for digital assets BITB, CEO Hunter Horsley revealed in a post on X platform adding the bull run was suggestive of strong demand for digital assets by investors. “$26,000,000 of inflows into $BITB today and $82M of volume in just 3.5 hours with short market day,” wrote Horsley. “People want more Bitcoin. Things are just getting started. Happy Thanksgiving!” Horsley. This comes as Bitwise filed to start a 10-Crypto index exchange-traded fund (ETF) meant to provide exposure to the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Uniswap and Polkadot. Once approved, the 10-Crypto Index ETF is expected to expand the two-way access between mainstream and the digital asset market, which will immensely interest both institutional and retail investors. Coinbase Custody will store the assets while the Bank of New York Mellon will act as the fund’s cash custodian and administrator. Bitwise reangles its European operations targeting institutional investors Bitwise has a history of supporting new and advanced crypto investment products, as last year the company submitted requests for ETFs based on Solana and XRP. The company has also spread its operations to Europe. Meanwhile, the asset management firm has announced the rebranding of its European XRP ETF to Bitwise Physical XRP ETP. The European operation, which was known as ETF Group Physical XRP will trade in Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA under the ticker GXRP. In a Wednesday blog, Bitwise indicated the move was part of a strategic overhaul of the company’s European product lineup. This was also meant to enhance its appeal to institutional investors seeking regulated exposure to XRP. The operation launched in 2022 under the ETC group and remains backed by physical XRP. Horsley spoke of a strong track record and evolving capabilities of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) a blockchain with more than a decade of proven reliability. “We’re thrilled to provide investors with access to this innovative asset through an institutional-quality product,” Horsley noted, signaling the product’s potential to attract significant institutional interest.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $9.97 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF’s price may surge to $16.21. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $3.29 Market cap $3,281,696,199.18 Trading volume $603,437,301.43 Circulating supply 998,844,854.96 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $3.33 24-hour low $3.05 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $10.52 (227.25%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 19.16% 50-day SMA $2.75 14-Day RSI 53.18 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $2.42 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF struggles to break past $3.389 TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis shows consolidation. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at $3.389. WIF’s support level is present at $3.056. The Dogwifhat price analysis for November 29 shows price consolidation, after a failed attempt to break past $3.389. Having seen massive gains over the past month (over 28%), and a rebound afterward, the bulls have been unable to push WIF to its previous highs. What next for Dogwifhat ($WIF)? Continued consolidation or a bullish breakout? Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF sees 8% daily gain, but continues to consolidate The WIF/USD 1-day price chart analysis shows that the token has seen about 8.1% gains today, but has struggled to break past $3.389 over the past 4 price candles. WIF’s immediate support is present at $3.056. A breakdown below this level could see WIF drop to $2.907. WIF sees 8% daily gain but continues to consolidate In the event of a bullish breakout, $WIF could recapture $3.5 or even higher. The RSI indicator shows 55.61, suggesting the market is neutral with no clear overbought or oversold signals, aligning with the token’s recent consolidation and current market conditions. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF is in an uptrend in the short-term The WIF/USD 4-hour price analysis reflects an uptrend in the short term, with the coin trading close to the upper Bollinger Band at $3.307. Immediate support is present at $3.117. A bearish reversal could see WIF settle below $3. If the current momentum persists, traders can anticipate a breakout towards $3.5. WIF is in an uptrend in the short-term Likewise, the MACD indicator suggests bullish momentum, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power shows that sellers are gaining a significant advantage, indicating the possibility of a trend reversal.

The 4-hour and 1-day charts point to a short-term bullish trend for WIF. However, a price correction could be on the horizon with RSI nearing overbought levels. Monitoring trading volume and key support/resistance levels will help gauge if the rally can hold. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $10 and $13. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, Orca, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? The recent decline in Dogwifhat’s price is due to a market correction after a bullish surge, high open interest levels, bearish technical signals, large whale sell-offs, shifts in market sentiment, long position liquidations, and breaches of key support levels. Will WIF reach $10? Having already reached about $5 on March 31, 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Predictions by analysts suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2028. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $5 by 2025 and $15 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

The 24X National Exchange, a Stamford, Connecticut-based trading platform, is set to launch with an almost uninterrupted schedule. Designed to serve both retail and institutional investors, this exchange plans to operate on business days from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. But that’s not the big deal. Pending final approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 24X might extend operations to 8:00 p.m. ET on Sundays through 7:00 p.m. ET on Fridays—essentially open for 23 hours a day with just a one-hour pause. This is the closest the U.S. has ever come to a stock exchange that barely sleeps. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, which stick to standard hours and shut down on holidays, 24X is rewriting the rules. The company is leaning into the global nature of trading, wanting to accommodate markets in Asia-Pacific (APAC), where U.S. equities are hot commodities, even when Wall Street is fast asleep. Why now? – The crypto connection Let’s not pretend this is a coincidence. Cryptocurrencies, which have been trading nonstop since Bitcoin’s debut, have been schooling traditional markets on what 24/7 access looks like. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase thrive on constant availability, and traders have gotten used to the idea of instant action, regardless of the time or day. Stocks, on the other hand, have stayed in their lane, sticking to opening bells and closing times. Sure, brokerage firms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have extended trading hours for some securities, but those windows still don’t come close to crypto’s round-the-clock hustle. The 24X National Exchange seems to be taking a page from the crypto playbook, recognizing the demand for seamless trading across time zones and asset classes. Dmitri Galinov, the brains behind the exchange, knows what’s at stake. “Traders are most at risk when the market is closed in their geographic location,” Galinov said in a statement . His solution? Bring U.S. equities trading to a global audience and make it as accessible as crypto. The 24X National Exchange is powered by technology from MEMX Technologies, a company known for its high-performance systems. The exchange claims it plans to use its advanced infrastructure to adapt quickly to customer feedback, so it can build trust with traders tired of rigid systems. Yet, for all its ambition, 24X isn’t abandoning tradition entirely. The exchange will stick to U.S. market holidays, closing in sync with NYSE and Nasdaq. A bigger picture Traders who have flocked to crypto markets for their constant availability might now have a compelling reason to split their attention. A stock market that’s almost always open could siphon off some of the volume that’s been a hallmark of crypto trading. And let’s talk liquidity. Extended trading hours mean more opportunities to buy and sell, potentially stabilizing prices in both the stock and crypto markets. But with liquidity comes volatility. Markets that never really close are like roller coasters without brakes. Every global event, every piece of breaking news, could trigger reactions that ripple across time zones. This isn’t just about traders though. Regulators will need to step up their game too. A near-24-hour stock exchange is uncharted territory, and it could push the SEC to rethink how markets are overseen. Don’t be surprised if this leads to clearer coexistence between crypto and equities. The overlap between the two worlds is becoming harder to ignore. Winners, losers, and the retail dilemma But the truth is, not everyone will be cheering for 24X. Retail investors, for one, might find the idea of nearly nonstop trading overwhelming. Let’s face it, not everyone has the stomach for markets that are always open, which is understandable. While institutional players will likely thrive in this environment, retail traders could struggle to keep up, widening the gap between Wall Street pros and Main Street novices. There’s also the risk of market manipulation. Longer trading hours mean more chances for bad actors to exploit loopholes. But for those who can adapt, the opportunities are huge. Arbitrage traders, for instance, could find gold in the overlapping hours between stocks and crypto. Global participation might also see a boost, with investors from different time zones jumping in when it suits them. Whether 24X succeeds or fails, it’s pretty clear that the way we think about markets is about to change forever, even if it is just through President Donald Trump.

The stablecoin issuer had just minted another 3B USDT last Sunday. The company has pushed its total minted USDT to 14 billion since November 8. CCData revealed that USDT has remained dominant in the stablecoin ecosystem, commanding approximately 69% of the total stablecoin market share. The high volume of Tether’s stablecoin activity was the primary driver behind the network’s $2.5 billion in earnings during Q3 2024. Tether’s CEO claims additional USDT for inventory replenishment PSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Tron Network. Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps. — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) August 20, 2024 Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, explained that the minting is a “USDT inventory replenish,” meaning the tokens are only authorized but not yet issued. Ardoino revealed that the tokens are added to Tether’s inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps. According to the company’s CEO, the approach will help ensure sufficient supply for effective liquidity management, with tokens released into circulation once officially issued. Ardoino is confident that the more stablecoins become available, traders will have greater flexibility in the market, and it can enhance market stability and efficiency. Data from on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously revealed that Tether mints the USDT and sends it to its multisignature wallet, where the funds are transferred to its treasury. The data also disclosed that the transaction featured zero fees. The company’s strategic minting depicts its ongoing efforts to maintain a robust supply of USDT to meet market demands. Tether’s newly minted USDT impacts the crypto market Research by Dr. Aman Saggu, together with Blockchain Research Lab, indicated that Tether’s continued issuance of USDT has a significant impact on the crypto ecosystem. The study evaluates and identifies every USDT minting and burning event on every blockchain ever used by Tether over the 2014 to 2021 period. The research revealed that Bitcoin prices tend to rise shortly after Tether mints new USDT. The study highlighted that Bitcoin prices increased by approximately 0.4% after 5 minutes and 0.8% after 30 minutes following a $1 billion USDT minting event. Saggu’s research suggested that investors view USDT minting as positive news due to its increased liquidity and demand signaled in the market. The study also confirmed that investors do not react similarly to USDT burning events. However, the study confirmed that the market does not perceive a reduction in USDT supply as negative news. Instead, it highlighted that Bitcoin’s price response to USDT minting is more driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) during periods of strong market sentiment and bullish conditions. CCData reported that the stablecoin market has surged in the past month. Tether marked an increase in its market capitalization to $190 billion and $1.8 trillion in trading volumes. The firm revealed in a post that USDT’s market cap rose last month by 0.57% to mark its thirteenth consecutive month of growth. Cryptocurrency traders and investors utilize stablecoin supply like Tether’s as a proxy to gauge market sentiment and investor interest. The rise in the level of newly minted stablecoins depicts bullish momentum, suggesting that traders are speculating on price movements. On the contrary, a reduction in supply would hint at lower interest and market activity.

The exchange’s website highlighted that traders can now access SOL/USD, SOL/EUR, PEPE/USD, and PEPE/EUR spot trading pairs. The exchange will debut PEPE, the third largest memecoin by market cap, which significantly surged in price after the listing announcement. The listing comes amid a prior “permanent” suspension trading ban of Solana on Bitstamp. Bitstamp believes relisting SOL demonstrates its dedication to bringing diverse options to U.S. customers.

Start now: https://t.co/sPXIuEAQ2H @pepecoineth @solana pic.twitter.com/nsbIQ2NoXe — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) November 29, 2024 Bitstamp supports several projects across decentralized finance, non-fungible token marketplace, and memecoins. The company shared that it is listing the third-largest memecoin by market cap. The PEPE memecoin has surged in price in the past few months amid a broader market uptick. The announcement was shared on the company’s official X account. The listing news comes at a time when the U.S expects a myriad of changes to the it’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, following Donald Trump’s presidential election win. The price of PEPE jumped to $0.000021 amid the news, and was up by 6% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing. The memecoin has now entrenched itself as the third-largest memecoin by market cap. SOL also bounced to highs of $247 after the news. Bitstamp reverses previous SOL trading suspension In August 2023, Bitstamp announced that it would no longer recognize SOL and six other cryptocurrencies. The decision followed allegations that Solana and six other digital assets were unregistered securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, the tokens were suspended from trading on the Bitstamp exchange. Even though only two crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved under the previous administration, the market is expecting a bigger shift following Trump’s win. ETF issuers are making applications for Solana, XRP, and HBAR ETFs, among others. A potential candidate for the next SEC chair, Teresa Guillén, also advocates to “make crypto great again.” Gary Gensler’s stepping down as SEC chairman has hinted towards a new approach to crypto regulation that could be more friendly. As a result, crypto exchange platforms like Bitstamp are embracing the new environment with their new listings in anticipation of a more relaxed regulatory environment. Multiple crypto platforms have begun adapting to the prospects of an improved regulatory environment. For example, MetaMask now allows US users to buy crypto directly using Venmo as an additional payment method. Bitstamp’s CEO, Bobby Zagotta, explained his renewed confidence in the stablecoin market in an interview on November 5. Zagotta revealed that the stablecoin market has the potential to grow from $175 billion to $5 trillion. The CEO backed his confidence by acknowledging that stablecoins have already played a crucial role in the development of the crypto ecosystem. Zagotta maintained that stablecoins have reduced frictions in terms of transfer value, collateral, and lending. Zagotta also revealed he is confident the stablecoin market will grow as other fiat currencies continue gaining traction in crypto. The crypto mogul compared the potential growth of the stablecoin market to the growth of the foreign exchange market.

Dogecoin Is Currently Showing A Pattern Similar To Previous Bull Runs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that has formed for Dogecoin’s weekly price recently. The “ TD Sequential ” refers to a technical analysis (TA) indicator that points out locations of probable tops and bottoms in a given asset’s price. This indicator involves two phases: the setup and the countdown. During the first of these, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. Once the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be complete, and a reversal in the asset may be expected. Naturally, the price would start heading down if the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were green, while it would catch an updraft if the candles were red. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown begins. This phase of the indicator works similarly to the setup, except for the fact that it lasts for thirteen candles. After these thirteen candles are also in, the asset may be considered to have arrived at another likely point of turnaround. Dogecoin has recently completed the TD Sequential phase of the first type, as the below chart for its weekly price shared by the analyst highlights. As is visible in the graph, Dogecoin has finished the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the indicator has just given a sell signal for the memecoin. Considering the indictor’s history, it’s possible that this would lead to a drawdown for the asset. That said, history would also inform us of another thing, as Martinez has highlighted in the chart. It would appear that during each of the last two bull runs , DOGE observed a similar TD Sequential setup in the initial leg of the rally as the one witnessed recently. These signals led into declines for the coin, but the bearish momentum didn’t last very long on either occasion, as the rally renewed each time after a temporary setback. If this trend is to go by, it’s possible that the latest TD Sequential sell signal may also prove to be only a minor obstacle on the way up for the cryptocurrency’s price. From the graph, it’s also visible that the last two Dogecoin bull runs both fit neatly into an ascending parallel channel . The channel has also continued to hold in the current cycle so far, meaning that if DOGE is going to rise all the way toward its upper channel, it might break through the $14 mark. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the asset would repeat the pattern or if this cycle is going to be different from the last two. DOGE Price Dogecoin has hit the snooze during the last couple of weeks as its price has continued to move sideways around the $0.41 mark.",Dogecoin|doge|Dogecoin Bull Run|Dogecoin Sell Signal|Dogecoin TD Sell|Dogecoin TD Sequential|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-29 23:00:42

In a new blog post, the crypto exchange says that its US branch is adding support for smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) and Pepe ( PEPE ), a frog-themed meme asset built on top altcoin Ethereum ( ETH ). “The day US fans of Solana and Pepe have been waiting for is finally here! We’re excited to announce that well-known Solana and the popular meme coin Pepe are now available for trading on Bitstamp in the US.” News of the listings sent both SOL and PEPE flying, as Solana went from a low of $235 on November 28th to a peak of $246 the next day while PEPE went from a low of $0.00001941 to a peak of $0.00002101 during the same time frame. Both SOL and PEPE have since retraced and are trading for $240 and $0.00002038 at time of writing, respectively. In its post, Bitstamp describes Solana as “a cutting-edge blockchain platform designed to deliver fast and scalable transactions” and Pepe as a charming token inspired by the legendary Pepe the Frog character that has no actual utility beyond collecting and trading. Earlier this year, retail trading giant Robinhood announced that it would be acquiring Bitstamp – which was founded in 2011 in Luxembourg – for $200 million despite getting hit with a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

BONK and DOGE Lag",https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elon-maga-elonmaga-solana-memecoin-to-rally-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-lag/,"Elon MAGA could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-29 23:08:00

The multimodal AI model is thought to be a boon to Amazon’s AWS offering. Additionally, Olympus is expected to reduce Amazon’s reliance on external AI providers while strengthening its own cloud computing service. Amazon’s Olympus can analyze videos Amazon is reportedly working on a new AI tool, Olympus, which could analyze videos, images, and text. AI functionalities software developer, Tibor Blaho, explained in a post on X that the multimodal AI model is designed to help businesses in specific industries. It can reportedly perform tasks like searching through videos using text prompts or automatically analyzing footage in detail. scoop w/ @KevKubernetes : Amazon has developed new generative AI that can process images and video, in addition to text. Amazon could launch the model (code-named Olympus) next week at re:Invent in Las Vegas to lessen its reliance on 3-party models https://t.co/7cwB65zT5T — Anissa Gardizy (@anissagardizy8) November 28, 2024 But, what is Amazon getting out of this AI tool? Well, it is claimed that it will reduce Amazon’s dependency on other AI companies, like Anthropic. Blaho says that an official statement may come during Amazon’s AWS re :Invent conference in the upcoming week. Notably, AWS or Amazon Web Services comes under Amazon which provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs. From the information, we infer that oil and gas companies could use Olympus to analyze drone footage and identify problems with underwater equipment. These inspections are usually long and costly and Olympus might cut the time and cost. Another application is potentially to create sports highlights and analyze archives. Video-related features are something that mainstream AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have not captured. Amazon’s cloud computing customers could benefit from the launch . AWS offerings can benefit from Olympus integration AWS is a pay-as-you-go pricing model that deploys applications globally. It is not only known for applications that scale computing and add various features , it provides security services and AI tools as well . For instance, Amazon’s Olympus could enhance the capabilities of Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock with in-house multimodal capabilities. Its integration with products like SageMaker means building complex applications can become simple. Potentially, developers could access Olympus as a pre-trained model for multimodal tasks. Amazon’s Olympus could be an AI game-changer | Image is AI generated Last year, AI commentator Rowan Cheung reported that Olympus is Amazon’s attempt to enter the competitive generative AI space. Especially when companies in the sector, like NVIDIA, have been making fast-paced advancements in high-speed model training. In September 2023, Deloitte said in a press release that it teamed up with AWS to create Olympus, a cloud accelerator fund. Forrest Danson, principal and global chief commercial officer of the Amazon/AWS alliance, Deloitte Consulting LLP, explained that the partnership would help businesses quickly adopt advanced cloud-based tools and technologies like AI to solve problems. Meanwhile, AI launches continue to hit the markets. Tesla chief Elon Musk is bracing for his artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, to launch an AI-powered gaming studio. Telecommunications company Orange announced a partnership with OpenAI and Meta to develop AI models in regional languages. Amid these offerings, Amazon’s Olympus AI tool could add additional capabilities to the technology sector.

The latest model reportedly outshines OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini models on some specific benchmarks, such as the AIME and MATH tests, which evaluate AI models’ performance in logic puzzles and math problems. Alibaba has made QwQ-32B-Preview for download. According to the retail giant, Alibaba’s new model is capable of tackling complex and intricate problems compared to normal large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5. An article by Benzinga indicates that the QwQ-32B-Preview is one of the few available under a permissive license, enabling users to download and use it. The model is now available on the AI development platform Hugging Face. However, Alibaba released certain components of the model to limit full replication of the model or insights into its working. Alibaba’s latest model boasts 32.5 billion parameters which allows it to handle prompts of up to 32,000 words. With the model’s significant capabilities and semi-open accessibility, Alibaba’s new entrant sets the stage for a transformative leap in AI reasoning technologies. Alibaba’s transparent announcement, which underscores its model’s sophistication, OpenAI has kept its parameter counts under wraps. The coming of this model comes at a time when OpenAI is making significant strides in the AI sector. In October, OpenAI’s valuation jumped to $157 billion following a successful funding round. Earlier this week, SoftBank Group SFTBF reportedly increased its stake in the ChatGPT maker through a $1.5 billion employee share buyout. OpenAI is also said to be exploring the development of its own web browser to challenge Alphabet’s subsidiary Google Chrome browser after pressure coming from the US Department of Justice to divest it. Alibaba admits the model has flaws too Although it possesses some unique strengths, the new model also has limitations. According to the group, QwQ-32B-Preview has issues like unexpected language switches, which could potentially confuse users. The model also underperforms in tasks requiring common-sense reasoning, which is common with many AI systems. According to AutoGPT , the model may get caught in logical loops, delaying responses. Despite its shortcomings, its reasoning capabilities allow it to fact-check itself, therefore cutting on errors but increasing resolution time. By reasoning through tasks and planning steps, Alibaba’s model avoids some pitfalls that affect traditional AI systems. But this approach demands extra time which might limit real-time application. According to Benzinga, QwQ-32B-Preview’ responses align with Chinese regulatory standards , avoiding politically sensitive topics. For example, politically sensitive topics like Taiwan will give responses that are aligned with the Chinese government’s stance. Additionally, prompts about events like Tiananmen Square result in no responses coming up, showing the model’s cautious design. While this might be ideal for the Chinese market, it can also limit its appeal on the global market. However, the model is a significant step into the world of reasoning AI. While its limitations may narrow its global appeal, its other components like logic and semi-open nature makes it a big competitor for OpenAI. According to AutoGPT, QwQ-32B-Preview highlight the potential, and challenges, of this exciting frontier where AI labs across the world are working towards refining reasoning technology.

Amidst the chaos, investors always look for the best crypto to buy today, navigating the noise to uncover hidden gems with explosive potential. While major market players are making headlines, there’s growing buzz around new innovations like Qubetics ($TICS), whose presale has the crypto world sitting up and paying attention. But first, let’s glance at the drama surrounding Binance and SEI’s recent breakout. Then, we’ll dive into why Qubetics could be your ticket to massive returns. This article will break down the latest developments for Qubetics, Binance, and SEI while helping you uncover the best crypto to buy today. Qubetics Wallet: Where Innovation Meets Convenience The Qubetics Wallet is set to revolutionise how we interact with digital assets. Designed for everyday users, it’s all about making crypto management easy, secure, and accessible. Whether you’re on iOS, Android, or a desktop, this wallet offers seamless functionality across platforms , letting you control your $TICS tokens and other digital assets like a pro.

This bold step merges traditional and digital finance, giving users more control and flexibility in their financial lives. It’s not just a wallet; it’s a gateway to your financial future. Binance Faces Whistleblower Allegations and Legal Troubles Binance, one of the biggest names in crypto, is under fire again. A former executive, Amrita Srivastava, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit in the UK, claiming wrongful termination. She alleges she was fired for reporting a colleague who requested a bribe from a customer in exchange for preferential treatment. Binance denies these allegations, stating her dismissal was due to performance issues. Meanwhile, Nigerian authorities have accused Binance of laundering $35.4 million and operating without a license. These controversies could cast a shadow on Binance’s reputation, leaving investors questioning its ethics and long-term stability. SEI’s Meteoric Rise: A 60% Surge and Bullish Momentum SEI has been turning heads with an impressive 60% surge over the past two weeks, driven by strong market interest and bullish momentum. After a slight pullback to the 50% Fibonacci level, the coin has rebounded to $0.5264, marking a 14% gain in just 24 hours. With trading volume hitting $783.84 million and TVL standing at $207.32 million, SEI is clearly on an upward trajectory. However, liquidation risks loom as shorts face increasing pressure. Key resistance at $0.5460 and support at $0.4414 suggest volatility ahead, especially around liquidation clusters. Whether SEI continues its climb or sees a correction, it’s a coin worth keeping on your radar. Qubetics Presale Phase 10 Ending Soon If you’re wondering about the best crypto to buy today, Qubetics is hard to beat. Currently, in Presale Phase 10, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.025, with over $3.6 million already raised. Here’s the kicker: each week, the token price climbs by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike in the final stage. That means the earlier you get in, the more you stand to gain. Let’s talk numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could skyrocket to $10 or even $15 in the future. What does that mean for you? A modest $200 investment at today’s price could turn into a staggering $80,000 at $10 per token—or an eye-popping $195,000 if it hits $15. That’s an ROI of up to 59,900%! With opportunities like this, it’s no wonder Qubetics is making waves as the best crypto to buy today . Conclusion: The Crypto Revolution Awaits In a market full of opportunities, Qubetics, Binance, and SEI are making waves for different reasons. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy today, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out with its innovative wallet, practical payment integrations, and the jaw-dropping ROI potential of its presale.

Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground, preparing for a potential Wave 4 breakout that could take it higher. Algorand (ALGO) is on fire, showcasing a “W” breakout pattern that analysts believe could catapult its price by 300% to $1.26. But stealing the show is Qubetics ($TICS) , the new best crypto presale to buy now, which has already sold over 239 million tokens, raising a jaw-dropping $3.6 million. What makes Qubetics different? It’s not just another token; it’s a solution-driven platform addressing real-world issues that older blockchain systems couldn’t crack. With tools like its Multi-Chain Wallet, Qubetics is setting a new standard for usability, security, and innovation. If you’re hunting for the best opportunities in crypto , here’s everything you need to know about these three projects. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Qubetics is the talk of the town for all the right reasons. At its core lies the Multi-Chain Wallet , a revolutionary tool designed to simplify people’s crypto management. Think of it as a universal remote for your digital assets—seamlessly handling transactions across multiple blockchains without hassle. Imagine you’re a small business owner juggling Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana payments. With Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet, you no longer need to switch between apps or worry about compatibility. It’s all under one roof, making life simpler and more secure. For professionals, this wallet eliminates the headaches of managing diverse portfolios. And for everyday users? It’s the easiest way to send, receive, and store crypto without the steep learning curve. Qubetics isn’t just about innovation—it’s also about delivering massive ROI potential. In its 10th presale stage, the project has sold over 239 million $TICS tokens to 4,800+ holders, raising more than $3.6 million. Priced at $0.0257, this is the new best crypto presale to buy now—especially with a 10% price jump coming this weekend. Analysts are bullish, predicting $TICS will hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS could surge to $1, delivering a 3,787% ROI. If the mainnet launch hits its stride, the token might reach $15—a mind-blowing 58,213% ROI. To put that into perspective, a $4,000 investment at $0.0257 nets you about 155,250 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $15, your $4,000 becomes a staggering $2,328,750. It’s not just an opportunity; it’s a potential financial revolution. No wonder crypto analysts consider it the new best crypto presale to buy now . Cardano (ADA): Waiting for the Wave 4 Breakout Cardano has always been a crowd favourite, and its recent performance keeps investors intrigued. After breaking above $1, ADA is eyeing its next move. Analysts call this a Wave 4 setup—a critical phase where the price consolidates before potentially breaking out. The key support zones to watch are between $0.85 and $0.60, with the most critical level at $0.702. Despite a recent pullback, ADA hasn’t lost its bullish spark. The Fibonacci support levels between $0.88 and $0.778 have held strong, providing a base for the next leg up. What’s exciting is the potential for higher prices. If ADA breaks resistance around $1.14 and $1.12, it could soar to $1.87—a significant leap for holders. But here’s the kicker: the recent pullback from the November 23 high was in three waves rather than five. This opens the door for an upward move, making ADA one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for those seeking medium-term gains. ADA’s current range is a balancing act between risk and reward for traders and investors. If the price dips, support at $0.85 and $0.77 offers potential re-entry points. But if it pushes higher, the upside could be substantial. Algorand (ALGO): Aiming for the Moon with a “W” Breakout Pattern Algorand is catching fire, and it’s easy to see why. The token is trading around $0.30, but a “W” breakout pattern has analysts predicting a 300% rally to $1.26. This classic double-bottom setup often reverses the trend, and ALGO seems primed for liftoff. The critical resistance lies between $0.30 and $0.32. A daily close above this range would validate the bullish pattern, potentially triggering a massive upward move. The projected target of $1.26 isn’t just hype; it’s backed by solid technical analysis. The pattern’s height adds credibility to the prediction, and traders closely monitor volume to confirm the breakout. But there are risks. If ALGO fails to break $0.32, the price could retreat to its $0.15 support level. However, the overall sentiment remains positive, with rising trading volumes indicating strong interest. For those looking at the best cryptos to buy now, ALGO offers an exciting mix of short-term potential and medium-term growth. Seize the Moment with the Best Crypto Opportunities When it comes to the new best crypto presale to buy now, Qubetics is leading the charge. Its Multi-Chain Wallet is a game-changer, and the ROI potential is off the charts. Meanwhile, Cardano is setting up for a Wave 4 breakout that could take it to new highs, and Algorand’s “W” breakout pattern offers an enticing 300% rally target. But time is of the essence. The Qubetics presale is in its final stages, with a price hike just days away. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Secure your $TICS tokens now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. What are you waiting for? Dive in today and make your move before the market does!

As per a November 29 filing, the company reported converting 14,200 ETH into approximately 515 BTC in an open-market deal worth more than $49 million. The Ethereum had been acquired at an average cost of $2,777 per ETH, totaling $39.45 million. Following the transaction, Boyaa now holds 3,183 BTC, with an average purchase price of $57,724 per coin. The company emphasized that the move is in line with its strategy to expand its Bitcoin reserves, considering the market outlook for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. According to the board, converting existing Ether holdings into is a timely decision. In March, Boyaa announced the approval of a $100 million initiative to allocate $45 million of corporate funds to Bitcoin, $45 million to Ethereum, and $10 million to stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed firm disclosed a $1 million investment in the UTXO Management Bitcoin Ecosystem Fund in July.

Notably, the correction has given rise to the formation of a bullish pennant on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. This development might be the bullish momentum needed to eventually break past the $100,000 price threshold. However, the anticipated breakout is not just above $100,000, but a run that would send the cryptocurrency to $145,000. Bullish Pennant Emerges On Bitcoin Price Chart Recent price action in the past 24 hours has seen the Bitcoin price returning to the $96,000 price level after spending the majority of the week on a correction path . Particularly, this correction saw the Bitcoin price hitting a low of $91,000 as many traders took profit. Notably, this back-and-forth movement of the BTC price has given rise to the formation of a small bull pennant. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, known for his technical analyses, pointed out this formation on social media platform X. In his post, he stated , “Small Pennant Big Target,” while pointing to the formation on the 3-day candlestick Bitcoin price chart. A bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that often emerges during strong uptrends. It begins with a sharp price movement (the flagpole), followed by a consolidation phase (the pennant), before potentially breaking out in the same direction as the initial trend. The emergence of this bullish pennant on Bitcoin’s 3-day chart suggests that the cryptocurrency may be gearing up for another leg higher. However, the formation suggests that the Bitcoin price could still continue to consolidate for a while as the liquidity in the pennant is yet to be filled. Nonetheless, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis highlights the longer-term implications of this formation. According to his projections, once Bitcoin completes its consolidation and breaks out of the pennant, it could surge toward an ambitious price target of $145,000. The $145,000 price target has become somewhat recurring among crypto analysts. For instance, this price target also made its way into an analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino, whose analysis pointed to the Bitcoin price top for this cycle at around $145,000. $100,000 Price Target Still In Play At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $96,070 and is up by 0.5% in the past 24 hours but down by 3.3% in the past seven days. The possibility of the Bitcoin price reaching the $100,000 price mark is not a matter of if at this point but of when. Speaking of when, the BTC price is about to witness another catalyst that could finally send it above $100,000. Bitcoin is about to undergo its largest monthly options expiry of 2024 on Friday, involving a total exposure of $13.6 billion. This expiry event could provide the momentum needed for bullish traders to drive Bitcoin’s price past the $100,000 milestone in the coming week.",Bitcoin|analyst|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 00:00:25

Morocco becoming the first African country to support a pro-crypto regulatory framework is big news for the global market and will drive the prices further up. Widespread adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and other front runners could potentially be beneficial to blockchain platforms like Near Protocol (NEAR). However, a new player could see the most out of this surge, IntelMarkets (INTL). Bitcoin Price: $5K Down Since Its ATH Bitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Being the largest crypto ever, Bitcoin’s massive price swings are nothing new. Its finite supply of 21 million coins and secure network has made it a popular store of value and an investment asset often referred to as “digital gold.” As per CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $95,100, a 40% increase since last month. BTC seems to hold onto this upward trajectory due to favorable crypto policies being implemented around the world, together with rising institutional interest. Morocco’s progressive legislation is one example that will aid in BTC adoption in that part of the world. Bitcoin is the go-to long-term investment for many traders because it offers stability like none others. However, its massive market cap of $1.88T means that BTC has a limit on its upside. Many investors are looking to invest in shorter-term, higher-return projects. One of those projects that they’ve turned their heads to is IntelMarkets (INTL), which is becoming the game changer for those who seek higher returns. Near Protocol (NEAR): Struggling To Reach Its Former Glory, Down 3% Near Protocol (NEAR) has made its name in the blockchain world with its focus on scalability, developer accessibility and user friendly applications. It uses a unique sharding technology called “Nightshade” to achieve high throughput and efficiency. NEAR, which is trading at $6.53, has repeatedly failed to recapture its former glory — its ATH of $20.42 in January of 2022. NEAR’s price instability shouldn’t diminish the fact that the token is still a solid choice for long-term investors as its ecosystem expands. With increased decentralized applications and partnership adoption, experts target a conservative $7 by the end of 2024. But since NEAR’s market cap is over $8 billion, explosive growth is far less likely than that of low-cap gems. NEAR is a safe entry for steady gains, but IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a unique opportunity for investors wanting to maximize returns utilizing a brand-new AI-driven approach. IntelMarkets (INTL): Revolutionizing Crypto Trading The project you should be looking out for during the following months is IntelMarkets (INTL). IntelMarkets combines AI, blockchain, and DeFi in one platform, offering traders a hassle free experience. The self learning AI trading bots analyze data at incredible speeds and enable a user to make profits on compelling opportunities across asset classes. The market has been excited by IntelMarkets ’ forward thinking approach, and so it was no surprise that investors have poured over $2.4 million into its presale. Some of INTL’s Key Features: AI Integration: Real-time self-learning bots that learn by optimizing their trading strategies. Dual-Chain Architecture: Scalable and efficient because it supports both Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Low Entry Price: With tokens sold at $0.055, there is plenty of room for early investors to get in. Massive Upside Potential: A top pick for life-changing gains, analysts predict a 75x rally post-launch. Exponential Growth Potential: As a low cap token, IntelMarkets (INTL) is predicted to outperform Bitcoin and NEAR on an upside basis, due to their limitations. Key Takeaways While Bitcoin (BTC) and Near Protocol (NEAR) remain attractive options for long-term investors looking for moderate gains, IntelMarkets (INTL) offers a rare opportunity to achieve life-changing returns. Its cutting-edge AI technology, low entry price, and immense growth potential make it the best investment choice in 2024. With Morocco’s crypto-friendly policy adding fuel to the market, INTL is poised to lead the next wave of innovation and surge.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 00:13:00

If approved, Ripple will be able to issue its stablecoin under a limited-purpose trust charter. This will position the company as a key player in the regulated U.S. digital finance market. The potential launch date is set for December 4, 2024, pending final regulatory approval. Ripple Labs Set to Launch RLUSD Stablecoin as New York Approval Nears According to a recent Fox Business report , Ripple labs is on the verge of receiving approval from New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD. This approval is crucial for Ripple as it seeks to enter the regulated U.S. market for stablecoins. The NYDFS is known for its stringent regulatory standards, ensuring that companies meet high levels of transparency before offering digital assets. Once approved, Ripple will be able to issue RLUSD under a limited-purpose trust charter, a common regulatory pathway for digital asset firms in New York. This regulatory approach allows Ripple to offer stablecoins without the more complex regulatory requirements faced by traditional banks. If all goes as planned, Ripple could launch RLUSD as soon as December 4, 2024. This is a significant step for the company in its pursuit of expanding its offerings in the U.S. digital finance sector. According to a recent report, Ripple Labs is expanding its partnership with Mercy Corps through the “Unlocking Opportunities” program. The initiative will drive the adoption of RLUSD, promoting financial inclusion in cases such as savings, and micropayments. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Aims to Offer Stability More so, Ripple’s stablecoin will provide a stable alternative to XRP, which has been prone to volatility. By being pegged to a stable asset, RLUSD will attract customers seeking a more predictable and reliable digital currency. Stablecoins are typically pegged to assets with stable valuations, such as the U.S. dollar. They also serve as a store of value and help facilitate faster, more cost-effective transactions. Ripple’s move into the stablecoin market places it in direct competition with other established U.S. issuers like Circle, Paxos, and Gemini. Additionally, for the rollout of RLUSD, Ripple labs will collaborate with several well-known payment providers, including Bitstamp, Moonpay, and Uphold. These partnerships will help Ripple expand RLUSD’s reach, offering users more access to payments and remittances. Keith Grossman, president of Enterprise at MoonPay, stated that the launch is a positive development for the stablecoin market. Grossman emphasized, “For another well-capitalized, highly regulated player to enter into the global stablecoin marketplace – especially as MiCA regulation in Europe is about to be implemented – is a win-win and MoonPay is proud to provide access to RLUSD for our partners and customers on day one of Ripple’s launch.” Meanwhile, XRP whales have moved over 139 million coins, sparking speculation as the Ripple Labs vs. SEC lawsuit nears a potential resolution. These large transactions come amid growing optimism that the legal case could favor Ripple, with XRP price rising.

XRP is currently trading above the crucial $1.50 level and is up by more than six percent in the last 24 hours. The altcoin has gained 20 percent in the past week and is now eyeing to break the $1.60 level. As for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is trading above the $97k level and has slipped into the red zone. XRP Continues Bull Run Although many cryptocurrencies move in waves, XRP tends to follow a straight upward trajectory, especially during bull markets. At the moment, XRP is facing some resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If XRP breaks above $1.70, it could easily hit $2 soon. Watch for the breakout above $1.70 to confirm this possibility. Support Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, in case of a pullback, XRP has solid support around $1.25 to $1.30. This range has acted as major support in recent times, so if the price drops, it is likely to bounce back from there. Short-Term Outlook: Breakout and Resistance XRP has successfully broken out from a triangle pattern. Although the breakout was slightly delayed, it is now heading towards the target price of $1.77. Short-term resistance may appear around $1.70, but once that level is cleared, XRP is expected to continue its upward movement. Previous Resistance Becomes Support The breakout above $1.50-$1.51 marks a significant shift. Once this resistance level was cleared, XRP’s price surged higher. Now, those previous resistance levels should act as new support. Watch for support around $1.62 to $1.63, and further support around $1.56 or $1.50 if the price pulls back.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 00:25:03

However, to make your experience as comfortable as possible, it’s essential to approach it with thoughtful preparation and strategic choices. One of the most important steps is choosing the right platform. While there are countless crypto-gambling sites available, not all offer the same level of security, fairness, or user experience. Look for platforms with verified licenses, strong reputations, and provably fair gaming systems. Additionally, ensure the platform supports the cryptocurrencies you intend to use and provides responsive customer support for any potential issues. For those seeking fair gaming, diverse gaming options, access to multiple cryptocurrencies, and enticing extras like bonuses and other freebies, this list of crypto casinos is an excellent place to start. These platforms have been curated to offer a secure and enjoyable gambling experience, catering to both newcomers and seasoned players. Although being web-based platforms, they’re fully compliant with international security and payment standards, and licensed accordingly. But starting with these activities without a clear expenditure plan can be a slippery slope. Hence, managing your budget effectively is another key to a comfortable experience. Set a clear gambling budget in advance and stick to it. This not only prevents financial stress but also ensures that the activity remains enjoyable. Many crypto platforms offer tools like deposit limits or self-exclusion options to help you stay in control. Take advantage of these features if they can enhance your comfort. Familiarizing yourself with the games is equally important. Before diving in, spend some time understanding the rules and strategies of your chosen games. Many platforms offer demo versions that allow you to practice without risking your funds. Whether it’s poker, slots, or sports betting, having a solid grasp of the gameplay can enhance your confidence and reduce frustration. Another essential tip is to ensure privacy and security. Use a reliable crypto wallet to manage your funds, preferably one with robust security features like two-factor authentication. Avoid sharing sensitive information and be cautious of phishing attempts . Some users prefer gambling anonymously; if that’s a priority for you, choose platforms that don’t require extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. Staying updated on cryptocurrency trends can also make your experience smoother. Crypto values can fluctuate significantly, so being aware of market conditions helps you plan deposits and withdrawals strategically. Keeping an eye on transaction fees is similarly important, as these can vary depending on network congestion. Finally, prioritize platforms with a user-friendly interface. A cluttered or confusing design can make the experience frustrating, while intuitive navigation and helpful tutorials can enhance your enjoyment. By carefully selecting your platform, managing your funds, and staying informed, you can make crypto gambling a comfortable and rewarding experience.

Despite the resistance, the HBAR price at press time was trading at $0.1823, a 25% surge from the intra-day low. During the rally, HBAR’s trading volume and market capitalization soared by 261% and 25% respectively, reaching $954.36 million and $6.92 billion. Hedera (HBAR) Price Jumps 25% Hedera (HBAR) price has displayed strong upward momentum, reinforced by technical indicators suggesting continued bullish trends after skyrocketing over 25%. The HBAR price recently crossed both its 50-day (SMA 50) and 200-day (SMA 200) simple moving averages, forming a “golden cross”. The SMA 50 is currently at $0.07545, while the SMA 200 is positioned at $0.07169, both well below the current price. HBAR/USD price chart (Source: TradingView) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for HBAR has reached 78.56, nearing the overbought zone of 80. This suggests strong buying activity but also indicates a potential price consolidation as traders may take profits. However, analysts remain optimistic, with one Javon Marks forecasting a possible rally to $0.504, representing a 192% increase from current levels. Increased Market Activity Boosts Investor Confidence HBAR’s price rally has been accompanied by heightened trading activity and open interest, indicating growing market participation. Trading volume surged by 261% to $954.36 million in 24 hours, while open interest grew by 48.26% to $208.25 million. This increase suggests that new capital is entering the market, which could support sustained upward price movement. According to More Crypto Online, HBAR’s current movement aligns with Elliott Wave theory, suggesting one more high is likely in the short term. Analysts are monitoring key resistance levels at $0.176, $0.20, and $0.23. A breakout above these levels could further validate the bullish trend. Federal Reserve Collaboration Fuels Positive Sentiment HBAR’s recent price surge is also being supported by its growing role in blockchain-based federal payment systems. Hedera is integrated into the Federal Reserve’s FedNow payment platform through Dropp, enabling real-time payments with increased efficiency and security. In addition, Ripple (XRP), which has partnered with Hedera for USD transactions, is expected to receive regulatory approval to launch its RLUSD stablecoin in December 2024. This partnership could enhance interoperability between Hedera and Ripple, further bolstering HBAR’s adoption in the payments sector. Concurrently, HBAR traders are also optimistic due to speculation about the potential approval of a Hedera exchange-traded fund (ETF) submitted by Canary Capital to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Data from CoinGecko shows that XRP beat Binance Coin (BNB) in terms of market capitalization, with XRP having a market capitalization of $100 billion above BNB’s $94 billion. This surge puts XRP in the elite $100 billion club. Currently valued at $1.74, XRP has risen by 17% in the last 24 hours and a stunning 200% in the past month, its best showing since December 2017. The cryptocurrency has continued to surge, reaching $1.7, a price it last touched in April of 2021. Currently, XRP is trailing behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Solana (SOL). On the daily chart, the XRP shows a steep upward trend from $0.50 to $1.72 in a parabolic trend this month. The RSI stands at 88.09, indicating that the asset is overbought, while the MACD at 0.25022 points towards the buying pressure. Support levels are at $1.40 and $1.50 while major resistance levels are at $1.80. A pullback to the $1.50 area, accompanied by a bullish breakout, could be a decent entry opportunity, with the price rallying above $1.80 if volume remains on the rise. Speculations surrounding changes within the US Security and Exchange Commission have boosted investor confidence. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch in December Ripple Labs is making headlines again with its RLUSD stablecoin, a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that is overcollaterized. According to sources , the New York Department of Financial Services is expected to provide its green light to the stablecoin as early as December, which may lead to the trading of the token. Ripple first unveiled its plans to launch the RLUSD in April 2024 as a way of challenging other stablecoins such as USDC and USDT. The company has forecast that the stablecoin market will be $2 trillion by 2028. The pilot of RLUSD was launched in August on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet, with the intention of adding more blockchains. Ripple has also ensured it partners with exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, and other exchanges that support RLUSD. CEO of Ripple Brad Garlinghouse reiterated the company’s commitment to using assets such as XRP to enhance the use cases of the stablecoin.

Launched in April 2023, Pepe Coin quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts. The coin, inspired by the popular internet meme, saw an incredible surge in its value shortly after its debut. If you had invested $100 in Pepe Coin at its launch, you would have seen that investment skyrocket to over $1.6 million during its peak in May 2023. When considering new coins to invest in, several factors should come into play. A coin’s online presence is one of the most important aspects to examine. How a project markets itself online can make a significant difference in its success. SEO cryptocurrency tactics are essential for boosting visibility and reaching the right audience. Projects with optimized websites, strong community engagement on social media, and high-quality content tend to attract more attention. Other factors include the team behind the project, its roadmap, and the utility of the coin itself. Pepe Coin’s success was largely driven by its community. Meme coins often rely heavily on online culture and viral trends, and Pepe Coin was no different. The coin’s developers leveraged the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme, creating a narrative that resonated with a niche audience. Community-driven campaigns on platforms like Twitter and Reddit helped the coin gain momentum. The sense of camaraderie and humor in these online spaces attracted more investors, fueling the coin’s rapid rise. However, the coin’s success was short-lived. By mid-2023, Pepe Coin’s value began to decline, and the hype surrounding it faded. By November 2024, the coin’s price had dropped significantly, leaving many late investors with losses. This cycle is common with meme coins, where the initial buzz often leads to unsustainable valuations. Investors who entered early and exited during the peak benefited the most, while others faced the downside of market volatility. The rise and fall of Pepe Coin underlines the importance of timing in cryptocurrency investments. Early adopters often see the greatest returns, but this comes with high risks. The speculative nature of meme coins means they can lose value as quickly as they gain it. Pepe Coin serves as a reminder for investors to approach such opportunities cautiously and be prepared for the risks involved. While the case of Pepe Coin is fascinating, it also highlights the speculative nature of meme coins. Unlike projects with strong utility or innovative blockchain solutions, meme coins often lack long-term sustainability. Their value is typically tied to social trends and online buzz, which can fade quickly. Looking at the broader crypto market, projects with robust foundations tend to perform better over time. Utility, team credibility, and a well-defined roadmap are critical for long-term success. While meme coins like Pepe can offer massive short-term gains, they are not a substitute for projects with solid use cases. Ethereum , for instance, has grown consistently because of its role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Pepe Coin’s story is a cautionary tale for both seasoned investors and newcomers. It shows the potential for high rewards in crypto but also the risks of chasing hype-driven assets. For those considering new investments, focusing on projects with a strong online presence, community engagement, and clear objectives is essential.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 232,200 followers on the social media platform X that Sei ( SEI ) looks bullish after breaking out of a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart. A rounding bottom formation is a bullish reversal structure suggesting that an asset is ready to witness a new uptrend. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “Fundamentals-wise, I think there needs to be a bit more built on there for people to gamble on but all in all, it looks really good for higher. Grabbing a bag a bit lower if it comes. Something like $0.60 would be a decent entry in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, SEI is worth $0.66. Another altcoin on the trader’s radar is the smart contract platform Fantom ( FTM ). According to the crypto strategist, FTM looks solid for long-term investors given its strong fundamentals. He also says the coin looks bullish after breaking out from a multi-month accumulation period. “FTM: there’s a lot to like with this chart and project IMO (in my opinion): -Andre [Cronje] cracked dev -high float/not as much sell pressure from VCs (venture capitalists) -Sonic rebrand coming that hits all the narratives -chart-wise, almost a two-year accumulation period followed by some big moves and clean levels. I’m in. Don’t really recommend you buy at this current level, to be frank, but I think that buying any dips is a good thing. Still believe that this is a pretty decent one to hold if you’re looking for older 2021 movers that have high float/supply out (others like AVAX might be considered).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FTM is facing one big resistance level at $1.10. At time of writing, FTM is trading at $1.00. Looking at fellow layer-1 (L1) protocol Near ( NEAR ), the trader shares a chart suggesting that the altcoin may target its resistance at $8.29 after moving above $6.50. “NEAR has pretty slow grinding price action and isn’t really a great active trade right now. That said, I do think that this hits a lot of narratives for this cycle in terms of AI (artificial intelligence) and L1. Would like to see more growth on there / more degen stuff but I do have a bag of this.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X NEAR is trading at $6.97 at time of writing.

Each day starts with new shifts in the bull market. The current session witnesses the BTC price reclaiming its previous price of $96,000. Ripple, which had been struggling for most of the year, has gained strength with the XRP token surging amid the spot XRP ETF buzz. These changes have been quite notable in the crypto space. Yet, DTX Exchange grabs the limelight with its massive ROI. Experts reveal that the DTX token is poised to give a 1021% rally in this session benefitting the investors. BTC Price Revisits $96k On Fed Rate Cut Expectations On Wednesday, US economic indicators fueled bets on a December Fed rate cut. The Core PCE Price Index rose 0.3% month-on-month in October, mirroring September’s increase. However, year-on-year, the Core PCE Price Index increased to 2.8% in October, up from 2.7% in September. The October figures suggested a sticky inflation environment. Nevertheless, the chances of a Fed rate cut increased on Wednesday, boosting demand for US BTC-spot ETFs and BTC price surge. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a Fed rate cut rose from 59.4% on November 26 to 64.8% on November 27. On Wednesday, BTC price gained 4.32%, reversing a 1% loss from Tuesday, closing at $95,883. BTC price trends hinge on Trump’s nominations and BTC-spot ETF market flows. Pro-crypto nominations for the SEC and CFTC Chairs bolster expectations of BTC becoming a strategic reserve asset, potentially boosting BTC price and demand. XRP-Spot ETF Applications Signal Seismic Demand Shift For Ripple An XRP-spot ETF market could materially boost Ripple’s demand, potentially driving it toward the January 2018 all-time high of $3.5505. The US BTC-spot ETF market offers a precedent, with BTC surging by 113%, advancing from $46,742 (January 11, 2024) to an all-time high of $99,318 (November 22, 2024). Speculation about President-elect Donald Trump potentially appointing a pro-crypto SEC Chair has fueled expectations for an XRP-spot ETF market. Since SEC Chair Gensler’s resignation announcement, investors are also betting on the SEC withdrawing its appeal against rulings in the Ripple case. If the SEC withdraws its appeal, the Programmatic sales of the Ripple ruling would set a crucial legal precedent. This could pave the way to an XRP-spot ETF market. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP did not satisfy the third prong of the Howey Test. On Wednesday, November 27, XRP rallied 5.17% to close at $1.4711, reversing Tuesday’s 1.17% loss. Significantly, Ripple ended a four-day losing streak while tracking the broader crypto market, which gained 4.89%. An SEC Chair favoring the end to ongoing legal battles with crypt firms could drive XRP toward $2. However, Ripple must move through the November 23, 2024, high of $1.6299 to target the May 2021 high of $1.8171 and $2. DTX Exchange (DTX): Trading Revolution Raises $8.8 Million DTX Exchange (DTX) is the latest project with the potential to redefine the global trading industry by combining the best centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges into one place. DTX enables access to over 120,000 asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities, all on a unified layer for a wallet system built on the Layer-1 blockchain. This is an innovative approach that fuses TradFi and DeFi, making DTX Exchange stand out. Based on Ethereum and Solana protocols, the DTX token is currently priced at $0.10 during its fifth round, having sold nearly 80% of the tokens available. Once they’ve been sold out, the price will increase to $0.12, marking a 20% for early investors. Having already raised $8,850,000 in presale, DTX Exchange is one of the most hyped investments today. Key Takeaways The BTC price recovers its lost momentum and crosses the $96,000 level once more. On the flip side, Ripple surges in tandem with XRP-spot ETF. However, after a 1021% surge, DTX Exchange is still unstoppable in this bull run. The platform raises over $8.85 million!

Whale Moves Signal Big Rally Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-10-within-reach-for-cardano-whale-moves-signal-big-rally-ahead/,"Cardano (ADA) has achieved a significant milestone by breaking past the $1 barrier , a level that appeared unattainable for the majority of 2023. The cryptocurrency’s recent price surge has captivated the attention of both analysts and investors, as it has been unable to overcome this psychological level for years. Although the token has recently experienced some price consolidation, analysts anticipate that this is merely the commencement of a much more substantial rally. Cardano: Consolidation Phase ADA’s momentum weakened after it crossed the $1 threshold, and it has been hovering just below this mark. Cardano has entered a phase of consolidation around the $0.99 to $1.00 range, contrary to the expectations of many investors who anticipated that the rally would persist. While this may appear to be a temporary setback, analyst Dan Gambardello has a different perspective. He perceives this consolidation as a positive indicator of redistribution, a prerequisite for the ADA to continue its upward trajectory. For years through the bear market, many didn’t think $ADA would ever hit $1 again. Many holders have been waiting to sell at $1. Now that we’ve reached $1, it’s great to see a consolidation and redistribution. After this phase is over, Cardano can focus on $5 and $10. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) November 27, 2024 Gambardello anticipates that Cardano may pursue significantly higher price points after this segment concludes, potentially achieving a range of $5 to $10. Increase In Whale Activities The increase in whale activity during Cardano’s latest performance is among the most fascinating features. ADA whales have been rapidly rising their numbers over the last few weeks, particularly following the token’s $1 breakthrough. According to reports, over 130 million ADA tokens are owned by millionaires, and that exceeds over 3.2 billion. Such accumulation is taken as a strong vote for the token, which would keep the price going high. Despite profit-taking, the ADA adoption has kept its positive optimism. Whale Appetite Up As Bitcoin approaches $100,000, there is a transition in focus to other cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano. The market capitalization of ADA has increased by more than 30% in the past week, reaching an impressive $35 billion. Because of the rise in whale activity and the possibility of a good regulatory environment, investors are very optimistic about Cardano’s future. The level of excitement has also been raised by rumors about Cardano’s founder and possible partnerships with incoming US President Donald Trump. Although these factors are still considered speculative, they contribute to the increasing conviction that Cardano may achieve new price milestones in the near future. Cardano’s most recent performance has demonstrated that it is once again competitive. ADA may soon achieve new heights due to the expanding market sentiment and robust whale support. The $5 to $10 price range may appear to be an ambitious goal; however, it is now feasible with the appropriate catalysts.

The amount of money tied up in criticized loans, which show emerging signs of risk and weakness that could lead to defaults, just reached its highest level since 2020, reports S&P Global. JPMorgan Chase has witnessed the largest year-over-year increase, with the number of criticized loans at the firm jumping 26.3%, reaching $26.01 billion at the end of Q3. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has recorded a 17.9% year-on-year increase in criticized loans, at $37.6 billion, while Bank of America recorded a 15.2% year-on-year increase, at $26.06 billion. That brings the total amount of the criticized loans at the trio of banks to $89.67 billion since Q3 of 2023, reflecting a trend that’s playing out at banks across the board. “Criticized loans at public US banks amounted to $279.98 billion, versus $240.37 billion at the end of 2023, and such loans at the 100 largest US public banks totaled $260.48 billion, versus $219.82 billion at 2023-end.” Among tier-one banks with over $50 billion in total assets, four lenders recorded triple-digit increases in criticized loans. Flagstar Financial recorded a 338.6% year-on-year increase in criticized loans while First Horizon, Valley National Bancorp and Webster Financial Corp witnessed 112.2%, 110.1% and 102.8% year-on-year increases in criticized loans.

Institutional adoption is skyrocketing, with big names like BlackRock and Fidelity stepping into the game by launching Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs have already amassed a staggering $52 billion in assets under management as of 2024, and recent U.S. election results saw a jaw-dropping $2.6 billion inflow in just a few days. It’s now seemingly obvious that Bitcoin isn’t just some fringe asset—it’s the future of investment. With all the interest in Bitcoin blowing up, there has been a bigger demand for reliable tools to manage cryptocurrency. The best bitcoin wallet for iOS users is designed to meet this need. The interface is easy and very intuitive, plus it has loads of handy features. This is why the app makes buying and selling Bitcoin a breeze. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, these apps provide all the functionality you need to handle your crypto with confidence. But it’s not just Wall Street that’s taking Bitcoin seriously. State governments are getting in on the action too. Colorado and Louisiana now accept Bitcoin for tax payments , and Ohio is considering similar legislation. Meanwhile, state pension funds are diving in, with Wisconsin’s investment board holding a hefty $99 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Even Florida’s Chief Financial Officer has proposed adding Bitcoin to the state’s pension portfolio. For individual investors, staying ahead in this rapidly evolving landscape requires the right tools. That’s where the crypto wallet apps truly stands out. Non-custodial wallets allow you to have full control of your assets. No one can freeze your funds or block transactions. Plus, its multi-chain support makes swapping cryptocurrencies across different blockchains lightning-fast and stress-free. This is why you’ve probably seen a lot more wallet app developers designing their apps to make crypto management straightforward and accessible, even for those new to the space. More people use Bitcoin, its not just about institutions investing in Bitcoin. Everyday users are getting more involved, driven by the convenience of modern apps . The app is really simple but it doesn’t skimp on power. With it, you’ll get everything from secure storage to seamless transactions, plus a whole lot more. Why does this matter? Well, as more people adopt Bitcoin, having a wallet that’s both reliable and versatile is becoming a necessity. The momentum behind Bitcoin is undeniable. With record-breaking ETF inflows and increasing support from state governments, it’s cementing its place as a major financial asset. This shift is creating a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, pushing demand for tools like Best Wallet that make it easy for anyone to participate. As Bitcoin’s role in finance grows, being prepared with the right tools will be the key to navigating this exciting new era.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s jaw-dropping success, they’ve flipped the script on traditional crypto investing. And now, a new star is stealing the show: BTFD Coin . With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming platform, staking rewards, and an ever-growing community, this coin is poised to redefine what meme coins are all about. Launched on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin didn’t just tiptoe into the meme coin space—it kicked the door wide open. Within the first 24 hours of its presale, it had completed nearly 25% of its journey through 16 presale stages, raising a whopping $150,000. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential, with its presale price of $0.00005 expected to hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. Could this be the best meme coin to invest in today? Let’s dive deeper and find out. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Raising the Bar BTFD Coin isn’t your average meme coin. Sure, it’s got the humour and community-driven vibes you’d expect, but it’s packing some serious utility under the hood. Think P2E gaming, staking rewards, and even a roadmap designed to make early investors a fortune. Since its presale launched at $0.000004 per coin , the momentum has been unstoppable. Fast forward to Stage 5, and the price now stands at $0.00005 per coin, with over 10 billion coins sold. Investors are piling in, eager to snag what could be the best meme coin to invest in today . In just a few days, the presale has raised over $295,000, proving that the hype isn’t just noise—it’s real. Let’s talk numbers. Imagine you invested $4,000 in Stage 5 at $0.00005 per coin. That would bag you 80 million BTFD Coins. Now, when the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would be worth a cool $48,000. That’s the kind of ROI dreams are made of. What sets BTFD apart is its vision for the future. While most meme coins ride on fleeting trends, BTFD is building an ecosystem that thrives on utility. With its P2E game just around the corner and staking rewards offering passive income, it’s not hard to see why investors are flocking to it. And let’s not forget the FOMO factor. With only 16 presale stages, the clock’s ticking to get in early. Apu Apustaja: The Underdog Meme Coin You Need to Know About Move over, Dogecoin—Apu Apustaja is here to claim its throne. Inspired by the iconic internet meme, Apu Apustaja taps into nostalgia while carving out its niche in the crypto world. But can it compete with heavyweights like BTFD Coin? Apu’s charm lies in its community. Built on a decentralised ethos, it’s all about inclusivity and grassroots growth. But what’s its edge? For starters, it’s rolling out an NFT marketplace where users can trade Apu-themed digital assets. It’s a bold move, but will it be enough to make Apu Apustaja the best meme coin to invest in today ? The coin’s price action has been volatile, to say the least. After launching at $0.000002, it saw a brief surge to $0.000009 before retracing to $0.000005. Some call it a buying opportunity, others a red flag. Regardless, Apu’s roadmap is ambitious. It plans to integrate with DeFi platforms and even launch a play-to-earn game by Q2 2025. Here’s the kicker: Apu Apustaja is all about the underdog narrative. It thrives on community support, making it a wildcard in the meme coin race. While it doesn’t have the immediate ROI appeal of BTFD Coin, it’s got a loyal following that could propel it to new heights. If you’re willing to take a risk, Apu might just surprise you. Cat in a Dog’s World: The Meme Coin with a Twist If the name doesn’t grab you, the concept will. Cat in a Dog’s World is a satirical take on the meme coin craze, flipping the script with its feline-first narrative. But don’t let the humour fool you; this coin means business. Launching at $0.000003, Cat in a Dog’s World has already seen a 40% increase in its market cap within its first week. Its appeal lies in its simplicity. No overcomplicated utility, no grandiose promises—just a meme coin that’s unashamedly fun. And sometimes, that’s all it takes. What’s unique about Cat in a Dog’s World is its “Clawback Program.” A portion of every transaction is redistributed to holders, creating a passive income stream. It’s a clever way to keep investors engaged while incentivising long-term holding. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, with price predictions targeting $0.00002 by mid-2025. But let’s be real—can Cat in a Dog’s World compete with the likes of BTFD Coin? Probably not. While it’s a fun addition to any crypto portfolio, it lacks the robust ecosystem and ROI potential that make BTFD the best meme coin to invest in today . Still, for those looking to diversify, it’s a quirky option that’s worth considering. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that meme coins are far from being a passing fad. They’re evolving, innovating, and offering investors opportunities that traditional cryptocurrencies simply can’t match. Among the contenders, BTFD Coin stands out as the frontrunner. Its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support make it the best meme coin to invest in today. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a first-time investor, this is one opportunity you don’t want to miss. Ready to join the meme coin revolution? Don’t wait too long—the BTFD presale is heating up, and the best deals won’t last forever. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your stake in the next big thing in crypto.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 01:20:00

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity, and for good reason. Robert Kiyosaki’s bold $500,000 Bitcoin prediction for 2025 has reignited investor confidence, while Fantom has surged past the $1 mark, positioning itself as a DeFi powerhouse. As these projects steal the spotlight, a rising star, Qubetics ($TICS), is quietly but confidently changing the game with its innovative solutions and impressive presale performance. For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, these are the best cryptos to watch in the fast-evolving crypto landscape. Qubetics is solving real-world problems with its revolutionary Web3 aggregator and user-friendly QubeQode IDE. Unlike its predecessors, which often alienated users with complexity, Qubetics is breaking barriers, making blockchain accessible to all. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned trader, the $TICS token offers a promising opportunity that blends innovation, usability, and potentially life-changing returns. Let’s dive deeper into what makes Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Fantom the best cryptos to watch right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Web3 with a User-Friendly Twist If you’ve been searching for a cryptocurrency project that combines cutting-edge technology with practical usability, Qubetics is your answer. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is setting new standards in the blockchain space. Its flagship feature, the QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is a game-changer, designed to simplify Web3 development. Think of it as the Google Docs of blockchain—a platform so intuitive that even a novice can build and deploy smart contracts without a hitch. Imagine this: a small business owner wants to integrate blockchain for supply chain tracking but lacks the technical know-how. With QubeQode IDE, they can create a smart contract with just a few clicks, ensuring transparency and efficiency without hiring an expensive developer. This ease of use is why Qubetics is attracting thousands of token holders, with over 4,800 investors already onboard. The presale’s numbers speak for themselves. Now in its tenth stage, Qubetics has sold over 239 million tokens, raising a jaw-dropping $3.6 million. At just $0.025 per token, early adopters are seizing the opportunity before the price surges by 10% this weekend. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering an 871% ROI. Post-presale, projections skyrocket, with $TICS potentially reaching $5 for a staggering 19,337% ROI. A mere $1 investment today could grow into $58,213 after Qubetics’ mainnet launch. Bitcoin (BTC): Can Kiyosaki’s $500K Prediction Come True? Bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrencies, and its reign shows no signs of slowing down. Robert Kiyosaki’s recent forecast of Bitcoin hitting $500,000 by 2025 has turned heads across the financial world. According to Kiyosaki, institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and increasing demand are all aligning to create the perfect storm for Bitcoin’s next massive bull run. With Bitcoin’s recent surge nearing $100,000, it’s not hard to imagine this prediction coming true. But what does it mean for everyday investors? Let’s consider Kiyosaki’s prediction in numbers. If you invest $1 in Bitcoin today and it climbs to $500,000, your dollar could grow exponentially, especially if purchased during a dip. Of course, Bitcoin’s price movements can be wild, but for long-term believers, the upside is hard to ignore. Bitcoin’s story isn’t just about price—it’s about resilience and adoption. Major corporations like Tesla and Square are embracing Bitcoin, while countries like El Salvador are building their economies around it. For those eyeing the best cryptos to watch, Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader. And with experts like Chamath Palihapitiya and Mike Novogratz echoing Kiyosaki’s optimism, the future looks brighter than ever. Fantom (FTM): DeFi’s Rising Star While Bitcoin grabs the headlines and Qubetics dazzles with innovation, Fantom quietly proves its worth in the world of decentralised finance (DeFi). Fantom’s recent surge past $1 is a testament to its growing utility and investor confidence. Unlike the speculative rallies of 2021, this price movement is underpinned by real-world applications and a robust ecosystem. Fantom’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at an impressive $131.01 million, a clear indicator of its active DeFi participation. Its ecosystem thrives on stability, thanks to its $320.62 million stablecoin market cap. These numbers highlight a maturing blockchain that prioritises security and efficiency—qualities that DeFi enthusiasts value deeply. Price predictions for Fantom are equally promising. Analysts suggest that if the current momentum continues, FTM could easily break new resistance levels, offering substantial returns for investors. For those looking at the best cryptos to watch, Fantom is more than just a contender—it’s a DeFi powerhouse ready to redefine the space. Seize the Moment with the Best Cryptos to Watch The cryptocurrency market is teeming with opportunities, but the clock is ticking. Each project offers unique advantages, catering to a diverse range of investors and traders. Qubetics stands out with its presale success and groundbreaking tools like QubeQode IDE, making blockchain more accessible than ever. Bitcoin’s journey to $500,000 might sound ambitious, but with growing institutional interest, it’s a target worth betting on. Meanwhile, Fantom’s rise past $1 signals the dawn of a new era for DeFi enthusiasts. Qubetics’ presale won’t last forever, and Bitcoin and Fantom are only getting stronger. The best cryptos to watch today could shape your financial future tomorrow.

After a strong bullish run in recent weeks, the recent pullback appears to be a temporary pause in an upward trend. Crucial on-chain data supports this outlook, indicating robust network activity that reinforces the bullish sentiment for ADA. Key metrics shared by IntoTheBlock reveal over 840,000 transactions recorded on the Cardano network, with total fees amounting to 279,000 ADA. This data underscores growing usage and demand for the Cardano blockchain, adding to its fundamental strength. Such network activity often correlates with price appreciation, suggesting that ADA could soon maintain its momentum. As ADA consolidates above $1 , the market will closely monitor whether it can hold this key level and push higher. Investors and analysts are optimistic, citing the network’s increasing adoption and solid transaction metrics as critical factors driving its bullish outlook. The next few weeks could be pivotal for Cardano, with a sustained move above $1 likely signaling the continuation of its upward trend. Cardano Activity Growing Cardano is trading at multi-year highs and looks poised to continue its impressive rally. After breaking through the critical $1 level at the start of this bull run, ADA has shown strong momentum, driven by increasing adoption and investor confidence. On-chain data shared by IntoTheBlock analyst C Thumbs highlights significant milestones, signaling sustained growth in the Cardano ecosystem. The latest data reveals that Cardano recently surpassed 840,000 transactions, with total fees reaching 279,000 ADA. Notably, the last time transaction volumes and fees were this high was in March 2022. This resurgence reflects the growing utility of the Cardano blockchain, transitioning from being primarily speculative to demonstrating real-world value. A closer look at holder trends further underscores this shift. From July 2022 until today, ADA has seen sustained growth in the number of holders, indicating increasing confidence in the blockchain’s long-term potential. Unlike previous cycles, where ADA’s price movements were driven primarily by speculation, the current rally appears underpinned by tangible network activity and adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Above $90K – On-Chain Data Reveals Key Demand Levels As Cardano continues to gain traction, investors are focusing on the next significant supply level. With robust network activity and bullish sentiment prevailing, ADA appears ready to target new highs, reinforcing its status as a leading blockchain in the crypto space. ADA Testing Crucial Supply Cardano has experienced a remarkable 250% rally in less than a month, showcasing strong bullish momentum as it gains traction in the market. Currently trading at $1.06, ADA is approaching its yearly high of $1.15, a crucial resistance level that could define its next price trajectory. If ADA successfully breaks above the $1.15 level, it could open the door to a significant rally targeting the next supply zones at $1.25 and potentially $1.60. Such a breakout would signal renewed investor confidence and sustained demand, further solidifying Cardano’s position as one of the most dynamic assets in the crypto space during this cycle. However, there is a risk of further consolidation below the $1.15 mark. If ADA fails to hold momentum at this critical level, the price may pull back to test support at $1.00 or lower. Such a scenario could indicate a temporary pause in the uptrend, allowing investors and traders to reassess the market conditions. As Cardano trades near these pivotal levels, market participants will closely monitor its price action to determine whether the rally can extend or if consolidation will define the short-term outlook for this rapidly rising altcoin.

In a recent post, he stated that FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) could benefit investors as Bitcoin price approaches the $100,000 mark. Kiyosaki, a strong advocate for alternative assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, warned that holders of traditional fiat currencies risk missing out. He believes that as BTC nears the $100,000 milestone, only the ultra-wealthy will be able to afford significant holdings. Robert Kiyosaki Warns: FOMO is Key as Bitcoin Nears $100K In a recent tweet , Robert Kiyosaki highlighted his view that Bitcoin will soon surpass the $100,000 mark. He emphasized that once BTC hits this price point, it will become increasingly difficult for the middle class to invest in significant amounts. Kiyosaki argued that those holding traditional fiat currencies like the dollar, euro, or yen will lose out as Bitcoin becomes more accessible only to the ultra-wealthy. Robert Kiyosaki has long been a critic of fiat currencies and advocates for alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He has been consistent in his stance that Bitcoin offers an opportunity to protect wealth in a way that traditional currencies cannot. With Bitcoin price approaching new highs, Kiyosaki has advised those hesitant about Bitcoin to reconsider and embrace the “FOMO” mentality. He suggested that this fear of missing out could drive more investors toward the crypto, benefiting those who act early. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author emphasized, “The horse will be out of the barn and running. Why? Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000 only the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO is good. Don’t be left behind!” Kiyosaki Criticizes Fiat Savings According to Robert Kiyosaki, those who save in cash or hold fiat currencies are “losers,” as he calls them, due to the devaluation brought on by inflation. He reiterated this message in his recent posts, where he underscored the importance of diversifying into assets like Bitcoin. His argument rests on the view that inflation and government monetary policies will continue to erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies. As the Bitcoin price continues to rise, he forecasts that it will soon reach $100,000 and beyond. He pointed out that once this milestone is achieved, it will be almost impossible for most people to catch up. Kiyosaki added, “Savers are losers…because cash is trash. Bitcoin will soon break $100,000. Once Bitcoin passes $100,000 it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up.” In addition to his commentary on the Bitcoin price, Robert Kiyosaki praised Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, for his Bitcoin strategy. Kiyosaki referred to Saylor as a “genius” for utilizing the company’s treasury to purchase billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. He believes that Saylor’s approach strengthened MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $96,400, following a recent rebound from a low of $91,000 earlier in the week. The cryptocurrency has shown strong resilience, with analysts predicting a BTC rally toward $100,000 soon.

Currently, the XRP chart highlights distinct patterns in market behaviour, suggesting that historical price action may be repeating itself. The analyst predicts that if the cryptocurrency can successfully replicate these bullish historical patterns, it could trigger an upward surge for XRP. XRP Price Patterns Signal Bullish Potential Richard, the crypto analyst on TradingView, popularly known as ‘The Signalyst,’ has declared that history is repeating itself in the XRP price chart. The analyst shared a detailed analytical report on XRP, predicting its future target while examining critical aspects of its current price action. According to Richard, the XRP 4-hour chart reveals an intriguing pattern characterised by lower lows and a sharp bullish impulse. The two red arrows labeled “LL” on the price chart indicate areas where the XRP price made lower lows mid-November, signaling a correction or a trend reversal. This downward trend was quickly followed by a period of consolidation within a defined range seen in the green zone on the chart. After experiencing lower lows and bearish momentum , Richard pinpointed that the XRP price entered a corrective phase, stabilizing within the aforementioned green zone. Eventually, XRP broke above this green resistance range, triggering a bullish impulse that pushed the cryptocurrency to its previous price high of $1.5. Although the XRP price has corrected again and was trading at around $1.4 earlier this week, Richard has highlighted that the cryptocurrency seems to be repeating the above historical set-up. Its price has entered a new consolidation phase just below the $1.53 level, signaling the start of its next bullish movement . Should the XRP price repeat this pattern and break above the $1.53 threshold, the analyst suggests that this would validate XRP’s anticipated bullish impulse position and pave the way for a potential rally toward the $2 psychological level. Analyst Labels XRP At $1.4 A Bargain Buy Steph, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has called the XRP price a bargain buy at $1.4. Following its surge above $1.5 earlier this month, the XRP price witnessed a slight trend reversal, pushing it down to $1.4. Steph disclosed that the $1.4 XRP price was a prime buying opportunity for investors, as a breakout to the upside was about to begin. Concerning the predicted breakout, it seems the analyst was spot on, as the XRP price is currently trading at $1.6 , marking an 8.7% increase in the last 24 hours. While XRP continues to gain momentum , Steph predicts that the cryptocurrency could soon see an explosive increase to $50. With this bullish scenario in mind, Richard has urged investors to start buying XRP before further adoption drives its price into “the very expensive range,” between $22 and $120.",XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 03:00:27

Solana, with its much-discussed ETF potential, has captured institutional and retail attention alike, while Cronos’s projected price increase to $0.22 signals steady growth. However, stealing the spotlight is Qubetics ($TICS), the new Web3 aggregator in town, setting itself apart with innovative tools like the QubeQode IDE. Unlike many predecessors, Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s solving real-world problems. At its heart, QubeQode IDE introduces a groundbreaking Code Snippet Library that simplifies development for Web3 builders, bringing a tech-forward approach to token value. Combine this with analysts’ predictions of up to 58,213% ROI, and $TICS could very well be the crown jewel of promising cryptos this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Web3 with Innovation As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is simplifying blockchain development with its intuitive QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Developers often hit roadblocks when coding decentralised apps (dApps), but QubeQode changes the game with its Code Snippet Library—a treasure trove of pre-written code blocks. Imagine an entrepreneur building a crowdfunding platform on blockchain. Instead of scripting smart contracts from scratch, they can simply select and customise relevant snippets from QubeQode . This innovation cuts development time and costs while reducing errors—giving creators confidence and investors peace of mind. It’s no surprise that $TICS has captured the market’s imagination. The presale, currently in its tenth stage, has already raised over $3.6 million, with 239 million tokens sold and 4,800 holders joining the movement. At $0.025 per token, investors are scrambling to grab $TICS before this weekend’s expected 10% surge pushes the price higher. For those sceptical about early-stage investments, consider this: analysts predict $TICS could reach $15 post-mainnet launch. If an entrepreneur invests $10 now, they’d receive 400 tokens. Solana (SOL): The ETF That Could Reshape Crypto Solana continues to make waves as institutional interest mounts in its potential ETF. With applications filed by firms like VanEck and Bitwise, a decision from the SEC is expected by August 2025. Optimism is high, especially with the impending resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, which analysts believe could create a more crypto-friendly environment. Globally, Solana ETFs have already been approved in Brazil and Canada, creating indirect pressure on the U.S. to follow suit. Approval could be a game-changer, not just for Solana but for the entire crypto ecosystem. As Matthew Sigel from VanEck suggests, a Solana ETF would bring legitimacy and open doors to institutional capital, further solidifying Solana’s position as a leading blockchain network. On the price front, SOL’s recent performance is nothing short of spectacular. The token hit an all-time high of $264.31, up 18% this week and 160% in 2024. For investors, this means SOL remains one of the most promising cryptos this weekend. With the possibility of ETF approval and continuous ecosystem expansion, Solana’s bullish trajectory seems poised to continue. Cronos (CRO): Quietly Building Momentum While Solana grabs headlines, Cronos is making steady progress. Trading at $0.176018 as of today, the token has underperformed against BTC and ETH in the short term, but analysts project a 26.11% price increase by December 3, 2024, bringing it to $0.222803. Cronos has shown resilience, gaining 130.94% over the last month and nearly doubling its value year-over-year. These metrics make it a solid pick for investors looking for less volatility compared to meme coins. Moreover, its role in the Crypto.com ecosystem ensures consistent demand, further stabilising its growth. Looking at the big picture, Cronos’s all-time high of $0.959822 in November 2021 suggests room for growth, especially as the Fear & Greed Index signals “Extreme Greed” among investors. While it may not promise the explosive gains of $TICS, Cronos’s reliability makes it another standout in the list of promising cryptos this weekend. Which Crypto Should You Bet On? When it comes to promising cryptos this weekend, Qubetics ($TICS) takes the crown. Its utility-driven ecosystem, groundbreaking QubeQode IDE, and jaw-dropping ROI projections make it an irresistible choice for risk-tolerant investors. Solana and Cronos also offer compelling narratives, with SOL riding the ETF wave and CRO delivering steady growth. But let’s not ignore the ticking clock. With $TICS priced at just $0.025 and a 10% surge expected this weekend, there’s no time to wait. Imagine snagging 1,000 tokens now and watching them turn into $15,000 post-mainnet launch . Opportunities like this don’t come often, so why not take the leap?

The company behind XRP, Ripple, is finally going to launch its stable coin RLUSD. It is awaiting approval from the NYDFS which is expected on December 4. Let’s dive deeper and find why this stablecoin means a lot for the company and for the crypto ecosystem. Ripple Stablecoin : A Game Changer Ripple’s got a plan with RLUSD, and it’s not just any stablecoin. Think of it as their answer to all the legal chaos around XRP. Stablecoins are like the calm in a crypto storm—way more predictable than XRP’s rollercoaster price moves. Ripple’s acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company earlier this year paved the way for RLUSD, aligning Ripple with stringent NYDFS standards. Ripple is now taking on established stablecoin giants like Circle’s USDC and Paxos’ USDP. Partnerships with platforms like MoonPay and Uphold will make RLUSD accessible to a global audience. The goal? Integrate RLUSD into global remittance networks, making cross-border payments cheaper and faster than ever. XRP Price Surge The XRP token has been moving in a confined zone between $0.39 and $0.75 since March 2023. It took a breakout as the crypto market started pumping with the US election. Optimism around Ripple’s regulatory clarity and the potential of its stable coin seems to be the driving force behind this momentum. The company’s blockchain-based RippleNet system already challenges traditional systems like SWIFT. With RLUSD in the play, the company could capture a larger share of the cross-border payment market. New regulatory shifts like MiCA in Europe and the Trump administration in the US gives more strength to Ripple’s position. What’s Next? With NYDFS approval likely days away, RLUSD could launch as early as December 4, adding a fresh layer of stability to Ripple’s offerings. As the stablecoin market grows and global regulations become clearer, Ripple seems poised to not just survive but thrive. Could this finally be the breakthrough Ripple’s been hoping for? Maybe—only time will tell. Why is XRP going up? Optimism around regulatory clarity and Ripple’s stablecoin news is fueling the price surge. How high can XRP go? While predictions vary, some experts believe XRP could cross $2 by year end. What is stablecoin? A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, reducing volatility. Is XRP a good investment? XRP has huge potential, but market volatility and regulatory factors should be considered.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 03:34:20

Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 03:40:21

Legendary Trader Forecasts Next Price Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/how-high-can-dogecoin-go-legendary-trader/,"Dogecoin is one of the standout performers in the crypto market in the last weeks. Over the past 34 days, DOGE has rallied by 210%, climbing from $0.13 to above $0.41. The rally was fueled by excitement surrounding the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Dogecoin advocate Elon Musk under the forthcoming US President Donald Trump. However, the rally has plateaued, with DOGE experiencing a sideways movement over the last 16 days. Despite this, the daily DOGE/USD chart continues to exhibit a highly bullish outlook. Legendary trader Peter Brandt, in collaboration with the observations of a crypto analyst known by the handle @Kultigin83, has highlighted a “running continuation flag” on the DOGE/USD chart, forecasting a potential price target of $0.66. Is This The Next Dogecoin Price Target? @Kultigin83 commented on X, stating: “Mr. Peter helps us, and I want to help him (a small piece of advice from a student); this pattern is known as an upsloping flag.” In response, Peter Brandt replied , “Yes, if completed, this would indeed be considered a running continuation flag.” The running continuation flag is a classic chart pattern recognized for its bullish implications. It generally appears during a strong uptrend when the price briefly consolidates or moves slightly downward within a parallel or slightly expanding channel. This pattern is crucial because it suggests that despite the temporary pause, the predominant bullish momentum is still very much intact. In the case of Dogecoin, the pattern observed follows a significant upward movement where the price notably increased from a level below $0.19 to above $0.39 following the breakout of a head and shoulders pattern, creating the “pole” of the flag. This pole is a crucial component as it represents the initial surge before the consolidation phase. Following this surge, the DOGE price action started to consolidate, moving within the boundaries of $0.340 to $0.48, forming the body of the flag. The method to derive the price target from a flag pattern involves measuring the length of the pole — in this instance, approximately $0.20 (from around $0.19 to $0.39). This measurement is then applied to the potential breakout point, which for DOGE appears to be forming around the $0.50 mark. By adding the height of the pole to the breakout price, the forecast target is set at $0.70. The analysis provided by @Kultigin83 sets a slightly more conservative target at $0.66. If Dogecoin can maintain its momentum and break out from the upper boundary of its running continuation flag, the target of at least $0.66 seems the next logical price target. This technical pattern, endorsed by Peter Brandt’s expertise, provides a bullish outlook for DOGE, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is not yet done with its upward climb. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.",Dogecoin|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin price analysis|dogecoin technical analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-30 04:30:42

Here’s What Robert Kiyosaki Believes",https://coinpedia.org/news/can-bitcoin-cross-100000-heres-what-robert-kiyosaki-believes/,"The post Can Bitcoin Cross $100,000? Here’s What Robert Kiyosaki Believes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin crossing $100,000? It sounds wild, but that’s exactly what Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is saying. He believes Bitcoin’s price is about to shoot up, and once it does, it could be too expensive for the average person to get in on. But is this for real? Let’s dive into what Kiyosaki is predicting and what’s actually going on with the first crypto right now. Kiyosaki Thinks FOMO Will Drive Bitcoin’s Surge Kiyosaki thinks the next big wave of Bitcoin buying will come from a simple feeling: FOMO—Fear of Missing Out. He says as BTC moves closer to $100,000, more people are going to jump in before they miss their chance. But here’s the catch: once the largest crypto hits that $100K mark, it might be hard for regular investors to afford much of it. That’s because only the super-rich will be able to grab big chunks. THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad “Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Kiyosaki also doesn’t trust traditional currencies like the dollar or euro. He argues that inflation is slowly killing their value. For him, BTC is the way to go—protecting your wealth in a world where cash just isn’t cutting it anymore. Bitcoin Could Hit $100K Sooner Than We Think Right now, Bitcoin’s trading at about $96,662. It’s not far from that $100K mark, and some experts think it could hit it soon. The charts show a possible double bottom pattern, which could mean a price jump to $106,000 by Christmas. Trading volume is up 8.73%, so there’s definitely some action happening. It’s looking like BTC is on the move. With countries like Switzerland working towards regulating Bitcoin mining, the growth is unstoppable. Kiyosaki is also big on Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, who’s been buying huge amounts of Bitcoin. Kiyosaki calls him a “genius” for making his company’s balance sheet stronger by stacking up Bitcoin. So, What’s Next for Bitcoin? Will Bitcoin hit $100,000? It’s hard to say for sure, but all signs point to a big jump. Kiyosaki’s prediction is more than just about the price; it’s about Bitcoin changing the way we think about money. Will it really protect wealth like he says, or will it fall short? We’ll see soon enough, but it looks like we’re in for an interesting few months.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 04:41:25

In his detailed post “ How Libra Was Killed “, Marcus provides a complete overview of the political slugfest. He also details how US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen prevented Fed Chair Jerome Powell from giving it the go-ahead. Facebook Libra Was Killed Politically, Says David Marcus David Marcus, who led Facebook’s Libra project, later renamed Diem, shared how the political forces choked the project into non-existence despite creating regulatory hurdles. Libra, designed as a high-performance blockchain paired with a stablecoin, aimed to revolutionize global payments. Marcus said that he and his team at Meta envisioned a system capable of addressing financial crime, money laundering, consumer protection, reserve management, and more. The project, announced in June 2019 with 28 partners, faced intense regulatory scrutiny from the outset. Just two following the launch of Libra, the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee called Marcus to testify. This led to his team conducting some exhaustive revisions for nearly two to address lawmakers’ concerns, before finally giving up on the project. Marcus said that by 2021, the Facebook Libra project met every regulatory requirement needed for a limited launch, and even supported by some Federal Reserve governors. However, he adds that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen instructed the Fed Chair that allowing Libra would be a “political suicide”. Soon thereafter, Powell instructed all regulated banks to stop supporting the project, ultimately leading to its demise. David Marcus wrote: “There was no legal or regulatory angle left for the government or regulators to kill the project. It was 100% a political kill—one that was executed through intimidation of captive banking institutions. That was the hardest part of this story for me personally. Not that we had failed, but that America, this country I immigrated to and became a proud citizen of because of its rule of law and value system, behaved in such a way for political reasons. It was a very tough pill to swallow”. Crypto Industry Leaders Back David Marcus’s Claims Crypto industry leaders including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , Gemini exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevos s, and Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long have all come out in support of David Marcus stressing that the Fed’s behavior was part of Operation Choke Point 2.0 , which involved forcing regulated banks to cut ties with crypto firms. Responding to Marcus’s post on X platform, Cameron Winklevoss wrote: “Can confirm. Gemini worked closely with David and his team at Meta to help launch Libra (fka Diem). We were on the one-yard line when Federal regulators murdered this project. It was all politics, no basis in law”. Caitlin Long , the CEO of Custodia Bank also affirmed stating: “David Marcus, that sounds familiar! Someday, like you just did, I’ll be able to tell the real story of what the Fed did to Custodia Bank, and how the Fed lied to achieve Biden/Warren political aims. There is so much corruption & I’m glad it’s pouring out in public now”. XRP Lawyer John Deaton recently demanded a detailed investigation into Operation Choke Point 2.0. He proposed that the incoming administration appoint an independent counsel to lead the investigation, recommending Nic Carter as a strong candidate for the investigative team Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Shares A Tip Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also said that the government, including Secretary Janet Yellen, pressured the banks from working with crypto firms and on the Facebook Libra project. Armstrong pointed to past events, including the launch of Meta’s Llama project, to emphasize the importance of releasing new technologies without seeking approval from regulators. Drawing parallels to the development of Bitcoin, Armstrong argued that decentralized technologies should be available as open-source software to avoid regulatory pushback. “Once these tools are out in the wild, they can’t be rolled back,” he stated. The Coinbase CEO asserted that this approach is critical for fostering innovation, with the Bitcoin network serving as a prime example of a successful, permissionless project. Armstrong also reiterated his belief that “code is speech,” highlighting the protection of software development under the First Amendment. Makes sense – the government pressured the banks (again). I think the lesson from Libra is that these tools should be released as open source software, and to not ask for permission. Once they are out in the wild they can't be rolled back. This is why Bitcoin worked, and it's… https://t.co/2Embd9jlNj — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 30, 2024 The Facebook Libra project is likely to open the door to disclosure from other crypto firms that suffered due to Operation Choke Point 2.0. With Donald Trump planning to have a ‘ crypto czar ‘ position at the White House, things could change for the betterment of the crypto industry. It will be interesting to see whether the Diem stablecoin project from Facebook will revive again.

BCB may prohibit centralized exchanges from permitting stablecoin withdrawals into self-custody wallets. This restriction targets “tokens denominated in foreign currencies” to ensure compliance with Brazilian financial regulations. The BCB gains crypto oversight under the 2022 law and sets new regulations BCB commented on the development; “The initiative reflects our commitment to adapting the financial system to the realities of digital assets while safeguarding the integrity of international capital flows.” – BCB This proposal enables the BCB to oversee the crypto industry as part of the December 2022 crypto law . Stakeholders can submit feedback on the proposal by February 28, 2025. Despite public opinions, the BCB is responsible for enforcing crypto laws. Additionally, crypto investments, whether inbound or outbound, would be subject to the same regulatory standards as traditional investments. External credit, direct foreign investment, and Brazilian capital abroad involving crypto would require adherence to existing international capital regulations. Under the public consultation, centralized exchanges would also need to obtain a foreign exchange license to offer stablecoin-related services. Brazil’s Central Bank proposes a stablecoin withdrawal ban to regulate the crypto market Brazil’s planned Stablecoin Withdrawal Ban highlights the growing significance of currencies in the financial sector. According to Brazil’s Internal Revenue Service, stablecoins accounted for 71.4% of September’s $4.2 billion crypto transactions, with Tether (USDT) leading the market. This critical book discusses the potential impacts of the new legislation on corporations and crypto traders. In addition to limiting withdrawals, the BCB recommends stringent rules for virtual asset service providers. Adhering to conventional investment standards guarantees these companies’ compliance with global capital regulations. This strategy strikes a compromise between Brazilian crypto industry innovation and financial stability.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 04:51:17

Beyond entertainment, GalaChain plays a key role in NFTs and memes, with Fuzzle and $WEN as frontliners. New developments and clever Innovations with real-life use cases that provide relatable solutions are emerging more frequently, making the Gala community one of the most innovative in the ecosystem. GalaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain developed by Gala to serve as a backbone for everything entertainment, including games, music, and film. It’s powered by a network of Founder’s and designed with a clear objective to cater to the demands of Web2 gaming while adding Web3 functions and extending unique features to other industries. The design philosophy behind the GalaChain is quite simple: it’s designed to seamlessly handle the intensive requirements of gaming with the ability to accommodate virtually any allocation or industry need. This has become the distinctive factor of GalaChain, making it the go-to for the tech demands of multiple platforms. Fuzzle Innovates On GalaChain The Gala community breeds innovators with ambitions to create the next big solutions and projects. The latest is Fuzzle launching its groundbreaking Web3 platform designed to fuel creativity and problem solving. An innovative platform that equips users with powerful AI tools to tackle a wide array of work challenges. The platform will automate the creation of videos, GIFs, articles, and comprehensive content campaigns tailored to individual needs and transform ideas into large-scale results with ease. Backed by the Fuzzle Prime DAO and six founder nodes, Fuzzle ensures robust support, security, and community-driven innovation. According to Gingerbreadman, the name behind Fuzzle, “the platform will give users powerful AI tools to handle all kinds of work challenges.” GingerbreadMan also won the block explorer bounty of 1 million $GALA for building the best-voted GalaChain block explorer, now known as GalaScan. $WEN takes Memes to New Heights on GalaChain While new memes on Solana look to steal the spotlight in recent times, $WEN has already taken centre stage preceding the current trend of meme sensation. The $WEN was created by a community member known as Lukabylie, who owns the platform galacoins.zyz. GalaCoins is a community developed site that covers different tokens in the GalaChain ecosystem. Recently launched on GalaChain, the token experienced a significant surge, reaching a market cap of $1 million within just a few weeks of its introduction. Token surges of this fashion only highlight a thriving community and underscore the health of the GalaChain ecosystem. Here’s what Lukabylie has to say about it all: “I got involved with Gala in 2021, I thought the in-game item ownership was a brilliant idea. A few years later I started playing Spider Tanks and on several occasions I wanted to analyze game data, which was available on the blockchain. When Gala came out with the Token creation Tool, I leveraged all of this into $WEN, a gamified token designed to belong to the community. It involved a reward mechanism for trading & holding & live trading data available to everyone. Over time tried to add more utility to the token by creating Galacoins.xyz, a platform designed to visualize data from Galaswap and empower other token creators”. $WEN creation came at the backdrop of a popular joke about delays. Since its creation, it has evolved to offer utility features, which include exclusive access to functionalities on galacoins.xyz. Unlike traditional meme coins that lack inherent value beyond speculative trading, $WEN offers its holders a form of fractional ownership, enabling individuals to win a fraction of valuable digital assets. The unique difference of $WEN compared to other meme coins points to the level of innovative ideas within the GalaChain ecosystem. The GalaChain Community Most successful projects and tokens in the blockchain industry are usually driven by a strong community. The GalaChain Community is exemplary not just for backing community-led innovations but for creating them. The rise of $WEN can be attributed to the active engagement of the community, while the sheer brilliance behind Fuzzle pays credence to elite builders and innovators within the ecosystem. As GalaChain evolves, so does the community. Together, a future of decentralized innovation is being built.",Crypto News|Press Release|GalaChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|GALA,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-11-30 04:53:37

However “community feedback and input” plays an important role in decisions related to which cryptocurrency to list. In a Cointelegraph interview at Aus Crypto Con 2024, Rachel Conlan said that teams responsible for listing go through a diligent process to go through the information regarding the founders behind the project’s involved people and the plans it potentially holds. This becomes necessary with the rise in the popularity of meme coins. Crypto exchanges have an increased responsibility to filter out any suspicious projects for the protection of the users. Moreover, Conlan said there is nothing “guaranteed” about what sets a project apart to be selected for listing on Binance. On the other hand, she also shared that the “secret research team” considers “a few different factors” like community feedback and input including community trends and insights regarding the project. She added these factors “are definitely important”. Memecoins with real use cases are the priority for Binance She added that because of no utility, meme coins have a lot of negative coverage. However “there are up-and-coming meme coins that have that utility built in”. It is the only functional requirement, explained Conlan. “What we should be talking about more is the innovation that’s going to come out, like the innovation that’s been prepped in this bear cycle. What people are building” – Rachel Conlan, Binance CMO Conlan believes that the crypto industry will have significant growth in the coming 18 to 24 months.

The growth accounts for 63%, leaving holders enthusiastic about its future. Hyperliquid held the largest airdrop in the DeFi protocol on November 29, giving out 310 million HYPE tokens to the community. The coin’s current market cap is nearly $2.2B. HYPE token supply plan is scheduled up to 2028 Hyperliquid, a layer one blockchain based on PoS consensus, can process up to 200,000 transactions per second. The token is critical to the ecosystem as it works as the staking asset and gas token for its Ethereum Virtual Machine Compatible Layer, HyperEVM. According to the protocol, Hyperliquid supplied 31% of its $1 billion tokens on its first airdrop. They reserved 38.8% for future emissions and community rewards, 6% went to the Hyper Foundation treasury, and 0.3% was directed to grants. According to the plans, core contributors will have 23.8% of the total supply during the first-year lock period, while the schedules will run beyond 2028. It didn’t reserve allocations for CEX, private investors, or market influencers. This airdrop is among the largest in De-Fi history So far, this airdrop is among the most historic on the DeFi protocol. In September 2020, another considerable airdrop was made by Uniswap. Uniswap’s airdrop distributed 400 UNI tokens each, to more than a quarter million addresses. By then, each token was about $3.40, which equaled almost $1,300 per recipient. Several users rushed to cash out their tokens after the airdrop, which worked in favor of the holders. The value of Uniswap rose to over $42 just a few months after the airdrop. The Arbitum protocol also had a memorable airdrop in 2023. It distributed its native token, Arbitrum, to 625,000 active wallets for a market value of $1.30 each, for a total of $812,500. Airdrop is not a new concept in the crypto space. In most cases, new or existing tokens are distributed for free to several users. The reasons for airdrops vary from promoting new tokens to giving incentives to early adopters. So far, data from CoinGecko indicates crypto tokens worth $26.6 billion have been distributed to users through airdrops.

They’ve got the kind of energy that turns internet jokes into billion-dollar sensations. From Dogecoin’s rocket-fuelled ride to Shiba Inus cult status, these coins have a way of grabbing headlines and making wallets dance. And guess what? This week, the spotlight shining on three standout contenders: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Book of Meme. Trust me, they’re not just making noise—they’re shaking things up! BTFD Coin’s presale is burning hot, roaring through its early stages like a meme-fuelled wildfire, while Moo Deng’s viral baby hippo charm is turning heads and winning hearts. And then there’s Book of Meme, the creative playground that’s giving meme lovers a platform to shine. Whether you’re here for the hype or the potential profits, these coins are proving that meme magic is alive and thriving. So, buckle up—it’s gonna be a wild ride! BTFD Coin: The Meme King in the Making BTFD Coin’s presale is already the talk of the crypto town, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now at $0.00005 in Stage 5, with the final listing price set at $0.0006. This meteoric price trajectory underscores its potential as the best meme coin to add right now. Its first day saw over $150,000 raised, and the tally has soared past $295,000, with 10 billion coins snapped up by eager investors. But it’s not just the presale numbers that are making waves. BTFD’s value proposition is packed with appeal: a play-to-earn (P2E) game that hooks gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, staking rewards that let holders earn passive income, and a vibrant, ever-growing community that’s ready to rally for the coin’s success. Imagine putting in $4,000 at Stage 5’s price of $0.00005 per coin—you’d snag 80 million BTFD coins. By the time it hits $0.0006 , your initial $4,000 investment would balloon to a whopping $48,000. That’s the kind of ROI dreams are made of. BTFD’s presale is slated to have 16 stages, which means there’s still room to hop on this rocket ship. With its robust roadmap, it’s no wonder analysts are calling it the best meme coin to add right now. Will you be part of its success story?

Today, the Ethereum vs Solana battle continues as both altcoins rank as the top performing cryptos to invest in. The Ethereum price has risen by about 37% in the past month, while the Solana price has soared by nearly 32%, causing speculation that another altcoin season is coming. However, Rollblock has surged by over 200% during its presale, causing investors to tip it as the top performing crypto to invest in right now. The new casino token has also raised over $6.2 million during its initial coin offering (ICO). But why is Rollblock causing so much FOMO among ETH and SOL investors ? Let’s find out. Ethereum crosses $3,600: Aims for new support at $4,000 Following the recent fall in the Bitcoin price, investors have shifted their attention to altcoins. As a result, the Ethereum price has experienced an upturn, increasing by approximately 37% within the last 30 days. On November 28, Ethereum crossed the $3,600 price point for the first time in 2024, causing optimistic conversations about a new altcoin season being in the offing. However, the rise in the Ethereum price in November has shown mixed feelings. Ethereum remains the second-worst performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, causing doubts about its ability to sustain the recent bullish trend. Solana remains one of the best-performing altcoins Solana has been a top performing crypto throughout 2024. The token has surged by over 330% in the past year, while Ethereum has only moved up by about 80%. SOL has overshadowed ETH in this battle of altcoins – thanks to its massively growing meme coin ecosystem, which has been attracting investors. Moreover, more developers are switching to Solana because of its faster throughput and lower fees. The Solana community has also given the blockchain and its token a massive boost as one of the best for investors, traders, and developers. The SOL price has reached about $240 at the time of writing, with optimistic Solana price predictions of $1,000 for 2025. Rollblock outperforms ETH and SOL during its presale Rollblock is in a world of its own, showing investors why its revolutionary GambleFi platform is the next big thing. The Rollblock (RBLK) token powers the Rollblock Casino ecosystem, incentivizing players and investors in various ways. One of the standout features of the casino is its reward system. The online gaming site has a unique revenue-sharing program that rewards RBLK token holders with a share of its weekly profits. These investors also get the opportunity to stake their tokens for up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY). On the player side, there are VIP bonuses for them and presale token holders to earn additional RBLK tokens based on their total holdings. They also get access to thousands of casino games that they can wager on for real money winnings. These, in addition to the daily, weekly, and monthly rakeback rewards, make Rollblock an exciting platform for their gambling needs. Conclusion The Rollblock presale is ongoing, allowing interested investors to key into the project. Investors can lock in the top performing crypto at $0.037 per unit in stage 8 before it increases to $0.041 in stage 9. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

He advises accumulating 10,000 XRP tokens before 2025, warning that those who fail to do so may miss out on significant future opportunities. Ripple’s Role in Global Finance In a recent analysis, Crypto Sensei highlighted the growing trust central banks place in Ripple’s technology. He explained that Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure positions XRP as a key player in the future of digital currencies, particularly central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Doyle emphasized that the token has maintained a leading position in blockchain innovation over the past decade, stating that its continued development and central bank partnerships are critical to its future success. According to Doyle, the asset offers advantages over stablecoins when settling international transactions. He said although stablecoins could offer price stability, they lack the decentralization and global liquidity XRP provides. He states that central banks need a cryptocurrency that can settle transactions instantly, highlighting the token as the one to fill the role. He believes the token’s technology could make it a central component in the tokenization of assets and the settlement of global trade flows. XRP Potential Value The analyst believes that as global financial institutions increasingly rely on the asset for cross-border payments, its value could reach between $100 and $9,999 per token. “If XRP becomes the hub for a lot of the world’s trade, you’re talking about an XRP value in the high three to four digits,” he suggested. Currently, the token is trading at $1.74, following a recent price increase of over 17% in the last day. Based on Doyle’s projections, those holding 10,000 XRP tokens today could see their holdings grow to between $1 million and $100 million if his high-end price predictions come true. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation and Criticism While Doyle’s predictions have captured the attention of many enthusiasts, they are not without skepticism. Critics point out that his projections are speculative and not guaranteed. Other analysts have expressed doubt that the token could reach anywhere near the $100 to $9,999 range within the next few years. They caution investors to consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and to be wary of overly optimistic predictions. Nonetheless, Doyle’s analysis highlights the token’s potential as digital currencies and blockchain technology continue to gain traction in the global financial system. Investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research and consider the potential rewards and risks before making significant investments.

Currently capitalizing on the current bull market , it is outperforming other tokens in spectacular fashion. The recent launch of ZK smart contracts further pushed ADA price higher, sending it on a massive price increase. This kind of performance could potentially push ADA back into the top echelons of the crypto market, but ADA is not the only token that is riding the bull market in style. Rollblock is also disrupting the GambleFi space, tearing up crypto rankings in the process. Let’s look at what these tokens offer ambitious investors bold enough to dive in and examine them. Rollblock is shaking up the GambleFi market Rollblock is a revolutionary online crypto casino that is causing a revolution in the GambleFi space, an industry that is worth more than half a trillion dollars. That is because it offers transparency in an opaque landscape, and online gamblers are flocking to it like addicted shoppers to Black Friday sales. However, Rollblock is more than a transparent, trustworthy gambling platform. It offers the latest tech and an extensive array of exciting games to give its users a comprehensive experience. It’s precisely why everyone keeps coming back for more! As a result, Rollblock is witnessing an expanding hub of active gamers, yet another reason why its presale continues to attract a massive influx of investors. More than $6 million has been raised, and given that it has an enticing entry price of $0.037, more investors are expected to jump on the bandwagon. That is because Rollblock holders not only get to realize massive profits when the coin moons, but they also get a slice of the revenue the platform generates every week. Once the project enters the limelight, there’s certain to be no going back, either. Experts believe it will go viral, ride the current b ull market to its destination, and net early investors the profits of their crypto careers! Cardano Unlocks ZK-Snarks smart contracts, ADA price explodes Cardano recently deployed its first zero-knowledge smart contract, an upgrade that introduces advanced scalability, privacy capabilities and expands its potential use cases. This was done in conjunction with Halo 2, an advanced zk-SNARK proving system integrated into Cardano’s ecosystem. After the launch, ADA price took off, trading at around $1. This is a major milestone given that it’s been more than two years since Cardano hit this price level. Crucially, it sets the ADA price prediction in an even more bullish mood. ADA price prediction: Is a Cardano ATH near? Cardano has been on a meteoric price rise in recent months, and the recent upgrade only adds fuel to the furnace. It bolstered ADA price, sending it into the top 10 coins by market cap. However, Cardano is currently about one-third of its ATH price, so it may take some time for ADA to break that record. But its current rally is enough to convince investors to take a stab at it. At the same time, it makes even more sense to take a bigger stake in Rollblock. Given its unknown status, Rollblock is well positioned to appreciate higher percentage-wise than ADA . No smart investor would want to miss out on it.

Santa Trump (SANTRUMP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Santa Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Trump launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Santa Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Trump by entering its contract address – 8ZaP3RBCDK2qBaNEcAqJqrL8c2hcYLtYrVNhpuSgR3rW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 05:50:00

The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience, and its current price action suggests a potential breakout at an aggressive pace if it can push above key resistance levels.

The next few days will determine whether SHIB can break above the $0.000026 resistance level. A successful breakout could continue its upward trajectory, driving SHIB toward its higher targets. However, failure to hold its current levels might lead to further consolidation. SHIB Testing Crucial Supply Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000258 after several days of volatile price action and market indecision. The price has fluctuated within a tight range, finding support near $0.000023 and facing resistance at $0.000028. This consolidation phase has kept traders on edge as they await a decisive breakout. If SHIB breaks above the critical $0.000026 resistance level, it could build the momentum needed to challenge the $0.000028 local high. A successful push above this level would likely signal the start of a more aggressive upward move, targeting the yearly highs at $0.000045. This level represents a significant milestone for SHIB, aligning with key technical and psychological factors that could further bolster its bullish trajectory. On the other hand, failure to break above these resistance levels might result in continued sideways trading or even a pullback toward the lower end of the range. The next few trading sessions will be crucial as market participants closely watch whether SHIB can sustain its bullish momentum and overcome these barriers.

Here’s What This Means to SHIB Price,https://timestabloid.com/1-billion-shib-within-an-hour-heres-what-this-means-to-shib-price/,"The Shiba Inu community has set a remarkable milestone by removing over 1.2 billion SHIB tokens from circulation within a day as 1 billion of this portion were burned within an hour. This significant development was reported by Shibburn, a blockchain tracker focused on SHIB burns. During this large-scale burn, SHIB’s price has shown signs of recovery, rising to $0.00002606 after a decline at this level earlier in the week. Shibburn reports that the burn rate for SHIB has surged by 2,050% in the last 24 hours. A total of 1,282,587,181 SHIB was transferred to dead wallets, effectively removing them from circulation. The most notable contribution came from a single anonymous wallet, which burned an astounding 1,003,266,585 SHIB in a single transaction. Additional burns included transfers of 209,312,491, 33,737,678, and 29,282,316 SHIB, spread across 14 transactions. This increase in burn activity suggests a coordinated effort to reduce the circulating supply, potentially boosting the token’s scarcity and value. Shytoshi Kusama’s Ambitious Vision Shytoshi Kusama , the enigmatic lead developer of Shiba Inu, has recently reiterated his goal of elevating the asset to the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In a recent tweet, Kusama emphasized the challenges of enhancing the utility of a meme-based cryptocurrency without a large budget, sharing an AI-generated image depicting a chaotic yet determined effort to achieve this vision. Kusama described the image as a metaphor for the journey to transform SHIB from its current rank of 14th on CoinMarketCap to a top-five position. In another tweet, he confirmed that this ambitious goal is firmly focused on Shiba Inu (SHIB). Kusama’s vision underscores the aspiration of the community to secure a prominent place among the leading digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Position At the time of press, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holds the 14th position on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of approximately $15.42 billion. The recent surge in burn activity has coincided with a modest price increase, as the token trades at $0.00002616. If the current burn momentum and market interest persist, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could rise further. However, its path to becoming a top-five cryptocurrency remains challenging, requiring continued innovation and community engagement. The recent burns highlight the community’s commitment to reducing supply and adding value. Whether these efforts will propel the asset to new heights remains to be seen, but the dedication of its developers and community suggests that the journey is far from over.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the NYDFS is expected to grant Ripple a Limited Purpose Trust Charter in the coming days, paving the way for the launch of RLUSD as early as December 4. The approval would allow Ripple to enter the heavily regulated U.S. stablecoin market, putting it in direct competition with industry leaders like Circle (USDC), Paxos (USDP), and Gemini (GUSD). The statute would allow Ripple to legally offer RLUSD to the public in New York, a state known for its strict regulatory standards for digital assets.

Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, played a central role in these transactions as a bridge currency. However, XRP has faced significant legal challenges in the US, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that it constitutes an unregistered security. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC, currently in the appeals phase, has kept XRP’s regulatory status in limbo. Despite these challenges, following Donald Trump’s recent election victory, the price of XRP rose to $1.90 on optimism that his administration will adopt crypto-friendly policies. XRP currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. *This is not investment advice.

Compared to Ethereum’s Uniswap (UNI) , Raydium’s volume is nearly double Uniswap’s $50 billion, making Raydium’s RAY one of the hottest new crypto tokens to hold. Thanks to the booming DeFi sector on Raydium , the price of RAY has surged over 67%, adding to its year-to-date uptick of 1365%. Uniswap’s UN I, on the other hand, is just starting to recover from a devastating drop of over 70% from its peak price of $44. Another new crypto DeFi project disrupting the market right now is Lunex Network . This DEX aggregator powered by institutional-grade liquidity is currently flying through its ICO with its LNEX utility token priced at $0.0033, Lunex has raised over $3.6 million. Lunex Network outshines legacy DEXs with its revolutionary new crypto Lunex is a new approach to DeFi, and expert analysts are already forecasting great upside potential for its token, LNEX. At its core, Lunex is a futuristic DEX and aggregator built on a speedy network that is capable of facilitating effortless cross-chain asset transfers. While most DEXs require the user to connect a DeFi wallet to swap tokens, all you need on Lunex is the receiving address of your non-custodial wallet, and you can trade across more than 50,000 currency pairs. That’s right, Lunex acts as a multi-chain bridge and swapping dApp that simplifies the process of swapping or trading tokens on a DEX. Its most revolutionary solution is its capacity to fetch deep liquidity across the Web3 landscape. Each trade is split across multiple chains to find the best price with zero slippage. Lunex also comes with a portfolio tracker that delivers accurate and up-to-date market intelligence to help with making data-driven decisions. With over $3.5 million worth of LNEX tokens sold so far, holders can enjoy additional perks such as the platform’s staking program. Raydium leads the charge as Solan’s DeFi ecosystem thrives Data from DeFi Llama shows that Solana’s DeFi ecosystem just surpassed a monthly trading volume of $100 billion, with Raydium leading the charge, given its 30-day trading volume of over $80 billion. That’s nearly double of Ethereum’s Uniswap volume of about $50 billion. Raydium thrives on the massive attention platforms such as Pump.fun has received amid a frenzy of new crypto meme coins that have taken the crypto space by storm. Can Raydium’s RAY surge past its previous ATH? Uniswap’s UNI starts to recover amid increasing bullish sentiment The price of Uniswap’s UNI has registered an uptick over the last 30 days of about 62% as bullish sentiment around Uniswap picks up speed. For the better part of 2024, UNI’ s price remained stagnant below the $15 resistance region, but a change in the tide is underway. Can Uniswap reclaim its position as a DeFi giant? Conclusion Raydium’s RAY and Uniswap’s UNI are soon going to be locked in a tight race for dominance in the DeFi space. RAY currently enjoys its position as a new crypto DEX token. However, Lunex’s LNEX could soon dethrone them both thanks to its deep liquidity and extensive range of useful features.

This collaboration introduces a dual-staking mechanism set to launch on December 2. The initiative allows users to stake SHIB tokens to earn SHIRO and vice versa, creating new opportunities for holders of both cryptocurrencies. The partnership has sparked interest due to its potential to enhance engagement within both communities. Shiba Inu’s Lead Developer Denies Involvement Following the announcement, concerns were raised by some community members regarding the legitimacy of the Shiro Neko project. Questions about transparency led Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, to address the issue. In response to a comment implying potential issues with the collaboration, Kusama clarified that he is not involved with Shiro Neko and requested that his name not be associated with the project. Dont @ me. I am not involved with Shiro. Tanks bunches. — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) November 28, 2024 Past Concerns About Shiro Neko Resurface Community concerns about Shiro Neko are not new. Last month, Susbarium, a community-managed scam awareness channel linked to Shiba Inu , warned the Shiba Inu community about the project. This warning came after Shiro Neko conducted a significant token burn, destroying 5.58 billion SHIB in a single transaction. Following the burn, Shiro Neko’s team sought a formal relationship with Shiba Inu, sparking skepticism about its motives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Susbarium advised the community to be cautious, highlighting that projects using large token burns as promotional tactics should be carefully evaluated. Although the channel did not label Shiro Neko a scam, it recommended investors conduct thorough research before engaging with the token. Mixed Reactions from the Community While some community members view the dual-staking initiative as an innovative way to increase the asset’s utility, others remain wary due to the concerns raised. The timing of the partnership, given past warnings, has led to further scrutiny. Despite this, the collaboration is moving forward, with supporters hopeful it will contribute to the growth of both ecosystems. As the dual-staking launch date approaches, investors are urged to remain cautious and informed. Conducting due diligence remains crucial in ensuring safe participation in cryptocurrency investment.

Yet, despite the challenges, the cryptocurrency has experienced an extraordinary surge in recent weeks. Since Donald Trump’s election win, XRP has rocketed by more than 273%. Is the rally here to stay, or are there warning signs ahead? Crypto analysts, including Maartunn, are urging caution. Let’s dive into the details and explore what’s driving XRP’s current momentum—and what could come next. XRP Outperforms the Market XRP, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has posted extraordinary gains. Over the past 30 days, it has surged by 262%, far exceeding the market average of 57%. In the last 24 hours, it jumped 21%—the highest among the top ten cryptocurrencies. By comparison, Bitcoin rose 0.6%, Ethereum 2.5%, and Solana 0.6%. Even Dogecoin, known for its volatility, gained only 4.1%. Caution, Investors! Maartunn, a prominent crypto analyst, warns that XRP’s rapid rise might be fueled by leveraged trading. He notes that similar scenarios in the past have led to significant market corrections, with drops of over 17%. Supporting this view, data shows that open interest in XRP futures has increased by 37%. This indicates heightened trading activity, which could amplify both gains and potential losses if investors start to close their positions. What’s Driving the XRP Price? A major factor driving XRP’s growth is Donald Trump’s recent election win. His presidency is seen as favorable for the crypto industry, boosting investor confidence. XRP has been a standout performer in this post-election rally. On November 5, XRP was trading at $0.50313. By November 16, it had surged to $1.11687, marking a significant gain in just over a week. Another major catalyst was the resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his tough stance on crypto, particularly against Ripple. Following this news on November 21, XRP jumped from $1.10064 to $1.24677. The next day, it hit a high of $1.47408. In the last four days, XRP has climbed over 35%, currently trading at $1.88521. Ripple’s Strategic Moves Ripple has also made key strategic moves, including investing in Bitwise’s XRP fund and launching its first tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger. These initiatives are designed to expand the XRP ecosystem and demonstrate Ripple’s confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. XRP’s recent surge is the result of favorable legal, political, and market developments. While the gains are impressive, analysts caution that the rally could face a correction if market dynamics shift.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 06:36:13

Elon MAGA (ELONMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Elon MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon MAGA by entering its contract address – 7aemsYDqBWz1vyyDQqMwMkvSa4xgyFYVc5NnrPecL6iX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 06:47:00

This dramatic climb defines broader market trends, with daily trading volume jumping over $18 billion with a rise of over 160%, signalling investor interest. A couple of key drivers have triggered the massive rally, attracting huge liquidity. Regulatory Optimism—Rumors of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure have fueled hopes for a more crypto-friendly approach. Ripple’s legal battle resolution could further bolster XRP. Institutional Confidance: Growing interest in XRP ETFs (like Bitwise’s rebranded Physical XRP ETP) indicates rising support from major investors. These external factors are expected to have a major impact over the XRP price rally, which could help the XRP price break new milestones. The token began to rise positively by separating from the general market. While many people claim huge price targets like $20 or $30 for XRP in the coming days, here’s why these possibilities are pretty low, as the token could reach a $2 trillion market cap, which appears to be pretty difficult considering the current market dynamics. The weekly chart of XRP shows the bulls are now poised to lift the price beyond the ATH at $3.84 in the coming days after rising above 2021 highs. The momentum of the rally remained in bullish favour since the beginning, which could intensify hereafter as the Gaussian channel just turned bullish since the second half of the month. However, the RSI raises some concerns, displaying the probability of a small pullback as it has reached the levels not attained since 2021 at around 89. Back in 2018, the RSI surged further to reach 95, which elevated the levels to a new ATH. Therefore, the price, which is trading between the pivotal range between $1.7 and $2.08 at 0.5 & 0.618 FIB resp, is expected to test the support before triggering a rise above the resistance. Once the bulls settle above the range, the price is expected to rise to 1 FIB at the highs and further maintain a strong rise to 1.2 FIB at $4.15, forming the peak of the prevailing bull run. However, an extended bull run may pave the way for higher targets at $5.2 and $6.4 as well. The growing fundamentals have also attracted major countries like India onto the platform. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country’s digital rupee is taking shape with Ripple’s XRP ledger. The growing confidence of the authorities, institutions, bulls, and mainly the market participants is expected to back the XRP price rally, which aims to form new highs in 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 06:47:36

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Avalanche targets Cardano, but rising star IntelMarkets shines with QuantumX wallet and AI platform launch. Avalanche (AVAX) is gearing up to overtake one of the biggest winners of the last bull cycle-Cardano (ADA). But while these crypto giants strive for comebacks, a new star of the crypto space is putting all its foot on the table, IntelMarkets (INTL). By announcing the QuantumX wallet launch and an AI-driven platform, IntelMarkets promises more upside potential than standard altcoins. IntelMarkets: Leading the next wave of crypto innovation Quickly getting all the attention is IntelMarkets . Shaping up to be a leader in transforming the $36 billion crypto trading sector with a unique AI- DeFi narrative. QuantumX wallet is a first of its kind “future-proof” wallet. With the increase in cybersecurity attacks combined with the threat of quantum computing, IntelMarkets provides the first retail solution to address this problem. IntelMarkets has already shown its credibility in the presale phase, garnering well over $2.5 million. Currently, at the sixth presale stage, early investors saw a 500% increase from the initial price of $0.009, with INTL tokens now priced at $0.054. With low entry and high growth potential, IntelMarkets is an excellent investment for those who get in early.

Providing a platform based on solid fundamentals, AVAX went on to gain a reputation for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and robust DeFi ecosystem. Facing stiff competition in the Layer 1 space has caused Avalanche to go above and beyond to remain competitive. AVAX is not only competitive, but is preparing for a historic rally. Avalanche currently sits at $43.56, far below its all time high of $146.22, which was reached back in November 2021. In the last month, AVAX has risen by a whopping 67%, and is still on the rise. But, Avalanche’s outlook remains optimistic, with predictions claiming AVAX could surge to $70 by the end of the year. Cardano: Claiming $1 price tag with a 200% increase on the monthly charts One of the larger blockchain platforms, Car dano, was one of the biggest winners this cycle. Seeing large attention, Cardano placed their main focus on scalability and sustainability. A top 10 cryptocurrency, ADA has made strides, but hasn’t made the pivot back to its all time high of $3.10 back in September 2021. Currently, Cardano is traded at above $1, experiencing a triple from its price of $0.30. ADA has stepped up to a 25% increase over the past seven days, slowing down slightly. Cardano could rally to $1.50 by the end of 2024, but more external factors would have to go ADA’s way to reach its previous highs. Conclusion While Avalanche prepares to rally over Cardano, the $2.5 million presale is leading the way. With the QuantumX wallet and AI-powered features, IntelMarkets has significant upside potential. At just $0.054, INTL tokens have yielded early investors with 500% gains already.

This is the first time that Ether ETFs have achieved this milestone, since launch, showing a shift in investor sentiment. As a result, the ETH price surged another 4.27% moving past $3,720, setting the stage for the next rally to $5,000. Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows on the Rise Institutional demand for the spot Ether ETFs is slowly picking pace. Yesterday, the total inflows into US Ether ETFs stood at a staggering $332 million overtaking the Bitcoin ETF daily inflows of $320 million. This is the fifth consecutive trading session in which Ethereum ETFs saw net positive inflows. On Friday, the BlackRock Ether ETF (ETHA) alone accounted for $250 million in inflows followed by Fidelity’s FETH at $79.1 million in inflows, per the data from Farside Investors . Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, stated that the BlackRock Ether ETF (ETHA) has now surpassed $2 billion in total inflows since its launch in July, underscoring strong investor demand and growing institutional interest in Ethereum as a leading digital asset. Source: SosoValue On the other hand, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw $137.5 million in inflows yesterday. This shows that the capital rotation from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum (ETH) has begun. While inflows into Ether ETFs have been on the rise, the Bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed down recently. Earlier this week, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw zero inflows for two consecutive days in a row. Recent reports also suggest that BlackRock funds from the traditional portfolio have also been buying millions of IBIT shares recently. ETH Price Rally to $5,000? Market analysts have turned bullish on the Ethereum price while expecting new all-time highs above $5,000. At press time, ETH price has surged another 4% with bulls taking it beyond the crucial resistance $3,700, setting an immediate target of 4,000. Ethereum’s price chart has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, signaling potential bullish momentum ahead. Analyst ‘Trader Tardigrade’ suggests that a retest of the $3,538–$3,445 range could present a final buying opportunity at these levels before ETH targets the pattern’s projected high of $5,800.

This sudden rally has caught the attention of investors, who are now increasingly optimistic about the token’s future. With New Partnerships, IPO launch, ETFs, and Stablecoins all lined up in the coming months XRP is surely to hit a new ATH by December. Before that let’s understand what’s market looks like. Ripple vs. SEC Case: Will it Be Over Soon? The hopes for XRP price are rising because Brad Garlinghouse hinted in a recent interview that XRP may come out from a legal mess creating room for XRP growth. Speculation is growing that the case could be dismissed by 2025, giving XRP the regulatory clarity it has long sought. This optimism gained momentum after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his departure in January. Some legal experts, like Chris Giancarlo, believe the SEC might drop the case altogether, while others, such as lawyers Fred Rispoli and Jeremy Hogan, think the SEC might settle and reduce penalties. Additionally, interest is rising in creating XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), though the SEC has yet to approve any. If the case is dismissed, it could remove regulatory roadblocks that have hindered XRP’s adoption. This would give Ripple room to expand, potentially sending XRP’s price to new heights, with investors already factoring in this potential outcome. Brad Garlinghouse’s Upcoming 60 Minutes Appearance Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is set to appear on 60 Minutes, where he will discuss Ripple’s journey through the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. The interview, airing on December 1st, will showcase Ripple’s resilience and belief in future success, even amidst legal challenges. This comes at a time when XRP has surged to a multi-year high of $1.60, with growing optimism in the crypto market. XRP’s Strong Market Performance In the meanwhile, XRP is currently in a strong bull run, trading above $1.50, with a 6% gain in the past 24 hours and a 20% increase over the last week. It’s eyeing the $1.60 mark, though it faces resistance between $1.60 and $1.70. If it breaks through, it could quickly hit $2. Analysts predict that if the price drops, solid support levels around $1.25 to $1.30 will prevent significant losses. If it breaks above $1.50 has already shifted previous resistance levels into support, setting XRP up for further growth. Looking Ahead: Positive Outlook for December Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, forecasts that XRP could continue its positive movement into December, potentially reaching as high as $2.57. This bullish prediction is supported by recent market trends and the anticipated launch of an XRP ETF, which could further influence the token’s price.",News|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 07:20:21

Notably, burn statistics on Saturday indicated a whopping 7,400% uptick in the crypto’s weekly burn rate, as roughly 2 billion coins were destroyed. In turn, crypto enthusiasts are eyeing a potential $0.0004 target for the renowned dog-themed meme coin ahead amid a bullish Q4 market. SHIB Burn Surges 7,400% Weekly As Kaaldhairya Burns 80M Coins According to the official tracker Shibburn on X, the SHIB weekly burn soared 7,418% on Saturday, November 30. This colossal surge comes against the backdrop of 1.93 billion coins removed from the meme token’s market supply. Notably, with the massive burn surge weighing in, the dog-themed meme coin ‘s total supply at the time of reporting was evaluated as 589.26 trillion tokens. For context, the meme coin’s token burn mechanism helps in reducing the asset’s excessive market supply by transferring it to a null address. These tokens can never be retrieved, thereby delivering a considerable blow to the crypto’s supply. In turn, market watchers anticipate a bullish effect on the asset’s price, reflecting the law of supply and demand. Intriguingly, it’s also worth mentioning that Shiba Inu exec Kaaldhairya appears to have contributed significantly to the burn rate surge mentioned above. Kaal took to X as of November 30, revealing that the ecosystem’s semi/auto burns have been working for months, burning over 300M tokens to date. Moreover, the exec said, “I just burned 80M+ SHIB a few minutes ago and enjoyed the cool animation at the end.” While these statements solidified optimism about the meme coin’s long-term prospects, they also cleared any misconceptions about the auto-burns designed to reduce the excessive supply. Additionally, the same exec also revealed that the recent maintenance on Shibarium is complete and that the bridge is now fully functional. This development has further solidified the meme coin’s leading stance in the broader sector. On the other hand, Kaaldhairya also revealed that the team is “still working on upgrades for the burn contracts,” igniting additional discussions over future price movements. What’s Ahead For SHIB Price? At the time of reporting, SHIB price traded at $0.00002593, down marginally by 0.06%. Its intraday low and high were $0.00002551 and $0.00002633, respectively. Besides, the monthly chart for the coin shows a 39% uptick, underscoring optimism in light of the SHIB burn surge and community advancements. Simultaneously, a Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape Media revealed that the token eyes potential gains ahead, although the chances of a $1 target this year remain slim. Besides, if the coin sustains its monthly bullish momentum, it could break the resistance of $0.00003. This bullish drive could further pave the path for a $0.0004 price target in turn. Meanwhile, rising Shiba Inu whale accumulations have added to market optimism surrounding the coin’s price action ahead. CoinGape Media reported a major whale to have continued bagging the token amid a bull market. Simultaneously, crypto market participants continue to monitor the meme-themed coin for further price action shifts in light of optimistic statistics.

33767162,[object Object],1732951837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Is Bitcoin Poised for a $150K Rally? Insights from a $20T Global Money Supply Projection,https://bitcoinist.com/ibitcoin-poised-for-150k-rally-global-money-supply/,"The latest insight from experts has revealed that Bitcoin is poised to benefit from a massive liquidity injection projected for 2025, potentially drawing $2 trillion in new investments into BTC. This prediction stems from expectations that the US Federal Reserve will significantly increase the global money supply, which could boost BTC’s market cap and price performance . Liquidity Growth And Bitcoin’s Market Implications According to Jamie Coutts, a chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, the global money supply, also known as M2, is expected to grow from its current $107 trillion to over $127 trillion in 2025. This 18% increase in liquidity, spurred by economic factors and monetary policies, may act as a critical catalyst for BTC. Coutts highlights that BTC has historically captured around 10% of newly injected liquidity, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could see significant inflows during this upcoming period. Coutts explained that BTC’s performance is closely tied to liquidity movements in the global financial system. Historical data reveals that between Q4 2022 and the present, the global M2 money supply rose from $94 trillion to $105 trillion. Global M2 bottomed at $94T in Q4 2022 and has since climbed to $105T. During this period, Bitcoin’s market cap 5x’ed, adding $1.5T. In other words, 10% of the new money supply has leaked from the fiat system into the emerging global reserve asset of Bitcoin (gold, equities etc… pic.twitter.com/w0vWIMufbg — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) November 28, 2024 During the same period, Bitcoin’s market cap increased fivefold, adding $1.5 trillion. These figures indicate that Bitcoin absorbed roughly 10% of the new liquidity entering the system, reinforcing its role as an emerging global reserve asset. With the projected $20 trillion liquidity boost in 2025, Bitcoin could potentially attract $2 trillion in new investments. Coutts’ analysis highlights that monetary debasement, alongside Bitcoin’s superior annualized returns exceeding 113%, will likely enhance the cryptocurrency’s institutional adoption . This trend positions BTC as an “increasingly attractive alternative” to traditional investment vehicles , particularly as concerns over fiat currency strength persist. Bitcoin’s 2025 Prospects and Institutional Adoption Coutts further predicts that the global M2 money supply will peak on January 26, 2026, as economic policies continue to expand monetary bases. This timeline aligns with forecasts of BTC’s price potentially reaching $150,000 in 2025. This growth is expected to be fueled by weakening confidence in the US dollar and the broader fiat system, encouraging investors to seek alternative stores of value. Notably, institutional interest in BTC is also likely to rise as the asset demonstrates its resilience and profitability.

A CryptoQuant analyst, G a a h, recently shared insights indicating heightened selling pressure within the market, which could signal caution for traders. At the core of this analysis is the delta between buy and sell taker volumes—a key metric used to gauge the market’s behaviour . Bitcoin Faces Increased Selling Pressure According to the analyst, the buy and sell taker ratio metric has reached levels comparable to those recorded in July 2024. This marks a period of heightened selling activity, attributed to profit-taking by investors, market uncertainty, or mass liquidations. The analyst noted that these developments coincide with an uptick in volatility and aggressive actions in the futures market. Notably, $430 million in long positions were liquidated within a week, highlighting the significant reaction from sellers. G a a h also revealed that the liquidation of long positions, which reached its fourth-highest peak in 2024, has had a notable effect on Bitcoin’s price behaviour. This volume of liquidation often result in a “redistribution of capital,” leading to temporary reversals or consolidation phases, the CryptoQuant analyst noted. Historically, these liquidation-driven price movements have also acted as pivotal moments, either reinforcing support levels or triggering further sell-offs. Outlook and Precautions For BTC Traders The analyst pointed out that sustained selling pressure could negatively influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the short term. As such, continuous monitoring of market indicators and risk management is important for investors aiming to navigate these conditions. G a a h added: Defensive strategies [such as reducing leverage and setting stop-losses] and continuous monitoring of the market are recommended to avoid excessive exposure at this time of dominant selling pressure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued with its positive performance. Over the past day, the asset has increased by 1.6% bringing its price above $97,000 . Although Bitcoin is still 2.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $99,645, there appears to still be a form of bullish sentiment in its market. According to recent analysis from renowned crypto analyst known as Javon Marks on X, Bitcoin’s 2-hour time frame on the chart has “confirmed” a notable bullish signal. This confirmation makes the rally to $100,000 price mark imminent and the current target at $116,652. #Bitcoin (BTC)’s 2h chart has confirmed a high conviction signal for a full recovery and continuation!

The market has recently favored XRP as it has breached a long-standing descending trendline against Bitcoin. However, it has to cross crucial levels to begin the bull run. This trendline had previously acted as a formidable resistance, with XRP struggling to overcome it during an attempt in July 2021. However, it has now gained a remarkable 111% against Bitcoin in November alone, signaling a potential resurgence in investor interest. Analyzing the #XRP price in Dollars vs Bitcoin shows us how early we are in this bullrun. We are still 1,500% behind in Bitcoin value compared to early 2017. If we meet the same Bitcoin value $XRP price will be around $20. pic.twitter.com/ofxd6Izv5g — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 26, 2024 A Lofty Target for XRP According to CryptoBull’s analysis, the significance of this breakout lies in the historical context. Before the current market conditions, XRP had been underperforming Bitcoin for an extended period, since it reached its all-time high in early 2018. The prolonged period of XRP’s relative weakness against Bitcoin has now been challenged, as the asset appears to be regaining its footing. CryptoBull believes that XRP’s current bull run is still in its early phase, suggesting it still has room for further upside. The analyst’s projection is based on the premise that if XRP can reclaim its 2017 peak against Bitcoin, it could reach a price target of around $20. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In 2017, XRP’s peak against Bitcoin was 0.0002454 BTC. The cryptocurrency achieved this in May 2017, following a remarkable gain of over 300% against the leading cryptocurrency in the preceding three months. Currently, XRP is trading at a mere 0.00001544 BTC, indicating that it is still at almost 1,500% below the historical high. Given the recent positive momentum , CryptoBull believes that a similar rally to the one witnessed in early 2017 could propel the altcoin to its aforementioned $20 price target. Based on the current Bitcoin price of around $95,000, which would translate the 0.0002454 BTC peak into a $23.3 XRP price. CryptoBull’s projection has instilled optimism among XRP enthusiasts, who closely monitor the altcoin’s performance. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.87. Other crypto experts have predicted the $20 target for XRP. If it can repeat its 300% surge against Bitcoin, it could outperform Bitcoin in December and January next year to reach this level.

As a result, the majority of the cryptos, specifically altcoins, are trying to rise above their pivotal resistance, which may further assist them in marking new highs during the upcoming bull run. Moreover, the possibility of a strong altseason has also emerged as Ethereum, which is known as the base for the other altcoins, has launched a strong bullish attack. For the first time, Ethereum ETFs have outpaced the BTC ETF. The recent rise in the ETH price seems to have caught the investor’s attention, which has reflected in the spot ETH ETFs volumes. The ETFs witnessed a massive surge in net flows, recording $333 million, surpassing BTC, which is around $320 million, between November 22 and 27. Out of this, Blackrock alone accumulated over $250 million. Source: X As ETH continues to outshine, it’s clear that the investor’s confidence is shifting, which may further lead to a major change in its value. The ETH price is ready to surge higher with the trend continuation after the breakout of the inverse head-and-shoulder pattern followed by a successful retest. This suggests the interim target of the ETH price rally is somewhere above $5500. After a successful breakout in the short term, the ETH price has become favourable for bulls in the long term. The price, which is trading along an ascending support line, is about to test the final resistance zone below the ATH between $3870 and $4016. The bulls are trying for a breakout before reaching the apex of the ascending triangle as the RSI is incremental and the Gaussian channel has turned bullish. Therefore, the ETH price is believed to surpass the resistance zone and enter the final resistance at the ATH. Meanwhile, the volume raises some concerns, which remains pretty lower than the bull run range. However, these volumes seem to be flowing into the ETFs, which keeps the bullish hopes alive. According to some reports, the institutions are investing more in technology than the ETH price. Therefore, this suggests the growing confidence in the platform, which may keep up the elevated trend, reaching a 5-digit level too.",Price Analysis|Ethereum|Ethereum ETF,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-30 07:36:21

This paradigm shift isn’t just technological—it’s reshaping industries and creating a gold rush of new career opportunities. If you’re seeking to align your career with the cutting edge, Web3 might be the perfect frontier. What Is Web3? Web3, or the decentralized web, leverages blockchain technology to enable peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries.

And this transformation requires a new breed of professionals who can help build and sustain this digital ecosystem. Why Web3 Is the Career Frontier of the Future Web3 is more than a buzzword—it’s a rapidly expanding industry. In 2023, the global blockchain market was valued at over $10 billion, with projections to grow exponentially. Companies, from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, are heavily investing in blockchain, NFTs, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). For job seekers, this means a wealth of opportunities. As traditional industries like finance, gaming, and healthcare explore decentralized solutions, the demand for skilled Web3 professionals is skyrocketing. Unique Web3 Career Paths 1.

Pink Shiba Inu (PINKSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PINKSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pink Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pink Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Pink Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pink Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pink Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6cPu1KvERtjkPK8RuiwpjpTZ4kYfY5KzrG48d5wyD2XX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PINKSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-11-30 07:52:00

Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing the game by combining the stability of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. It takes reliable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once only available to a few. By using blockchain, Ondo makes financial systems better and more accessible to everyone. It has two main parts: one creates tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to make these products more functional and scalable. In a market that’s often uncertain, Ondo stands out by focusing on trust and security. It works with well-known partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase to keep crypto assets safe. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and follows legal and regulatory rules closely. One of its key products, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but offers yields. It’s backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits, giving it stability. For non-US investors, this means access to top-quality, regulated, and clear financial products. With the current interest in secure and transparent crypto options, Ondo’s approach could appeal to many looking for reliable investments in the blockchain space. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, known by its token AVAX, is turning heads in the blockchain world. It’s a Layer-1 platform that’s eco-friendly, boasts low fees, and processes transactions at lightning speed—up to 4,500 per second. One standout feature is its ability for users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility and scalability. Avalanche uses a unique consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto methods, ensuring transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. The platform operates with three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which handle different tasks like transactions and smart contract execution. AVAX serves as the backbone of the Avalanche ecosystem. It’s used for paying transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and powering multiple Subnets. This strong utility positions AVAX well in the current market. With the growing demand for fast and affordable blockchain solutions, Avalanche stands out among competitors. Its eco-friendly approach and rapid transaction times address key challenges in the industry. While markets are always shifting, Avalanche’s technology and versatility make it a noteworthy player in today’s crypto landscape. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects these digital agreements to real-world data. This means a smart contract can access information like weather reports or stock prices. Chainlink does this through a network of oracles, which are like messengers that bring data from outside sources to the blockchain. They use a reputation system to make sure the data is accurate and reliable. In the current market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a big problem: getting real-world data onto blockchains. This makes smart contracts more useful and opens up new possibilities. Unlike many other coins that focus on payments, Chainlink focuses on data and functionality. Its token, LINK, rewards those who provide data and helps secure the network. As more businesses look to use blockchain technology, the demand for Chainlink’s services could grow. This unique approach makes LINK an interesting option to watch in today’s market. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain platform that puts security first. It’s designed to meet real-world regulatory requirements, making it a trustworthy choice for institutions and developers.

Martinez tells his 91,300 followers on the social media platform X that online searches for the keyword “Bitcoin” are in the bottom 50th percentile, suggesting low interest relative to the levels usually experienced at the height of bull markets. “Investor sentiment remains subdued, far from euphoric—indicating Bitcoin may still have significant room to grow before reaching a market top.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $97,450 at time of writing. Next up is Ethereum. Martinez says that Ethereum could rally by around 67% from its current level over the medium term. Over the long term, the he says the top altcoin could go up by nearly 180% over the coming weeks, eclipsing its all-time high of around $4,900 reached in November of 2021. Based on Martinez’s chart, it appears that Ethereum is in an ascending channel on the weekly time frame and the medium-term target price sits around the upper boundary of the channel. In technical analysis, an ascending channel consists of upward-sloping parallel trendlines and is an indication of a strong uptrend.

Martinez says that the flagship memecoin is at a “very critical resistance point.” The crypto analyst says that Dogecoin could plunge by up to 17% from current prices if it fails to convincingly cross above the major resistance area. “A sustained break above $0.40 will send it to $0.43, but failing to clear the $0.40 resistance will trigger another dip to $0.36 or even $0.34!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.41 at time of writing.
