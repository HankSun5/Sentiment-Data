While Cardano is struggling with bear market conditions and is trading well below most of its key moving averages, Mutuum Finance is flourishing; raising over $18.9 million, supported by over 18,140 unique community holders. The presale is in the final stages of phase 6, and the price of the tokens is $0.035. The price is scheduled to increase, making it a great consideration by anyone looking to invest in an asset with great flexibility. The unique revenue earning mechanism coupled with the precious tokens makes this cheap crypto a great consideration for anyone looking to invest, positioning the token as one of the most flexible to enter the market. Cardano’s Problems Show Change in the Market Cardano (ADA) is still in a noticeable downtrend. More technical indicators show ADA is still making lower highs and losing momentum. The asset is still below the 20-day and 50-day moving average lines. The RSI is still in the bearish low range. This shows ADA is losing strength. Even though some long-term estimates predict a recovery to $1.01 by 2026, higher price points have strong resistance around the $0.48 to $0.53 range. Players are beginning to invest in multiple opportunity projects in the market. The market is showing great interest in what crypto to invest in and the best opportunity is in presale projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to the lower entry price and new narratives. Last Chance To Buy Mutuum Finance Presale in Phase 6 Unlike the large caps’ price stagnancy, the presale of Mutuum Finance is the last chance to get these tokens cheap, as they are currently priced at $0.035. The project is currently at the end of their Phase 6 presale and has raised $18.9 million with 18,140+ holders. As with any presale, the later phases sell out very quickly, and in Phase 6, over 95% of the tokens have been already bought by the presale investors. Phase 6 is about to sell out completely and will be the last time investors have the chance to buy these tokens at this price. After sellout, more tokens will become available in Phase 7, priced at $0.040, further increasing the importance of this Phase 6 closing window. For anyone interested in the best cryptos to buy right now, this is their last chance to invest in a well-developed protocol and is a clear front-runner considering the potential the protocol has. Buy-and-Distribute Stablecoin Sustainable Value In addition to the presale success, Mutuum Finance is designing a model centered around their stablecoin. The network is deploying a buy-and-distribute strategy, where ecosystem activity is tied to the token’s value. A portion of all protocol fee revenue is directed toward the purchase of MUTM tokens off the open market. Tokens that are bought are redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens, the interest-earning liquidity receipts. This forms a cycle where the focus on platform usage creates fee revenue which drives buy pressure on the MUTM token and distributes rewards to stakers. The model is a fundamental growth driver that provides the project a reputation as one of the best cryptos to invest in for users seeking real value and flexibility in tokenomics, deflationary pressure, and no speculatory hype. Get Ready for Upcoming Success In terms of the almost finished presale stage and self-sustaining economic structures in place, Mutuum Finance is in the position for a good trajectory after listing. While Cardano is still busy with some technical issues, MUTM is gaining momentum and getting closer to the mainnet launch. The remaining tokens in Phase 6 is the last chance to get these tokens at the lowest price. This is a no-brainer for investors that are analyzing which new crypto to buy. The new crypto has an ecosystem that is planned to grow, and the tokens will appreciate with it. The price point on these tokens will go up, and if buying now is not on your to-do list, you will be unfortunately missing out on a chance to be an early investor in an impressive new asset that will level up the DeFi marketplace.

54865320,633456,1764032406,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Regains Strength With a $2,800 Rebound, Will BitMine’s $59M Bet Break the Downtrend?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-regains-strength-rebound-will-bitmines-59m/,"Ethereum (ETH) is showing early signs of stabilization after a turbulent month, bouncing back above the crucial $2,800 level as fresh institutional inflows reignite optimism across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Quantum-Break Catastrophe Is Pure FUD, Says Gabor Gurbacs ETH currently trades near $2,821, up modestly over the past 24 hours, with traders closely watching to see whether this rebound can evolve into a sustained trend reversal. The renewed momentum follows major accumulation from BitMine, which has doubled down on its Ethereum strategy despite steep market drawdowns. BitMine’s $59M ETH Accumulation Sparks Fresh Investor Confidence The catalyst for Ethereum’s latest recovery came on November 23, when blockchain data confirmed that BitMine acquired 21,537 ETH worth roughly $59–60 million. The purchase increases the company’s total holdings to more than 3.5 million ETH, equivalent to approximately 3% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. While Ethereum prices have fallen nearly 30% in the last month, BitMine maintains that the downturn stems from a temporary liquidity shock rather than deteriorating fundamentals. Bitmine is simultaneously expanding its ecosystem footprint through its upcoming MAVAN staking network, expected to launch in early 2026, and recently announced a dividend issuance, moves that collectively signal long-term conviction. Investors appear to be taking notice. Exchange reserves have dipped to multi-year lows as whales continue accumulating ETH, even as traditional ETF products face outflows. This divergence suggests deep-pocketed players view the current range as a strategic entry zone. Ethereum Battles the Downtrend but Momentum Improves Despite the bounce, Ethereum remains inside a steep descending channel, with resistance stacking between $2,947 and $3,000. This zone contains compressed EMAs, trendline resistance, and the upper Bollinger Band, making it the first major test for buyers. A clean break above $3,000 could pave the way for ETH to reach $3,120, $3,250, and potentially even $3,450. However, a failure at this level may send ETH back toward $2,760 or lower. Indicators remain mixed. The RSI near 40 signals oversold conditions, hinting that a reversal may be developing, while the MACD and moving averages still indicate lingering bearish pressure. Rising open interest and elevated long-short ratios across exchanges reflect aggressive long positioning, momentum that could amplify volatility in either direction. Institutional Products and Upgrades Add Momentum Beyond price action, Ethereum continues to gain structural support. The Singapore Exchange just launched regulated ETH perpetual futures, giving institutions a compliant on-ramp. Meanwhile, anticipation builds around Ethereum’s December Fusaka upgrade , expected to deliver meaningful scalability improvements. With whales accumulating, institutional demand rising, and network upgrades approaching, Ethereum’s rebound above $2,800 may be more than a dead-cat bounce.

Many analysts are leaning toward calling the start of a new bear market, arguing that Bitcoin likely topped in early October near $126,000. Momentum has weakened sharply since then, and investor behavior now reflects a shift toward risk-off positioning. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse A new report from CryptoOnchain, published via CryptoQuant, highlights one of the most significant developments of this cycle: a historic 63,000 BTC has moved from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs). This unprecedented transfer is clearly visible in the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change chart, which shows a massive red bar — a negative daily difference signaling heavy outflows from long-term holder wallets. This type of behavior typically appears during late-stage bull markets or near local and cycle tops, when long-time investors with substantial profit margins begin realizing gains. At the same time, the corresponding Short-Term Holder Net Position Change chart shows a huge green bar, confirming that newer, more reactive market participants are buying these coins, often at elevated prices. Long-Term Holders Distribute as Short-Term Buyers Absorb Supply CryptoOnchain explains that the current market structure is being shaped by a clear divergence in behavior between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). LTHs — historically considered the “strong hands” of the market — are now heavily distributing, sending large amounts of Bitcoin into the market after months or even years of holding. At the same time, STHs are aggressively buying and accumulating this supply, often entering positions at elevated prices despite growing volatility. This dynamic is not inherently a bearish signal on its own. In fact, such transitions are common during late-stage bull markets, where early investors secure profits while new participants enter the market with fresh capital. It reflects a natural rotation of supply from experienced holders to newer ones, a pattern seen repeatedly in previous cycles. However, the volume of distribution is significant, and it raises an important risk: if incoming demand fails to fully absorb the coins being offloaded by LTHs, the market could face a deeper correction or extended consolidation phase. This supply pressure can weigh on price, especially in a context where sentiment is fragile and macro conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle Weekly Chart Signals a Critical Retest of Macro Support Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize around the $87,000 level after an intense multi-week sell-off that dragged price as low as $85,946. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has now tapped the 100-week moving average (green line), a historically important support level during bull-market retracements. This line acted as a springboard in previous cycles, but the current bounce remains weak and indecisive, reflecting the fear dominating the market. Momentum has clearly shifted bearish. The breakdown from the $110K–$100K consolidation zone triggered accelerated selling, confirming a loss of market structure on the weekly timeframe. Candles over the past three weeks show high-volume distribution, with sellers overwhelming demand each time Bitcoin attempted to reclaim higher levels. The steep slope of the 50-week MA turning slightly down is another sign that trend strength has softened. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details However, the reaction at the 100-week MA is critical. Bulls aggressively defended this area in prior macro corrections, and holding above $83K–$86K keeps the long-term bull structure intact. A weekly close below this zone, however, opens the door to deeper downside toward the 200-week MA near $56K–$60K.

This bold move comes just weeks after the same trader secured a substantial $2.8 million profit from previous Ethereum positions, signaling strong belief in ETH’s future performance. What Does This Massive Leveraged ETH Long Mean? The trader deposited 10 million USDC into Hyperliquid early this morning, immediately opening a $44.15 million long position on Ethereum with 5x leverage. This leveraged ETH long represents one of the most significant single-position bets we’ve seen recently from experienced cryptocurrency investors. The use of leverage amplifies both potential gains and risks, showing the trader’s conviction in Ethereum’s upward trajectory. Why Are Experienced Traders Bullish on Ethereum? This isn’t the first time this Bitcoin OG has shown confidence in Ethereum. The same address previously closed an entire long position of 55,133 ETH on November 11, realizing an impressive $2.8 million profit. Now, the return with another substantial leveraged ETH long suggests several key factors: Strong technical analysis supporting upward momentum Positive fundamental developments in the Ethereum ecosystem Market conditions favoring altcoin performance Institutional growing interest in Ethereum Understanding the Risks of Leveraged Positions While this leveraged ETH long position demonstrates confidence, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved. With 5x leverage, the trader faces amplified losses if the market moves against their position. However, experienced traders like this Bitcoin OG typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies including: Stop-loss orders to limit potential losses Careful position sizing relative to portfolio value Continuous market monitoring and adjustment Diversification across multiple assets What This Leveraged ETH Long Signals for the Market The timing of this leveraged ETH long position is particularly noteworthy. Coming after a successful previous trade, it suggests the trader sees continued upside potential in Ethereum. This move could influence other market participants and potentially signal: Growing institutional confidence in Ethereum Anticipation of positive market developments Technical breakout patterns forming Increased altcoin season momentum Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This substantial leveraged ETH long from an experienced Bitcoin OG provides valuable insights for all cryptocurrency investors.

Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, recently dropped a bombshell that’s shaking the crypto community. He declared that while artificial intelligence has clear, tangible use cases, cryptocurrency struggles to demonstrate real-world utility. This bold statement raises crucial questions about the future of digital assets and their place in our economy. What Are the Real Cryptocurrency Use Cases According to Critics? Kashkari’s criticism centers on one fundamental question: What problems does cryptocurrency actually solve? Unlike AI, which is transforming industries from healthcare to transportation, critics argue that cryptocurrency use cases remain largely theoretical. They point to several key areas where crypto has failed to gain mainstream traction. However, this perspective ignores the growing adoption in specific sectors and among certain demographics. The debate around cryptocurrency use cases isn’t new, but it’s gaining fresh urgency as regulatory scrutiny increases. Proponents counter that real-world applications do exist, including: Cross-border payments and remittances Decentralized finance platforms Digital ownership through NFTs Financial inclusion in developing nations How Does AI Demonstrate More Concrete Utility? Artificial intelligence presents a stark contrast to cryptocurrency when examining practical applications. AI systems are already embedded in our daily lives through virtual assistants, recommendation algorithms, and automated customer service. More importantly, businesses can clearly measure AI’s impact on efficiency, cost reduction, and innovation. The transparency of AI benefits makes it easier for policymakers like Kashkari to endorse. From medical diagnostics to supply chain optimization, AI delivers measurable results that cryptocurrency use cases often struggle to demonstrate at scale. This tangible value proposition gives AI a significant advantage in gaining institutional acceptance. What Challenges Do Cryptocurrency Use Cases Face? Several fundamental obstacles hinder wider adoption of cryptocurrency use cases. Regulatory uncertainty remains the elephant in the room, with governments worldwide grappling with how to oversee digital assets. Additionally, technical complexity and volatility create barriers for average users who simply want reliable financial tools. Security concerns also plague cryptocurrency use cases, with high-profile hacks and scams damaging public trust. Meanwhile, scalability issues continue to challenge many blockchain networks, limiting their ability to handle transaction volumes comparable to traditional payment systems. These practical hurdles make it difficult for skeptics like Kashkari to see cryptocurrency as anything beyond speculative assets. Where Are Cryptocurrency Use Cases Actually Succeeding? Despite the criticism, evidence of successful cryptocurrency use cases continues to emerge. In countries experiencing hyperinflation or capital controls, digital assets provide lifelines for preserving wealth and conducting international trade. The gaming industry has embraced blockchain technology for in-game assets, while content creators use crypto platforms for direct monetization. Moreover, institutional adoption is gradually increasing, with major companies exploring blockchain for supply chain management and settlement systems. These developments suggest that cryptocurrency use cases may be evolving rather than absent. The key question becomes whether these applications will achieve the scale and stability needed to convince mainstream skeptics. What Does the Future Hold for Cryptocurrency Utility? The path forward for cryptocurrency use cases likely involves greater integration with traditional finance and clearer regulatory frameworks. As the technology matures, we may see more hybrid solutions that combine blockchain efficiency with conventional financial security. The emergence of central bank digital currencies could also force innovation in the private cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, the success of cryptocurrency use cases will depend on solving real problems for real people. Whether it’s reducing remittance costs, enabling financial inclusion, or creating new digital economies, crypto must demonstrate value beyond price speculation. The conversation started by Kashkari serves as an important reality check for the entire industry. The debate around cryptocurrency use cases versus AI utility reflects broader questions about technological adoption and value creation. While Kashkari’s comments highlight legitimate concerns, they also ignore the gradual progress happening beneath the surface. The truth likely lies somewhere between the extremes – cryptocurrency may not yet match AI’s obvious utility, but dismissing its potential entirely would be premature. As with any emerging technology, the most meaningful applications often take time to develop and recognize. Frequently Asked Questions What specific cryptocurrency use cases did Kashkari criticize? While Kashkari didn’t specify individual use cases, his comments suggest he sees cryptocurrency primarily as speculative assets rather than practical tools for solving real-world problems. How does AI demonstrate more tangible benefits than cryptocurrency? AI shows measurable improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and problem-solving across multiple industries, making its value proposition clearer to policymakers and businesses. Are there any legitimate cryptocurrency use cases gaining traction? Yes, cross-border payments, decentralized finance, and digital ownership applications are seeing growing adoption, though not yet at mainstream scale. What would help cryptocurrency develop stronger use cases? Clearer regulations, improved scalability, better user experience, and demonstrated solutions to actual consumer problems would significantly advance cryptocurrency utility. Could cryptocurrency and AI work together in the future? Absolutely. Many experts believe blockchain and AI could complement each other, with crypto providing secure data exchange and AI offering advanced analytics capabilities. How do other Federal Reserve officials view cryptocurrency? Opinions vary among Fed officials, with some expressing cautious optimism about innovation while others share Kashkari’s skepticism about current utility.

This dramatic fluctuation highlights the volatility that can occur even with stablecoins designed to maintain consistent value. What Caused the USDC Price Spike on Bithumb? The USDC price spike occurred at approximately 1:08 a.m. UTC, when the stablecoin’s value surged to 6,120 won (about $4.43) on the South Korean exchange. This represents more than four times its typical trading value. Market analysts suggest several potential causes for this unusual USDC price movement: Technical glitches in trading algorithms Large mistaken market orders Liquidity issues during low-volume trading hours Potential manipulation attempts Fortunately, the USDC price spike was temporary, and the stablecoin quickly returned to its normal trading range near 1,503 won ($1.09). How Do Stablecoins Maintain Their Peg? Stablecoins like USDC are designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, making this USDC price spike particularly unusual. These digital assets achieve price stability through: Asset backing : Each USDC is backed by real US dollar reserves Redemption mechanisms : Users can always redeem USDC for $1 Market arbitrage : Traders profit from price discrepancies When a USDC price spike occurs, arbitrage traders quickly step in to sell at the higher price and buy back at the normal rate, effectively correcting the imbalance. Why Should Traders Monitor These Events? While the USDC price spike was brief, it offers valuable lessons for cryptocurrency investors. Such events demonstrate that even stable assets can experience temporary volatility. Traders should: Set limit orders to avoid buying at inflated prices Monitor multiple exchanges for price discrepancies Understand the redemption mechanisms for stablecoins Keep emergency sell orders ready for unusual price movements The rapid correction following this USDC price spike shows that market mechanisms generally work effectively to restore equilibrium. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Stability? This USDC price spike incident, while isolated, raises important questions about market infrastructure. However, the quick recovery demonstrates the resilience of modern cryptocurrency markets. The event highlights how automated trading systems and arbitrage opportunities help maintain overall market efficiency. Moreover, the temporary nature of this USDC price spike reinforces that these events are typically short-lived and don’t indicate fundamental problems with the stablecoin itself. Key Takeaways from the Bithumb USDC Incident The dramatic USDC price spike serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and occasionally unpredictable. However, the swift correction to normal levels shows that market forces effectively maintain stablecoin pegs over time. This USDC price spike event ultimately demonstrates the robustness of cryptocurrency market mechanisms. Frequently Asked Questions How long did the USDC price spike last? The price surge was extremely brief, lasting only minutes before correction mechanisms brought the price back to normal levels. Could traders profit from this USDC price spike? While theoretically possible, the speed of the spike made it difficult for most traders to execute profitable trades before the price corrected. Has this happened with USDC before? Minor price deviations occur occasionally, but a spike of this magnitude on a major exchange like Bithumb is relatively rare. Should I worry about my USDC holdings? No, the quick correction demonstrates that USDC maintains its peg effectively through market mechanisms and redemption options. Can I prevent buying during price spikes? Yes, using limit orders instead of market orders ensures you never pay more than your specified price for any cryptocurrency. Do other stablecoins experience similar spikes? All stablecoins can experience temporary price deviations, though most correct quickly through arbitrage trading. Found this analysis of the USDC price spike helpful?

While more miners compete to secure the blockchain, the reward per unit of computing power is falling, leaving even some of the largest operators struggling to break even. Bitcoin mining has long been a booming business for entrepreneurs looking to extract the cryptocurrency. Still, the energy-intensive process has become far less profitable due to its soaring electricity costs. However, growing competition, a decline in Bitcoin’s price, and rising operational costs are beginning to test the industry. The challenge of keeping mining profitable is so great that many miners are exploring high-performance computing and other artificial intelligence workloads to seek new revenue streams. In October 2025, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate broke the 1.1 zettahashes-per-second mark for the first time. The hashrate is the overall computing power committed to securing the network and validating transactions. And while higher hashrates contribute to Bitcoin’s security, they also make mining more challenging. Miners now face increased competition for the same rewards, and only the most efficient operators can maintain healthy margins. Meanwhile, the “hashprice,” a crucial measurement that denotes revenue per unit of computing power, has tumbled. By November, it had fallen to about $35 per PH/s, the lowest it had been in over five years. Declining Bitcoin prices and dwindling transaction fees are exacerbating the issue. As rewards in terms of coins per hash dwindle, many miners are struggling to recoup their electricity and equipment costs. Payback periods for new rigs are stretched out to more than 1,200 days, or over three years. Miners take on more debt to stay afloat To stay afloat, many mining companies are borrowing heavily. Convertible debt and other financial instruments are now crucial for paying increasingly high energy bills, upgrading equipment, and meeting daily expenses. Public miners, in particular, have taken advantage of the debt market aggressively in recent months, seeking to preserve liquidity as Bitcoin prices fluctuate. This already stretches the finances even further due to increasing overheads. Electricity rates in some of the major mining regions are higher, and second-hand equipment is more expensive than ever. Companies are facing regulatory and logistical hurdles, including permitting delays, supply chain challenges, and compliance with regulations. Others are hoarding Bitcoin as a hedge against market uncertainty. Larger inventories can cushion companies against short-term revenue fluctuations, but they also expose firms to price swings, adding to their financial uncertainty. That need has only intensified as miners face increasing pressure on their low margins and mounting debt. As the vice tightens, several miners are investigating high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence workloads to generate new revenue streams. Companies are no longer waiting to mine Bitcoin directly; instead, they are switching their infrastructure to host GPUs for AI cloud services and other compute-intensive tasks. Large operators have secured long-term agreements with technology firms to deliver such services. Others are going all in, gradually pivoting away from traditional Bitcoin mines to the business of AI data centers. For starters, Bitfarm says it will exit Bitcoin mining altogether by 2027 and redirect the hundreds of megawatts currently allocated for crypto mining to facilitate AI computing. Miners face rising risks and uncertain markets However, amid those struggles, some miners are finding new opportunities. Publicly listed companies have seen some recovery in stock prices, partially resulting from investor enthusiasm for the AI and HPC transition. Analysts say that companies able to manage costs effectively and diversify their operations will emerge stronger, while less efficient miners may struggle or be forced to exit the market. However, the path forward is far from clear. The price of Bitcoin remains volatile, and the difficulty and hashrate continue to increase. Additionally, there are energy costs, regulatory challenges, and capital requirements for growth to consider. The next year could be a moment of reckoning for the wider industry, one that divides firms capable of change from those fated to remain stuck in their ways.

This revenue outcome demonstrated outstanding performance for the software company’s diverse range of business tools. In a statement released on Monday, November 24, Zoom noted that its sales increased by 4.4% to reach an all-time high of $1.23 billion in the fiscal third quarter. The profit gained, after eliminating specific items, was reported at $1.52 per share. According to the earlier prediction presented by the analysts, a reliable source noted that the company’s average earnings were expected to be $1.44 per share. At the same time, revenue was estimated to total around $1.21 billion. Zoom makes significant progress in increasing revenue Recent reports highlighted that Zoom is expanding its reach in the tech market by broadening its offerings to provide business phone systems and software designed for contact centers. Notably, the company is famous for its popularly adapted videoconferencing application . Additionally, it launched the newest versio n of its artificial intelligence assistant during its September annual conference. This AI assistant included upgraded features that allowed users to develop custom AI tools for a monthly fee of $12. Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, commented on this progress . Yuan noted that they expected a substantial rise in AI Companion usage following the launch of their artificial intelligence assistant, AI Companion 3.0, in this quarter. He made these remarks after acknowledging rapid growth in Custom AI Companion and its AI-first Customer Experience suite. Meanwhile, reports from sources indicated that the company’s shares surged approximately 4% in after-hours trading. This increase occurred after the stock closed at $78.60 in New York on Monday of this week. The stocks, on the other hand, dropped drastically by 3.7% this year, following general concerns raised in the market regarding application software. Revenue collected from enterprise clients surged by 6.1% to reach $741.4 million. This figure exceeded analysts’ earlier prediction of $731.6 million. When reporters inquired about these impressive results, Zoom stated that it had a total of 4,363 clients at the time who had contributed more than $100,000 each within the past year. In the last quarter, the average monthly churn rate for individuals and small businesses was 2.7%. This percentage reflected a decline from 2.9% in the previous quarter. Sources explained that this decrease was observed after many casual users decided not to renew their Zoom licenses as pandemic restrictions eased. Rishi Jaluria admits that Zoom’s enterprise business continues to be a major strength During a call with analysts after Zoom’s revenue results were made public, Michelle Chang, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the company, confessed that they have implemented several processes to increase revenue while maintaining strong profitability and minimizing dilution. In the meantime, apart from increasing its revenue, Zoom also raised its total share buyback limit by $1 billion. The company, based in San Jose, California, stated that its revenue for this period would be approximately $1.23 billion following this achievement. Profit (excluding specific items) is estimated to be around $1.49 per share. Analysts, on the other hand, expected $1.23 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.45 per share. Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, acknowledged Zoom’s enterprise business as a major strength. According to Jaluria’s argument, investors are paying attention to the progress of the new AI companion tool, the stabilization of churn among casual users, and expected long-term profit margins.

The Financial Services Commission’s recent opposition to expanding the Bank of Korea’s authority signals a crucial turning point for cryptocurrency oversight in one of Asia’s most dynamic markets. Why Is Stablecoins Regulation Sparking Such Intense Debate? The heart of the controversy lies in balancing innovation with protection. South Korea’s FSC firmly believes that granting the Bank of Korea emergency powers over stablecoin issuers would create unnecessary burdens. They argue that small-scale issuers simply don’t pose systemic risks to monetary policy. This stance reflects a growing global conversation about appropriate stablecoins regulation frameworks. Moreover, the commission highlighted a significant gap in international precedent. No major economy currently provides direct liquidity support to stablecoin issuers through deposit insurance systems. This careful approach to stablecoins regulation demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to thoughtful policymaking rather than rushed decisions. What Specific Powers Did the Bank of Korea Seek? The proposed authority would have granted the central bank two key abilities: Request emergency orders from stablecoin issuers Conduct joint inspections of won-denominated stablecoin operations The FSC’s opposition centers on the belief that these stablecoins regulation measures would be excessive for smaller players. Since their trading volumes remain relatively low, they argue these issuers don’t significantly impact broader monetary policy. This nuanced understanding of stablecoins regulation shows regulators are considering scale and actual risk rather than applying blanket rules. How Does This Decision Align With Global Stablecoins Regulation Trends? South Korea’s position actually places it in careful company with other major economies. The FSC correctly noted that no leading financial jurisdiction has established direct liquidity support mechanisms for stablecoin issuers. This global hesitation stems from the unique nature of stablecoins regulation challenges. Stablecoins primarily function as payment methods rather than investment vehicles. Therefore, regulators worldwide are approaching stablecoins regulation with particular caution. The ongoing international discussions about appropriate oversight frameworks make South Korea’s deliberate stance both timely and strategic. What Does This Mean for South Korea’s Crypto Future? This decision represents a victory for measured growth in the digital asset space. By rejecting excessive stablecoins regulation for small issuers, the FSC supports innovation while maintaining necessary oversight. The approach acknowledges that not all market participants require the same level of scrutiny. The stablecoins regulation debate in South Korea will undoubtedly continue evolving. However, this initial position establishes important boundaries that could influence how other nations approach similar questions. It demonstrates that effective stablecoins regulation requires understanding both the technology and the market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar or Korean won. Why does the FSC oppose the Bank of Korea’s proposal? The FSC believes the proposed powers would be excessive for small-scale stablecoin issuers whose volumes don’t affect monetary policy. How does South Korea’s stance compare to other countries? South Korea aligns with major economies that haven’t established direct liquidity support for stablecoin issuers through deposit insurance. What powers was the Bank of Korea seeking? The central bank wanted authority to request emergency orders and conduct joint inspections of won-denominated stablecoin issuers. Will this decision affect cryptocurrency innovation in South Korea? Yes, by avoiding excessive regulation of small issuers, the decision supports continued innovation in the digital asset space. What happens next for stablecoin regulation in South Korea? Discussions will continue as regulators balance innovation with consumer protection in this rapidly evolving sector.

54867444,633215,1764036027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54867444.jpeg,"Bitcoin Capitulation Now Mirrors COVID, China Ban, and Luna Collapse Levels – Historical Stress Point",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-capitulation-now-mirrors-covid-china-ban/,"Bitcoin has officially entered a capitulation phase as relentless selling pressure and macro uncertainty push the market into one of its most stressful moments of the cycle. After reaching its $126,000 all-time high in early October, BTC has collapsed to a fresh local low near $80,000 in under two months — a stunning 35% drawdown that has shaken investor confidence. Many market participants who expected a continuation of the bullish trend are now facing steep unrealized losses, amplifying fear and forcing short-term holders to exit at a loss. According to top analyst Axel Adler, the strength of the US dollar has become one of the dominant forces behind this wave of capitulation. As the DXY index holds firmly above 100, global liquidity tightens, historical patterns show that Bitcoin short-term holders tend to realize losses more aggressively. Adler notes that this dynamic is currently playing out with intensity, mirroring previous phases of market stress. However, not all signals point downward. The probability of a December Federal Reserve rate cut has climbed to 69%, and Adler suggests that if markets begin pricing this more aggressively, it could flip macro momentum and trigger a reversal . For now, Bitcoin remains in a fragile state — but a macro catalyst may be forming. Short-Term Holder Capitulation Deepens as Macro Pressure Overrides Behavioral Signals Axel Adler explains that short-term holders are now realizing losses with an intensity comparable to some of Bitcoin’s most violent historical shocks — including the COVID crash of 2020, the China mining ban in 2021, and the Luna collapse in 2022. The latest data shows that SOPR Momentum, a key indicator of realized profitability, has dropped nearly to 0, a level that typically marks full capitulation among reactive market participants. Historically, readings this depressed have aligned with explosive V-shaped reversals or sharp relief rallies, as selling pressure becomes exhausted and stronger hands begin absorbing supply. However, Adler emphasizes an important nuance: while behavioral capitulation is clearly underway, macro forces currently dominate market structure. Extreme SOPR readings can produce bottoms, but they can also generate short-lived bounces within broader downtrends when macro conditions remain unfavorable. With the dollar index (DXY) still elevated above 100, liquidity remains tight — and Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure. Adler notes that everything now hinges on the Federal Reserve. If markets begin actively pricing in the December rate cut, it could weaken the dollar and relieve some of the stress weighing on BTC. Until then, macro remains the stronger force, overshadowing even severe capitulation signals. Testing Support After a Steep Breakdown Bitcoin’s price action on the 1D chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after one of the sharpest multi-week declines of this cycle. BTC dropped from the $126,000 peak to the $80,000–$86,000 range in less than two months, and the chart clearly reflects this capitulation structure. The series of long red candles highlights aggressive selling pressure, with bears firmly in control throughout November. The chart shows BTC trading below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—confirming a clear breakdown in trend structure. The 200-day MA around the mid-$88K region is now acting as resistance rather than support. This flip is typically a bearish signal and aligns with the ongoing macro-driven weakness highlighted by analysts across the market. Volume remains elevated during the downturn, reinforcing that the sell-off has been driven by strong hands exiting. However, the most recent candles show wicks forming near $83K–$86K, suggesting early attempts at demand absorption. If BTC can hold above the recent low around $80K and close back above the 200-day MA, the market could see a short-term relief rally.

Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The wider crypto market is finally flashing green, but the HBAR price is clearly outpacing the pack thanks to a wave of institutional interest, rising ETF inflows, and growing excitement ahead of Coinbase’s futures launch. Still, despite the bullish sentiment, chart signals warn that the token isn’t out of danger just yet. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview ETF Inflows, Futures Launch Fuel the Rally The sudden HBAR price acceleration comes at a moment when multiple catalysts are stacking in its favor. Trading volume has surged by more than 190%, pushing Hedera into the top gainer bracket of the day. A major driver is Coinbase’s upcoming rollout of 24/7 HBAR futures trading on December 5, which opens the door for more institutional hedging, speculation, and liquidity. The ETF space is also turning increasingly supportive. Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF has boosted its holdings to over 421 million HBAR, now valued at nearly $55 million, after three straight sessions of positive net inflows. Since its launch, the ETF has attracted over $72 million, a rare trend during a period when other major crypto funds, particularly those focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced significant outflows. Additionally, the IRS’s new stance allowing staking inside ETFs and the SEC’s updated listing standards have brightened the long-term outlook for HBAR-based investment products. Meanwhile, real-world adoption narratives are strengthening thanks to Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot on Hedera and tokenized ETF assets deployed. HBAR Price Bullish Setup, But Still Below Key Trendlines Technically, the HBAR price is showing early signs of a possible reversal. Analysts highlight a triple bottom pattern forming around the $0.123 zone, an area buyers have defended multiple times this year. Rising futures open interest and an improving long/short ratio add to the bullish backdrop. However, Hedera remains trapped beneath a dominant descending trendline that has rejected every rally since September. The 20-day EMA at $0.155 continues to cap upside attempts, while the 50- and 100-day EMAs reinforce heavy resistance above. Momentum indicators have improved, but the broader trend remains bearish unless the HBAR price decisively breaks above $0.155. Short-Term Outlook: Cautious Optimism If buyers maintain pressure, the HBAR price could retest the $0.16–$0.18 region. A clean breakout above the falling channel would set the stage for a larger move toward $0.228, the neckline of the triple bottom. But failure to overcome resistance keeps the token vulnerable to retracements toward $0.14, then $0.125, and potentially $0.10 if bearish momentum resurfaces.

Recent warnings from blockchain security experts suggest the official claim page may have been compromised, putting users’ funds at risk. What’s Happening with the Monad Airdrop? Cos, founder of renowned blockchain security firm SlowMist, has issued an urgent warning about potential security breaches affecting the Monad airdrop claim process. Multiple users report that wallet addresses displayed on the official claim page differ from those they originally registered. This discrepancy suggests a possible website compromise where hackers may have altered destination addresses to redirect funds. The security expert noted that a white-hat hacker previously identified similar vulnerabilities, indicating this exploit method isn’t new to the crypto space. How Can You Protect Your Assets? While confirmation of active exploitation remains pending, extreme caution is essential during any Monad airdrop application. Here are critical safety measures: Double-check every wallet address before confirming transactions Verify website URLs to ensure you’re on the legitimate platform Use hardware wallets for additional security layers Monitor official channels for security updates Avoid rushing the claim process despite excitement Why Are Airdrops Particularly Vulnerable? Airdrops create perfect conditions for scammers because they generate significant user excitement and involve mass transactions. The Monad airdrop situation highlights how hackers exploit this enthusiasm to bypass security measures. Moreover, the technical nature of cryptocurrency transactions means once funds transfer to wrong addresses, recovery becomes nearly impossible. This makes prevention absolutely crucial for protecting your investments. What Should You Do Immediately? If you plan to participate in the Monad airdrop , take these proactive steps immediately. First, pause any claim attempts until security concerns resolve. Second, monitor official Monad communication channels for updates. Third, consider using alternative verification methods beyond the primary claim page. Finally, report any suspicious activity to both Monad developers and security firms like SlowMist to help protect the broader community. Conclusion: Safety First in Crypto Rewards The potential Monad airdrop compromise serves as a stark reminder that cryptocurrency security requires constant vigilance. While airdrops offer exciting opportunities for token distribution, they also present attractive targets for malicious actors. By exercising caution, verifying information, and implementing security best practices, you can navigate these opportunities while minimizing risks to your digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions How do I know if my Monad airdrop claim is safe? Currently, you should wait for official confirmation that security issues have been resolved before attempting any claims. Monitor official Monad channels for updates. What should I do if I already submitted a claim? Immediately check your transaction history and verify the receiving address matches your intended wallet. Contact support if you notice discrepancies. Can I recover funds sent to a wrong address? Unfortunately, cryptocurrency transactions to incorrect addresses are typically irreversible, making prevention critically important. How can I verify the legitimate Monad airdrop page? Always access the claim page through official Monad website links and verified social media channels, never through third-party links. Are hardware wallets safer for airdrop claims? Yes, hardware wallets provide additional security layers by keeping private keys offline during transactions. When will we know if the security issue is resolved? Security firms and Monad developers will announce when they’ve confirmed the platform’s safety. Follow their official communications.

This landmark transaction represents a significant shift in institutional crypto strategy and marks WLFI’s first-ever engagement with the HTX platform. What Does This Massive TRX Deposit Mean for Crypto Markets? The substantial TRX deposit occurred over a concentrated 10-hour period, according to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa.

Frequently Asked Questions How significant is a 40.71 million TRX deposit? This TRX deposit represents a substantial institutional move, indicating serious capital allocation and strategic positioning within the TRON ecosystem. Why did World Liberty Financial choose HTX for this deposit? The HTX selection suggests diversification strategy, potentially seeking better liquidity, competitive fees, or specific trading pairs not available on their usual exchanges.

The first spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund in the United States made its market debut with surprising results that have left crypto enthusiasts and investors buzzing with questions. What Exactly Happened with the DOGE ETF Launch? Grayscale’s highly anticipated DOGE ETF arrived on the New York Stock Exchange with mixed performance metrics. According to data from SoSoValue, the ETF recorded $1.41 million in trading volume during its first day. However, the most startling figure was the zero net inflows, indicating balanced buying and selling activity. The total net asset value settled at $1.71 million, creating an interesting starting point for this new cryptocurrency investment vehicle. This DOGE ETF represents a significant milestone for meme coin institutional adoption. Why Zero Net Inflows Matter for the DOGE ETF Zero net inflows tell us something crucial about market sentiment. This balance suggests that: Initial investor interest was matched by profit-taking The market found an equilibrium price point quickly There was no immediate rush of new capital into the DOGE ETF This trading pattern differs from other cryptocurrency ETF launches we’ve witnessed. The DOGE ETF’s debut reflects cautious optimism rather than explosive demand. Understanding the DOGE ETF Trading Volume Significance The $1.41 million trading volume indicates healthy market activity for a new financial product. This level of volume demonstrates: Substantial investor awareness and participation Liquidity that supports future growth potential Market maker engagement in the DOGE ETF ecosystem While not record-breaking, this volume establishes a solid foundation for the DOGE ETF’s future trading activity and market presence. What This Means for Dogecoin’s Institutional Future The launch of a DOGE ETF marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency mainstream acceptance. However, the zero net inflows suggest institutional investors might be taking a wait-and-see approach. This cautious stance could change as: More track record data becomes available Market conditions for meme coins evolve Regulatory clarity improves for cryptocurrency ETFs The DOGE ETF’s performance will be closely watched as an indicator of institutional appetite for alternative digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key Takeaways from the DOGE ETF Debut The initial trading day provided valuable insights about market reception. The DOGE ETF achieved respectable volume while maintaining balance between buyers and sellers. This suggests a measured rather than speculative launch, which could benefit long-term stability. As the first spot Dogecoin ETF in the U.S. market, this Grayscale product opens new doors for cryptocurrency investment strategies. The DOGE ETF creates accessible exposure to Dogecoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Frequently Asked Questions What is a DOGE ETF? A DOGE ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning or storing it. Why were there zero net inflows? Zero net inflows occur when the amount of money entering the ETF equals the amount leaving, indicating balanced investor interest without significant new capital injection. How does this compare to other crypto ETF launches? The DOGE ETF debut showed moderate volume compared to some Bitcoin ETF launches, reflecting the different market positions of established cryptocurrencies versus meme coins. Can the DOGE ETF impact Dogecoin’s price? Yes, increased institutional access through the DOGE ETF could potentially influence Dogecoin’s price dynamics and trading patterns over time. Is the DOGE ETF available to all investors? Yes, like other ETFs, the DOGE ETF is available to any investor with access to brokerage accounts that support NYSE trading.

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has just announced an urgent temporary suspension of Worldcoin (WLD) deposits and withdrawals starting at 10:00 a.m. UTC today. This crucial Upbit WLD suspension comes as the Worldcoin network undergoes a significant hard fork upgrade, requiring enhanced security measures and technical adjustments. Why Did Upbit Implement This WLD Suspension? The primary reason behind this temporary halt is Worldcoin’s network hard fork. Hard forks represent major protocol upgrades that create permanent divergences from previous blockchain versions. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily suspend services to ensure: Secure network transition during the upgrade process Proper wallet compatibility with the new blockchain Asset protection for all user funds Seamless integration with the updated protocol What Does This Upbit WLD Suspension Mean for Traders? While the Upbit WLD suspension affects deposit and withdrawal functions, important trading activities remain operational. Users can still: Execute WLD trading pairs on the exchange Monitor price movements and market trends Place limit and market orders Manage existing WLD holdings in their wallets However, traders should note that external WLD transfers to and from Upbit wallets will remain paused until the hard fork completes successfully. When Will Upbit Resume WLD Services? Upbit has confirmed the suspension is temporary, though the exact resumption time depends on the hard fork’s completion and subsequent network stability checks. Typically, such maintenance periods last several hours to ensure thorough testing. The exchange will provide updates through: Official website announcements Mobile app notifications Social media channels Email alerts to registered users How Can Traders Prepare During This Suspension? Smart cryptocurrency management during exchange maintenance involves several proactive steps. First, ensure you have alternative trading options if needed. Second, monitor official communication channels regularly. Moreover, avoid attempting deposits during the suspension period as transactions may fail or face delays. Finally, use this time to research the hard fork’s potential impact on WLD’s long-term value proposition. What Are the Broader Implications of This Upbit WLD Suspension? This temporary Upbit WLD suspension demonstrates the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation. Exchanges now prioritize security over convenience during critical network upgrades. Furthermore, such proactive measures help prevent potential fund losses and technical issues that previously plagued early blockchain projects. The careful handling of this hard fork reflects Upbit’s commitment to operational excellence and user asset protection. In conclusion, the temporary Upbit WLD suspension represents standard industry practice during significant network upgrades. While inconvenient for short-term transfers, this precautionary measure ultimately safeguards user assets and ensures smooth post-fork operations. The crypto community recognizes such responsible actions as essential for mainstream adoption and institutional confidence. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade WLD on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, all WLD trading pairs remain active. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. How long will the Upbit WLD suspension last? The duration depends on the hard fork completion and network stability. Typically, such suspensions last several hours to a day. Will my existing WLD funds be safe during this period? Absolutely. All user funds remain secure in cold storage during the maintenance period. Should I move my WLD to another exchange before the suspension? This isn’t necessary unless you require immediate withdrawal capabilities. The suspension is temporary and trading continues normally. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will announce the resumption through official channels including their website, app, and social media accounts. Could this suspension affect WLD’s price? Temporary suspensions during upgrades typically have minimal long-term price impact, though short-term volatility is possible. Found this update helpful?

This substantial capital movement represents one of the most significant single-day inflows for XRP spot ETFs this year, highlighting growing mainstream acceptance of digital asset investment vehicles. What Makes XRP Spot ETFs So Attractive to Investors? The recent $164 million inflow into XRP spot ETFs demonstrates several key advantages that make these investment vehicles increasingly popular. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency purchases, XRP spot ETFs offer regulated exposure to the digital asset through familiar brokerage accounts. Moreover, they provide institutional-grade security and eliminate the technical complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Investors benefit from several compelling features: Regulatory compliance and institutional oversight Simplified investment process through traditional brokerage platforms Enhanced security measures compared to personal wallet management Liquidity advantages during market volatility Breaking Down the $164 Million XRP Spot ETF Inflows According to data from SoSoValue, the November 24 inflows were distributed across four major XRP spot ETF providers. Grayscale’s GXRP led the pack with an impressive $67.36 million, followed closely by Franklin’s XRPZ at $62.59 million. The remaining inflows were split between Bitwise’s XRP fund at $17.71 million and Canary’s XRPC at $16.38 million. This distribution pattern reveals important market dynamics. The substantial allocations to established players like Grayscale and Franklin indicate that investors prefer providers with proven track records in digital asset management. However, the meaningful contributions to smaller funds suggest diversification strategies are also at play. Why Are Institutions Flocking to XRP Spot ETFs Now? The timing of these massive XRP spot ETF inflows coincides with several positive market developments. Regulatory clarity surrounding XRP has improved significantly in recent months, reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. Additionally, broader cryptocurrency market recovery and increasing adoption of blockchain technology by traditional financial institutions have created favorable conditions for XRP investment products. Several factors are driving this institutional interest: Improved regulatory outlook for XRP and digital assets Growing institutional adoption of blockchain technology Portfolio diversification benefits in uncertain economic conditions Long-term growth potential of the XRP ecosystem What This Means for the Future of XRP Spot ETFs The $164 million inflow represents more than just a single-day trading event—it signals a fundamental shift in how institutions approach XRP investment. As more traditional financial players enter the digital asset space through regulated vehicles like XRP spot ETFs, we can expect increased liquidity, improved price discovery, and enhanced market stability. This development also suggests that XRP spot ETFs are becoming mainstream investment options rather than niche products. The substantial capital allocation indicates that institutional investors now view these vehicles as legitimate components of diversified investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions What are XRP spot ETFs? XRP spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual XRP tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why are XRP spot ETFs important? These ETFs provide regulated, accessible investment vehicles for both institutional and retail investors, bridging traditional finance with digital assets. How do XRP spot ETFs differ from Bitcoin ETFs? While both are cryptocurrency ETFs, XRP spot ETFs track XRP specifically, which serves different use cases in cross-border payments and financial settlements. Are XRP spot ETFs safe investments? Like all investments, XRP spot ETFs carry risks, but they offer regulatory oversight and institutional custody that may reduce some risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. Can retail investors access XRP spot ETFs? Yes, retail investors can purchase shares of XRP spot ETFs through their regular brokerage accounts, similar to traditional ETFs. What factors affect XRP spot ETF performance? Performance depends on XRP price movements, market demand, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency market trends.

The sharp decline has flipped market sentiment decisively bearish, with many traders fearing that ETH has entered a prolonged downtrend. Bulls are struggling to establish a reliable support level, and the lack of strong buy-side reaction so far has only intensified uncertainty. Liquidity continues to thin out across major exchanges, reinforcing the narrative that the market is still deep in a risk-off phase. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse Yet, despite the heavy selling pressure and underwhelming price performance, not all major players are stepping back. In fact, some are doubling down. Fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that Tom Lee’s Bitmine — a well-known crypto-focused investment operation—continues to buy ETH aggressively at current prices. Bitmine has been one of the few entities consistently adding to its position during the downturn, signaling strong conviction that Ethereum remains undervalued in the long term. This divergence between retail fear and whale accumulation is becoming increasingly notable. As ETH hovers around a critical psychological level, the coming days may determine whether this whale’s confidence translates into broader market stabilization or remains an isolated bet against the prevailing trend. Bitmine’s Aggressive Accumulation Signals Confidence According to Lookonchain, Tom Lee’s Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation, purchasing another 28,625 ETH worth $82.11 million. This move reinforces the growing narrative that some of the market’s most sophisticated players are positioning for a rebound despite the prevailing fear and relentless selling pressure. Large-scale buying during deep corrections has historically aligned with early reversal zones, and Bitmine’s conviction adds weight to the idea that Ethereum may be approaching a significant turning point. Still, a recovery is far from guaranteed. ETH remains trapped near the $2,800 zone, a level that has acted as a fragile line of defense during this downturn. For momentum to shift, Ethereum must not only hold this area but also reclaim the $3,000 mark, which has now flipped into an important resistance zone. A decisive move above this level would signal that buyers are finally stepping back in with strength, potentially setting the stage for a broader trend reversal. Until then, the situation remains delicate. Bitmine’s accumulation offers a bullish signal, but without confirmation from price structure, Ethereum continues to walk a tightrope. A failure to hold current levels could invite another wave of capitulation, but stability here may spark the rebound whales seem to be anticipating.

Price has now pulled back to around $2,800, a level that aligns closely with the 200-week moving average—a historically important area where ETH has often found long-term support. This zone previously acted as a launchpad during major market reversals in both 2022 and mid-2023, making its defense crucial for maintaining broader structural strength. The recent breakdown below the 50- and 100-week moving averages highlights the intensity of the current selloff. Momentum clearly shifted in favor of bears over the past weeks, with several large red candles confirming aggressive distribution. However, ETH’s current stabilization attempt above the 200-week MA signals that buyers are finally stepping in, preventing a deeper slide toward $2,400.

He told listeners that a clear US regulatory framework and a formal banking license for Ripple would be the real switch that unlocks big institutional interest in XRP . That idea is getting attention in crypto markets today. CEO Sees Ripple As A Bank Gilbertie compared Ripple’s organization to a financial institution with strong capital and coordinated leadership. He pointed out that Ripple’s network includes many former employees who stay active in the wider ecosystem, which he said helps the company expand even when people move on. According to Gilbertie, the firm functions much like “a machine.” He also asked a sharp question about token sales: “Why would they want to sell XRP? They’re incredibly well capitalized.” That comment was offered to calm concerns that Ripple might flood the market with tokens. Ripple’s Token Strategy And Reserves Based on reports , Gilbertie believes Ripple has less motive to sell large amounts of XRP as its balance sheet grows and use cases for the token increase. He framed XRP as a tool that could be used by institutional clients and a bank, noting that holding tokens could be similar to how banks keep capital reserves. Critics point out Ripple has sold XRP in the past to fund operations. But Gilbertie argued that a licensed Ripple Bank would change how those holdings are treated and how often they are moved. Regulatory Clarity And A Banking License Regulatory clarity in the US is central to Gilbertie’s view. He said that a banking license , combined with clear rules, would open doors to products and clients who now wait on the sidelines. That is the milestone he expects will have the most direct impact on price and demand. Until regulators spell out how these services will work, many institutional buyers remain cautious. Market Moves And Volatility Volatility has marked XRP’s recent path. Reports noted that some market swings are part of a broader trend where assets that surged by “hundreds of percent” in the prior year then give back gains. Gilbertie described a 30–50% pullback as natural after big rallies. He added that falling volatility in major assets, plus more institutional entry through ETFs and a friendlier US administration toward crypto, may make markets calmer over time as more supply is held by long-term owners.

This strategic move could significantly enhance liquidity and trading efficiency in these emerging markets, creating new opportunities for investors and traders alike. What Does a Market Maker Actually Do? A market maker plays a crucial role in financial ecosystems by providing continuous buy and sell orders. This ensures that traders can execute transactions quickly and at stable prices. For decentralized prediction markets, having a reliable market maker like Galaxy Digital means better pricing and smoother trading experiences for everyone involved. Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital’s CEO, revealed they’re currently testing market making operations on a small scale. This cautious approach allows them to understand the unique dynamics of prediction markets before committing larger resources. The company’s extensive experience in cryptocurrency markets positions them perfectly for this expansion. Why Are Prediction Markets Gaining Traction? Prediction markets represent one of blockchain’s most promising use cases. They allow people to bet on real-world events, from election outcomes to weather patterns. However, these markets often struggle with liquidity issues that can deter participation. Enhanced price discovery through continuous liquidity Reduced spreads between buy and sell orders Increased market depth for larger trades Improved overall market stability Galaxy Digital’s entry as a market maker could solve these challenges. Their involvement brings institutional credibility and substantial capital, which typically leads to more efficient markets. This development signals growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets as legitimate financial instruments. What Challenges Do Market Makers Face? While the opportunities are significant, market making in prediction markets presents unique hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern, as different jurisdictions view prediction markets differently. Additionally, the volatile nature of event outcomes requires sophisticated risk management strategies. Galaxy Digital’s gradual approach demonstrates their understanding of these complexities. By starting small and scaling carefully, they can develop robust systems to handle market fluctuations and regulatory requirements. This methodical expansion reflects their commitment to sustainable growth in this emerging sector. How Will This Impact Crypto Traders? The involvement of established firms like Galaxy Digital brings multiple benefits to individual traders. Better liquidity means you can enter and exit positions more easily. Tighter spreads reduce trading costs, while increased market depth allows for larger positions without significant price impact. Moreover, institutional participation often precedes broader market adoption. As more reputable companies enter the prediction market space, we can expect improved infrastructure, enhanced security measures, and potentially clearer regulatory frameworks. These developments create a more trustworthy environment for all participants. What’s Next for Prediction Markets? The future looks bright for decentralized prediction platforms. With Galaxy Digital’s potential market making role, we’re likely to see increased competition and innovation in this space. Other institutional players may follow suit, leading to rapid market maturation and expanded use cases. This evolution could transform how we approach risk assessment and information aggregation. Prediction markets have the potential to become valuable tools for businesses, researchers, and policymakers seeking crowd-sourced insights about future events. Frequently Asked Questions What is a market maker in simple terms? A market maker is a company or individual that continuously provides buy and sell prices for assets, ensuring there’s always someone to trade with and helping maintain market liquidity. Why is Galaxy Digital’s involvement significant? As a well-established cryptocurrency firm, their participation brings credibility, capital, and expertise that can help prediction markets grow and become more accessible to mainstream users. How will this affect trading fees? Increased competition and better liquidity typically lead to lower spreads, which means reduced trading costs for individual participants over time. Are prediction markets legal? Regulations vary by jurisdiction. Some countries allow prediction markets for certain types of events, while others restrict them. Always check local laws before participating. When will Galaxy Digital start market making? The company is currently in discussions and testing phases. While no specific timeline has been announced, their gradual approach suggests careful planning before full-scale implementation. Can individual traders benefit from this development? Yes, better market making typically results in improved trading conditions, including tighter spreads, better liquidity, and more stable prices for all market participants.

Japan and South Korea led regional advances as Tokyo reopened after a holiday, while US shares had climbed at Monday’s close when tech stocks extended their recovery from last week’s slump and traders positioned for a busy data calendar. A gauge of Chinese companies listed in New York rose 2.8% after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held their first talks since agreeing a tariff truce last month.

The update reinforced the market’s sense that big tech remains at the centre of both the artificial intelligence trade and broader risk sentiment. $META IS REPORTEDLY IN ADVANCED TALKS TO DEPLOY $GOOGLE TPUS ACROSS ITS DATA CENTERS IN A DEAL THAT COULD BE WORTH BILLIONS. pic.twitter.com/RChQTsXduG — Shay Boloor (@StockSavvyShay) November 24, 2025 The major US indexes started the holiday-shortened week with solid advances, with strength in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of AI-related momentum stocks once again putting the Nasdaq in front. Signals from the Fed added fuel to the rebound. Fed Governor Christopher Waller lifted spirits on Monday by signalling support for a rate cut next month, helping to ease nerves after a choppy spell driven by worries over stretched AI related valuations and uncertainty about the policy path. Some investors now see November’s pullback as a possible prelude to a seasonal rally into year end. Dovish Signals From Multiple Fed Voices Push Rate Bets Higher Waller’s comments followed similar remarks from other policymakers. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly voiced support for a December cut in a television interview, while New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday that a near term reduction in borrowing costs remained on the table, reinforcing the market’s tilt toward easier policy. US 10-year Treasury yields slipped four basis points to about 4.02% on Monday as rate expectations shifted. Money markets now imply roughly a 90% chance that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate at the December meeting, a sharp change from the more hesitant pricing seen only weeks ago and a backdrop that tends to favour assets such as growth stocks and Bitcoin. Attention now turns to a full slate of economic releases. Ahead of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, September retail sales data due Tuesday are expected to show some cooling as households continue to wrestle with high prices. Producer prices and durable goods orders are also on the docket this week, while jobless claims covering the key November survey week will carry extra weight as the Fed leans on alternative indicators in the absence of regular payroll figures. Economic Reports Strengthen Market View That A December Cut Is Likely A batch of economic reports, released with a delay after a six-week government shutdown, has pointed to a softer labour market alongside stubborn inflation. That mix has strengthened the case in markets that the Fed can deliver what many see as a third and final rate cut of 2025 at the December meeting. Earnings have added support. By Friday, nearly 95% of S&P500 companies had reported third-quarter results, with about 83% beating estimates. Analysts now expect aggregate earnings growth of 14.7% for the quarter, compared with an 8.8% forecast at the start of October, according to LSEG data, giving equity bulls another reason to stay engaged. Crypto analysts are watching how Bitcoin trades against this backdrop. In a pattern seen earlier in 2025, the token has once again peaked ahead of major equity benchmarks, a sequence that some read as a warning that traditional markets could still face another leg of correction even as they bounce. Analysts at Bitfinex said recent on-chain data show a heavy wave of loss-taking, reflecting how top-heavy the market has become, with dense concentrations of buying between $106,000 and $118,000 now capitulating at a loss. They argued that this structure leaves two broad paths, either a strong resurgence in demand steps in to absorb ongoing selling, or the market is pushed into a longer and potentially deeper accumulation phase before it can find a more stable equilibrium.

The cryptocurrency perpetual futures market just experienced exactly that – a staggering $235 million in crypto futures liquidations that primarily devastated short sellers across major digital assets. What Caused These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations? The past 24 hours delivered a brutal lesson in leverage trading as crypto futures liquidations reached alarming levels. When prices move sharply against positioned traders, exchanges automatically close their leveraged positions to prevent further losses. This creates a cascade effect that amplifies market movements and creates tremendous pressure on both sides. Bitcoin led the carnage with $123 million in crypto futures liquidations, while Ethereum followed with $78.67 million. Solana traders faced even more severe consequences relative to its market size. The overwhelming majority of these crypto futures liquidations came from traders betting against the market. Which Assets Suffered the Worst Crypto Futures Liquidations? The distribution of pain across different cryptocurrencies reveals fascinating patterns about market sentiment and positioning: Bitcoin : $123 million total, with 66.42% short positions Ethereum : $78.67 million total, with 71.46% short positions Solana : $33.60 million total, with 84.96% short positions These crypto futures liquidations demonstrate how crowded short trades became before the market moved against them. Solana’s extreme percentage suggests traders were particularly bearish on the asset, leading to catastrophic results when prices rallied. Why Did Short Positions Dominate the Liquidation Wave? Market dynamics created a perfect storm for short sellers. When too many traders bet against an asset, any upward price movement triggers margin calls and forced position closures. These crypto futures liquidations then fuel further buying pressure as exchanges cover the short positions, creating a vicious cycle that amplifies the original move. The dominance of short positions in these crypto futures liquidations indicates widespread bearish sentiment that got caught wrong-footed. Traders likely anticipated price declines but instead faced a sharp reversal that obliterated their leveraged bets. How Can Traders Avoid Future Crypto Futures Liquidations? Surviving volatile markets requires disciplined risk management strategies. These recent crypto futures liquidations offer valuable lessons for all traders: Use appropriate position sizing to avoid over-leverage Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Monitor funding rates for crowded trade warnings Maintain adequate margin buffers for volatility spikes Understanding market sentiment extremes can help identify when crypto futures liquidations might occur. When too many traders lean one direction, the risk of violent reversals increases dramatically. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Signal for Market Health? While painful for affected traders, large-scale crypto futures liquidations actually serve an important market function. They help reset excessive leverage and restore balance between buyers and sellers. The market emerges healthier after flushing out overextended positions, though the process remains brutal for those caught in the crossfire. These crypto futures liquidations also demonstrate the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency markets. The mechanisms work similarly to traditional futures markets, providing price discovery while managing counterparty risk through automated position closures. Conclusion: Learning From the $235M Liquidation Lesson The devastating wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a stark reminder about the risks of leveraged trading. While the opportunity for amplified returns attracts many traders, the reality of sudden position closures can wipe out accounts in moments. The $235 million lesson teaches us that market sentiment extremes often precede violent corrections, and proper risk management remains the key to longevity in crypto trading. Frequently Asked Questions What are crypto futures liquidations? Crypto futures liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close leveraged positions because traders can no longer meet margin requirements, preventing further losses. Why were short positions hit harder in these liquidations? Short positions dominated because most traders were betting against price increases before the market moved upward, triggering massive position closures. How can I avoid getting liquidated in crypto futures? Use proper risk management, avoid over-leveraging, set stop-loss orders, and maintain adequate margin buffers for volatility. Which cryptocurrency saw the highest percentage of short liquidations? Solana experienced the most extreme short dominance with 84.96% of its $33.60 million liquidations coming from short positions. Do large liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, large liquidations can amplify price movements as exchanges automatically buy or sell to close positions, creating additional market pressure. Are crypto futures liquidations common? Liquidations occur regularly in volatile markets, but $235 million events represent significant market moves that reset excessive leverage.

The cryptocurrency community was buzzing with rumors about preferential terms, but the truth might surprise you. Let’s dive into the real story behind the Berachain investment controversy that’s making waves in the crypto space. What Really Happened with the Berachain Investment? Berachain has firmly denied allegations that it offered preferential investment refund terms to Brevan Howard. The controversy started when Unchained published an article claiming Brevan Howard’s 2024 investment agreement included a unique refund clause. However, anonymous Berachain founder Smokey The Bera took to X to set the record straight about this Berachain investment situation. The founder explained that Brevan Howard participated in the Series B round approximately 1.5 years ago through its Abu Dhabi-based Nova fund. Importantly, they emphasized that all investors received the same basic terms. This clarification addresses the core of the Berachain investment controversy directly. Understanding the Side Letter Agreement So where did the confusion come from? The founder acknowledged that Nova’s $25 million investment did include a side letter with specific provisions. However, this wasn’t about special privileges. The side letter granted Nova the right to request a refund one year after the Token Generation Event (TGE). This arrangement serves as protection for the fund’s principal investment. If the BERA token price falls significantly below the $3 investment price, Nova can recover its initial capital. The founder stressed this was a mutual agreement tied to the fund’s operating requirements. Why This Berachain Investment Matters for Crypto The transparency around this Berachain investment situation sets an important precedent for cryptocurrency projects. Here’s what makes this case significant: Investor confidence: Clear communication builds trust in the project Industry standards: Sets expectations for future crypto investments Regulatory clarity: Demonstrates proper disclosure practices Market stability: Reduces uncertainty for token holders This approach to handling the Berachain investment controversy shows maturity in how crypto projects manage investor relations. The Bigger Picture for Berachain Investment Strategy Looking beyond the current controversy, the Berachain investment strategy appears focused on long-term growth. The project’s handling of this situation demonstrates their commitment to fair treatment of all investors. The clarification about the Berachain investment terms shows they’re building for sustainable development rather than quick gains. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, transparent communication about investment terms becomes increasingly crucial. The way Berachain addressed these allegations could become a model for other projects facing similar scrutiny. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main allegation against Berachain? The main allegation claimed Berachain offered preferential refund terms to Brevan Howard that weren’t available to other investors. How did Berachain respond to the allegations? Berachain firmly denied the claims, stating that Brevan Howard invested under the same conditions as all other Series B participants. What is the side letter mentioned in the controversy? The side letter allowed Brevan Howard’s Nova fund to request a refund one year after token launch if the price fell significantly below their $3 investment price. Was this refund clause a special privilege? According to Berachain, this was not a special privilege but a mutual agreement related to the fund’s operating rules and liquidity requirements. How much did Brevan Howard invest in Berachain? Brevan Howard’s Nova fund invested $25 million in Berachain’s Series B round approximately 1.5 years ago. What does this mean for other Berachain investors? The clarification suggests all investors were treated equally, with the side letter being specific to institutional fund requirements rather than preferential treatment.

This strategic partnership marks a significant milestone in the evolution of regulated real-world assets on blockchain, bringing institutional-grade financial products to the decentralized ecosystem. Why Plume Network Stands Out in the Blockchain Space Plume Network has positioned itself as a specialized blockchain focusing exclusively on regulated real-world assets. The platform’s selection as the primary launch network for USDG0 demonstrates its growing influence in the digital asset space. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid and Aptos join as additional launch networks, creating a powerful trifecta for stablecoin deployment. The Plume Network ecosystem benefits tremendously from this partnership. Developers gain access to native liquidity and a regulated stablecoin foundation, while users enjoy exposure to U.S. Treasury rates through on-chain yield structures. This integration represents a major step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized applications. What Makes USDG0 Different From Other Stablecoins? USDG0 represents an expanded, cross-chain version of Paxos’s existing USDG stablecoin, which already boasts an impressive $997 million market capitalization. The key differentiators include: Full reserve-backing with regulatory oversight Cross-chain functionality using LayerZero’s OFT standard Direct exposure to U.S. Treasury yields Regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions The utilization of LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard enables seamless transfers between different blockchains. This technological foundation ensures that USDG0 maintains its value and regulatory status regardless of which blockchain it operates on. How Will Plume Network Transform DeFi Development? The integration of USDG0 into Plume Network creates unprecedented opportunities for DeFi developers. They now have access to a regulated stablecoin liquidity base that combines the security of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. This partnership addresses one of the biggest challenges in DeFi – the need for reliable, regulated stable assets. Developers building on Plume Network can leverage several key advantages: Native liquidity for faster transaction processing Regulatory clarity for compliant application development Yield opportunities tied to traditional financial instruments Cross-chain interoperability for broader user reach The Future of Regulated Assets on Blockchain This partnership between Plume Network and Paxos signals a broader trend toward regulated financial products entering the blockchain space. The combination of real-world asset tokenization with stablecoin technology creates a powerful foundation for the next generation of financial applications. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, platforms like Plume Network that prioritize compliance while maintaining decentralization will likely lead the market. The successful implementation of USDG0 on Plume Network could set a new standard for how traditional financial instruments integrate with blockchain technology. This development represents a crucial step toward mass adoption of decentralized finance by providing the security and reliability that institutional and retail investors demand. Frequently Asked Questions What is Plume Network’s main focus? Plume Network specializes in regulated real-world assets (RWA) on blockchain, providing a compliant platform for tokenizing traditional financial instruments. How is USDG0 different from other stablecoins? USDG0 is fully reserve-backed, regulated, and uses LayerZero’s OFT standard for cross-chain functionality while offering exposure to U.S. Treasury yields. Which other networks will launch USDG0? Besides Plume Network as the primary launch platform, Hyperliquid and Aptos will also serve as launch networks for the stablecoin. What benefits does USDG0 bring to DeFi developers? Developers gain access to regulated stablecoin liquidity, native yield structures, and cross-chain interoperability for their applications. Is USDG0 available on multiple blockchains? Yes, through LayerZero’s OFT standard, USDG0 can transfer seamlessly between different blockchain networks while maintaining its value and regulatory status. What is the current market cap of Paxos’s existing USDG? The current USDG stablecoin has a market capitalization of $997 million, demonstrating significant market trust and adoption.

The US spot Bitcoin ETFs just recorded a shocking $145.4 million net outflow, reversing the previous day’s gains and sending ripples through the digital asset market. This significant shift in investor sentiment demands immediate attention from anyone involved in Bitcoin ETFs. What Caused the Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Surge? According to data from TraderT, the outflow pattern reveals crucial insights about institutional behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest withdrawal at $143.48 million, representing the majority of the total outflow. This massive movement from one of the world’s largest asset managers signals potential concerns about short-term Bitcoin ETF performance. Other major players also contributed to the outflow trend. Ark Investment’s ARKB saw $11.65 million exit, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded a $5.79 million withdrawal. The coordinated nature of these outflows suggests broader market forces at play rather than isolated investor decisions. Is There Any Positive News for Bitcoin ETFs? Despite the overwhelming outflow trend, Fidelity’s FBTC emerged as the lone bright spot. The fund attracted $15.49 million in net inflows, demonstrating that some investors remain confident in specific Bitcoin ETFs. This divergence in performance highlights the importance of fund selection even within the same asset class. The market for Bitcoin ETFs continues to show volatility as investors weigh various factors: Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency Broader market conditions and risk appetite Specific fund management strategies and track records Short-term price movements in underlying Bitcoin assets What Do These Bitcoin ETFs Movements Mean for Investors? The sudden return to outflows after just one day of net inflows indicates ongoing uncertainty in the Bitcoin ETF space. This volatility pattern suggests that investors are actively rebalancing their positions rather than making long-term commitments to these Bitcoin ETFs. For current investors in Bitcoin ETFs, this development serves as a crucial reminder to monitor fund flows regularly. The concentration of outflows in specific funds like BlackRock’s IBIT underscores the need for diversified exposure across multiple Bitcoin ETFs to mitigate single-fund risk. How Should You Approach Bitcoin ETFs Now? The recent $145.4 million outflow from Bitcoin ETFs doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term trend reversal. However, it does emphasize the importance of understanding fund-specific dynamics within the broader Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Smart investors should consider both the quantitative data and qualitative factors when evaluating their Bitcoin ETF positions. Key considerations for Bitcoin ETF investors include: Track fund flow patterns over multiple periods Analyze fund manager reputation and strategy Monitor overall market sentiment toward Bitcoin Consider dollar-cost averaging to manage volatility Final Thoughts on Bitcoin ETFs Market Movement The $145.4 million net outflow from US spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency investments. While short-term fluctuations can be concerning, they also present opportunities for informed investors who understand the underlying market mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs. The divergence between Fidelity’s inflows and other funds’ outflows suggests that selective investment strategies may outperform broad market approaches in the volatile Bitcoin ETF space. As always, thorough research and careful position sizing remain essential for navigating these digital asset waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly holding digital assets. Why did Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? The outflows likely resulted from investor profit-taking, market uncertainty, or portfolio rebalancing strategies amid changing market conditions. Should I be worried about investing in Bitcoin ETFs? While outflows indicate short-term sentiment shifts, they don’t necessarily reflect long-term prospects. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Which Bitcoin ETF performed best during the outflow period? Fidelity’s FBTC was the only fund to record net inflows, attracting $15.49 million while others experienced withdrawals. How often do Bitcoin ETFs experience significant outflows? Bitcoin ETFs can experience regular flow fluctuations based on market conditions, though $145 million represents a substantial single-day movement. Can I still invest in Bitcoin ETFs after this outflow? Yes, outflows don’t prevent new investments. However, investors should research current market conditions and fund specifics before committing capital. Found this analysis of Bitcoin ETFs outflow helpful?

Prices fell more than 30% from an October peak near $126,000 to around $85,500, and that slump has cut the value of the coins believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto by roughly $41 billion. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Dumps Bitcoin At $90K After Predicting A $250K Moonshot – Here’s Why Satoshi’s On-Chain Holdings Under Scrutiny According to on-chain analysts, about 1.1 million BTC are attributed to Satoshi by patterns seen in early mining. Reports have disclosed that this total was worth about $138 billion at Bitcoin’s October high. Based on current prices, those holdings are now estimated at close to $96 billion. That places the pseudonymous owner below US billionaire Bill Gates, who is estimated at about $104 billion. These figures are estimates, and the methods used to tie addresses to the creator are debated. Early Mining Pattern Still Contested Arkham Intelligence and other blockchain researchers point to the so-called Patoshi Pattern as the key evidence linking many early blocks to one actor. The pattern is a technical signature in the way early blocks were mined. It is not proof of identity. Some experts say the pattern strongly suggests a single miner was responsible for many of the earliest coins. Source: Arkham Others caution that assumptions about ownership must be treated carefully. The wallets in question have been largely inactive for years. That inactivity makes the idea of liquidating such a stake more theoretical than practical. Market Volatility Highlights Paper Wealth Risk A lesson here is simple. When most of a fortune is in one asset, swings in price move the headline number a lot. The $41 billion drop is a paper loss. No sale was reported. The funds remain where they have been for years. Still, the change in valuation has pushed Satoshi down in hypothetical rich lists compiled by observers and crypto outlets. Wealth trackers that require verified identities, like Forbes, do not include Satoshi because the ownership and identity are not confirmed. Long-Term Questions Remain Based on reports, the discussion also revived talk about what dormant crypto holdings mean for public measures of wealth. Some commentators raised more speculative concerns, such as future technical threats that could affect custody of private keys. Those scenarios are distant and uncertain, and they remain a matter for technical debate rather than immediate reality. Related Reading: $2 Billion Gone In Minutes: Bitcoin Slide Shakes Crypto World What This Means For The Market Traders watching Bitcoin see how much headline numbers can swing. A 30% move in a few weeks changes math dramatically. Investors who focus on stable, diversified holdings might view this as another reminder of crypto’s big swings. For now, Satoshi Nakamoto remains silent, as always, despite his/her massive loss; and the coins attributed to the enigmatic crypto creator sit largely untouched — and their paper value will rise or fall with Bitcoin’s next moves.

According to the report, 150 million XRP was moved to an unidentified wallet. The transfer, valued at approximately 317 million USD at the time of execution, was recorded on November 24, 2025, and classified as originating from a wallet linked to Ripple . Although transfers of this magnitude are not unprecedented, they often attract scrutiny because of the influence such movements can have on perceptions of corporate activity, treasury management, and liquidity conditions. 150,000,000 #XRP (317,388,174 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/TOYGW2aejB — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 24, 2025 Details of the Transaction The transaction was executed on the XRP Ledger with a minimal fee of 0.0004 units, consistent with the network’s low-cost design. Whale Alert’s post listed the transfer as “from Ripple to unknown wallet,” indicating that the receiving address is not publicly identified or labelled within major tracking systems. Transfers from known institutional or corporate wallets to unlabeled accounts typically raise questions about the underlying purpose, especially when involving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of tokens. At the moment the transfer was detected, the asset was priced at approximately 2.1265 USD, placing the total value at just over 317 million USD. Potential Interpretations Behind the Movement Although the alert does not explain the transaction’s intent, several common scenarios may apply. One possibility is that this represents an internal treasury operation, such as shifting assets between custodial environments, redistributing holdings for security purposes, or preparing reserves for corporate activities. These kinds of transfers often occur without external announcements. The receiving wallet may be part of Ripple’s broader internal infrastructure, even if not publicly labeled as such. Another plausible interpretation is that the tokens were moved to a custody partner or institutional entity. Large asset managers, financial institutions, or liquidity providers sometimes receive high-value transfers. Such movements may precede operational uses. Without an exchange tag or identifiable institutional label on the receiving account, the purpose remains unclear. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A further possibility is that the transfer could be associated with over-the-counter arrangements. OTC activity is often conducted using wallets that are not publicly associated with exchanges, and high-value transfers may occur without immediate reflection on open market order books. In these cases, the size of the movement does not necessarily imply imminent market impact. Market and Ledger Context There has been no indication from public data that the transfer immediately preceded unusual price movement or abnormal liquidity shifts on major trading venues. Additionally, on-chain metrics are yet to display a pattern of redistribution from the receiving address, though this may change as further ledger activity develops. As with similar movements in the past, the absence of a clear label for the destination wallet means that definitive conclusions cannot be drawn solely from the alert.

This significant movement, recorded on November 24th, marks the second consecutive day of positive momentum for Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds, signaling renewed institutional confidence in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. What Drove the ETH ETF Inflow Surge? The recent ETH ETF inflow data reveals a dramatic shift in investor sentiment. After ten consecutive days of outflows, BlackRock’s ETHA fund led the charge with an impressive $88.22 million inflow. This reversal suggests that institutional investors are once again betting on Ethereum’s long-term potential. The timing of this inflow surge coincides with broader market recovery signals, making it particularly noteworthy for crypto enthusiasts. Several factors likely contributed to this ETH ETF momentum shift: Improved market conditions for cryptocurrencies Growing institutional adoption of Ethereum Attractive entry points after recent price corrections Positive regulatory developments surrounding crypto ETFs Which ETH ETF Performers Stood Out? While BlackRock dominated the ETH ETF inflows, other players showed varied performance. Grayscale’s Mini ETH fund recorded $9.81 million in net inflows, demonstrating continued interest in alternative Ethereum investment products. Meanwhile, 21Shares’ CETH attracted $740,000, showing that smaller funds still maintain relevance in the competitive ETH ETF landscape. However, not all ETH ETF products shared in the positive momentum. Fidelity’s FETH experienced $2.23 million in outflows, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $4.26 million exit. This mixed performance across different ETH ETF offerings highlights the selective nature of current institutional investment strategies. Why Does This ETH ETF Momentum Matter? The consecutive days of positive ETH ETF flows represent more than just numbers—they signal a potential shift in market sentiment. When institutional giants like BlackRock reverse outflow trends, it often indicates broader market confidence. This ETH ETF performance could foreshadow increased mainstream adoption and potentially influence Ethereum’s price trajectory in the coming weeks. Moreover, the ETH ETF data provides valuable insights for retail investors considering Ethereum exposure. The institutional vote of confidence through ETH ETF investments suggests that professional money managers see long-term value in Ethereum’s technology and ecosystem development. What’s Next for ETH ETF Investments? Looking ahead, the ETH ETF market appears poised for continued evolution. The recent inflow patterns suggest that investors are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to cryptocurrency exposure. As regulatory clarity improves and more traditional financial players enter the space, we can expect further diversification of ETH ETF products and strategies. The current ETH ETF landscape demonstrates that despite market volatility, institutional interest in Ethereum remains strong. This bodes well for the future of cryptocurrency adoption and could pave the way for more innovative financial products centered around blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions What is an ETH ETF? An ETH ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Why did BlackRock’s ETH ETF see such large inflows? BlackRock’s ETH ETF attracted $88.22 million due to renewed institutional confidence, attractive pricing after recent outflows, and the fund’s strong reputation among traditional investors. Are ETH ETFs a good investment? ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum, making them suitable for investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles over direct cryptocurrency ownership. How do ETH ETF flows affect Ethereum’s price? Significant ETH ETF inflows can create buying pressure on underlying Ethereum assets, potentially supporting price appreciation over time. Which companies offer ETH ETFs? Major providers include BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Bitwise, each offering different ETH ETF products with varying features. Can I invest in ETH ETFs outside the US? ETH ETF availability varies by country, with some nations offering similar products while others restrict cryptocurrency-based investment funds.

On the other hand, $156 million was taken from Solana’s funds, and $1.27 billion was taken from Bitcoin’s funds. The subsequent largest outflow was $589 million for ether. In the meantime, Nansen’s “smart money” traders placed optimistic short-term bets on XRP while holding $325 million in bearish Bitcoin positions. The late-week inflows suggest that mood may gradually stabilize, but the significant withdrawals indicate short-term bearish pressure on BTC. After the current sell-off, Bitcoin might regain steam if inflows persist. Bitkub Plans Hong Kong IPO as Thai Markets Hit 5-Year Lows According to Bloomberg, Bitkub, Thailand’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is considering an IPO in Hong Kong rather than Thailand due to the extreme weakness of the local stock market. Through the planned IPO the company hopes to raise $200 million. Bitkub was established in 2018 and now manages a daily trade volume of about $66 million. The exchange’s initial intentions to go public in Thailand in 2025 have faltered. Due to trade concerns and political problems with Cambodia, Thailand’s stock market has suffered this year, dropping 10% and hitting a five-year low. Over $3 billion in Thai stocks has already been sold by foreign investors in 2025. Hong Kong, meanwhile, is seeing a surge in initial public offerings. In the first ten months of 2025, the city raised approximately $28 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs), a 209% increase over the previous year. Major cryptocurrency companies like HashKey Group and Bitcoin Depot are also drawn to its rapidly expanding digital asset sector.

This promotes a positive long-term attitude for Bitcoin and boosts Asia’s role in its adoption. JPMorgan Closes Strike CEO’s Accounts, Reviving Crypto Debanking Concerns In September, Jack Mallers, CEO of the Bitcoin payments app Strike, had his bank accounts abruptly frozen by JPMorgan Chase, which rekindled concerns about the “debanking” era of cryptocurrency. Mallers claimed the bank told him they were “not allowed to” reveal the cause of the closure, and refused to explain. According to a letter from JPMorgan, “concerning activity” was found during standard Bank Secrecy Act surveillance. Mallers’ banking is now located at Strike. The event reminds us of past times when U.S. banks denied services to cryptocurrency firms. Regulators have frequently pressured banks to stay away from high-risk sectors, such as cryptocurrency, under both the Obama and Biden administrations. President Donald Trump has yet to take action to buck this tendency. JPMorgan Chase abruptly closed Strike CEO Jack Mallers’ accounts, citing “concerning activity,” reigniting crypto debanking fears. @micahvzimmerman with more: https://t.co/UNZRTwtvNr — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 24, 2025 He issued an executive order in August that required authorities to investigate and penalize banks that unfairly refuse services to prevent “politicized debanking.” According to Trump officials, these actions targeted Trump’s family and cryptocurrency companies. The event supports Bitcoin’s central narrative: it is censorship-resistant and self-custodial. The long-term outlook may be bolstered by growing faith in Bitcoin as a new form of currency, as more crypto leaders face bank closures. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $94K Recovery as Channel Pressure Eases Bitcoin is stabilizing after rebounding from the $86,800 Fibonacci support, with buyers defending key levels following weeks of heavy selling. The daily chart shows BTC trading inside a descending channel, with resistance at $94,000, a confluence of the 20-day EMA and the 0.236 Fibonacci level. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is improving as the RSI recovers from oversold conditions near 30, showing early bullish divergence. A breakout above $90,800 could confirm a short-term reversal and open the path toward $94,000 and $97,000, which align with key retracement levels. If this pattern evolves into a falling wedge, the next upside target sits near $107,000, marking a full recovery from November’s decline. Holding above $86,800 keeps the bullish setup intact, offering limited downside with strong rebound potential. A close above $97,000 could reignite momentum toward the $100,000 mark, signaling renewed optimism heading into December’s trading cycle. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

Galaxy, which has built its brand around providing crypto infrastructure and services to institutional clients, would act as a market-maker on the platforms, posting regular bids and offers to deepen trading. Novogratz told Bloomberg in a recent interview that the firm is “doing some small-scale experimenting with market-making on prediction markets, but I think you’ll eventually see us providing broader liquidity.” Prediction Markets Surge As Traders Bet On Real-World Outcomes Prediction markets have grown rapidly in recent months, offering binary contracts tied to outcomes such as elections, sports results and key economic events. Traders buy “yes” or “no” shares on specific questions, with prices reflecting the crowd’s implied probability that a given outcome will occur. Bloomberg reports that Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says the firm is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi to provide liquidity in prediction markets, having already begun small-scale market-making experiments with plans to expand. Jump Trading has also quietly started making… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 25, 2025 The regulatory backdrop remains patchy. Some US states argue that prediction markets fall under gambling laws, while at the federal level the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees event contracts, has so far not stepped in to shut down the activity on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. Unlike traditional sportsbooks, which take the opposite side of customer bets, Polymarket and Kalshi run largely peer-to-peer order books. To buy “yes” on a market, a trader needs someone willing to hold the corresponding “no” position, which makes liquidity providers and active market makers central to the user experience. Both platforms have rolled out incentive schemes that reward participants who post orders in specific markets. Major Trading Firms Start Testing The Waters In Prediction Markets For years, event markets were too small to attract major trading firms. Susquehanna International Group has been one of the few players to publicly acknowledge its role as a market maker on Kalshi. Some exchanges also operate internal market-making entities to meet demand. Kalshi runs a unit called Kalshi Trading that trades against customers. The company says the desk is walled off and has no access to non-public information generated by the exchange. Polymarket, which originally built much of its volume outside the US, has started live testing its US exchange this month. The platform has quietly onboarded a limited group of users and is matching real trades as it prepares for a broader relaunch in the domestic betting market. Sector Matures As Tech Platforms And Liquidity Providers Step In Interest in wagering on real-world outcomes has risen since the last US presidential election, with traders treating prediction markets as both a speculative outlet and an informal polling tool. Liquidity from firms like Galaxy would make it easier for larger tickets to move through the order book without causing sharp price swings. Big tech is also helping to pull the sector into the mainstream. Google Finance recently said it will begin showing live data from Polymarket and Kalshi in the coming weeks, allowing users to ask about future events and see how the crowd is pricing the odds. For crypto natives and traditional investors alike, that kind of visibility could make prediction markets feel less like a niche experiment and more like a regular part of the market landscape.

Meanwhile, the US dollar maintains its stability ahead of a crucial week filled with economic indicators that could reshape global currency dynamics. Why are Asian currencies muted in current market conditions? Most Asian currencies traded within narrow ranges as investors weighed the implications of potential monetary policy shifts. The cautious sentiment reflects several key factors: Growing expectations for December rate cut actions by major central banks Uncertainty surrounding global economic growth prospects Technical resistance levels limiting upward momentum Seasonal factors affecting trading volumes and market participation How rate cut expectations are reshaping the forex market The increasing probability of December rate cut moves has created a complex environment for currency traders. Market participants are closely monitoring central bank communications and economic indicators for clues about future monetary policy directions. Currency Current Status Rate Cut Probability Japanese Yen Range-bound Moderate Chinese Yuan Stable Low Indian Rupee Moderate pressure High Australian Dollar Mixed signals Medium Dollar steady position before crucial economic data releases The US dollar remains dollar steady as traders await a significant wave of economic data that could determine short-term currency directions. Key indicators scheduled for release include inflation figures, employment data, and manufacturing reports that will provide critical insights into the health of the US economy. What economic data matters most for currency traders? Several key economic data points are commanding market attention this week. These indicators will significantly influence the forex market and potentially trigger substantial currency movements: Inflation reports from major economies Employment and unemployment figures Central bank meeting minutes and statements Manufacturing and services PMI data Retail sales and consumer confidence numbers Navigating the current forex market landscape The current forex market environment requires careful strategy and risk management. Traders should consider several approaches when dealing with Asian currencies and the dollar steady conditions: Monitor central bank communications for rate cut signals Stay informed about upcoming economic data releases Implement proper position sizing given current volatility levels Consider both technical and fundamental analysis in decision-making Actionable insights for currency market participants Market participants can take several practical steps to navigate the current environment. Focus on understanding the relationship between economic data releases and potential rate cut decisions. Monitor how Asian currencies respond to both regional and global developments. Watch for breakouts from the current dollar steady pattern that could signal new trends in the forex market . FAQs Which central banks are most likely to implement rate cuts? Several Asian central banks are monitoring economic conditions closely. The Federal Reserve , Bank of Japan , and Reserve Bank of Australia are among institutions carefully assessing inflation and growth data. How do economic data releases affect currency values? Economic data directly influences currency values by shaping market expectations for interest rates and economic growth. Strong data typically supports currency appreciation, while weak data can lead to depreciation pressures. What makes Asian currencies particularly sensitive to rate cut expectations? Asian currencies often react strongly to rate cut expectations due to their dependence on foreign investment flows and export-oriented economic structures. Changes in interest rate differentials can significantly impact capital movements. Which companies are most affected by Asian currency movements? Multinational corporations with significant Asian operations, including Apple , Samsung , and Toyota , closely monitor currency fluctuations that affect their international revenue and manufacturing costs. The current forex market landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for informed traders. The muted movement in Asian currencies combined with dollar steady conditions creates a waiting game ahead of crucial economic data releases.

The Financial Services Agency plans legal changes that would require exchanges to create liability reserves to compensate users if platforms are hacked or suffer other incidents that lead to lost funds, Nikkei reported Tuesday. The FSA aims to submit a bill to parliament in 2026, extending a framework long used in traditional securities markets into crypto. Japan already obliges exchanges to store customer coins primarily in cold wallets, which are kept offline and viewed as more secure. Under the current regime, however, platforms that follow these custody rules do not need to set aside specific reserves to cover potential losses, leaving customers exposed if a breach or failure does occur. According to the Nikkei, Japan’s Financial Services Agency plans to require crypto asset exchanges to establish mandatory reserve funds to cover losses from unauthorized access or other asset outflow incidents, ensuring rapid compensation for customers. The Financial System… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 24, 2025 Reserve Model Draws From Rules Long Used In Japan’s Securities Industry The new system would mirror the reserve requirements imposed on securities companies, which must provision funds to cover losses tied to illegal or unfair practices such as erroneous orders. Major Japanese brokers currently hold reserves of about 2b to 40b yen, or roughly $12.7m to $255m, with amounts linked to trading volumes and other risk factors. Regulators plan to use those precedents, along with past crypto leak cases, to determine appropriate reserve levels for digital asset exchanges. To ease the strain on balance sheets, the FSA is also considering allowing platforms to meet part of their obligations through insurance, blending capital buffers with risk transfer to third parties. Authorities want to tighten protections around insolvency as well as hacking. The proposed framework would reinforce rules that require customer assets to be segregated from a platform’s own funds and would make it easier for an independent administrator, such as a court-appointed lawyer, to return assets to users if management loses control or an exchange goes bankrupt. Recent Mega-Hacks Renew Pressure On Japan To Toughen Exchange Safeguards The push comes after a series of high-profile incidents. In May 2024, DMM Bitcoin reported that about 48.2b yen worth of Bitcoin had been stolen. In Feb. 2025, global exchange Bybit disclosed that hackers had taken roughly $1.46b in cryptocurrency. These episodes have revived concerns in Tokyo that even with cold storage, large platforms remain attractive targets. Other jurisdictions are moving in the same direction. The European Union requires crypto service providers to hold capital and use insurance to protect customer assets under its MiCA regime, while Hong Kong obliges licensed exchanges to secure loss compensation funds through insurance policies and deposits. Japan’s plan to formalize liability reserves would bring its safeguards closer to those models. Traders Face Tighter Safety Rails And Higher Compliance Costs As The Market Matures Domestic rules have been evolving alongside a shift in how policymakers view digital assets. Japan initially expected cryptocurrencies to grow mainly as payment instruments and regulated them under the Payment Services Act. Their rising use as investment products has since sparked debate over migrating parts of the sector under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which covers securities and derivatives and includes insider trading provisions. According to the Asahi newspaper, Japan is preparing a broader reset of its crypto rulebook that would treat more tokens as financial products subject to insider trading laws and would lower taxes on profits to encourage regulated participation. At the same time, Tokyo Stock Exchange operator Japan Exchange Group is weighing stricter use of backdoor listing rules and potential fresh audit requirements for listed companies that pivot into large digital asset treasuries, after heavy losses in recent hoarding waves raised investor protection concerns. For crypto exchanges, the planned reserve mandate signals that Japan wants to keep the market open, but with safety rails that look increasingly similar to those in mainstream finance. For traders, it offers the prospect of stronger protections if things go wrong, at the cost of higher compliance demands that may reshape which platforms can afford to operate at scale.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has seen $2.2 billion in outflows so far in November, according to FactSet data as of Monday. The withdrawals are nearly eight times the $291 million in losses recorded last October, the fund’s second-worst month since launching in early 2024. The exodus from the fund comes as bitcoin continues to slide sharply. The cryptocurrency was recently trading at $87,907, down more than 20% over the past month and more than 40% below its early October peak above $126,000. November is shaping up to be bitcoin’s worst month since June 2022, when the asset tumbled roughly 39%. Hot money pulls back as market sentiment weakens The sharp outflows reflect broader risk aversion across markets. “There’s no doubt that hot-money investments have had significant outflows,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in a CNBC report. He added that the pullback is concentrated in “the gambling part of the market,” with bitcoin serving as the most visible example. Investors have been shifting funds into traditional safe-haven assets such as gold as macroeconomic uncertainties mount. Recent data from the University of Michigan indicate that consumer sentiment is plunging toward historically low levels. Meanwhile, markets are awaiting key economic releases, including September retail sales and producer price index figures, which could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy. Although the CME FedWatch Tool shows traders pricing in better than 80% odds of a rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting, that outcome is far from guaranteed. The uncertainty has pushed many investors to de-risk, creating conditions that amplify outflows from speculative corners of the market. Newer ETF investors add to selling pressure Spot bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for many new retail investors to enter the crypto space. But these newer holders may also be quicker to retreat during bouts of volatility. Frank Chaparro, head of content and special projects at GSR, noted that the macro backdrop is prompting broad de-risking, including reduced exposure to crypto and other risk-sensitive assets. “For newer entrants who came in through the funds, any downturn can be unsettling, they can sell just as quickly as they bought,” Chaparro told CNBC. This dynamic is contributing to the rapid outflows seen in BlackRock’s fund and could continue to pressure bitcoin in the near term. Institutional holders may help stabilize the market Despite the volatility, spot bitcoin ETFs have also attracted more stable long-term investors, including institutions, who may help temper extreme price swings. Joshua Levine, chairman of bitcoin treasury firm OranjeBTC, said these investors could “dampen some of the extreme downside, but also smooth upside, reducing bitcoin’s volatility as the asset class matures.” As bitcoin navigates a challenging macroeconomic environment, the divide between short-term retail sellers and long-term institutional holders may shape how the asset performs in the months ahead. For now, both the cryptocurrency and its largest ETF are confronting one of their most turbulent periods since the recent bull run began.

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, jumped 2.7% in late trading, while Nvidia dropped 2.7%, showing how fast investors reacted to the idea of Meta shifting part of its AI hardware stack. The Information said one unnamed person familiar with the talks described Meta’s plan to test TPUs for long-term use. Meta is one of the world’s heaviest spenders on AI infrastructure, so any change in Meta’s chip choices matters far beyond the company itself. Google expands TPU deals as Meta evaluates the hardware Google developed TPUs more than ten years ago for its internal AI work.They are ASIC chips designed for a single job: running and training AI models. While Nvidia’s GPUs were originally made for video game graphics and later adopted for AI because they handle huge amounts of data, TPUs were built only for AI tasks. This is one reason Meta is testing them now, as the company looks for more options in a market where Nvidia still controls most of the demand. Google already signed a deal to supply up to 1 million TPUs to Anthropic, and that announcement got attention on Wall Street. Jay Goldberg, an analyst at Seaport, called the Anthropic deal “a really powerful validation” and added, “A lot of people were already thinking about it, and a lot more people are probably thinking about it now.” The Meta talks increased that attention, especially since Meta spends more on data centers than most companies in the world. Asian markets reacted fast.In South Korea, IsuPetasys, which supplies multilayered boards to Alphabet, surged 18% to an intraday record. In Taiwan, MediaTek gained almost 5% as traders priced in potential demand growth linked to Google’s chip ecosystem. Investors in Asia were responding to the idea that Google may expand its hardware partnerships well beyond its own products. TPUs were built into Google’s internal systems, including AI models developed by Google and DeepMind. Engineers who work on Google’s Gemini models share what they learn with Google’s chip designers, which helps shape new versions of TPUs. That feedback loop also gives AI teams the ability to customize hardware for their own workloads, something that Meta is now studying. The developments around Google and Meta came as Nvidia was dealing with another story. Michael Burry, the investor known for his 2008 housing-market bet, criticized Nvidia’s stock-based compensation and buybacks last week in a post on X. Nvidia responded by sending a memo to Wall Street analysts to address his claims, something reported by Barron’s. Burry did not change his mind. In a new post on Monday, he said he stands by everything he wrote. Burry said he plans to share more comments on his timeline and directed people to a post on his Substack.

Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes believes the correction is nearing its end, and said that $80,000 should hold as support as the Federal Reserve prepares to halt quantitative tightening, a shift he says could reignite liquidity across risk assets. New Investors Are Panicking Bitcoin’s latest bout of volatility rattled newer institutional investors, but long-time holders argue that the recent drawdown is just part of the asset’s natural rhythm. On CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday, crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said seasoned Bitcoiners are unfazed by the correction, as the asset has experienced 30% declines more than twenty times over the past decade. According to him, Bitcoin historically undergoes a big drawdown roughly every 18 months, making the current slump well within expectations for those familiar with its market cycles. Pompliano argued that the anxiety is coming largely from newcomers entering the space from traditional finance, where sharp swings are rare. He said many Wall Street-based investors are now grappling with year-end concerns, portfolio reviews, and bonus calculations, which may be motivating them to reduce exposure. That uncertainty, he added, contributed to the downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price as some of these investors question their initial enthusiasm. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel , offered a similar perspective on Monday, and explained that the recent sell-off was “overwhelmingly a US-session phenomenon.” He pointed to tightening liquidity conditions in the United States and widening credit spreads as key drivers of the decline. These pressures are emerging at the same time that markets are digesting the scale of corporate capital expenditures tied to artificial intelligence, creating a more fragile funding environment. Despite the turbulence, analysts argue that volatility is still a central feature of Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Jeff Park , a market analyst at Bitwise, said that Bitcoin’s volatility index climbed back toward 60 over the past few weeks, creating the potential for more dramatic price swings in either direction. Pompliano believes that volatility is not a sign of weakness but a necessary ingredient for Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. He warned that a lack of volatility would be far more concerning because it would suggest stagnation. Pompliano also mentioned Bitcoin’s historical performance, and pointed out that the asset has risen 240x over the past decade — equivalent to roughly a 70% annualized growth rate. While he warned that those extraordinary gains are unlikely to repeat, he believes even a more modest 20% to 35% annual growth rate over the next ten years will still allow Bitcoin to outperform equities. Bitcoin Will Hold $80K Support? On the bright side, Bitcoin may be nearing the end of its correction. This is according to Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO who believes the $80,000 level will hold as a key support zone. Hayes argued on X that shifting US liquidity conditions could strengthen the crypto market, setting the stage for a recovery after Bitcoin’s more than 35% pullback from its all-time highs. The core of his outlook centers on the Federal Reserve’s expected move to end its current phase of quantitative tightening next month. With the Fed’s balance sheet no longer shrinking, Hayes expects fresh liquidity to flow back into markets, which will benefit both Bitcoin and risk assets. He also pointed to an uptick in US bank lending in November as another early sign that liquidity is beginning to turn. Hayes stayed bullish throughout Bitcoin’s decline from its October peak, and repeatedly said that meaningful relief for the crypto market requires a return to quantitative easing. While he acknowledged the possibility of one more dip into the lower $80,000 range, he stuck to his belief that $80,000 should remain intact as a support level. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Hayes also suggested that a deeper sell-off in major US tech stocks, especially AI-related names, may be necessary before the Federal Reserve shifts decisively toward a more accommodative stance. He described the current environment as one where investors are essentially “playing for more money printing,” a condition he believes is ultimately bullish for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate decision have swung dramatically. The recent US government shutdown disrupted the flow of economic data, which fueled volatility in rate forecasts. Just a week ago, markets assigned less than a 50% probability to another December rate cut. Those odds have now surged to almost 80%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. This sharp shift caught the attention of economists like Mohamed El-Erian, who criticized the lack of stability in market expectations. El-Erian believes that the volatility stems from disrupted data, uncertainties around the Fed’s leadership, and the absence of a clear long-term policy framework — factors that have created an unpredictable macro backdrop for investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-25 05:30:00

Christine Lagarde, who leads the ECB, made these remarks during a Monday conference in Bratislava, Slovakia. She emphasized that European countries need to move fast to catch up with the United States and China, where companies are pouring massive amounts of money into AI development. The heavy investment in AI technology by American and Chinese firms has sparked discussions about whether this spending rush represents a dangerous financial bubble or signals a genuine breakthrough in technology. Some of Lagarde’s fellow central bank officials have expressed concerns about inflated prices for AI companies. However, Lagarde took a broader view of the situation. She pointed out that periods of intense investment, including ups and downs in cycles, are normal occurrences. She also noted that research shows real economic benefits from AI are appearing faster than gains from earlier technological advances. The ECB president stressed that Europe must prepare itself for this technological shift. She argued that the continent needs to eliminate all barriers preventing it from embracing this change, warning that failure to act could mean missing out on AI adoption and putting Europe’s economic future at risk. Central banks grapple with AI’s economic impact These comments show how central banks worldwide are wrestling with AI’s potential economic effects. Officials at the Federal Reserve agree that AI will bring major changes, though they have not taken firm positions on exactly how these impacts will unfold. In Europe, this AI discussion connects to broader talks about reviving economic growth. A 2024 report by former ECB head Mario Draghi identified Europe’s failure to take advantage of the first digital revolution as a key reason why the region’s productivity growth lagged behind. Lagarde said Europe should not repeat past mistakes. Even though America and China have taken early leads in AI innovation, she believes quick adoption and smart use of the technology could help Europe turn its late start into an advantage. Europe seeks to turn late start into advantage The ECB leader acknowledged that Europe has already lost its chance to be first in AI development. “Europe can still emerge as a strong second mover if it acts decisively,” she stated. She explained that Europe’s aim should focus on widespread AI deployment rather than trying to create the best AI systems. Lagarde has repeatedly called for reforms to unlock growth potential within Europe, especially as the region faces challenges including potential US trade tariffs and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Just last Friday, she pushed for stronger steps toward European integration, a theme she returned to in her AI comments. She warned that several factors could slow AI adoption across Europe. High energy costs, scattered regulations, and poorly integrated capital markets that fail to provide long-term, risk-taking funding could all hinder progress. Such problems would lead to reduced competitiveness across many European sectors and industries, she cautioned. The speech highlighted the urgency Lagarde feels about Europe’s need to act quickly on AI adoption to maintain its economic standing globally.

His video highlighted the inconsistencies across major AI models, which are challenging traders who attempt to determine whether the market is nearing the end of its cycle or preparing for another phase of expansion. Grok and ChatGPT Indicate High Bear Market Probability Rietveld explained that Grok produced the most bearish view, stating that there is an estimated 80% probability that the market has already peaked and transitioned into a bear phase. This assessment was described as decisive, leaving little room for an alternative reading. He added that ChatGPT’s DeepThink variant produced a similar but slightly less severe conclusion, estimating a 70% likelihood that the market is currently in bear territory. Rietveld highlighted the closeness of these figures, noting that two separate models independently pointed toward a downward trend as the dominant probability. Gemini Presents an Opposing XRP Projection A more optimistic viewpoint came from Gemini, which offered a projection focused specifically on XRP. According to Rietveld, Gemini suggested that XRP could reach a range of $6 to $10 before the end of the year. AI Predicts $XRP Price GROK is wild!! Comment down below! pic.twitter.com/yZ8MhQ3EYr — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 22, 2025 This forecast stood in direct contrast to the bearish prediction from the other two models, introducing a level of uncertainty about how the broader market conditions align with asset-specific expectations. The sharp difference between these predictions contributed to the overall sense of unpredictability described in Rietveld’s commentary. When assessing market direction independently, projections of this kind rely heavily on future regulatory actions, liquidity conditions, and institutional behavior. It should therefore be treated as speculative indicators rather than definitive outcomes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Utility Over Price In response to Rietveld’s post, X user Gordon Cameron shifted the focus away from short-term price expectations. He stated that cryptocurrency should be viewed as technology rather than as a traditional stock, emphasizing that its long-term value depends on practical use cases that can support financial system upgrades. Cameron added that assets lacking real utility will not maintain relevance once regulatory frameworks are fully established. His comment underscored an argument frequently made by those who prioritize functional adoption over market cycles.

Privacy is hygiene,” after hackers infiltrated several U.S. banks and stole client information. Reports indicate that hackers targeted JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley during a cyberattack on mortgage technology firm SitusAMC. The breach highlighted the vulnerability of sensitive data in banks and the ease with which large systems can expose customer information. Banks face risk as stolen data exposes sensitive client records SitusAMC was the victim of a cyberattack on November 12, 2025, that exposed large amounts of sensitive corporate information, including accounting records and legal documents. In this instance, customer data may have been compromised. The company announced that although the breach has been stopped, its systems are currently operational, and it has notified federal authorities of the incident. Notably, no encrypting malware (such as ransomware) was used, indicating that cybercriminals attempted to evade detection. Some of the banks that risk being affected are JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, according to multiple reports. The full extent of the leaked data remains to be seen. Still, the threat that one third-party vendor’s breach might affect multiple Wall Street banking giants underscores an emerging threat to supply chains that can be exploited through cyberattacks. Hackers infiltrated the security systems of SitusAMC and stole client information linked to major banks. They stole accounting papers, legal agreements , and other sensitive client and customer information, so officials at the company are investigating the extent of the theft and its potential use in fraudulent activities. Experts say that storing large amounts of personal and business information in one place is very risky, as hackers can use stolen information for illegal activities that damage the reputations of both companies and their customers. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley were all notified that their client data may have been compromised, and the news quickly spread on social media platforms. Financial news accounts and tech commentators on X discussed the incident, raising concerns among the public about how large banks must take responsibility for their own security systems and those of their clients. Members of the tech and crypto communities used the incident to highlight the dangers of storing sensitive data without robust security measures. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin even said privacy should be as essential as hygiene, so that banks and digital companies treat it as a routine. Ethereum developers are making new tools to keep people’s information safe Buterin wrote an essay in April that outlined a plan for Ethereum to enhance privacy by utilizing stealth addresses, which conceal transaction details. ETH would also display only the necessary information in specific situations, and zero-knowledge tools would enable users to interact without needing to understand complicated cryptography to protect themselves. Shiv Shankar, CEO of Boundless, said that privacy must be a routine practice to prevent hackers and mistakes from exposing sensitive information and causing real harm to people who use the network. The Ethereum Foundation introduced a new privacy-focused research cluster in October, hiring 47 engineers, cryptographers, coordinators, and researchers to collaborate on projects that enhance the safety and privacy of ETH for users. The team also showcased a privacy-first browser wallet and software toolkit called Kohaku, which Nicolas Consigny and Buterin created. The software helps users protect their information when using ETH applications. Bitcoin developers are also working on Taproot upgrades and wallet-level improvements that make transactions harder to trace and more secure. At the same time, developers are building new Ethereum layer-2 solutions with privacy as a fundamental part of the system, rather than adding it later. Companies that focus on privacy, such as Zcash, have also become increasingly popular now because they allow users to hide their transaction details. A Nasdaq-listed company purchased more ZEC, and the price increased by 469% in one month, which only proves that investors are starting to recognize the value of privacy.

With signs of a potential bear market emerging, fresh rumors suggest that one of the world’s largest banks allegedly holds a significant short position on Strategy’s stock (MSTR), which has plunged 69% from its record high of $543 per share last year. Strategy Faces Potential MSCI Exclusion The turmoil escalated last week when JPMorgan issued a warning that Strategy might soon be removed from major equity indices, specifically the MSCI USA Index. JPMorgan’s analysts noted that the issues facing Strategy extend beyond the recent downturn in cryptocurrency prices, which have seen Bitcoin fall more than 30% from its all-time highs. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,000, while the broader crypto market has experienced a staggering $1 trillion decline in total market capitalization over the past month. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target JPMorgan’s analysts indicated that MSCI is considering whether companies with over 50% of their total assets in digital currencies should qualify for inclusion in traditional equity indices. Given that Strategy’s balance sheet is heavily weighted with Bitcoin, it is at significant risk of exclusion. The analysts stated that “MicroStrategy [is] at risk of exclusion from major equity indices as the January 15th MSCI decision approaches.” They speculated that removal from the MSCI could trigger approximately $2.8 billion in outflows, and if other index providers follow MSCI’s lead, the total could reach as high as $8.8 billion. The situation is complicated by market dynamics, particularly the timing of JPMorgan’s bearish note, which coincided with Bitcoin’s weakness and MSTR’s decline, all while liquidity was thin and overall sentiment fragile. JPMorgan Faces Account Closures Surge According to analysts at the Bull Theory, JPMorgan has been noted for timing its market reports—bearing down when prices are already weak and striking a more bullish tone near market peaks. The analysts have highlighted that share lending for MSTR has reportedly increased, allowing brokers to lend shares to short sellers, which can exacerbate downward pressure on the stock price. Additionally, there are escalating reports of widespread account closures at JPMorgan, with thousands claiming to have exited due to perceived manipulation of both MSTR and Bitcoin. Related Reading: A Quiet Move In Bitcoin Options Is Starting To Raise Big Questions Amid these developments, the fear of a potential short squeeze is growing. The analysts believe that if Strategy’s stock were to rally around 40% to 50%, it could trigger a short squeeze in the bank’s position and spell major financial troubles. In response, Michael Saylor, the CEO of Strategy, has sought to clarify the company’s identity, emphasizing that it is not just a passive Bitcoin holder. He pointed out that Strategy operates as a software business with an active financial strategy, countering the narrative circulating around MSCI’s concerns. As the situation unfolds, several key points emerge. The October 10th crash appeared to align with the MSCI announcement, coinciding with an already fragile market state. JP Morgan’s strategic timing of its bearish insights has amplified existing fears, creating further uncertainty as MSCI’s final decision looms.

Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Plummeted Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish has discussed about the latest trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score . This on-chain indicator calculates the difference between the market cap of BTC and its Realized Cap, and takes its ratio with the standard deviation of the market cap. The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model for the asset that calculates its total value by assuming the ‘real’ value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In short, what this metric represents is the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the market cap is the value that they are carrying in the present. As the Bitcoin MVRV Z-score compares the market cap with the Realized Cap, it essentially tells us whether the overall network is in a state of profit or loss. Now, here is the chart shared by Beamish that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has gone through a decline recently. This drop in investor profitability is a result of the bearish trajectory that the cryptocurrency’s price has followed. The metric is still a notable distance above the zero mark, which suggests the market cap continues to be greater than the Realized Cap. In other words, the investors are still in a state of net unrealized profit. The degree of the holder gain, however, is low when compared to the profitability level of the last couple of years. In fact, the current MVRV Z-Score is at a similar level to when Bitcoin was trading around the $35,000 level. Historically, a cooldown in investor profitability has facilitated bottom formations for the cryptocurrency. Usually, however, major bearish phases have only reached their lows when the network has outright gone underwater . Currently, Bitcoin still has some ways to go before this can happen. Though, it’s possible that the current level is enough for the asset to reach a bottom, as it has already done a few times over this cycle. Just like how a low value on the MVRV Z-Score can lead to a bottom, a high one can result in a top instead as profit-taking explodes. From the chart, it’s apparent that the metric reached an extreme level during the bull run in the first half of 2021. So far in the current cycle, no peak in the indicator has been of a similar scale; the tops this time around have formed at a comparable profitability level to the second-half 2021 bull run. BTC Price Bitcoin has rebounded since its low below $81,000 on Friday as its price has now climbed back to $88,600.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin MVRV Ratio|Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score|Bitcoin Profits|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-25 06:00:25

54873938,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=867613,1764050460,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54873938.jpeg,Galaxy Digital is talking with Kalshi and Polymarket about becoming a liquidity provider,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/galaxy-digital-prediction-market-liquidity/,"According to Bloomberg, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is preparing to become a liquidity provider for Kalshi and Polymarket, two of the biggest names in the fast-expanding world of crypto-based prediction markets. These platforms let people place simple bets on real-world outcomes; like election results, sports scores, or even policy decisions. Now, Galaxy Digital is looking to plug directly into those bets by offering constant trade activity that keeps the wheels turning. Mike said the company is already “doing some small-scale experimenting with market-making on prediction markets,” and added that “you’ll eventually see us providing broader liquidity.” This would make Galaxy Digital a key player in a market that’s already seeing tons of involvement from retail traders and financial firms alike. And while Mike has spent years building Galaxy as a crypto infrastructure backbone for institutions, prediction markets open a new front in that strategy, one that’s raw, fast, and not yet fully regulated. Kalshi and Polymarket compete for bigger trade flows Unlike traditional sportsbooks, where the house always takes the opposite side, platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket match people directly. If you want to buy “yes” on a bet, someone else needs to sell you a “no.” This system needs liquidity providers to keep trades flowing, especially when demand surges. That’s why Kalshi and Polymarket rolled out incentive programs to reward active traders in specific markets. For years, these platforms were too small to attract serious Wall Street players. The only big name who jumped in early was Susquehanna International Group, which has publicly acknowledged its role on Kalshi. But the tides are turning. Jump Trading has begun market-making activity on Kalshi, according to Bloomberg, and Cliff Asness, co-founder of AQR Capital Management, said he’s thinking about moving into the sports betting arena. Kalshi also uses its own in-house desk called Kalshi Trading to keep trades moving and says this desk works separately and doesn’t get any private information. Not long ago, Kalshi gained a legal opening under the Trump administration, which softened federal attitudes toward event-based trading. That said, the backlash is real. Melinda Roth, a law professor at Washington & Lee University, said, “This is a mess for so many reasons. We have people taking money they often don’t have and not investing in the stock market or retirement savings.” She’s been researching the legal gray zone around these kinds of contracts and says the risks are getting harder to ignore. Trump family ties deepen as Polymarket reenters U.S. Earlier this year, Kalshi started offering markets tied to sports results just after winning a legal case to allow election betting. State gambling regulators came out against this move, arguing that it broke local laws. Kalshi pushed back, saying it offers financial products under federal CFTC oversight, not state gambling rules. The company stressed that it operates as a marketplace, not a bookmaker. So far, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission hasn’t stepped in. Meanwhile, the Trump family is doubling down. Donald Trump Jr. joined both Kalshi and Polymarket as an advisor. In the fall, Trump Media & Technology Group started talks with Crypto.com, one of Kalshi’s competitors, and ended up launching its own prediction exchange, Truth Predict. Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, played a central role in sealing that deal, which reportedly came together in just weeks. Polymarket, which had been shut out of the U.S. after a 2022 settlement with the CFTC, is now back in the game. In July, both the CFTC and the Justice Department said they were done investigating the company. That greenlight let Polymarket buy QCX, a tiny derivatives exchange trying to get regulatory approval. The deal cost $112 million and gave Polymarket a legal way to operate in the U.S. under federal rules. With that door now open, and Galaxy Digital ready to step in, the race to dominate prediction-market liquidity is getting very real, very fast.

54874256,https://invezz.com/?p=2979686,1764050535,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"XRP price prediction after strong Franklin, Grayscale ETFs debuts",https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/25/xrp-price-prediction-after-strong-franklin-grayscale-etfs-debuts/,"The XRP price has moved into a bull market after rising by over 24% from its lowest point this month. It has risen in the last three consecutive days and is now hovering at its highest level in a week. This rebound happened after the successful launch of the Grayscale XRP ETF on Monday. XRP ETF inflows are soaring The XRP price has done well in the past few days, reaching a high of $2.25 as investors cheered the launch of the Grayscale and Franklin Templeton ETF on Monday. These ETF launches were successful, with the Grayscale one generating over $67 million in inflows. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF had $62 million in inflows, while the existing Canary and Bitwise had $16 million and $17 million, respectively. The total daily XRP ETF inflows jumped to $164 million, bringing the total assets to over $628 million, which is equivalent to 0.46% of the coin’s market capitalization. The total value traded rose to nearly $90 million. Most importantly, SoSoValue data shows that XRP ETFs have had inflows in the last seven consecutive trading days. They have never had an outflow, which is notable because they were launched during a crypto market crash . There is a likelihood that the XRP ETFs will have robust inflows in the coming months. In a report released earlier this year, JP Morgan analysts predicted that these funds would have over $8 billion in assets in the first year. One way of estimating the future assets is to look at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin ETFs have $116 billion in assets, which is equivalent to 6.54% of the market cap. Ethereum ETFs, on the other hand, have $18.4 billion in assets or 5.14% of the market cap. XRP has a market cap of over $135 billion. As such, a 5% allocation in XRP ETFs would bring their total assets to about $6.75 billion, much higher than where they are today. Why Ripple ETF inflows are rising There are several reasons why XRP ETF inflows are rising. First, XRP was created by Ripple Labs, which has become a juggernaut in the financial service industry. The company recently r aised $500 million from Ken Griffin’s Citadel and Fortress, bringing its valuation to over $40 billion. Ripple Labs hopes to use these funds to grow its network and its market share in the cross-border payment industry. It has already made some major acquisitions this year, including Hidden Road, Rail, and GTreasury. Second, XRP ETFs are seeing robust demand because of its size. Data shows that XRP is the fourth-biggest coin in the crypto industry after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. As such, investors view it as a viable alternative asset. Third, the network’s growth is accelerating, with Ripple USD (RLUSD) having $1.02 billion in assets, a year after its launch. There are chances that the RLUSD growth will accelerate as stablecoins become more mainstream. XRP price technical analysis The daily timeframe chart shows that the XRP price crashed to a low of $1.8173 on November 21 and has now rebounded to $2.25. Its lowest level this month was a notable level as it coincided with the lowest point on October 10 this year. Therefore, there are signs that the coin has formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $2.6945, its highest point on October 27. A double-bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. Still, technicals points to more XRP price risk. For one, it remains below the Supertrend indicator and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Therefore, the bearish outlook will persist as long as it remains below these indicators.

The Trump family's total wealth has eroded by $1 billion, falling from $7.7 billion at the beginning of September to about $6.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Much of this decline stems from losses in the value of the family's expanding crypto investments and related companies. During Trump's second term, cryptocurrencies have completely reshaped the family's wealth. Memecoins attributed to him have lost nearly 25% of their value since August, while shares in his son Eric Trump's Bitcoin mining venture have nearly halved from their peak. Trump's social media company, which has entered Bitcoin with significant volume this year, is also trading at historic lows. This scenario is part of a broader cryptocurrency downturn that has recently wiped out over $1 trillion in market value. These losses aren't limited to family fortunes; many individual investors involved in projects linked to the Trump brand have also suffered significant losses. Short-term investors who bought memecoins during the height of Trump's tenure have lost nearly all of their investments as of this month. Despite this, Eric Trump isn't backing down. Speaking to Bloomberg, Trump said, “Now is a perfect time to buy. Those who can buy on dips and withstand price fluctuations will win.” He added that he's more optimistic than ever about the future of the crypto market. Related News: Chinese Expert Analyst Answers the Question, “Has the Bear Market Begun for Bitcoin?” According to experts, not only investments but also issuance and transaction revenues play a significant role in the Trump family's crypto strategy. Professor Jim Angel of Georgetown University said, “Individual investors can only speculate. The Trump family, on the other hand, can speculate, issue and sell their own crypto assets, and generate consistent income from this process.” Trump Media & Technology Group, Truth Social's parent company, fell to an all-time low on November 19th following its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment push. According to a July report, the company holds approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency positions. Approximately 25% of the 11,500 BTC purchased at an average price of $115,000 are currently at a loss. Furthermore, the company's $147 million investment in Cronos (CRO) has nearly halved. The family's largest crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, has seen its own token, WLFI, fall from 26 cents in early September to around 15 cents. The value of WLFI holdings has fallen from $6 billion to around $3.15 billion. Despite this, the family has generated around $900 million from token sales, with $500 million from the deal with Alto5Sigma alone. American Bitcoin (ABTC), the new mining venture co-owned by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., is trading on the Nasdaq. Its share price has more than halved from its peak of $9.31 in early September, wiping out at least $300 million in Eric Trump's stake. The Trump memecoin associated with the family has suffered a sharp decline since its launch, falling 25% since the end of August. Bloomberg analysis shows that wallets linked to the family held 17 million tokens in the first few months. It's also estimated that 40% of the 90 million tokens unlocked in July went to the family. The current value of the coins is approximately $310 million, down $117 million since August, but the total value has increased by $220 million thanks to new unlocks. *This is not investment advice.

Trump said he would travel to Beijing in April, while Xi would come to the U.S. later next year. “It could be Florida, Palm Beach, or Washington, D.C.,” Trump said, adding that the meeting schedule was still being determined. The first report on the meeting came from China's official Xinhua news agency. According to the agency, Xi stated that “the momentum in bilateral relations must be maintained” following the two countries' summit in South Korea last month. Xi also stated that “Taiwan's return to China is an important part of the post-war international order.” Xi, recalling that China and the US are “fighting together in the war against fascism and militarism,” said, “We must protect the victory of World War II together.” Areas of bilateral cooperation were also discussed during the meeting, according to the Associated Press.

While the Trump administration is pressuring Taiwan to increase its defense spending, strategic uncertainty remains about whether US troops would be deployed in the event of a Taiwan Strait conflict. The call followed a trade truce reached last month between the world's two largest economies. Under the agreement, Washington reduced tariffs on certain Chinese products from 57 percent to 47 percent, while Beijing lifted select restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. Trump also announced that China had resumed purchases of American soybeans and assured that there would be no delays or additional restrictions on rare earth minerals. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s Everything We Know and the Facts,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/todays-hot-topic-did-jpmorgan-really-declare-war-on-bitcoin-heres-everything-we-know-and-the-facts/,"A claim that has been circulating rapidly on X in recent days suggested that JPMorgan holds a massive short position in MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares, suggesting that a 50% rise in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) would pose an “existential threat” to the bank. The post, which reached millions of users, brought with it GameStop comparisons, calls for boycotts, and talk of a mass purchasing campaign. However, financial writer Shanaka Anslem Perera points out that this narrative is a complete fabrication. Perera points to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing with Section 13F-HR dated November 7, 2025. The filing indicates that JPMorgan has no open short positions in MicroStrategy, meaning the reported short amount is “zero.” The records are publicly available and accessible on EDGAR. The bank reduced its MSTR holdings by 24.5% in the third quarter and also holds limited-sized call and put options. The put options, which some social media users cited as “evidence,” are said to be routine hedging compared to the $4.6 trillion in assets under management at JPMorgan. MicroStrategy's total short position is 9.74% of the market, according to FINRA data, but there's no evidence that JPMorgan owns it. A significant portion of the posts brought up the example of GameStop's short squeeze in 2021. According to Perera, this comparison is baseless: The short position ratio in GameStop exceeded 140%, while in MSTR it was 9.74% GameStop's free float was much smaller Short positions were concentrated among a few funds; there is no such concentration in MSTR Therefore, there is no similar structural compression condition in MicroStrategy. The claim reportedly began with a November 23rd post by Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser. According to Perera, the claim reached millions within hours, but no posts cited a primary source. Those opposed were accused of “defending the banks,” and verification mechanisms failed to keep pace with social media. Related News: Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network Altcoins That Developers Focused On Most in the Last Month Have Been Revealed Perera argues that false claims are overshadowing more important developments: JPMorgan reduces MicroStrategy position Harvard University Increases Its Holdings in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT by 257% Abu Dhabi fund Al Warda increases IBIT position by 230% Total inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs exceed $60.8 billion This trend suggests that institutions are now choosing to access Bitcoin through regulated ETFs rather than through company stocks. According to Perera, the “leveraged Bitcoin stock” model MicroStrategy has offered for years is losing its edge. The company's market capitalization relative to its Bitcoin holdings is now at a discount, and a potential MSCI delisting in January 2026 could lead to billions of dollars in forced selling. Therefore, JPMorgan's position reduction is not considered “hostility towards Bitcoin” but rather portfolio risk management. *This is not investment advice.

Analyst ‘Sykodelic’ echoed the sentiment, opining that over the next month, “we are going to climb the biggest wall of worry that has ever existed in crypto.” “It should be clear by now that we are in a market position like 2019, not 2021,” they added. “We are just not in the liquidity/macro environment to enter a prolonged contraction or bear.” Echoes of Pandemic Crash MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe commented that the recent crash reminded him of the COVID market meltdown in 2020. “People expected to see another test at the lows, actually, during these times, lower lows were also expected in the COVID crash, it never happened,” he said. “The higher Bitcoin goes during these 1-2 weeks, the lower the chance of that low to happen again.” Bitcoin slumped more than 50% in March 2020 when the world locked down during the pandemic. However, it surged to a new all-time high by the end of that year. Meanwhile, ‘Altcoin Alf’ said it was time for markets to perform, noting Tether (USDT) dominance, which usually leads to rotation into crypto assets. “I truly believe we are about to start a massive run that most are not positioned for. BTC to ATH’s, but I expect ALTS to finally outperform.” Every time $USDT.D has had a weekly stochastic cross down for the last 28 months is when we had a rally. Markets also hate having built up equal lows. We just swept the liquidity up the top. Which leads me to believe the next target is the equal lows. I truly believe we are… pic.twitter.com/E8vevrM8VB — Altcoin Alf (@alfy11116) November 25, 2025 Crypto commentator ‘Colin Talks Crypto’ wasn’t as bullish, stating that “enough bear market signals have triggered,” but remaining hopeful that there is “one last leg up.” BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin has continued its recovery today, hitting an intraday high of just over $89,000 on Monday, before cooling during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session, where it was hovering around $88,000. It has gained 8.5% since it bottomed on Friday, but has a long way to go to reverse the almost two-month down trend.

The families of victims of the Hamas 2023 attack accused the exchange and recently pardoned CZ of helping to transfer over $1 billion to the accounts of terror groups. The exchange “deliberately” and “consciously” took efforts to carry out the financial crime on an “industrial scale,” the filing read. “Binance not only knowingly provided financial services to Hamas; it also actively tried to shield its Hamas customers and their funds from scrutiny by U.S. regulators or law enforcement—a practice that continues to this day,” the plaintiffs noted in the complaint, filed in federal court in North Dakota on Monday. The Hamas’ October 2023 deadly incursion in Israel killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Binance Bypassed Sanctions, Warnings – Here’s How The crypto giant allowed large volumes of sanctioned money to move undetected, the lawsuit claims. According to the attorneys representing 306 American plaintiffs, Binance’s lax controls contributed directly to the attack’s financing. Further, the exchange relied on pooled wallets, having limited records and weak identity checks. “Binance’s conduct was far more serious and pervasive than what the U.S. government disclosed during its 2023 criminal enforcement actions,” the attorneys said in the suit. Binance told Reuters that the platform complies “fully with internationally recognized sanctions laws,” declining to comment on the lawsuit. Zhao and Guangying Chen, a close associate of CZ whom the lawsuit points to as Binance’s “de facto chief financial officer,” could not be reached for comment regarding the lawsuit. The complaint identified Ali Mohammad Alawieh, the son of Hezbollah chief, as one of the Binance account holders. Another Binance account was tied to a 25-year-old Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) operative who had opened his account in October 2020. The Agence France-Presse and Reuters photo shows the PIJ militant at a Hamas operative’s funeral. Source: AFP Hamas, Terrorist Groups’ Emerging Use of Crypto Per a recent study , the use of crypto is becoming a preferred mode for transnational terrorist and organized criminal networks. In 2019, Hamas engaged in crypto donation campaigns, leading to the US seizure of several websites and 150 crypto accounts. The WSJ reported in October 2023 that cryptocurrency wallets connected to Hamas received about $41 million between 2020 and 2023. Besides, wallets connected to another U.S.-designated terrorist organization, the PIJ, received as much as $93 million over a similar period. Binance and CZ separately defended against the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court.

South Korea’s leading crypto exchange Upbit has announced a crucial service suspension that affects all OP token holders. Starting December 2nd at 1:00 p.m. UTC, the platform will temporarily halt all deposit and withdrawal activities on the Optimism network. This strategic pause comes as the network prepares for a significant hard fork upgrade that could reshape its future trajectory. Why Is Upbit Suspending Optimism Network Services? The primary reason behind this temporary suspension is an upcoming hard fork on the Optimism network. Hard forks represent major upgrades in blockchain technology, requiring exchanges to pause services to ensure safe integration. Upbit’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to security and smooth operations during these critical network transitions. During this suspension period, users cannot move OP tokens or any other assets on the Optimism network to or from their Upbit accounts. However, trading of OP tokens within the exchange will continue uninterrupted. This means you can still buy and sell OP tokens on Upbit’s internal market while the network upgrades occur. What Does This Mean for Optimism Network Users? If you’re an active Optimism network user, this suspension requires careful planning. Here are the key implications: Deposit and withdrawal functions for OP tokens will be temporarily unavailable All other exchange services remain operational Users should complete any urgent transfers before the December 2nd deadline The suspension affects only Optimism network transactions, not other cryptocurrencies The timing of this suspension aligns perfectly with the network’s upgrade schedule, minimizing disruption for most users. Upbit typically resumes services shortly after network stability is confirmed post-upgrade. Understanding Optimism Network Hard Forks Hard forks represent significant milestones in blockchain development. They involve substantial protocol changes that often introduce new features, enhance security, or improve scalability. The Optimism network’s upcoming hard fork follows this pattern, aiming to deliver important upgrades to the Layer 2 scaling solution. These network improvements typically result in: Enhanced transaction speeds Reduced gas fees Improved security features Better user experience Exchanges like Upbit suspend services during these events to prevent potential transaction losses or technical conflicts that could occur during the transition period. How to Prepare for the Upbit Service Suspension Smart planning can help you navigate this temporary service interruption smoothly. Consider these actionable steps: Complete all urgent Optimism network transfers before December 2nd, 1:00 p.m. UTC Monitor Upbit’s official announcements for service restoration updates Explore alternative trading strategies during the suspension period Keep your OP tokens secure in your preferred wallet during the transition Remember that such suspensions are standard practice in the cryptocurrency industry and demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to user asset security. The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters for Crypto Adoption This temporary suspension actually highlights the growing maturity of cryptocurrency infrastructure. Major exchanges like Upbit implementing careful upgrade procedures shows how the industry is evolving toward more reliable and secure operations. These measures protect users during critical network improvements, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem. The Optimism network’s continued development through hard forks demonstrates the ongoing innovation in Layer 2 scaling solutions. Each upgrade brings us closer to faster, cheaper, and more accessible blockchain technology for everyday users. FAQs About Upbit’s Optimism Network Suspension When will Upbit resume Optimism network services? Upbit will restore services after confirming the Optimism network’s stability post-hard fork. The exact timing depends on network conditions, but typically resumes within hours of successful upgrade completion. Can I still trade OP tokens on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, trading of OP tokens within Upbit’s internal market continues uninterrupted. Only deposits and withdrawals on the Optimism network are affected. Will my OP tokens be safe during the suspension? Absolutely. Your tokens remain secure in your Upbit account. The suspension only affects movement of tokens to and from the Optimism network. What happens if I try to send OP tokens during the suspension? Any attempted transactions during the suspension period will fail or be queued. It’s best to wait until services resume to avoid potential issues. How often do such suspensions occur? Network suspensions for upgrades happen periodically across all major exchanges. They’re standard procedure for maintaining security during significant blockchain changes. Should I move my tokens elsewhere before the suspension? Only if you need immediate access to them on the Optimism network. Otherwise, keeping them on Upbit during the upgrade is perfectly safe.

The recent pullback in cryptocurrency markets and Bitcoin's (BTC) slide below critical support levels are worrying market experts. Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone, speaking on a podcast, described Bitcoin's current outlook as “Bit-Dog,” highlighting technical levels. McGlone noted that Bitcoin's recent bull run was “a tremendous surge” fueled by the halving, ETF inflows, and the Trump administration's support for the sector, but that this process has now peaked. The analyst said the market is currently experiencing a “classic bull market peak”-like decline, which is dragging down other assets. Related News: Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network Altcoins That Developers Focused On Most in the Last Month Have Been Revealed Pointing out that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index fell 21%, McGlone said, “Bitcoin is currently down about 10% year-over-year. The real question is where it goes from here. The fact that stock market volatility (VIX) is so low while cryptos are falling suggests we may see more risk-off (de-risking) towards the end of the year.” McGlone, assessing the situation from a technical analysis perspective, argued that the $100,000 level was a psychological support level, but that it was rapidly being lost. He gave the following figures for the current outlook: Support level: $84,000 Resistance level: $94,000, McGlone painted a pessimistic picture, contrary to market expectations: “In my view, the risk of the $84,000 support being broken and the price heading towards $50,000 is higher than the chance of a rebound.” The analyst reminded that the $50,000 level is a very strong historical key point dating back to 2020 and 2021. *This is not investment advice.

The comments from Johnson, along with the examples she provided, form the basis of his position that infrastructure connected to XRP fits the characteristics being described. Franklin Templeton’s CEO sounds the alarm: the dollar’s dominance is being chipped away, and the world urgently needs a sovereign, neutral, free-floating currency, interoperable with all others. That’s exactly what XRP and Ripple’s infrastructure provide. pic.twitter.com/8zjawSdAox — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 23, 2025 Dollar Dominance Under Pressure In the video referenced by Aljarrah, Johnson noted that the dollar remains the leading reserve currency, but she acknowledged that its position is facing gradual erosion. She explained that countries selecting a reserve currency seek stability, strong economic foundations, and the absence of heavy capital controls. According to her, the dollar still satisfies these conditions, yet certain developments have introduced new considerations among central banks and policymakers. Johnson explained that the shift did not stem from sudden distrust but from geopolitical and economic actions that prompted other nations to reassess their exposure. She pointed to the freezing of Russian assets following the Ukraine invasion as a moment that caused officials in other countries to consider whether similar measures could one day apply to them. This, in her view, encouraged diversification away from exclusive reliance on the U.S. dollar. Global Transactions Reflect Changing Preferences Johnson noted that this adjustment is visible in how certain countries structure international trade. She referenced India’s purchase of oil from Russia using rupee-denominated invoicing, while China and Russia conduct transactions in yuan. These examples, she said, represent the incremental shift away from exclusive dollar usage while not eliminating its dominance.

The ongoing diversification indicates that global participants are preparing for a more distributed monetary landscape, with multiple currencies used depending on regional or political relationships. Aljarrah’s Interpretation and the Digital Asset Argument Aljarrah’s post connects Johnson’s remarks to the broader conversation around the need for a neutral and globally interoperable currency that is not dependent on any single nation’s policies. He stated that this aligns with the structure of XRP and the wider ecosystem built around it, emphasizing its capacity to operate as a free-floating asset designed for cross-border value transfer. While Johnson did not mention digital assets or XRP in her comments, the interpretation offered by Aljarrah reflects the view held by many digital asset advocates who believe that ongoing geopolitical and economic shifts may create space for alternative settlement mechanisms. He highlighted that the characteristics Johnson described match the qualities that supporters attribute to XRP’s role in international financial infrastructure.

Key Takeaways: The SEC granted Fuse a no-action letter, confirming it will not recommend enforcement if the FUSE token is sold as described. This is the second DePIN project in recent months to receive such relief. Industry figures say the SEC’s new leadership is driving a more constructive approach to token oversight. Fuse submitted its request to the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on Nov. 19, seeking assurance that the agency would not recommend enforcement if it moved forward with the offer and sale of FUSE. The project emphasized that its token is designed strictly for network participation, not speculative investing, and functions as a reward for users who maintain Fuse’s distributed infrastructure. FUSE may only be redeemed through third-party venues at prevailing market rates. SEC Says It Won’t Pursue Enforcement Against Fuse Token Sales In a letter signed Monday by deputy chief counsel Jonathan Ingram, the SEC agreed. “Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action… if Fuse offers and sells the Tokens in the manner and under the circumstances described,” Ingram wrote. The decision marks the second time in recent months that the SEC has granted no-action relief to a DePIN project. In August, the agency issued a similar letter to Double Zero , surprising many in the industry and fueling optimism that the SEC, now led by Chair Paul Atkins, is taking a more measured approach after years of tension under former chair Gary Gensler. DoubleZero co-founder Austin Federa described the SEC’s process as “professional, diligent, and without crypto animosity,” calling the approval “highly coveted.” No-action letters are routine in traditional finance but extremely rare in crypto, making these back-to-back approvals especially notable. The SEC’s leadership reshuffle earlier this year placed Commissioner Hester Peirce, long considered one of the industry’s most pro-innovation voices, in charge of the agency’s crypto task force. Since then, the agency has taken steps that many founders say resemble a return to practical rulemaking rather than aggressive enforcement. Why No-Action Letters Matter Legal experts say Fuse’s approval was straightforward. Consensys lawyer Bill Hughes wrote that “not a lawyer in crypto” would classify FUSE as a security, given its consumptive design and narrow utility. Latest from the @SECGov : Fuse's token is not a security that requires registration to offer to the public because: 1) Fuse won't sell tokens to the public; 2) tokens are earned as compensation for participation in the grid consumption efficiency goals of the network (including… pic.twitter.com/5XgjUGy69Z — Bill Hughes (@BillHughesDC) November 24, 2025 Solana-ecosystem attorney Rebecca Rettig said crypto teams seek no-action letters because they offer “regulatory clarity,” a reasonable assurance that launching a token will not trigger immediate SEC action. “It’s a kind of regulatory cover,” she said. The document does not establish new legal precedent, but it underscores a broader shift. In recent months, the SEC has also granted no-action relief to certain crypto custodians lacking banking charters, another area that had been logjammed under previous leadership. Meanwhile, Atkins is considering establishing a “token taxonomy” at the federal regulator in an effort to clarify the classification of specific crypto assets. Earlier this month, Atkins announced that he is weighing the creation of a token taxonomy “anchored in the longstanding Howey investment contract securities analysis” as the next phase of the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative.

The announcement marks one of the largest corporate treasury allocations ever made into a Web3 prediction market protocol. It also signals a new phase where traditional institutions begin taking on-chain forecasting seriously, not as an experiment, but as a strategic advantage. And the momentum didn’t stop there. Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will now join the board of Enlivex, bringing political experience and global visibility into a fast-expanding digital prediction infrastructure. This convergence of capital, leadership, and narrative is already reshaping how prediction markets are perceived across crypto and traditional sectors. A $212 Million Treasury Allocation Sparks the Rally The surge began when $ENLV, a publicly traded biotech firm, announced a $212M treasury allocation into Rain Protocol. For a prediction market platform, this level of corporate commitment is unprecedented. Enlivex framed the allocation as a long-term strategic move. It reflects confidence in: On-chain prediction systems Incentive-driven forecasting models Open liquidity markets Collective intelligence engines The decision represents a strong endorsement of Rain’s infrastructure, which allows anyone, anywhere, to create and trade in markets on any topic, without gatekeepers. Just hours after the news broke, market activity spiked. ENLV’s market cap surged past $200M in shares, reflecting how quickly investors reacted to the dual announcement of capital injection and governance expansion. $ENLV just made it rain – big time! Enlivex, a @Nasdaq -listed company, announced a $212M private financing and became the first public company to adopt a digital-asset treasury strategy built around prediction markets – with $RAIN at the center of that strategy. Just hours… pic.twitter.com/THtjBbi9Zu — Rain (@Rain__Protocol) November 24, 2025 Matteo Renzi Joins the Board, A Major Governance Moment The second catalyst came immediately after the funding announcement. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will now take a board seat at Enlivex, marking one of the most notable political crossovers into a digital asset strategy team. This is rare territory. High-level political figures typically stay far from emerging decentralized systems, especially in sectors like prediction markets, which often blur into regulatory grey zones. Renzi’s arrival sends several signals: Traditional governance is paying attention. Institutional leaders see value in decentralized forecasting. On-chain intelligence is becoming a legitimate decision-support tool. Enlivex is positioning itself as a global player, not a niche biotech firm dabbling in crypto. The appointment adds weight, credibility, and visibility to both Rain and $ENLV. It also reinforces the idea that prediction markets may soon influence sectors beyond crypto, from biotech to policy to macro forecasting. Why This Move Matters: Prediction Markets Enter a New Era The reaction across the market makes sense. Prediction markets have long been one of the most promising yet underdeveloped areas of Web3. Adoption has been slow, liquidity fragmented, and regulation complicated. Rain’s core idea changes that. 1. Rain Is Permissionless Anyone can create a market. On anything. At any time. There are no gatekeepers deciding which topics are allowed. 2. Truth Becomes a Market Signal Rain follows a simple principle: Incentives create truth. Users propose markets. Liquidity flows to the best forecasts. Participants compete to predict accurately. The best predictions rise to the surface through open competition. 3. Liquidity Is Open, Not Fragmented Traditional prediction platforms silo markets behind apps or jurisdictions. Rain removes those walls. Liquidity can flow freely across categories. 4. Collective Intelligence at Scale Rain doesn’t stop at prediction markets. It builds an engine where: Users generate insights Traders shape probabilities Capital amplifies the best signals Markets compress information into real-time forecasts This creates something bigger than speculation. It becomes a collective intelligence layer. The $212M allocation directly validates this vision. A Major Win for Rain Protocol Rain’s infrastructure is still expanding, but today’s events placed a spotlight on everything the protocol has been building quietly: Decentralized market creation Permissionless contracts Composable liquidity layers Incentivized truth-seeking Transparent forecasting rails The market already recognizes these as foundational elements for future information marketplaces. Now a publicly traded firm is putting nine figures behind the idea. And with Matteo Renzi in the mix, Rain is no longer just a crypto-native experiment, it is becoming a bridge between Web3 and global governance. ENLV Surges Past $200M in Shares The numbers moved fast. Within hours: ENLV crossed $200M worth of shares RAIN’s token jumped 120% Liquidity spiked Volume hit cycle highs Market participants began reevaluating prediction assets entirely It wasn’t a hype rally. It was a realization moment. The kind of rally that follows structural change, not short-term narrative. The collaboration pulls together: Institutional capital Political leadership Decentralized infrastructure Open prediction markets A next-generation intelligence engine Few protocols have ever had this type of multi-layered catalyst in a single 24-hour window. The Strategic Value of a $212M DAT A “DAT”, Distributed Allocation Treasury, is more than funding. It is a structural integration. By placing $212M directly into Rain, Enlivex is effectively: Backing the liquidity layer Supporting long-term market depth Aligning with decentralized forecasting Strengthening cross-sector collaboration Reducing fragmentation in prediction liquidity This sets the stage for Rain to grow not just as an app or a platform, but as a public intelligence network. And the timing makes sense. Prediction markets are shifting from novelty tools to intelligent systems for: Scientific research Clinical timelines Biotech forecasts Global policy predictions Macroeconomic outcomes Market sentiment measurement Rain is where those markets can be built quickly, openly, and at scale. Rain summed up its mission clearly: “Prediction markets are just the surface. What we’re really building is an engine for collective intelligence.” It’s becoming a global intelligence platform, and today marks the moment the world started paying attention.

What aSOPR Suggests,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-this-cycle-what-asopr-suggests/,"Bitcoin has been in freefall recently, but this popular indicator is yet to reach the same highs as the last two cycles. Is the real top still ahead for the asset? Bitcoin aSOPR Has Been Consolidating For The Last Two Years As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin aSOPR has been consolidating between converging trendlines for nearly two years. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. Related Reading: USDC Floods Exchanges: Are Traders Buying The Bitcoin Crash? When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder is transferring their coins at some net profit on the blockchain. On the other hand, the indicator being below this threshold implies the dominance of loss taking on the network. Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests profit realization is canceling out loss realization. In other words, the investors as a whole are just breaking even on their sales. In the context of the current discussion, the version of the SOPR that’s of interest is the Adjusted SOPR (aSOPR). This indicator eliminates from the data sales of all coins that moved within an hour of their last movement. Such moves are usually relay transactions and carry no consequences for the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few years: As the quant has highlighted in the graph, the 2017 and first-half 2021 bull runs both interestingly topped out as the aSOPR rose to the red line. This level corresponds to a notable degree of profit realization among the investors. Similarly, the bear markets of the last two cycles found their bottoms at about the same time as the aSOPR hitting a low at the green line, some distance below the 1 mark. At this level, loss-taking is dominant, so weak hands capitulating and resolute entities accumulating their coins could be behind the bottom formation pattern. In the current cycle so far, the aSOPR hasn’t touched the red line. Instead, the indicator has been stuck in consolidation inside two converging trendlines in a mild profit-taking region for almost the last two years. Considering the pattern of the last two cycles, it’s possible that the latest one hasn’t hit its top yet. Another possibility, however, could very well be that the aSOPR simply isn’t going to touch the red level in this cycle at all. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Retraces To Lower Bound—What Comes Next? The Bitcoin aSOPR is now slowly inching toward the end of its converging channel, so a breakout one way or the other could happen soon. It only remains to be seen which direction the indicator will exit. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,300, down 9% over the last week.

However, a recent analysis raises questions about the true purpose of this legislation, suggesting that it may be more about managing government debt than regulating crypto. Crypto As New Mechanism For Government Debt Demand? Market expert and crypto author Shanaka Anslem recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights, asserting that while many believed the GENIUS Act was primarily focused on regulating cryptocurrencies, emerging data reveals a different narrative. He noted, “EVERYONE THOUGHT THE GENIUS ACT WAS ABOUT CRYPTO REGULATION. THE DATA JUST PROVED IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.” The initial buzz surrounding the bill faded after just 48 hours, overshadowed by discussions of tech regulation and stablecoin rules . However, new statistics paint a starkly different picture of the bill’s implications. Embedded within the 47 pages of the legislation was a critical requirement: every dollar of stablecoin must be backed 100% by US Treasury bills, eliminating any alternatives, such as cash in banks or corporate bonds. At the time the GENIUS Act was enacted, the stablecoin market cap stood at approximately $200 billion. Today, that figure has risen to roughly $309 billion, which can now be legally mandated for purchasing US government debt over just four months. According to Treasury Secretary Bessent’s official projections, this trend could lead to $3 trillion in purchases by 2030. Anslem noted that the implications of this requirement are profound: the government no longer has to seek out buyers for its debt, as the law creates an automatic buyer each time someone purchases a digital dollar. This essentially means that for every stablecoin created, a corresponding Treasury bill must be bought. Shift In Regulatory Control? Research from the Bank for International Settlements reveals that every $3.5 billion in stablecoin growth results in a 0.025% reduction in the government’s borrowing costs. The expert noted that when the market reaches the projected $3 trillion, this could save taxpayers approximately $114 billion annually, translating to about $900 in lower debt costs for each US household. Bessent confirmed these findings last week, stating that increased stablecoin issuance means the Treasury does not need to enlarge its bond auctions. In effect, the government has found a new way to finance its spending without relying on traditional buyers. This shift has not gone unnoticed, even by institutions once skeptical of cryptocurrencies. JPMorgan, for instance, which spent the last decade dismissing crypto as a fraud, announced last month that it would now accept Bitcoin as collateral. The crux of this transformation lies in the allocation of regulatory control from the Federal Reserve (Fed) to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which now reports directly to the Treasury Secretary. Anslem concluded his analysis, stating: The Treasury now controls who can create digital dollars. And the law requires those digital dollars to fund government debt. This is not monetary policy. This is legislative engineering of debt demand. And it’s been operational since July.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|crypto regulation|cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency|GENIUS Act|GENIUS Act news|Stablecoins|US Treasury|US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-25 07:00:34

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-wipe-out-begins-heres-what-is-happening/,"In a post on X, crypto analyst Ripple Bull Winkle highlighted the rapid acceleration of XRP accumulation among newly launched exchange-traded products, drawing attention to the scale and pace of institutional absorption now underway. His latest commentary presents a data-driven assessment of how rapidly institutional vehicles are absorbing circulating supply and why he views the trend as an early indication of a tightening market structure. The analyst outlines these points in a video accompanying his post, focusing on the pace, scale, and potential implications of ongoing ETF inflows . #XRP 's Supply Wipeout Begins! pic.twitter.com/OR8kMeNOyW — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 24, 2025 Rising ETF Demand Within Days of Launch According to his breakdown, more than 205 million units of XRP have already been absorbed across the ETF products within seven trading days. He emphasizes that this level of demand is not tied to retail flows and instead originates from only two institutional issuers. In his view, this early activity demonstrates how quickly structured investment vehicles can remove supply from open markets, especially when operating under daily accumulation mandates. He further notes that five additional products are scheduled to go live next week, indicating that the current figures may represent only the opening phase of a broader institutional expansion. The analyst highlights specific accumulation numbers to illustrate the pace at which these products are growing. He states that Canary’s XRPC product is positioned to hold over 146 million XRP, while Bitwise has already accumulated approximately 59 million within just two days of trading. He describes these developments as examples of institutional products steadily drawing liquidity out of the market, rather than entering and exiting positions in a manner associated with speculative trading. Analyst Projects Significant Supply Tightening by 2026 Ripple Bull Winkle argues that, if the current rate persists, the liquid supply of XRP available on exchanges may experience a meaningful contraction heading into 2026. In his assessment, ETF structures are designed to accumulate and maintain positions rather than distribute or rebalance in a way that returns large quantities of XRP to the market. Because of this, he believes the ongoing absorption functions as a continuous reduction of accessible supply. He characterizes the present moment as the early stage of a significant supply reduction event, in which institutional accumulation steadily removes liquidity from circulation. He adds that this trend could accelerate as more ETF issuers enter the market over the coming months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst uses the example of more than 200 million XRP being absorbed within two days across two issuers to underscore the potential scale when a larger set of products becomes active. Outlook Based on Expanding Institutional Participation In concluding his analysis, the commentator suggests that the next six months may present a markedly different liquidity environment if multiple issuers continue to accumulate XRP each trading day. His projection is rooted in the idea that consistent buying from a growing number of institutional products may compress the amount of XRP available on public exchanges. This forms the basis of his broader view that the current developments represent a meaningful shift in the asset’s supply dynamics as institutional participation accelerates.

Dogecoin now has its own U.S. spot ETF. Grayscale has officially launched $GDOG, the first-ever spot Dogecoin ETF in the United States. It opens trading with a temporary 0% fee, a move clearly designed to seize early market share ahead of incoming competitors. The launch marks a cultural and financial moment for both TradFi and crypto, the first time regulators have approved a spot ETF tied to a meme asset born from internet humor. The crypto industry calls it historic. Analysts call it surreal. The market calls it bullish. Grayscale Opens the Door: $GDOG Goes Live Grayscale announced the launch on X, confirming that $GDOG begins trading today as the first U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF. The product is structured as the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF, traded under the ticker GDOG. Investors now have a regulated, exchange-traded way to gain exposure to Dogecoin without buying or custodying the asset directly. The fee structure is already turning heads: 0% expense ratio for the first $1B in assets Or the first three months of trading After that, fees rise to 0.35% This aggressive introductory fee is one of the lowest among single-asset crypto ETFs at launch. Grayscale also highlighted that it remains the largest crypto-focused asset manager in the U.S. by AUM as of October 31, 2025, reinforcing its lead in the digital asset ETF race. Much wow. Big ETP. Introducing the first @dogecoin ETP in the U.S., Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF (ticker: $GDOG ), offered with 0% fee¹. Gain exposure to one of the world’s most iconic and community-driven crypto ecosystems, $DOGE from the world’s largest crypto-focused… pic.twitter.com/pc11FDIjTA — Grayscale (@Grayscale) November 24, 2025 A New Milestone for Memecoins A Dogecoin ETF hitting the U.S. market is more than product expansion, it’s a signal that memecoins have fully entered mainstream financial infrastructure. Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013. Today, it has: A larger market cap than many S&P 500 companies Billions in daily trading volume A decade of community-driven ecosystem growth Tesla integration moments Elon-fueled cultural moments A place in the top 10 crypto assets by market cap $GDOG formalizes what the market already knew: memecoins are no longer fringe. They are an investable asset class. How GDOG Works: Risks, Structure, and Disclaimers Grayscale issued a long set of disclaimers outlining how GDOG functions and the risks involved. 1. Not a 40-Act ETF $GDOG is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This means: Fewer regulatory protections Less oversight compared to traditional ETFs Higher underlying asset risk This structure mirrors the setup of other single-asset crypto ETFs. 2. Not a direct investment in Dogecoin The ETF tracks DOGE through the trust structure, but investors do not hold DOGE directly. 3. High risk and volatility Grayscale’s prospectus warns that the fund is suitable only for investors who can tolerate: Large price swings Potential loss of principal High market volatility tied to Dogecoin itself 4. Fee waiver details The temporary 0% fee applies only until: The fund hits $1B AUM, or Three months pass Then the fee becomes 0.35%. Brokerage fees still apply. These disclaimers make one thing clear: the product is regulatory-approved, but carries all the volatility that Dogecoin is known for. The Race Is On: Bitwise Set to Launch BWOW Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas added important context to GDOG’s timing. Grayscale gets only a brief head start. Bitwise’s competing Dogecoin ETF, $BWOW, is scheduled to launch this Wednesday. Balchunas noted that this pattern, issuers each getting first-mover advantage on different assets, is becoming a trend. It gives each ETF a chance to capture attention and liquidity before the next competitor enters. His comment underscored what many in the market are seeing: crypto ETF issuers have spent years preparing for this wave of approvals. Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, BlackRock, and others are all now sprinting to list products covering every major digital asset. The first spot Dogecoin ETF* in US launches today from Grayscale, ticker $GDOG (sounds like a late '80s one hit wonder rapper). Fee is 35bps but is waived to 0.00% for first 1b or until 3mo. Day One volume predictions welcome. I'm going with $12m. *33 Act pic.twitter.com/QbdLLxejhr — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 24, 2025 Why This Matters: The Memecoin Market Has Changed The launch of a Dogecoin ETF is symbolic, but also deeply strategic. 1. Memecoins now compete with blue-chip crypto assets Dogecoin becomes the first memecoin to reach ETF status in the U.S. That places it alongside: Bitcoin Ethereum Solana Litecoin It is now treated as an institutional-eligible asset. 2. ETFs expand investor access Retail traders have always been able to buy DOGE. But ETFs give access to: Retirement accounts Institutional capital Financial advisors Brokerage-only users Compliance-restricted investors This dramatically widens the top-of-funnel for new DOGE inflows. 3. Mainstream validation accelerates memecoin adoption Every ETF approval signals that a coin has reached regulatory maturity. Dogecoin being the first memecoin to receive a spot ETF elevates the entire category, opening doors for other meme assets in the future. Grayscale’s Strategy: Capture the Culture Early Grayscale didn’t only launch GDOG, it timed the launch perfectly. 0% introductory fee First-mover advantage Heavy cultural resonance Simple, catchy ticker A product appealing to both crypto natives and traders outside the space The ticker itself, GDOG, sounds like a nostalgic 80s rapper, and analysts are already joking about it. But the branding works. It’s memorable. It’s retail-friendly. And it fits the irreverence of Dogecoin’s identity. Grayscale knows exactly who they’re targeting. What Comes Next for GDOG The market will now watch: 1. First-day flows Whether GDOG pulls in tens or hundreds of millions will signal how hungry investors are for a Dogecoin ETF. 2. Performance vs. BWOW Bitwise launches in two days. Competition will be immediate. 3. Dogecoin price reaction Memecoin markets often respond dramatically to major catalysts. ETF flows can add real momentum. 4. ETF expansion If DOGE gets traction, issuers may push for similar products for SHIB, BONK, or even broader memecoin baskets. The memecoin industry may not stay a joke much longer. With GDOG live, Dogecoin officially steps into regulated finance. Ten years ago, it was a joke coin with a Shiba Inu meme. Today, it has a U.S. spot ETF trading on major exchanges. The crypto market has entered a new phase, one where culture coins earn Wall Street tickers, and memes become investment vehicles. Grayscale opened the door. Bitwise is right behind them. And the memecoin era keeps expanding. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

But the team behind the memecoin launchpad is openly rejecting the claims, calling the circulating numbers “misinformation” and insisting the large transfers reflect internal treasury management, not cash-outs. Lookonchain’s report surfaced major USDC and SOL outflows over the last year, sparking speculation across X. Pump.fun quickly responded, denying any wrongdoing and arguing that the movements stem from reorganizing treasury funds raised during the PUMP ICO. The conflicting narratives are now driving one of the platform’s biggest transparency tests to date. Lookonchain Reports Over $1B in Combined USDC + SOL Movements Lookonchain’s thread presents a detailed breakdown of on-chain activity involving Pump.fun wallets. The core claims: 436.5M USDC sent to Kraken since October 15 Between October 15 and today, Lookonchain tracked 436.5M USDC flowing from Pump.fun-linked wallets into Kraken. The on-chain flow also showed: 537.6M USDC leaving Kraken and moving into Circle through wallet DTQK7G A nearly matching inflow/outflow pattern that raised questions around whether Pump.fun was off-ramping proceeds Lookonchain framed the activity as part of a broader pattern of exchange deposits and potential cash-outs. It appears https://t.co/C909I8882s has cashed out at least 436.5M $USDC since Oct 15. Since Oct 15, https://t.co/C909I8882s has deposited 436.5M $USDC into#$Kraken. During the same period, 537.6M $USDC flowed from #Kraken to #Circle through wallet DTQK7G. Between May 19, 2024… pic.twitter.com/WQGnUcA8l4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 24, 2025 4.19M SOL sold between May 2024 and August 2025 The report also highlighted long-term SOL selling: 4.19M SOL sold in total since May 19, 2024 Valued at $757M at an average price of $181 Of that: 264,373 SOL was sold directly on-chain (~$41.64M) 3.93M SOL (~$715.5M) was deposited into Kraken This multi-year accumulation of transactions intensified concerns that Pump.fun has been liquidating assets steadily. The thread triggered immediate reactions across X, from curiosity to outright FUD, partly fueled by its precise numbers and the size of the movements. Pump.fun Responds: “This Is Misinformation” Pump.fun publicly rejected Lookonchain’s interpretation. In multiple posts, the team stated that: The USDC movements were part of internal treasury management The funds originated from the PUMP ICO Transfers involved reorganizing liquidity across wallets The platform has never worked directly with Circle, despite the flows Lookonchain connected to Circle-related wallets No evidence supports the idea of coordinated off-ramps or cash-outs by the founders The team’s position is clear: the transactions represent corporate bookkeeping, not dumping. Pump.fun emphasized that the company is actively managing its “runway,” reallocating USDC to support growth, operations, and business reinvestment. They called Lookonchain’s framing inaccurate and misleading, sparking debate over how much on-chain analysis can infer about corporate treasury behavior. A Closer Look at Treasury Management Claims Pump.fun’s defense hinges on one central explanation: The USDC from the PUMP ICO is being moved across internal wallets as part of structured treasury management. The team provided additional context: 1. Funds were reorganized across multiple treasury wallets The USDC wasn’t withdrawn into cash, according to Pump.fun, but redistributed for operational planning and financial management. 2. No direct relationship with Circle While Lookonchain identified USDC eventually reaching Circle’s mint/burn pathways, Pump.fun insists those flows do not imply a business relationship. Many large exchanges routinely use Circle for settlement. Kraken → Circle flows do not necessarily indicate Pump.fun’s involvement beyond depositing to Kraken. complete misinformation from @lookonchain again. $0 have been cashed out – we're not involved in the transactions between Kraken and Circle that you're alleging us to be a part of. What's happening is a part of pump's treasury management, where USDC from the $PUMP ICO has been… https://t.co/qd6GUnIxKH — Sapijiju (@sapijiju) November 24, 2025 3. Treasury tokens from the ICO are being used for runway Pump.fun states the PUMP ICO raised significant capital, and that treasury diversification is part of long-term sustainability. They argue it is normal for companies to: Move funds between wallets Rebalance holdings Use centralized exchanges for treasury operations And adjust capital allocations year-to-year The team’s stance is that nothing in the transactions signals mismanagement or off-ramping. Why the Report Triggered FUD So Quickly The crypto space reacts fast, especially when a thread highlights millions moving through exchanges. Three factors drove the rapid bearish sentiment: Large Numbers Seeing $436M USDC and 4.19M SOL tied to one protocol creates immediate alarm, regardless of context. Kraken Deposits In the industry’s eyes, CEX deposits often equal “preparing to sell.” The nuance behind treasury management rarely reaches the same virality. SOL Sales Timeline The SOL sales span over a year, but were summarized in one thread, amplifying the shock. Together, these points created a narrative that Pump.fun was “cashing out,” even before the team responded. Ongoing Debate: Transparency vs. Interpretation This situation illustrates a recurring tension in crypto: On-chain data shows what happens. But it doesn’t always show why it happens. Lookonchain’s report is precise in tracking transactions. But Pump.fun argues the interpretation misses internal context. This raises several questions: Should protocols proactively disclose treasury management updates? Should analysts label findings more cautiously when intent is unknown? Should treasury wallets be publicly flagged to avoid misinterpretation? How should projects communicate large movements without triggering community panic? These debates will likely continue as protocols grow more sophisticated and their treasuries scale. Pump.fun hasn’t announced further clarification, but several things are likely: 1. More transparency After this level of scrutiny, protocols often publish updated treasury overviews or dashboards. 2. Continuous monitoring Analysts on X will keep watching Kraken-linked wallets for any new deposits or sales. 3. Community stabilization The initial wave of FUD is cooling as the team’s explanation circulates. Market sentiment typically normalizes once context becomes clearer. 4. Growth still accelerating Despite the noise, Pump.fun remains one of the most active platforms in Solana’s ecosystem, powering tens of thousands of launches monthly. Treasury events rarely slow activity unless tied to confirmed misconduct, and there is no evidence of that here. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ether is trading above a significant $2,800 level, which has acted as a strong support and resistance throughout this entire cycle, he observed. “Price is finding some sort of support for the time being, but it is essential for the bulls to defend this area.” Earlier this year, this price level served as resistance before the asset finally broke out in July. In 2024, it served as support during the Ether rally. Bulls Currently Defending A break below this level could see ETH prices crash to the next major support zone, which is around $2,170. Resistance currently lies just above $3,400, making it the next target for the bulls. $ETH Decision time here!

It is important to note that simultaneously, analytics firm 10x Research announced that its own “Greed & Fear” Index has hit an historical bottom, showing very adverse market sentiment to bitcoin prices. It has been observed that previous adverse market sentiment often precedes an ultimate price bottom, making way for a short-term market correction. As the prices for Bitcoins continue to fluctuate, research analysts are looking to find resistant assets with foundation growth. Some projects that are gaining attention include Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which appears to stand at the top for investors hoping to amplify investments amidst market turmoil and is considered one of the best cryptos to buy now. Market Sentiment & Strategic Change The current state of the crypto market is filled with fear, which is a contrarian indicator that has always signified areas where accumulation can take place. Now that Bitcoin is on its quest for stability, money has started to rotate into projects that are making actual headway and not those that are working on stories or narratives. It has also become common for investors to question where they can find a cryptocurrency to buy to ensure profit generation regardless of market fluctuations. This has created demand for presales for DeFi projects with solid fundamentals, where investment entry points are likely to be advantageous prior to listings on exchanges. Mutuum Finance: One of DeFi’s Top Investment Options Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the leading cryptos to buy at this moment, relying on its presale success and imminent protocol launch. It has managed to secure $19,000,000 from investors and accumulate 18,200 holders, making it quite popular. It has entered phase six, selling tokens at $0.035, which has shown a 250% jump from phase one. Phase 6 is 95% filled, meaning that this is the last chance to buy into this price for the token acquisition for MUTM tokens. The next phase will include about a 20% price rise to $0.040 per token, meaning that this is a last-minute opportunity to gain entry. It has been predicted that investors can gain over 400% returns once the token has gone live on its selling price at $0.06. It also has dynamic community incentives. The project has a 24-hour leaderboard that rewards the top contributor with a $500 MUTM bonus for as long as they perform at least one transaction in each UTC cycle. Mutuum Finance has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway where they reward ten winners with $10,000 each. Moreover, it has also enabled card payments directly for MUTM tokens. Another important aspect is that security has always been one of its priorities, for which an independent audit on the protocol’s contracts for lending and borrowing has been initiated by Halborn Security prior to its mainnet launch. Securing Position Before Next Leap As Mutuum Finance heads into the last stage of presale Phase 6, the opportunity to buy at this level becomes limited. This is followed by presale Phase 7, which offers new investors a higher priced token than previous sales. Analysts refer to presales for projects that possess great mechanics and sound project strategies as one of the most profitable chances for investors in the cryptocurrency market. Mutuum Finance illustrates exactly this kind of ambition, with its transparent development roadmap and very aggressive tokenomics rewards structure to incentivize early contributors. It also plans to unveil its dual-market lending platform on its V1 rollout on the Sepolia testnet later this year. As long as Bitcoin is making headlines for its price movements, shrewd investors are making the most out of this fear-driven period to align themselves for promising projects that are still in their nascent stages. Mutuum Finance is one such project that offers many reasons to support it and is also seeing its presale fill up quickly. It is in its current presale stage and provides one of the most preferable risk vs reward deals within DeFi, making it very desirable for traders looking to grow exponentially. It is important to act on this opportunity prior to its presale ending and prior to its prices going up.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces selling pressure toward $0.157 WLFI price is facing a surge as sellers push the price toward $0.157. WLFI price is aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume dropped toward $43.85 million, showing decreased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.157, declining over 0.1% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades above the midline at level 59, suggesting strong buying pressure. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price hovers above EMA trend lines, bears prepare for a domination by sending the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.47, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, hinting at a bullish pressure.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.1694, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2105. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1438, resulting in a correction to $0.1122.

Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price down today? Sellers are gaining confidence to maintain their dominance, resulting in a downward push toward $0.157. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction November 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in November. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.1 and a maximum price of $0.25, with an average of $0.18 in November.

World Liberty Financial Price Prediction 2029 By 2029, analysts expect WLFI to begin at $0.72, maintain an average price of $0.83, and rise toward $0.86. WLFI Crypto Price Forecast for 2030 By 2030, experts predict WLFI will start at $0.89, trade at an average of $0.96, and potentially reach $1.02. Crossing the one-dollar mark would be a significant psychological milestone for investors and a strong indicator of growth. World Liberty Financial Price Prediction 2031 By 2031, WLFI is expected to open at $1.26, average around $1.3, and peak at $1.40.

Key Takeaways: A Hyperliquid whale who earned nearly $200 million in October has expanded his Ether long to $44.5 million. Blockchain sleuths have linked the wallet to former BitForex CEO Garret Jin, who denies ownership. Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin’s recent dip likely marked a local bottom. The trader, widely referred to as the “OG Whale” or the “$10B HyperUnit Whale,” increased an already large Ether long on Monday, bringing the total position to $44.5 million, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. The whale added another $10 million to the long, and Arkham noted the position was up more than $300,000 within the first hour. Mystery Whale Linked to Ex-BitForex CEO The wallet remains unverified, though blockchain investigators last month connected it to former BitForex CEO Garret Jin. Jin denied ownership of the wallet but acknowledged knowing the individual behind it. The whale’s high-stakes long arrives as Ether trades near $2,900, up roughly 2% in the past 24 hours amid a broader uptick across the crypto market. The trader has built a reputation for timing major swings correctly, fuelled by a series of profitable shorts placed throughout October and November. You definitively say in your post the Bitcoin whale is Garrett Jin and now in your reply to me say “these are certainly BTC from multiple entities” pic.twitter.com/PqFIWW58ki — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) October 12, 2025 While the whale positions for an Ether bounce, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes is calling for Bitcoin to stabilize as US liquidity conditions shift. In a Monday post on X , Hayes argued that BTC’s recent drop to $80,500 likely marked the cycle’s local bottom, pointing to the expected end of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program. The Fed’s balance sheet is set to stop shrinking next month, a shift Hayes believes should improve liquidity across risk assets. “Minor improvements in $ liq,” he summarized. Hayes added that U.S banks increased lending in November, another factor that typically supports crypto markets. He expects Bitcoin to remain below $90,000 in the short term, with a possible final dip into the low $80,000s, yet he maintains $80,000 will hold. Macro Uncertainty Fuels Volatility Bitcoin’s path has been complicated by shifting expectations for the Fed’s December meeting. The government shutdown left policymakers with limited economic data, contributing to unusually rapid swings in rate-cut odds. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 79% probability of a quarter-point rate cut, up from 42% just a week earlier. The volatility caught the attention of economist Mohamed El-Erian, who called the fluctuations “stunning.” “This kind of wild volatility is the opposite of the predictability and stability the Fed usually strives for,” he said on X, pointing to data disruptions and uncertainty around the Fed’s leadership.

Among those affected is the Trump family, whose wealth reportedly decreased by $1 billion over the past month, according to Bloomberg. Their current net worth now stands at approximately $6.7 billion, down from $7.7 billion in September. Trump Family’s Crypto Portfolio Takes Major Hits The family’s crypto portfolio has suffered significant losses as a result of recent market conditions, including President Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, Eric Trump’s Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm, American Bitcoin (ABTC), and Truth Social—all of which are Bitcoin-related. Related Reading: XRP Real Purpose: Documentation Shows Payment Utility Contrary To Viral Claims — Details One of the hardest-hit entities is Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social. Last week, shares of the firm dropped to a record low, resulting in an estimated $800 million decline in Trump’s stake since September. The company has invested heavily in Bitcoin, spending roughly $2 billion on digital assets. Its stockpile of approximately 11,500 BTC, purchased when Bitcoin prices hovered around $115,000, now represents a significant downturn of about 25%. In addition, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), regarded as the Trump family’s principal crypto operation, has seen its value diminish rapidly. WLFI, which was once trading at $0.26, has now fallen to around $0.15 when writing. At its peak, the token’s total valuation reached about $6 billion, but it is now worth just over $4 billion. Despite the difficulties, a spokesperson for World Liberty Financial expressed optimism, stating that “Crypto is here to stay.” The spokesperson emphasized a long-term conviction in the technologies that support digital assets, suggesting that these innovations could transform financial services. Eric Trump Remains Optimistic Following his return to office in January, President Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., also began collaborating with Hut 8 Corp, a crypto company that supplies Bitcoin mining equipment. In exchange, they secured a controlling interest in a newly formed organization called American Bitcoin Corp. Eric Trump reportedly holds about 7.5% of this new venture.

However, shares of Hut 8, which are traded on Nasdaq, have been cut by nearly half, wiping out over $300 million from Eric Trump’s wealth since September, with shares previously valued at $9.31. Amidst these financial challenges, Eric Trump conveyed a sense of optimism, suggesting that the recent market declines may present “a great buying opportunity.” He emphasized that those who purchase during downturns and embrace market volatility are likely to be the long-term winners in the cryptocurrency landscape. Currently, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a 1.5% recovery on Monday toward $88,430, after reaching an 8-month low of $80,000 last Friday. This positions BTC nearly 30% below all-time highs of $126,000 reached back in October.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/researcher-to-xrp-holders-get-ready-200-will-happen-heres-why/,"Citibank’s latest view on Bitcoin has sent ripples across the crypto market. The bank stated that Bitcoin’s liquidity squeeze is projected to improve between now and the end of the year. The comment came when tight conditions engulfed major assets. This created renewed interest in liquidity trends and how they may shape the next stage of the cycle. Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle) released a video reacting to this update. He framed the development as a turning point for digital assets. In his view, an improvement in Bitcoin’s liquidity often creates a shift in capital flow across the market. He referred to Bitcoin’s recent conditions as a “chokehold” on upward movement and said that the squeeze is now easing. He argued that this change could position XRP for a sharp upward move if market liquidity expands, with the asset potentially targeting $200. GET READY XRP HOLDERS! ($200 #XRP Incoming !?) pic.twitter.com/PoIShbHIsZ — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 22, 2025 Citibank’s Position on Bitcoin Liquidity Citibank stated that liquidity is expected to improve. The bank did not offer price predictions. Its remarks focused on conditions that limited Bitcoin’s ability to move with strength through recent periods. Ripple Bull Winkle highlighted this comment in his video. He said that when Bitcoin’s liquidity unlocks, “capital floods into the rest of the markets.” He believes this shift tends to occur each time Bitcoin exits a tight liquidity phase. Ripple Bull Winkle pointed to the size of the institution behind the statement. He said Citibank “moves global markets,” and that this type of assessment should matter to any participant who monitors liquidity cycles. His view places weight on institutional signals and how they may guide expectations for the remaining months of the year. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP Could React Strongly Ripple Bull Winkle focused on XRP as the asset he believes could benefit the most. He said that XRP sits in a compressed zone with a large liquidity air pocket above its current range. He argued that if liquidity improves for Bitcoin, the market tends to shift towards high-value majors once the initial reaction subsides. In his view, XRP falls into that category and stands ready for what he described as a potential rapid move. He believes that the asset could reclaim its all-time high without breaking past trends. He also stated a clear target, predicting that XRP can reach $200 under the right conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

54880026,633784,1764064809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54880026.jpeg,$11 Million Crypto Vanishes In San Francisco Fake-Delivery Heist,https://bitcoinist.com/11-million-crypto-san-francisco-fake-delivery-heist/,"A staged fake-delivery encounter in San Francisco’s Mission Dolores district escalated into one of the city’s largest known individual crypto thefts, after a disguised assailant subdued a resident and escaped with assets worth $11 million, alongside the victim’s phone and laptop. Mission Dolores Hit By $11M Crypto Robbery According to a police report obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, the Saturday evening robbery unfolded in broad daylight on the unit block of Dorland Street, only steps from Mission Dolores Park—a neighborhood where tech proximity and high-value assets have increasingly intersected with targeted crime. Home-security footage posted by Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan captured the moments leading up to the heist. In the video, the suspect approaches the residence wearing dark clothing, a hooded sweatshirt, gloves and sunglasses, and holding a white package while deliberately turning his head away from the camera. He rings the doorbell and asks for “Joshua,” claiming the box is addressed to him. The ruse continues when the resident opens the door and confirms his name. The man posing as a courier asks whether the victim can “sign for this,” pats his own pocket as though searching for a pen, and then asks the resident if he has one. The moment the victim steps inside to retrieve a pen, the intruder follows him into the home and moves out of frame. A loud noise is heard. Police later confirmed that the suspect brandished a firearm and bound the victim with duct tape before fleeing with his belongings. Officers arrived at approximately 6:45 p.m. and found the victim with non-life-threatening injuries. No arrests had been made as of Monday morning, and authorities have not disclosed details about how the $11 million in cryptocurrency was accessed or transferred. Tan publicly acknowledged the incident on X, describing the victim as a friend and community member. He urged anyone in the neighborhood with security footage from 4:30 to 6 p.m. to contact the San Francisco Police Department. “We have to find the perpetrator,” Tan wrote. “Time is of the essence.” The Big Risk Of Self-Custody In a follow-up post referencing the crypto theft, Tan added a pointed observation about crypto asset security: “ Self custody of crypto seems like a good idea until it isn’t. Vault storage (at Coinbase or elsewhere) for long term holding is safest.” His comments drew immediate attention from both the tech and crypto communities, highlighting the tension between self-custody principles and the physical-security risks of storing large private-key access at home. Thus, the incident has reignites a longstanding debate about personal-security practices among high-net-worth crypto holders in urban settings. While hacks, phishing attacks, SIM swaps and insider compromise have dominated crypto asset crime over the past decade, physical-world robberies —once rare—have become increasingly sophisticated. The San Francisco case stands out due to the scale of assets stolen, the execution of the ruse and the direct commentary from one of Silicon Valley’s most visible figures. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.98 trillion.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto crime|Crypto heist|Crypto market news|crypto news|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-25 10:00:09

Dogecoin has been one of the biggest names in retail trading for years, but its latest 20% drop has opened a new debate. Many investors are now looking at early stage projects with stronger upside potential, lower entry prices and real utility. One of the tokens getting the most attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi crypto that is selling out its presale at a rapid pace. With Phase 6 already at 90% allocation, many investors believe MUTM could be one of the best crypto opportunities under $0.05 right now. This shift has created strong urgency. While DOGE cools down after a sharp pullback, MUTM continues to gain buyers daily. Analysts also expect this trend to grow as more traders rotate out of meme coins and into utility projects with early stage growth potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is trading near $0.158. The recent price drop pushed it far below its earlier highs and confirmed a downward trend that many traders were worried about. The market cap is still large at around $24 billion, which makes any strong recovery harder to achieve. With more than 151 billion coins in circulation, Dogecoin needs massive capital inflows to move in price. This makes it less attractive for investors who want fast growth or higher upside potential. DOGE is also struggling with several resistance zones. The first major resistance is near $0.17 to $0.20. Even if DOGE manages to break above this level, another strong resistance block sits between $0.25 and $0.30. Technical indicators show weak momentum and slow volume growth, which increases the chance of further downside. Analysts believe that DOGE may not deliver strong gains in the coming months. Some projections show that Dogecoin may only rise between 5% and 20% even in a more positive market. This is not appealing for investors who are now seeking stronger upside or early stage growth. DOGE remains a meme coin, and in a market where utility and fundamentals matter again, that can become a limitation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an upcoming DeFi crypto protocol building a decentralized lending system. It allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets through smart contracts. Instead of relying on intermediaries, the protocol uses automated mechanisms to match deposits and borrowing demand. This creates a more open, accessible and transparent system compared to traditional finance. MUTM is still in presale, and investor interest has been strong from the start. The presale price is $0.035. Phase 6 is now around 90% allocated. The project has already raised millions and the number of holders continues to rise every day. Early buyers say they like the entry price and the strong upside potential ahead of the V1 launch. Mutuum Finance also has a passed security audit, which gives new investors confidence. The protocol has been checked for vulnerabilities and high risk issues. This audit is one of the biggest reasons why the presale has grown so fast, because many investors want safety before a token goes live. 3 Reasons Why MUTM Could Outperform DOGE The rotation from DOGE to MUTM is driven by three main factors. Many analysts believe these points highlight why MUTM could be the better option for long term growth. 1. DOGE Has a Huge Market Cap That Limits Its Growth Potential Dogecoin’s market cap is around $24 billion. For DOGE to double in price, it would need billions in new inflows. For it to 10x again like in previous cycles, the crypto market would need an unrealistically large expansion. This is why many analysts say DOGE cannot repeat its old parabolic surges. MUTM, on the other hand, is still at an early stage. The presale valuation is small compared to DOGE. This means it has far more room to grow in percentage terms. Early stage tokens often deliver the highest gains in bull markets, especially when supported by real utility. 2. DOGE Is a Meme Coin With No Real Utility, MUTM Is Utility Based Dogecoin remains a meme coin. It has a strong community but limited real world use cases. Most of its price action depends on hype, social trends or sudden market sentiment. This makes it unpredictable and weaker during market corrections. Mutuum Finance is built around utility. The protocol uses smart contracts, lending pools and automated liquidation systems. Depositors receive mtTokens, which accumulate yield over time. Borrowers interact through a secure and transparent process based on loan to value rules and interest models. The buy and distribute model also helps support the token. Lending revenue is used to buy MUTM from the market and distribute it to mtToken stakers. This creates natural buying pressure over time. 3. Timing: Early DOGE Investors Are Rotating Into MUTM Many early DOGE holders are now diversifying into utility projects. Social data shows that investors who bought during Dogecoin’s early boom are exploring new opportunities with higher growth potential. One of the most common picks among this group is MUTM. This shift is also driven by Mutuum Finance announcing its V1 launch. According to the official X statement , the protocol is preparing to go live on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This adds urgency because investors like to enter before a major product launch that could increase visibility and demand. Phase 6 Selling Out Fast, Security Audit and 24 Hour Board Support Growing Momentum The presale is moving fast. Phase 6 is around 90% filled and could sell out soon. This creates strong urgency for investors who want the $0.035 entry price before the next stage begins. Each new phase increases the price and reduces the supply available for early buyers. Mutuum Finance also has a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards top contributors. This attracts more buyers during peak demand hours. On top of that, MUTM can be purchased with card payments, which makes the process simple for new investors. The completed security audit is also a strong confidence signal. The project has been reviewed and the code is considered safe. This is important for a lending protocol because users want to deposit assets without fear of major vulnerabilities. With V1 approaching, Phase 6 almost sold out and strong growth catalysts in place, many analysts believe MUTM could be one of the best crypto options under $0.05 right now.

Despite this rally, which came on the heels of new XRP ETFs hitting the US markets, there are certain warning signs from whales again. XRP Jumps to Weekly High The cross-border token experienced a substantial correction last week alongside the rest of the crypto market, plunging from over $2.50 to under $1.85 in the span of just ten days. However, the bulls finally intercepted the move after that multi-month low and helped it recover to over $2.00 in the next few days. The asset kept climbing in the past 24 hours, surging to almost $2.30 earlier today, which became a weekly high. The most evident reason behind this impressive rally is the launch of spot XRP ETFs in the United States, including the two that went live for trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The net inflows were quite impressive for the group of XRP ETFs, which has now risen to four such financial vehicles, with more than $164 million. Grayscale’s product debuted with $67.36 million, while Franklin Templeton’s ETF saw $62.59 million on its first day. Yesterday was the XRP ETFs’ second-best day for net inflows, behind only Canary’s launch on November 14. XRP ETF FLOWS: $XRP ETFs saw $164.04M in net inflows yesterday. On its first day of trading, the Grayscale XRP ETF saw a net inflow of $67.36M. While Franklin Templeton’s ETF saw inflows of $62.59M on its first day. pic.twitter.com/PsjbOHGnt7 — Kyle Chassé / DD (@Kylechasse) November 25, 2025 The price performance of the underlying asset now is in stark contrast to previous launches from Bitwise and Canary Capital, as both those product releases were followed by immediate corrections. Whales Keep Selling, Though Aside from today’s impressive surge of 7%, Ripple’s token jumped by nearly 20% in the span of just three days. The new ETFs on US soil should also be regarded as a bullish development for XRP investors, but whales have continued their recent selling spree. Data from Ali Martinez shows that these large market participants have offloaded another batch of more than 180 million tokens. Such moves increase the immediate selling pressure on the asset, but could also serve as an example to smaller investors, who might decide to panic-sell.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-1000-xrp-price-is-a-peanut-heres-why/,"XRP enthusiast Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) set off a wave of reactions after reacting to a post from crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG). In a short comment that caught the community’s attention, he suggested that XRP could hit $1,000. His reaction showcased a growing confidence among XRP supporters as new details about payment emerge. XRP’s Expanding Role The material shared by SMQKE came from ProgressSoft. The shot revealed a clear link between modern bank systems and networks that use newer payment standards. It highlighted a Centralized Payments Hub Orchestrator. The description explained that it acts as an intermediary between a bank’s back-end systems and the SWIFT network . It also showed support for CBPR+. The document listed payment options, such as Visa Direct, Ripple, and Mastercard Send. These features gave XRP holders a reason to pay closer attention. They point to a system that can connect older processes with updated technology . WARNING WARNING WARNING Please sit down before reading @SMQKEDQG post…neither of us are responsible for bumps on the head from passing out $1000 XRP Peanuts. Let’s Goooooo https://t.co/exD77E6d4Y — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) November 22, 2025 The Importance of this System The ProgressSoft document showed a hybrid setup that uses an ad hoc translator with native CBPR+/ISO 20022 support. This design enables institutions to move towards new standards without interrupting daily operations. It offers a smooth path for banks to upgrade their systems while staying active in global transfers. This matters to XRP holders because Ripple appears as one of the supported channels in the setup. The image also highlighted the easy adoption of CBPR+. Many banks are working toward these new message formats. They want accurate data, clear communication, and more efficient flows. A system that can manage CBPR+ while also supporting Ripple reduces technical effort during migration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This lets banks move forward without delays or extra integration work. It also means they can introduce faster payment routes once they are ready. Why XRP Holders See This as a Strong Signal Ripple’s presence in a system built for high-volume transfers gave many supporters a reason to believe that XRP could see stronger demand. Banks want systems that move fast and reduce errors. They also want options that match global standards. When software providers include Ripple in a list of supported payment paths, it suggests that more banks may test or adopt these tools in the future. Remi Relief suggests this adoption could send XRP to $1,000 . XRP holders see this as part of a larger shift. As banks begin linking digital assets with traditional payment rails, XRP could stand out as the best option to power this transition.

Could these cryptocurrencies be the next stars in the market's rebound? The article will explore which of these coins is poised for significant growth and why they have become focal points in the financial world. Solana Shows Signs of Rebound After Recent Losses Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently between a low one hundred nineteen dollars and a high one hundred forty-two dollars. Recently, it has shown signs of recovery with a 3.8% increase over the last week. Despite a tough month, dropping nearly 30%, the coin holds promise if it breaks past the next hurdle at one hundred fifty-five dollars. If Solana surges beyond this, it could aim for the second resistance level at one hundred seventy-eight dollars, offering a potential gain of over 20%. However, it also has a safety net at about one hundred nine dollars if it dips. This movement hints at a possible uptrend for the resilient cryptocurrency. XRP Holds Steady, Eyes Potential Surge Source: tradingview XRP's price is currently hovering between the high $1 range and just over $2. It has shown slight upward movement over the past week, though it's still down from the past month. The coin faces resistance at a little over $2.50, and if it breaks past this, it could aim for the $3 mark. Such a rise would represent over a 30% increase from its current upper price range. However, XRP also sees support at under $1.60, meaning it has some cushion to fall back on if needed. Its short-term moving average suggests some positive traction, pointing towards potential growth if investors maintain interest. Conclusion Solana and XRP are gaining traction on CME and Franklin ETF lists. This attention could position them as leaders in the next altcoin rally. Both assets offer unique strengths to investors. Solana’s fast transactions and low fees make it appealing. XRP’s focus on cross-border payments provides a solid use case. Increased visibility from CME and Franklin can boost their credibility. If market conditions improve, these factors may lead Solana and XRP to outperform other altcoins. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At press time, VeChain (VET) was trading at $0.01345, up 2.7% over the past 24 hours, after weeks of bearish momentum. VeChain and Rekord partnership VeChain’s new collaboration with Rekord focuses on building reliable, EU-ready digital product passports and tokenisation infrastructure for real-world assets. The partnership brings together VeChain’s enterprise-grade blockchain with Rekord’s API-first trust layer, creating a seamless way for companies to secure product data, documents and process logs on-chain without changing existing systems. This strengthens VeChain’s long-standing position in supply chain transparency and sustainability reporting. By enabling manufacturers to capture and verify product information directly at the source, the system ensures that data anchored on VeChainThor is permanent, verifiable and ready for regulatory audits. Rekord’s API is already live in production with multi-chain capability, and the first transactions have been pushed to the VeChain network. The timing of the partnership is significant as Europe prepares to enforce the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation in 2026. This regulation will require Digital Product Passports for a wide range of goods, linking compliance, sustainability and circular economy goals. With Rekord’s trust layer validating data and VeChain providing a scalable blockchain backbone, businesses can prepare for these rules without disrupting their workflows. Upcoming Hayabusa hard fork Beyond the Rekord partnership, the VeChain ecosystem is also preparing for its next mainnet upgrade, dubbed Hayabusa hard fork . The Hayabusa hard fork is scheduled for December 2 at block height 23,414,400, marking one of the most significant upgrades in VeChain’s history. The upgrade will transition VeChain from its current Proof-of-Authority setup to a more decentralised Delegated Proof-of-Stake model. This shift aims to improve network security and encourage broader participation in governance. Only staked VET will generate VTHO under the new dynamic reward system, creating stronger incentives for token holders to support network operations. Hayabusa will launch alongside the StarGate mainnet, enabling NFT-based staking and validator delegation. Exchanges, including Bithumb, have confirmed temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals during the upgrade, underscoring their scale and importance. A testnet release on November 4 and an upgrade to v0.68 on Tuesday, November 25 , laid the groundwork, and the transition period will run until December 9. Notably, the upgrade is a meaningful step toward decentralisation, improved tokenomics, and stronger enterprise-level performance, contributing to renewed attention on VeChain price trends over the past week. VET price outlook As the VeChain–Rekord partnership drives market sentiment, eyes are on the upcoming Hayabusa upgrade. The VeChain network upgrades, staking incentives via StarGate, and real-world asset adoption provide strong fundamentals that may support a gradual recovery in VeChain price for traders looking for short to medium-term gains. Technical indicators show support around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0131, while immediate resistance sits near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0149. VeChain price analysis | Source: TradingView If bullish momentum continues, VET price could test $0.0163 within the next two weeks. Conversely, a drop below $0.0131 may trigger a short-term pullback toward the 24-hour low at $0.0128.

This article delves into three notable candidates poised for a rebound. Discover which digital coins might be primed for a comeback and why they stand out in the current landscape. Avalanche (AVAX) Faces Challenges but Shows Growth Potential Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is currently priced in the middle range of just under $12 to a bit above $15. Recent trends show AVAX has dipped by nearly 5% in the past week and close to 30% in the last month. Despite these setbacks, there's potential for a bounce back. The nearest resistance sits at $17, and if AVAX breaks through this level, it could reach $20. This would be a jump of about 30% from current levels. However, if it slips below $10.61, support could be tested further down. The market indicators show mixed signals, with room for both short-term challenges and potential growth. Solana Shows Signs of Rebound After Recent Losses Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently between a low one hundred nineteen dollars and a high one hundred forty-two dollars. Recently, it has shown signs of recovery with a 3.8% increase over the last week. Despite a tough month, dropping nearly 30%, the coin holds promise if it breaks past the next hurdle at one hundred fifty-five dollars. If Solana surges beyond this, it could aim for the second resistance level at one hundred seventy-eight dollars, offering a potential gain of over 20%. However, it also has a safety net at about one hundred nine dollars if it dips. This movement hints at a possible uptrend for the resilient cryptocurrency. NEAR Protocol: Is a New Upswing on the Horizon? Source: tradingview NEAR Protocol's price is currently between $1.61 and $2.22. It's been a tough time lately, with the coin dropping about 18% in both the past week and month, and over 35% over the last six months. However, there's potential for growth. If NEAR climbs past the nearest hurdle at $2.62, it could aim for a bigger target near $3.23. This would mean a rise of over 45% from the lower end of the current price range. The RSI is below 40, suggesting it might be undervalued, and with a bit of positive momentum, NEAR could start a more significant recovery. Conclusion AVAX, SOL, and NEAR show potential for recovery if market fear decreases. These high-beta assets often react swiftly to shifts in sentiment. Their strong fundamentals position them well for a rebound. As confidence improves, these could be among the first to see gains. Monitoring their performance can provide insights into broader market trends. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Launch Trezor Suite application (desktop, browser extension, or mobile app depending on your platform) and ensure your firmware is updated to the latest version for optimal security and compatibility. Step 2: Navigate to the Trade Section Within Trezor Suite, access the Trade section from the main navigation menu. Select the “Swap” option to initiate a cryptocurrency exchange. Choose the account containing the cryptocurrency you wish to exchange from the dropdown menu. Step 3: Configure Your Exchange Enter the amount you want to swap and select both the source cryptocurrency (what you’re trading from) and destination cryptocurrency (what you’re trading to). Trezor Suite will automatically query rates from all partner exchanges through Invity, displaying available offers with associated fees, processing times, and KYC policy. Step 4: Compare and Select an Exchange Review the available offers from partner exchanges including GODEX, Changelly, ChangeNOW, and others. Compare exchange rates, total fees, estimated processing times, and privacy policies. Select your preferred offer based on your priorities for price, speed, or anonymity. Step 5: Confirm Transaction Details Verify the destination address where you’ll receive the swapped cryptocurrency. This can be another account on your Trezor or an external wallet address. Review the exchange rate, network fees, and total amount you’ll receive. Most exchanges display all costs upfront with no hidden charges. Step 6: Authorize on Your Trezor When prompted, verify all transaction details on your Trezor device’s trusted display. Confirm the receiving address matches your intended destination and the exchange amount is correct. Use your Trezor’s physical button or touchscreen to authorize the transaction, ensuring your private keys never leave the secure hardware environment. Step 7: Complete the Exchange After authorization, your cryptocurrency will be sent to the exchange partner’s processing address. Track the transaction status through Trezor Suite, which provides real-time updates as the swap progresses. Most exchanges complete within 5-30 minutes depending on blockchain confirmation times and the specific cryptocurrencies involved. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Are Trezor-integrated exchanges safer than regular crypto exchanges? Yes, they eliminate custodial risk by keeping your private keys on the hardware wallet throughout the exchange process, protecting against hacks and platform failures. Q: Do I need KYC verification to use Trezor exchange integrations? It varies by platform. GODEX and most partners offer instant-access swaps, while some may require verification for large transactions or specific regions. Q: What are the typical fees for exchanging crypto through Trezor? Fees include network transaction costs plus exchange service charges, typically ranging from 0.5% to 2% depending on the platform and trading pair selected. Q: Can I cancel a transaction after authorizing it on my Trezor? Once blockchain confirmations begin, cancellation is generally not possible. Always verify all details on your Trezor display before authorizing transactions. Q: Which Trezor models support exchange integrations? All current Trezor models (Model One, Model T, Safe 3, Safe 5, Safe 7) support exchange functionality through Trezor Suite with compatible partner platforms. Conclusion Trezor’s integration with carefully vetted cryptocurrency exchange platforms represents the evolution of secure digital asset trading, combining cold storage security with trading convenience.

54880336,https://coinpaper.com/12600/legendary-trader-peter-brandt-issues-bitcoin-warning,1764065636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Veteran Trader Issues Bitcoin Warning,https://coinpaper.com/12600/legendary-trader-peter-brandt-issues-bitcoin-warning,"Veteran commodity trader Peter Brandt has issued a cautious assessment of Bitcoin's recent price action. The market analyst shared a technical chart depicting what he characterizes as a ”dead cat bounce” following the cryptocurrency's sharp decline from above $120,000 to the low $80,000s. Bitcoin now trades within a narrow range between $88,000 and $92,000. This corridor has become the focal point for traders attempting to gauge the asset's next direction. Brandt's chart outlines a five-wave corrective pattern, suggesting that the recent recovery may lack fundamental strength. Source: X The cryptocurrency dropped more than $40,000 in two weeks before stabilizing, to trade at around $86,869, up 0.9% in the last 24 hours. Market participants remain divided on whether this represents a temporary pause before further declines or the foundation for renewed upward momentum. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Technical Structure Points to Defensive Positioning The chart analysis reveals a market operating in reactive mode rather than showing signs of aggressive accumulation. Trading volumes remain subdued compared to the rally that pushed Bitcoin above $120,000 earlier this year. Order book depth has diminished across major exchanges, creating conditions where large trades can move prices more dramatically. Liquidity conditions deteriorated throughout the previous week. Bid-ask spreads widened on several platforms, indicating reduced market maker participation. These technical factors suggest traders are approaching current levels with caution rather than conviction. The $88,000 to $92,000 range has absorbed multiple tests from both directions. Support at $88,000 has held against downside pressure, while resistance near $92,000 has rejected upward attempts. Neither bulls nor bears have managed to establish clear control. Recent liquidation data shows over $1.2 billion in long positions were forced out during the decline. This deleveraging has cleaned up some excessive positioning but has not been followed by the type of aggressive buying typically seen at major bottoms. The absence of strong dip-buying activity raises questions about demand strength at these levels. Bitcoin ETF Flows Show Shift in Institutional Sentiment Bitcoin exchange-traded fund activity has shifted markedly from patterns observed earlier in the quarter. BlackRock's IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, recorded multiple net outflow sessions last week. The product had previously attracted consistent inflows during Bitcoin's climb toward $120,000. Smaller ETF products displayed mixed results, with some registering modest inflows while others experienced withdrawals. The inconsistent flow pattern contrasts sharply with the steady accumulation seen during the fourth quarter of 2024 and early January 2025. These ETF movements matter because they represent institutional and retail demand through regulated investment vehicles. The shift from consistent inflows to scattered activity suggests changing risk appetite among traditional investors.

COIN's recent struggles and volatility have led to NAV erosion and reduced distributions for CONY, but long-term growth potential remains if crypto sentiment rebounds. Macro headwinds and crypto market weakness are temporary; COIN is well-positioned for future adoption, making CONY attractive for income seekers once stability returns. CONY remains a viable income-generating ETF, but due to NAV erosion and ongoing risks, it should be a small portfolio allocation until COIN recovers. CONY ( CONY ) is a synthetic covered call ETF that has a primary focus of generating income for investors. It targets Coinbase ( COIN ) as the individual underlying stock it writes covered calls against. Since COIN has been struggling as of late, CONY has also. There has been a lot of volatility for COIN over the last year, which I think has been a reason CONY has been able to offer up some significant distributions. But with the volatility moving to the downside once again, it has provided new challenges for CONY, which has been slowly cutting back on its distributions while at the same time dropping in NAV. As the chart below shows, CONY has been trading largely in line with COIN, with the gap starting to widen in April 2025, as it has with a number of other covered call ETFS. While true, that hasn't stopped the interest in CONY, as it has over $800 million in AUM while trading over 25 million in volume on a daily basis. In this article we'll look at some of the dynamics associated with the ETF, the importance of the underlying, and what I'm looking for to consider taking a position in it once the fear trade eases off. CONY amd COIN chart (Seeking Alpha) The significance of the underlying When considering taking a position in a covered call ETF that has a single underlying stock, it's important to have a good grasp of that stock in the same way you would if you were thinking of taking a position in it. With that in mind, I believe COIN has the strong probability of having a consistent long-term growth trajectory. It is my thought that it has been oversold, as evidenced by the pullback after the solid earnings beat in its last reporting period, where it generated revenue of $1.87 billion, up over 55% year-over-year, beating by $60.37 million. It also had a solid earnings beat, where EPS came in at $1.50 per share, surpassing expectations by $0.40. Since the earnings report the company has been in a freefall, dropping from approximately $343.00 per share on October 31, 2025, to a little over $240.00 per share as I write. CONY has predictably followed suit, continually dropping in share price in conjunction with the price movement of COIN. While this isn't an article on COIN, the point is, when taking a position in a covered call ETF that has one underlying stock, you need to know that stock well. Why this is invaluable is because there are a lot of periods of volatility with covered call ETFS, and if you don't have a solid grasp of the underlying and believe in it, it'll be easy to be chased out of that position potentially resulting in unrealized losses becoming realized losses, while at the same time losing the income stream. It's also important to know the difference between why the share price of the ETF is falling. In other words, is it real NAV erosion or nothing more than the share price dropping in response to the share price of the underlying dropping. For the life of CONY I see it being both, primarily because of the high distribution being paid out. Once the crypto market reverses direction and positive sentiment return, I think CONY will start to trade more sideways or slightly up, with distributions having the support of the strength of the underlying. Macro effects Economic sentiment has been rapidly changing lately, with investors, in many cases, fleeing holdings that are considered risky and either holding that as cash or redeploying capital into less risky assets. Among the general macro elements are interest rates, recession fears, and whether or not the bull market run is over. More specifically, as it relates to CONY, is the dampening sentiment in regard to the overall crypto space, which COIN and CONY are directly associated with. I see this as being a temporary pullback in crypto sentiment, and expect it to reverse course in the not-too-distant future, which will provide support for COIN and CONY. In my view, crypto is still in its early stages of adoption, and COIN is uniquely positioned to take advantage of that over the long haul. For that reason I think, over time, CONY could be a good holding for those seeking income, with the caveat it doesn't appear to have found its bottom yet. More importantly, since it seeks to generate income for investors, I want to see it find its distribution range while maintaining NAV. Conclusion I believe COIN is going to turn around when the fear trade eases, and when it does, CONY should better hold NAV while continuing to pay out a solid distribution. Even so, it seems to me that it's likely it'll have to cut back some on its distribution until that plays out. After all, CONY will perform best in a volatile environment, especially when the price of COIN is climbing. CONY has fallen a lot since its inception, experiencing real NAV erosion during that time. It isn't all NAV erosion, but a lot of it is. Until the fund managers get that under control, it's likely to continue. There are only two things I see that will help with that, which is the return in growth of COIN, which will generate more covered call income, and second, cutting back some on its distribution. Yet, even under that scenario CONY would remain a decent holding for those seeking income, especially in the price range it's trading now. I'm considering taking a position in CONY, but I want to wait to see what happens once COIN rebounds. The major thing to take into consideration with CONY is even with the very real NAV erosion, it continues to do what it was designed to do, which is to provide a good income stream for traders. Even if the distribution declines further, it's still far above the majority of stocks or ETFs that throw off dividends or distributions. At best I would consider CONY to be a very small percentage of an overall portfolio build to generate an income stream for investors; it would be prudent to only have a small weighting with th ETF.",COIN|CONY,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-25 10:16:38

In the meantime, many altcoins have produced more impressive gains, including ENA, HYPE, and XRP. BTC Eyes $90K? Recall the events that transpired last week, which brought the primary cryptocurrency to its knees for the first time in months. The asset had already lost the coveted $100,000 level, but the bears were just getting started. Last Monday and Tuesday, they drove BTC from over $96,000 to under $90,000, where it found some support and immediately rebounded to $94,000. However, that relief rally didn’t last long, and bitcoin was quickly on the downfall again, this time to new lows. By Friday afternoon, BTC had lost over $13,000 and plunged below $81,000 for the first time since April. This meant that it had dropped by around 35% since its all-time high in early October. Following this seven-month low, though, the cryptocurrency finally started to recover some ground and stood at around $84,000 during the weekend. It kept posting modest gains over the past couple of days, which resulted in a surge to $89,000 earlier today. It failed there and now sits around $87,000, but it’s still slightly in the green on a daily scale. Its market cap has risen to $1.740 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 56.5% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView These Alts Turn Green Ethereum surged past $2,900 earlier today but has dipped below that level as of press time, despite posting a 3% daily increase. BNB, DOGE, HYPE, ADA, and LINK are well in the green, but XRP and SOL have stolen the show from the larger caps. The former has surged by 7% to $2.20, while the latter is up by more than 5% to trade above $135. Even more impressive gains come from KAS (22%), SUI (11%), ENA (10%), and CC (9%). RAIN, though, has skyrocketed by more than 100% after this multi-million dollar initiative. In contrast, ZEC and BCH have dropped the most from the bigger altcoins, losing 6.3% and 4.5%, respectively. The total crypto market cap has increased by over $60 billion in a day and is up to $3.075 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview Daily.

Currently trading at $2.19, the cryptocurrency is navigating a delicate balance between growing buying pressure and heavy resistance zones that could cap its upside. BOSSMD reports XRP accumulation gaining momentum, but strong supply zones could cap gains. Failure to breach these levels may trigger a pullback to prior support. The $2.30 level is the first key target for bullish traders, surpassing it signals buyers reclaiming control. BOSSMD highlights that a clean break above $2.45 would decisively flip the market structure upward, potentially sparking a broader rally and drawing renewed institutional and retail interest, fueling XRP’s momentum. On-chain data shows accumulation aligning with broader market trends, signaling traders are positioning for potential upside. Yet, heavy supply zones pose a risk of rejection, making the possibility of a breakout that could reshape the near-term trend a key focus for market participants. Well, technical indicators signal cautious optimism for XRP. Momentum is gradually turning bullish, but heavy supply zones keep upside fragile. Notably, $2.30 is the present key inflection point, while a clean break above $2.45 could trigger a decisive rally. Failure to surpass these levels may prompt profit-taking, highlighting the need for precise entry and exit strategies in today’s market. Therefore, XRP faces critical resistance between $2.30 and $2.45. A clean breakout could trigger a structural shift toward sustained bullish momentum, while failure may spark a fresh decline. Trading at $2.19, XRP sits at a key inflection point, balancing accumulation-driven optimism against supply-side pressure. XRP Makes Strides in Global Payments: SWIFT Test Integration Signals Potential Breakthrough Renowned analyst SMQKE notes SWIFT confirms a successful XRP settlement test via R3 Corda Settler in the GPI network, marking a major leap for XRP adoption in cross-border payments. Under strict regulatory and operational conditions, the test confirmed XRP’s seamless integration with the R3 Corda Settler, enabling it as a bridge currency for faster, more transparent, and cost-efficient institutional transfers. SWIFT’s Global Payments Innovation (GPI) network, already widely adopted by banks for its speed, transparency, and traceability, served as the operating environment for this integration. By successfully combining XRP with SWIFT GPI, the experiment showcased how digital assets can enhance existing financial systems rather than disrupt them. Banks and financial institutions could benefit from reduced settlement times, lower costs, and improved liquidity management. The successful integration of XRP into a regulated settlement workflow highlights its potential to bridge traditional finance and blockchain. Beyond proof of concept, this development could drive real-world adoption in cross-border payments, attracting renewed institutional interest. With near-instant settlement and lower costs than correspondent banking, XRP’s long-promised utility may finally become a reality. Notably, XRP’s real-world applications are expanding beyond speculation, with milestones like the SWIFT-Corda test highlighting its growing role in global finance. The coming months will be critical in determining whether XRP evolves from experimental use to a core pillar of international settlements. Conclusion XRP sits at a pivotal juncture, slowly gaining bullish momentum but facing strong resistance between $2.30 and $2.45. A decisive breakout could ignite a sharp upward move and draw renewed market interest, while rejection may trigger a pullback. The coming sessions are crucial, as XRP’s near-term trend hinges on overcoming these supply-heavy levels. On the other hand, the integration of XRP into the R3 Corda Settler via SWIFT GPI marks a milestone for digital assets and traditional finance. This test highlights blockchain’s potential to enable faster, more transparent, and cost-efficient cross-border payments, signaling a path toward broader institutional adoption and real-world utility.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-25 10:36:47

The sentencing decision, released this month, outlines one of Canada’s most severe “wrench attack” cases. Source: CanLII Attackers Posed as Canada Post Workers Before Torturing Family for $1.6M in Crypto According to the court document, the attack occurred on April 27–28, 2024, when four men forced their way into a family home after two of them disguised themselves as Canada Post workers delivering a package. Once the father opened the door, the men pushed inside, shut the door behind them, and were joined moments later by two additional accomplices. The husband, wife, and daughter were restrained with zip ties and subjected to hours of escalating violence as the attackers demanded access to the father’s digital assets. Prosecutors said the man had previously spoken in the Chinese community about his cryptocurrency holdings, leading the group to believe he controlled substantial Bitcoin wealth. The intruders initially demanded 200 BTC, then reduced the demand to 100 BTC when he was unable to comply. The assailants ultimately transferred about $1.6 million in crypto before fleeing the property. Both parents were waterboarded and threatened with mutilation, while the daughter was forced to undress, filmed, and compelled to repeat explicit phrases. One of the attackers sexually assaulted her as the group continued pressuring the family for access to their assets. After the attackers tied the victims and wrapped them in blankets, a door shut, giving the daughter an opportunity to partially free herself. She escaped the home and called 911, prompting the police investigation. In May, one of the suspects, Tsz Wing Boaz Chan, pleaded guilty to breaking and entering, unlawful confinement, and sexual assault. He was sentenced earlier this month to seven years in prison. Authorities have not disclosed updates on the remaining suspects. Global Wave of Violent Crypto Robberies Surges; France Leads With 14 Cases The case comes at a time when physical attacks on crypto holders are rising sharply worldwide. According to a CryptoNews report in September citing data compiled by Bitcoin security advocate Jameson Lopp, incidents in which criminals use physical force to obtain wallet credentials have surged 169% since February . Physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. #Crypto #Attack https://t.co/d7lhF9bvvO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 21, 2025 Lopp’s database now documents over 60 wrench-style attacks this year, surpassing 2024 by 33%. with France leading at 14 cases. In the United States, a San Francisco resident was robbed of $11 million in cryptocurrency last weekend in a home invasion by a thief posing as a delivery driver, and no arrests have been announced.

In January, Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife were abducted in France in a 48-hour ordeal that left Balland with a severed finger. French prosecutors say criminal networks are increasingly using fake delivery uniforms, stolen service vans, and pre-attack intelligence to target crypto holders and their families. Attacks have also been reported in Thailand, Israel, Belgium, the U.K., and across the United States. In Chicago, six men were charged this year in a kidnapping scheme involving $15 million in stolen cryptocurrency.

Analysts say the rise in physical crime parallels the sector’s economic growth. With Bitcoin and other assets increasing in value, attackers are shifting from digital theft to physical coercion. A report from security firm CertiK found that crypto users lost $2.47 billion to hacks and scams in the first half of 2025 , pushing some criminal networks toward violent offline methods instead.

Key Takeaways: Crypto VC funding surged 290% in Q3 to $4.65B, marking the strongest quarter since early 2023. Capital flowed mainly into stablecoins, AI, and blockchain infrastructure, with seven deals capturing half of all investment. Pre-seed activity continues to shrink as investors favor mature firms and turn toward liquid products like Bitcoin ETPs. The surge marks a 290% jump from Q2 and reflects the strongest quarter since Q1’s $4.8 billion tally, according to new data from Galaxy Digital . Galaxy’s head of research, Alex Thorn, said the rebound shows that venture appetite for digital-asset startups remains stronger than many expected, even if overall activity is still below the breakneck pace of the 2021–2022 bull market. AI and Stablecoins Dominate as Crypto VC Flows Shift Toward Infrastructure Key areas like stablecoins, AI-driven crypto tools, blockchain infrastructure, and trading technology continued to attract capital throughout the quarter, while very early-stage activity held steady. The renewed momentum comes after nearly two years of muted investment across the sector. Venture firms pulled back sharply following the exposure of FTX’s multibillion-dollar fraud, which wiped out confidence and froze deal flow across nearly every corner of the industry. Despite the headline jump, capital deployment was heavily concentrated. Out of 414 venture deals, just seven accounted for half of all money invested in Q3. The quarter’s fundraising was heavily concentrated, with a handful of major players absorbing most of the capital. Revolut led with a massive $1 billio n round, followed by Kraken, which secured $500 million , and Erebor, a US-based crypto bank, which raised $250 million. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin has broken its 50-week MA, historically leading to tests of the 200-week level (~$65–70K) Liquidity is thinning, volatility is rising, and positioning remains too long Tax-loss harvesting and equity pressure could add to near-term downside … — Galaxy (@galaxyhq) November 24, 2025 Established companies, especially those founded around 2018, captured the majority of funding. Younger firms launched in 2024, however, represented the highest number of deals, suggesting strong early-stage interest even as the broader market matures. Thorn noted that pre-seed’s share has declined consistently over the past few years. As more traditional institutions enter crypto and existing venture-backed firms find market fit, “the golden era of pre-seed crypto venture investing has likely passed,” he said. Unlike earlier bull runs, the latest market cycle has not been matched by a parallel surge in venture financing. Thorn attributes the stagnation to fading interest in once-hot categories like NFTs, Web3 gaming, and consumer crypto apps, along with fierce competition from AI startups, which continue to dominate the venture landscape. Higher interest rates are another factor, discouraging venture allocators broadly. At the same time, institutional investors appear to be turning toward spot Bitcoin ETPs and digital-asset treasury strategies, gaining crypto exposure through liquid, regulated products instead of early-stage bets. Still, Thorn believes regulatory shifts, including clearer US frameworks, could renew allocator confidence. US Maintains Venture Dominance The United States remained the epicenter of crypto VC activity in Q3, capturing 47% of invested capital and 40% of completed deals. The UK followed with 28% of capital, while Singapore accounted for 3.8%. Despite previous regulatory uncertainty, Thorn expects US dominance to strengthen under the crypto-friendly Trump administration . “We expect US dominance to increase, particularly now that the GENIUS Act is law and especially if Congress can pass a crypto market structure bill,” he said.

Bitcoin reclaimed the $89k level on Monday, but has slightly dipped and now trades above $86k. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading above $2,800 per coin and could rally higher in the near term. Its recovery comes as institutional investors continue to acquire more Ether tokens. BitMine purchases more Ether coins Ether is up by 2% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading close to the $2,900 mark. The positive performance comes as the Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies increased its ETH holdings last week. The company purchased 69,822 ETH, growing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Thanks to this latest acquisition, BitMine now holds 3% of the entire ETH circulation, bringing it closer to its original goal of holding 5% of Ethereum’s supply. In its statement on Monday, the company confirmed that it also maintained a balance of 192 Bitcoin (BTC), a $38 million stake in Worldcoin (WLD) treasury, Eightco Holdings, and unencumbered cash of $800 million. However, thanks to the recent dip in crypto prices, BitMine’s total assets value has declined to $11.2 billion. BitMine is holding an unrealized loss of over $3.4 billion via its ETH treasury. BitMine Chairman Thomas Lee stated that, “The continued decline in crypto prices in the past week reflects the impaired liquidity since October 10th, as well as price technicals, which remain weak. A few weeks ago, we noted the likely downside for ETH prices would be around $2,500 and current ETH prices are basically there. This implies asymmetric risk/reward as the downside is 5% to 7%, while the upside is the supercycle ahead for Ethereum.” Additionally, BitMine has announced its intention to start staking its ETH holdings in 2026 using the Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN). The staking could help BitMine boost the average cost basis of its ETH holdings. The company is currently the leading Ethereum treasury globally, followed by SharpLink Gaming and The Ether Machine with holdings of 859,395 ETH and 496,712 ETH, respectively. Ether eyes $3,200 despite resistance pressure around $3k The ETH/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and efficient as Ether has added 2.5% to its value in the last 24 hours. Short traders suffered a $53 million liquidation over the past 24 hours as Ether briefly tested the $3k resistance level. The positive performance comes after Ether dipped below the $2,600 level on Friday. The coin is now trading above $2,880 and could rally higher in the near term. Ether is currently facing pressure as it shows early signs of rejection after hitting the $3k psychological level a few hours ago. Overcoming the $3k level would allow ETH to hit the ILQ and TLQ levels above $3,100. On the flipside, failure to overcome $3k resistance level could see Ether decline towards $2,300 if the $2,850 support fails to hold again. The 4-hour RSI of 50 is currently neutral, indicating a fading bearish momentum. The MACD lines are also looking to cross into the bullish region in the near term.

Or Does He Know Something?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-big-whale-in-bitcoin-btc-traded-1-7-billion-at-these-price-levels-or-does-he-know-something/,"Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week with a recovery after falling to $80,000 last week. This rally, which has risen above $88,000, is being fueled by renewed expectations for a 25 basis point Fed rate cut in December, raising investor hopes for a bullish price. Accordingly, one blockchain investor has placed a large bet that Bitcoin's ongoing price recovery will last until the end of the year. The anonymous investor expected the $100,000 barrier to be breached again, but avoided reaching new record highs. According to Coindesk, this anonymous investor opened a $1.76 billion BTC call option targeting the $100,000-118,000 range. According to the data, this investor initiated a $1.76 billion call option containing 20,000 BTC, placing a bullish bet on continued growth to levels above $100,000 by the end of the year. The investor reportedly used a long-term call option (call condor) strategy that included four call options with the same expiration date but different expiration prices. The maturity prices were set at $100,000, $106,000, $112,000 and $118,000. Deribit wrote the following in his post: “Trader opened a 100k/106k/112k/118k call condor position with December 25 maturity. The signal is clear: there's a structural bullish view. BTC is expected to reach the $100,000-$118,000 region, not break out of it. Deribit said the investor's predictions that BTC will rise to the $100,000 to $118,000 range by the end of the year, but will not exceed the upper limit. *This is not investment advice.

According to the US-based news platform Morningstar, Strategy was rejected again for not meeting the requirements to join the S&P 500. The S&P Dow Jones Indices Committee announced that Strategy failed to meet the requirements for inclusion in the S&P 500 and its application was rejected again. The committee reported that Bitcoin volatility, which is directly reflected in company performance, is considered the biggest risk for Strategy, which holds 648,008 Bitcoins worth approximately $72.3 billion and is the world’s largest “Bitcoin treasury company.” The committee also stated in its decision that the company failed to meet the four consecutive quarters of profit requirement required for inclusion in the S&P 500. In return, Sandisk, which has risen by nearly 400% in the last three months, will be included in the index instead of Strategy. The committee’s decision thwarted the previous expectations of crypto market analysis firm 10x Research, which estimated that Strategy’s likelihood of inclusion was more than 70%. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart had also viewed the company as a possible candidate for inclusion this year. Apart from these, Robinhood, which is considered as another important candidate along with Strategy, was added to the index in September. There are currently three cryptocurrency companies included in the S&P 500: Coinbase, Block, and Robinhood. *This is not investment advice.

SEC Approves This Altcoin, Closes Case!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-grants-second-approval-sec-approves-this-altcoin-closes-case/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has taken more moderate steps for the cryptocurrency sector after Gary Gensler left and was replaced by crypto-friendly Paul Atkins, has made a more positive decision for an altcoin. Accordingly, the SEC ruled that the Solana (SOL)-based Fuse Energy token is not a security. The SEC issued its second no-action letter to cryptocurrency projects in recent months, DePIN, after sending a similar no-action letter to DoubleZero a few months earlier, providing regulatory protection for the altcoin from sanctions. The SEC sent a similar no-action letter to Solana-based DePIN project FUSE as it did to DoubleZero. Accordingly, the SEC sent a no-action letter to Fuse Energy stating that its native token, FUSE, does not constitute an investment contract under securities law. The SEC's decision to close the case without taking any action or imposing any penalties indicates that the FUSE token is not considered under federal securities laws. “Incredible news: The SEC today issued a Letter of No Action for Fuse Energy's token. It is the native utility token for The Energy Network, built on Solana. Full details can be found in the project whitepaper published today. This milestone is the culmination of months of productive work with the SEC, and Fuse is proud to play a role in ensuring regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies in the US. Momentum is building,” Fuse Energy said in a statement. At this point, the decision also stands out as a step that reduces uncertainty for cryptocurrency projects and investors. Cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett commented that this decision was based on the finding that the token's value is tied to its actual utility within the network rather than investors' expectation of profit. *This is not investment advice.

54881614,633979,1764068241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54881614.jpeg,"Franklin Templeton ETF Adds Dogecoin, XRP, Solana – Spotlight Turns to PEPENODE’s 10x Potential",https://bitcoinist.com/pepenode-to-10x-as-franklin-templeton-etf-adds-doge-sol-xrp/,"Quick Facts: Franklin Templeton’s expanded Crypto Index ETF, plus its XRPZ launch, shows institutions now want diversified, multi‑narrative crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. As majors like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin get wrapped into ETFs, volatility and potential upside increasingly migrate to smaller, narrative-driven and experimental altcoin sectors. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) introduces a mine-to-earn meme coin model that uses a gamified virtual system to earn rewards. $PEPENODE’s presale raises over $2.19M, with a current token price of $0.0011638 and the potential for a 519% ROI by the end of 2026. Franklin Templeton just signaled how fast crypto is maturing as an asset class. Its Crypto Index ETF, previously focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, is now expanding to include XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Stellar, and Chainlink, giving mainstream investors diversified exposure in a single ticker. The timing is not accidental. The expansion comes shortly after Franklin launched its spot XRP ETF, XRPZ , a move that puts $XRP on the same institutional shelf as $BTC and $ETH. You’re effectively watching the meme coin, payments, and DeFi narratives being bundled into compliant, index-style products. Dogecoin brings the culture trade, Solana and XRP represent high-throughput settlement, while Chainlink and Stellar cover infrastructure and cross-border rails. That’s a very different picture from the 2020 cycle’s $BTC-only narrative. But here’s the catch: when blue-chip assets get wrapped into indexes, they also get more efficient and, frankly, less explosive. As majors like XRP and Solana institutionalize, the hunt for higher upside rotates further out the risk curve. That’s where PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) enters the conversation as a more speculative, narrative-driven play built around mine-to-earn meme coin mechanics. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn design slots neatly into that emerging ‘engagement-first’ meta many traders are now hunting. How ETF Expansion Is Reshaping Altcoin And Meme Coin Narratives Franklin Templeton’s decision to broaden its Crypto Index ETF beyond $BTC and $ETH highlights a structural shift: institutions now want curated baskets of narratives, not just single-asset bets. Adding XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Stellar, and Chainlink effectively indexes payments, smart contracts, meme coins, and oracle infrastructure in one product. For you as a retail trader, that changes the game. Large caps like $XRP and $DOGE increasingly get treated like ‘crypto mid-caps’ inside professionally managed products. That’s exactly where experimental models like mine-to-earn, play-to-earn, and virtual node staking are competing for attention. You’ve got pure meme plays with no utility, gamified staking protocols, and crossovers trying to merge DeFi yields with casual gaming. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) sits in that third bucket, pitching itself as a mine-to-earn meme coin where users acquire virtual miner nodes instead of expensive GPUs. For traders tracking evolving narratives, this adds a distinct layer on top of what you’ll see in more traditional ETF and price-prediction coverage. Why PEPENODE’s Mine-To-Earn Model Stands Out In This Cycle If ETFs like Franklin Templeton’s are the passive front door to crypto, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is the opposite: a high-touch, engagement-driven experiment. Branded as the world’s first mine-to-earn meme coin, it replaces physical rigs and complex setups with a virtual mining system that runs entirely via smart contracts on Ethereum. The problem it’s attacking is straightforward. Traditional mining is capital-intensive, energy-heavy, and, frankly, boring for most users. You either buy hardware, lease hashpower, or give up. PEPENODE flips that script by letting you purchase and customize mining nodes, upgrade virtual facilities, and earn meme coin rewards like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN through a gamified dashboard instead of a command-line interface. That structure also changes early incentives. Early adopters receive more powerful nodes with higher reward multipliers, turning ‘being early’ into a mechanically reinforced advantage rather than just a narrative flex. And that’s without even mentioning the 589% staking rewards. The presale has already raised over $2.19M, with a current token price of $0.0011638, suggesting measurable demand for this mine-to-earn narrative. If you want in, check out our guide to buying $PEPENODE today. On-chain sentiment is starting to reflect that interest, which feeds into our price prediction for $PEPENODE for 2026 and beyond. Based on PEPENODE’s on-chain utility and mine-to-earn mechanics, we expect $PEPENODE to potentially reach $0.0072 by the end of 2026. By 2030, we could see a price point of $0.0244 if the community buys into the hype and on-chain utility. We’re talking about potential ROIs of 519% and 1,996% respectively. Built as an ERC‑20 on Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake stack, PEPENODE leans on smart contracts to handle staking, reward distribution, and governance, abstracting away most technical complexity. For users, that means you get exposure to a mine‑to‑earn economy without ever touching a watt meter, mining pool, or specialist hardware.

Prices can rise or fall by double-digit percentages in a single day, and market-moving news may arrive at any hour. Decentralized finance platforms allow users to borrow against their digital assets, but these loans often require collateral that exceeds the borrowed amount. If the value of the collateral drops, the position can be liquidated automatically, leaving the borrower with a loss. For crypto enthusiasts who hold assets long term, such volatility can make it hard to cover everyday expenses without selling tokens at the wrong time. Comparing DeFi Loans and Short-Term Personal Loans DeFi loans and traditional short-term personal loans serve different needs. A DeFi loan enables users to lock up cryptocurrency in a smart contract and receive stablecoins in return. This can be useful for tax planning or to avoid selling long-term holdings, but it comes with risks: over-collateralization means you must pledge more value than you borrow, and market swings can trigger liquidations. On the other hand, a short-term personal loan is a small cash advance based on your income rather than your crypto balance. Approval is quick because lenders look at employment and banking information instead of credit scores or asset holdings. Funds are disbursed in fiat currency, which you can use to pay rent, fix your car or cover medical bills. Short-term loans do have costs. Lenders typically charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed, and the entire balance is due on the agreed-upon date. However, because the loan amounts are modest and the terms are clear, many borrowers find the total cost manageable. For crypto investors, tapping a short-term loan for a real-world expense can be preferable to selling tokens during a downturn or risking collateral liquidation in DeFi protocols. The key is to borrow only what you need and to repay on time to avoid additional fees. Fintech Solutions in an Interconnected World The convergence of traditional finance and digital assets has spurred innovation across the lending landscape. Fintech companies leverage automation, data analytics and mobile interfaces to deliver micro-loans quickly and transparently. Applications take minutes to complete, and decisions are often instant. By examining factors such as deposit history and bill payments, these lenders can extend credit to people who might otherwise be excluded from bank loans. For consumers, this means more options for managing cash flow without dipping into volatile investments. These technology-driven lenders also emphasize clarity. Instead of variable interest rates that compound daily, many short-term lenders charge a fixed fee, so borrowers know exactly how much they will owe. Mobile apps provide reminders and account information, helping borrowers stay on top of due dates. The convenience and speed of fintech lending make it especially appealing to crypto enthusiasts, who value digital-first solutions and may need fast access to fiat currency. My Personal Dollars: A Fiat Safety Net When a crypto investor faces a sudden cash requirement, a dependable short-term lender can provide peace of mind. My Personal Dollars offers loans of up to $500 for first-time customers and up to $1,500 for returning borrowers, with no traditional credit check required. Applicants complete a brief online form, and if they qualify before the afternoon cutoff, funds are deposited the same day into their checking account. The fee structure is straightforward: $30 for every $100 borrowed, repaid in one payment on the due date. There are no hidden charges or compounding interest. This service is designed for emergencies rather than speculation. Borrowers can use the funds to cover rent, buy groceries or pay a utility bill while waiting for their next paycheck. Because the application process relies on current income and bank account status, approval is accessible to people with limited or imperfect credit histories. For crypto investors who prefer not to lock up their assets in DeFi protocols, a short term loan from My Personal Dollars can serve as a fiat safety net. Using a short term loan thoughtfully allows you to meet immediate needs without selling tokens in a down market. Strategies for Crypto Enthusiasts Borrowing should always be part of a broader financial plan. Before taking out any loan, crypto investors should consider whether they can cover the expense by reallocating part of their portfolio or by negotiating payment terms with service providers. If you decide a short-term loan is necessary, borrow the smallest amount possible and confirm that the repayment schedule aligns with your income. Use the loan exclusively for essential expenses and avoid the temptation to leverage borrowed money to buy more crypto. Remember that the goal of a short-term loan is to smooth cash flow, not to amplify risk. Monitor your crypto holdings carefully if you are also engaged in DeFi lending or trading. Over-collateralized loans can be liquidated quickly during price swings, so keeping a buffer of unencumbered assets is prudent. Diversify the assets you hold and avoid pledging your entire portfolio as collateral. By combining thoughtful investment strategies with the judicious use of transparent, short-term loans, crypto enthusiasts can navigate volatility and maintain financial flexibility.

The transaction will bring payment infrastructure companies Monavate and Baanx under the control of the crypto wallet provider. The NYSE-listed company revealed the agreement on Monday. The acquisition represents a strategic pivot toward integrated payment solutions. Exodus aims to establish itself as one of the few self-custodial wallet providers that controls the entire payment infrastructure chain. CEO JP Richardson stated the move would eliminate the gap between cryptocurrency storage and spending. The company expects to become a comprehensive financial platform for users managing digital assets. Strategic Integration of Payment Infrastructure The acquisition will grant Exodus direct access to card issuance, payment processing, and compliance capabilities. The company plans to embed these tools within its consumer and enterprise product lines. This integration will reduce dependence on external service providers. Exodus expects to expand support for additional digital assets after the deal closes. The company specifically highlighted plans to accommodate major payment stablecoins. The transaction also positions Exodus to issue cards through Visa, Mastercard, and Discover networks. The payment infrastructure will connect directly with XO Swap, the company's onchain exchange aggregator. This integration will enable programmable payouts and streamlined card issuance for users. Financing Structure and Timeline Exodus will fund the purchase through existing cash reserves and a credit facility with Galaxy Digital. The loan is secured against the company's Bitcoin treasury. The arrangement allows Exodus to maintain its cryptocurrency holdings while accessing necessary capital. The company has already provided $58.8 million in loans to W3C Corp. These funds support W3C's acquisition of Monavate and Baanx. Exodus may extend up to $10 million in additional working capital if needed. The transaction is expected to close sometime in 2026. Regulatory approvals and standard closing conditions must be satisfied before finalization. Chief Financial Officer James Gernetzke emphasized the revenue potential from the acquisition. He noted that interchange fees, processing charges, and program fees would form a core component of the company's transaction services business model.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-25 10:59:50

Signal Behind Past 60% Crashes Is Back",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-40000-signal-past-60-crashes-is-back/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how a technical analysis (TA) signal that led into major price declines in the past has returned for Bitcoin. Monthly MACD Has Turned Bearish For Bitcoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has formed in the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) for Bitcoin. MACD is a TA indicator that’s generally used for timing buys and sells in an asset’s price chart. Related Reading: USDC Floods Exchanges: Are Traders Buying The Bitcoin Crash? The indicator consists of two lines: MACD line and signal line. The first of these, the MACD line, is found by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the price from its 12-period EMA. The signal line tracks the 9-period EMA of this difference. Crossovers between the two lines can provide buy or sell signals for the asset. The MACD line breaking above the signal line could be considered a bullish signal, while the reverse type of crossover a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows how the monthly MACD has changed for Bitcoin over the last several years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MACD has registered a crossover recently. The MACD line has plunged as the asset has witnessed its bearish momentum and it’s now sitting under the signal line. As mentioned earlier, such a signal can be a bearish one. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the past instances of this pattern. It would appear that the last three sell signals from the indicator all led into declines of more than 60% for the cryptocurrency. “If that repeats, the chart points to $40,000,” noted Martinez. It now remains to be seen whether the MACD will hold for Bitcoin, or if a different trend from the past will follow this time around. The MACD line falling under its signal line isn’t the only bearish crossover that BTC has faced recently. As the analyst has pointed out in another X post, a classic death cross has also appeared between the asset’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and 200-day SMA. From the chart, it’s apparent that the 50-day SMA has declined below the 200-day SMA alongside the latest Bitcoin market downturn. During the past couple of years, each such signal has marked local bottoms for BTC, but in 2022, this crossover kicked off the bear market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Yet To Top In This Cycle? What aSOPR Suggests So far since the death cross has appeared, the asset has continued to decline, a potential sign that this death cross may be different from the recent ones. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $88,800, down over 4% in the last seven days.

The coin is currently trading around $0.0000044, offering some relief from its steady decline over the past several months. When it recovers, some of the best meme coins to buy could also benefit, including Maxi Doge and Bitcoin Hyper. Pepe ($PEPE) coin’s brutal drawdown is forcing meme traders to rethink their playbook. It has plunged to around $0.0000044, wiping out roughly 75% from this year’s peak and trading about 85% below its ATH. However, $PEPE has carved out a falling wedge , with the two trendlines now close to converging. Historically, that’s where you often see sharp relief rallies, even inside longer-term bearish structures, as sellers run out of momentum. If the coin does break higher, the next logical upside magnet sits near $0.000010. That’s still far below the highs, but it would represent a clean, tradable bounce for meme-coin speculators. More importantly, a relief rally in one of the largest meme coins tends to spill over into the broader sector, lifting risk appetite across the degen end of the market. Traders hunting for the best meme coins to buy in 2025 are already rotating into newer narratives and more structured ecosystems. In this cycle, it’s not just about jokes and dog avatars; it’s about staking yields, on-chain games, and infrastructure that can actually handle the next wave of retail FOMO. As such, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , and Dogecoin ($DOGE) are well-positioned to ride any Pepe-led meme revival. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Leverage King Culture for Meme Traders If you’re the type of trader who never skips leg day and never skips a pump, then you’ll love Maxi Doge . Branded as a 240-lb canine juggernaut, $MAXI channels the 1000x leverage mentality into a meme-first trading community, complete with holder-only competitions, leaderboards, and gym-bro humor. As a holder of its $MAXI token, you can join trading contests where returns, not raw size, determine leaderboard rankings. That structure gives you a realistic shot at outsized rewards, closing the capital gap between whales and everyday traders. Read all about the project on ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ On the tokenomics side, staking is key. A 5% allocation feeds a staking pool with dynamic APY (currently at 73%), distributed automatically via smart contract daily for up to one year. That gives you a reason to hold through volatility while still participating in trading competitions and partner events, such as futures platform integrations and gamified tournaments. The early numbers suggest the market is paying attention. The Maxi Doge presale has already raised over $4.1M, with tokens priced at $0.00027. Our Maxi Doge buying guide shows you how you can get your share of $MAXI tokens. Whales are betting on $MAXI too, with the most recent whale buy worth $59.8K happening less than a week ago. This suggests that smart money is front-running a potential rebound in the meme sector. Grab your $MAXI tokens here. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – SVM-Powered Speed on Bitcoin If you believe meme season and Bitcoin ($BTC) season can coexist, Bitcoin Hyper sits right at that intersection. It aims to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, giving $BTC the kind of high-throughput that low-latency environment traders currently associate with Solana. The pitch is straightforward: extremely low-latency Layer 2 processing on top of Bitcoin, with SVM-compatible smart contracts for DeFi, NFTs, and high-frequency trading strategies. In theory, that means execution speeds rivaling or even surpassing Solana, while still settling back to Bitcoin’s security layer through a decentralized canonical bridge for $BTC transfers. Want to learn more about $HYPER? Check out ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?’ Capital is already flooding in. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised $28.4M, with tokens priced at $0.013325, putting it among the more substantial early-stage L2 fundraises this cycle. That level of backing suggests institutions and larger crypto funds see real demand for high-performance infrastructure anchored to Bitcoin’s brand and security. Staking adds another layer of appeal. Currently at 41% APY, it gives long-term holders a way to earn while the network and ecosystem roll out. Its long-term prospects look even better. Based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , $HYPER’s value has the potential to reach a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026. Of course, a lot depends on how the team delivers, but if it does, the sky’s the limit for the project. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Meme OG With ETF-Backed Staying Power No list of the best meme coins to buy now is complete without Dogecoin. Born as a joke, $DOGE has evolved into a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency used for low-cost, fast digital payments, especially for tipping, donations, and small online purchases where card fees make little sense. Our comprehensive history of $DOGE takes you on a deep dive into the story of the market’s biggest meme coin. Dogecoin’s technical profile is simple but effective. Transaction fees are typically a fraction of a cent, making it ideal for micro-transactions, while settlement times are much faster than traditional payment networks. On top of that, $DOGE enjoys one of the most active and enduring communities in crypto, with broad merchant acceptance across online services and retailers. Institutional interest is quietly reshaping the Dogecoin narrative. Yesterday, Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust ETF launched on the NYSE Arca . This move adds another regulated gateway for traditional investors to gain exposure to $DOGE without touching spot exchanges. Despite countless copycats, Dogecoin remains a top-10 cryptocurrency by market cap. It’s also the only meme coin on that list, which underscores its staying power in a sector where most memes fade quickly. If you’re a trader rotating from $PEPE into more established names while still wanting meme exposure, $DOGE offers liquidity, recognition, and a growing suite of institutional vehicles. Buy Dogecoin on Binance. Pepe’s falling wedge hints at a relief rally that could reignite meme-coin speculation. When it does happen, Maxi Doge , Bitcoin Hyper , and Dogecoin are some of the top coins that could lead the charge. Each offers different ways to position: a high-energy trading community, a Bitcoin-anchored SVM Layer 2, and the original meme with ETF support.

Over the same period, XRP price climbed 7.05% to $2.20, outperforming the broader crypto market’s 1.97% gain. While the weekly change remains modest at just +0.6%, the short-term surge signals renewed institutional interest. XRP 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP ETF launches The upward move directly coincided with the launch of two new U.S. spot XRP ETFs, Grayscale’s GXRP and Franklin Templeton’s fund, which attracted $164 million in net inflows on their first day of trading (November 24). This marked their second-strongest day since inception, building on demand already established by Canary Capital’s XRPC ETF, which now holds $306 million in assets. The ETF-driven exposure appears to be providing liquidity support and locking up tokens in custodial assets, which could ease sell pressure over time. The XRP market cap chart shows a steep market cap acceleration beginning around midday, followed by a consolidation phase with relatively stable valuation overnight. Despite some softening toward the late trading session, XRP managed to retain most of its gains. Daily trading volume surged over 51.5% to $6.34 billion, reflecting heightened engagement across short-term traders and institutional flows. XRP 24 hour market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap From a technical perspective, momentum indicators ahead of the rally suggested a bullish setup, including a golden cross and RSI divergence, which helped fuel the initial breakout. However, the price has been met with resistance above $2.23, and the late-session cooldown may be linked to profit-taking. Notably, whale addresses offloaded 180 million XRP ($396 million) during the rally, per data cited by analyst Ali Martinez. That selling was counterbalanced by increased retail activity, reflected in a 12% rise in XRP’s social dominance. While $XRP jumped 17% in the last 72 hours, whales used the move to lock in profits, selling more than 180 million tokens. pic.twitter.com/t9aKQqTwQN — Ali (@ali_charts) November 25, 2025 The ability to sustain levels above $2.20 remains pivotal. Failure to maintain this threshold could trigger a correction, particularly given signs of MACD divergence and elevated volume-to-market-cap ratio (4.78%), often observed during euphoric top formations.

Monday’s session revealed a sharp rise in institutional engagement, hinting at shifting momentum within the broader digital-asset landscape. The market mood suggested renewed confidence in XRP’s long-term role in regulated financial products. Chad Steingraber brought this activity into focus through a detailed post on X. His update highlighted an impressive concentration of volume across four major XRP funds. The figures quickly spread across the crypto community and sparked conversations about liquidity, institutional demand, and market direction. Monday Close Bitwise XRP – 1,452,944 / $36,599,659 Franklin XRPZ – 965,203 / $23,666,777 Canary XRPC – 783,825 / $18,772,608 Grayscale GXRP – 152,566 / $6,717,480 Total – $85,756,524 For 1 Day / 4 Funds https://t.co/207aSkgUax — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 24, 2025 Rising Interest in XRP ETFs The recent introduction of multiple XRP spot ETFs has created a new channel for capital inflow. Investors who previously avoided crypto exchanges now have regulated instruments for exposure. This shift has strengthened market depth and broadened XRP’s appeal. Monday’s results mirrored this shifting trend, showing broader participation. Detailed Breakdown of Monday’s Figures Bitwise dominated the session with 1,452,944 shares traded , valued at $36,599,659. Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ followed with 965,203 shares, worth $23,666,777. Canary Capital’s XRPC recorded 783,825 shares, which totaled $18,772,608. Grayscale’s GXRP contributed 152,566 shares, translating to $6,717,480 in value. Collectively, these four funds generated $ 85.7 million in a single trading day. Why the Performance Matters Such concentrated activity reveals a rising preference for institutional-grade XRP exposure. The inflows also indicate that liquidity providers are meeting strong market demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This dynamic can help maintain stable prices and alleviate supply pressure when trading volumes surge. The market often reacts strongly when ETFs demonstrate sustained activity. Market Implications Although the momentum is promising, short-term movements can still shift rapidly. Traders continue to watch regulatory developments and macro sentiment. Yet, the steady growth of XRP ETF participation signals a maturing investment environment. If these flows remain stable, XRP could benefit from deeper liquidity and broader institutional trust. Monday’s combined performance of more than $85 million across four XRP funds drew significant attention for good reason. The figures shared by Chad Steingraber highlighted strong institutional engagement at a pivotal time for the asset. Whether this trend strengthens or normalizes will shape XRP’s path in the coming months. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

They work best when you treat them as support rather than a shortcut. A small boost at the start can make your sessions feel more relaxed and less rushed, especially when you are still figuring out what you enjoy. One easy way to stretch your promotions is to use them when you are trying out something new. A small bonus gives you room to explore without feeling rushed, the same way you might sample a new show before deciding if you want to commit. Gambling analyst Jovan Milenkovic notes that many players warm to online casino craps once they see how quick the rounds are and how straightforward the basic bets feel after a little practice. Most sites keep the stakes low and the layouts clear, which helps both new and experienced players ease in at their own pace. It is a simple example of how a promotion can help you settle into a game naturally before using more of your own balance. Promotions also help when you think of them the way you would think of a store voucher. It will not cover everything, but it lets you try a bit more than usual without affecting your budget. Just like a voucher gives you room to add something extra to your cart without the guilt, a promotion gives you that financial cushion to explore opportunities you’d normally pass on. A matched deposit or a batch of free spins can carry you through extra rounds, giving you space to understand the rhythm of a game before you make any real decisions. This is especially useful with modern slots, since many only reveal their full personality once you have played through a handful of bonus features or multipliers. That extra room from a bonus helps you see how the game behaves across different moments, much like taking a longer test drive before committing to a car. Short-term offers can also make a difference. These work a lot like limited-time sales . They appear around holidays or major events and usually come with softer playthrough rules or more generous spin totals. If you time them well, you can stretch your bankroll without making a larger deposit. It is similar to grabbing a travel deal when the price dips for a weekend. You get more value just because you arrived at the right moment. Spacing out your sessions can extend your play time even further. When you break your play into smaller windows, you avoid blowing through your balance on a single streak. Many people do the same thing with mobile data or gym sessions. A little here and there lasts longer than trying to squeeze everything into one day. Taking small pauses also gives you the chance to spot new offers that may drop during the week, helping you slot them into your plan without effort. In the end, casino promotions work best when you use them as gentle support. They help you play for longer, try new games with less pressure, and get more value from the money you were already planning to spend. A steady pace and a bit of awareness go a long way, and over time those small decisions make your sessions far more enjoyable. If you use your bonuses with care, they can turn short bursts of play into something that lasts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Crypto treasury stocks have seen their market caps compress relative to holdings, even as major players keep accumulating $BTC and $ETH. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn model turns virtual mining rigs and meme rewards into a high-engagement alternative to passive presale tokens. For degen-level risk-takers, $PEPENODE combines early-stage staking yield and meme exposure into one speculative ecosystem play. Ethereum treasuries are back in the spotlight. BitMine Immersion Technology just snapped up another 69,822 $ETH in a single week, lifting its stash to 3.63M $ETH (roughly 3% of the entire circulating supply), and boosting combined crypto and cash holdings to $11.2B. The timing is spicy. $ETH has dropped close to 30% over the past month, dragging the value of BitMine’s treasury down from over $12B to near $10–11B before the latest rebound. Yet BitMine keeps buying, effectively doubling down on an ‘own the network’ thesis while its stock trades under pressure like other crypto-treasury plays. It’s the same tension playing out in Bitcoin land. Large $BTC treasuries have seen their market caps slump relative to the value of the coins they hold. And yet, while some $BTC has bled off, the drumbeat of acquisitions continues. This ongoing trend generates a weird split: corporate balance sheets hoarding blue-chip crypto, public equity multiples compressing, and retail investors left wondering whether to buy the coins, the stocks, or something else entirely. That’s where high-yield narratives like PEPENODE start to look interesting, particularly for meme coin hunting retail traders. Instead of owning a listed treasury at a discount, you effectively buy into a mine-to-earn meme ecosystem with direct token exposure, aggressive staking yields, and gamified virtual mining mechanics. PEPENODE Turns Virtual Mining Into Meme-Driven Yield PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is built as a mine-to-earn meme coin on Ethereum, but it doesn’t ask anyone to plug in an ASIC. Instead, the project unveils a fully virtual mining simulator where holders use $PEPENODE tokens to buy miner nodes and upgrade digital facilities. Here, you’re building out customizable server rooms that generate simulated hashpower and rewards inside a web app dashboard. The idea is simple but clever; virtual mining rewards put in a meme coin wrapper and accessible from any basic Ethereum wallet. No rigs, no cooling fans, no angry landlord. PEPENODE also leans into the meme economy. The roadmap includes rewards not only in $PEPENODE itself but also in some of the best meme coins like $PEPE and other community favorites. These rewards will go to the top leaderboard players once the full game is live. That turns the platform into a kind of meta-meme mining arcade: you’re using one frog coin to farm a whole basket of others. On top of the gameplay, the presale already offers staking, not at a whopping 589% rewards for early participants, with emissions distributed over two years. It fits the project’s pitch: reward early backers aggressively while the mine-to-earn ecosystem spins up. For anyone watching BitMine push toward a validator-heavy future with its planned US-based staking network, PEPENODE feels like the retail, gamified interpretation of the same meta, just with memes, frogs, and a leaderboard instead of a Nasdaq ticker. Check PEPENODE’s official website for more. $PEPENODE Presale Maps Out 2025–2026 Upside While treasuries like BitMine and the big Bitcoin holders wrestle with stock prices that occasionally drift below the value of their underlying crypto, $PEPENODE is still in pure token-issuance mode. The presale has already crossed $2.19M raised at a live token price of $0.0011638, with staged pricing designed to ratchet higher as each funding milestone is hit. That puts new buyers roughly in line with recent analyst models. Our $PEPENODE token forecast sees a potential high of $0.0077 for 2026 if the mine-to-earn game launches on schedule, exchange listings land, and crypto sentiment stays constructive. From today’s presale price, that implies a theoretical upside of roughly ~560% into 2026 under optimistic conditions. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE to join now. Instead of paying a premium or small discount for a listed treasury stock, whose upside is tied to multiples and macro flows, you’re taking on a high-risk, high-reward crypto with high-APR staking, decent upside potential, and optional exposure to multiple meme assets via the virtual mining rewards. Instead of just parking tokens and waiting for TGE, early buyers can stake immediately, then later deploy those same tokens into nodes and upgrades once Phase 3 of the roadmap kicks in. The result is a presale that behaves less like a static raise and more like a soft launch of the game economy. In a market where big treasuries are under valuation pressure but still hoarding $BTC and $ETH on conviction, that kind of asymmetric, gameplay-driven upside is exactly what many retail traders are hunting for on the risk curve. Explore the PEPENODE presale while early. This is not financial advice. Crypto and presale investments are highly volatile; never risk capital you cannot afford to lose.

The new program will provide young companies with early access to powerful models, cloud support, and in-depth technical assistance from both teams, enabling them to build robust AI products from the outset. Google and Accel make a plan to fund new AI teams in India Google and Accel have launched a significant program to support new AI startups in India in building high-quality products from the outset. This is the first time Google has collaborated with another company in a global program like this under its AI Futures Fund, and it demonstrates the company’s commitment to supporting young founders in India and beyond. The program will target the citizens of India and Indian-origin founders worldwide who build AI products for their country and others. Both companies claim the program is long-term because they believe India has highly skilled individuals and a substantial market for new tech companies. Google and Accel will provide each startup with up to $2 million, with no limit on the number of startups they can support. However, they will start with at least 10 companies that demonstrate significant potential in AI for coding and software, content creation, and digital experiences. Each startup will also receive up to $350,000 in cloud and computing credits, as well as early access to Google’s powerful AI models, including Gemini and DeepMind. The program will also connect founders with engineers, researchers, and business experts at Google and Accel to help them find answers to challenging questions, learn how to design more effective AI systems, and plan their businesses for rapid growth. Both Google and Accel will own shares in the startups they fund, but they haven’t specified exactly how much, as their primary goal is to help the companies grow, not control them. India is one of the most significant internet markets in the world, and a suitable location for AI companies to test and expand their products , given the country’s nearly one billion online population. Google is also investing $15 billion to build a new AI data center in Andhra Pradesh, and the company’s AI Futures Fund has already supported more than 30 companies, including startups like Toonsutra, which creates webtoon content. At the same time, Accel has its Atoms program, which has been running in India for four years and has backed 40 companies that later raised over $300 million in additional funding. Experts even say the AI market in India can grow to $17 billion by 2027, and the total spending on AI worldwide can go over $2 trillion by 2026. New Cohort connects founders with top engineers and AI researchers The new program will connect startups with engineers, researchers, product managers, and go-to-market specialists from both Google and Accel. They will also have monthly meetings with Accel partners and receive one-on-one support from both companies to address questions, resolve problems, and make informed decisions. Startups will collaborate with Google Labs and DeepMind research groups to explore new ideas and test their products using some of the world’s most advanced AI systems. The Atoms AI Cohort 2026 runs for three months, and the application will utilize Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model to help founders complete forms and share information quickly, allowing them to focus on building their products. Applications will be open until January 26, 2026. Startups that applied between September and November 2025 don’t need to reapply, as the system will automatically consider them.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word According to crypto commentator Anthony Pompliano, drops of 30% or more are part of Bitcoin’s history — they have happened 21 times over the last decade and tend to occur about once every one and a half years. Reports have disclosed that recent selling has pushed the token to lows around $82,000 during US trading. “So Bitcoiners are used to this,” Pompliano said. “Now, who’s not used to this are the people who are coming from Wall Street. They’re not used to this type of volatility.” Veterans Expect The Swings Pompliano said people who have owned Bitcoin for years treat big swings as normal. He argued that volatility helped create the huge gains seen so far: Bitcoin has risen about 240x over the past decade. He added that a 70% compound annual growth rate over that period is not likely to continue, but that even lower long-term returns — in the 20–35% range — would still beat stocks. “I would be worried if Bitcoin’s volatility drops to zero,” he said, explaining why price swings can be a sign of an active market rather than a flaw. US Markets And Liquidity Strains Played A Role Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said the sell-off was mainly a US-session event. He linked the fall to tighter US liquidity and wider credit spreads, which made traders less willing to hold risky positions. Sigel also noted that big spending plans tied to artificial intelligence were colliding with a fragile funding market, creating extra pressure. Around year-end, other market participants face bonus decisions and portfolio reviews, which may add to selling pressure. Volatility Is Climbing Again Analysts at Bitwise and other firms reported that Bitcoin’s volatility has risen in the past two months and was creeping back up to about 60 as of Monday. Jeff Park of Bitwise pointed out that higher volatility can move prices sharply in either direction. Based on reports, Pompliano and others said that volatility is needed for the asset to make large gains over time, and that calm markets would actually be a warning sign for some investors. ETFs Brought More Money — And More Flows Out The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs has made it easier for big brokers’ clients to get exposure without holding coins directly. Still, data from Morningstar’s Bryan Armour shows roughly $4.7 billion left crypto-related ETFs in November. Armour added that while some funds saw outflows, ETFs tied to smaller tokens such as Solana and XRP drew investments during the same period.

Several major organizations are persistently adding the altcoin to their payment method. FinTech Notes Adds XRP To Official Glossary XRP continues to cement its position in the broader cryptocurrency and financial landscape. In a notable step toward broader institutional recognition, IMF FinTech Notes has officially added the leading altcoin to its global financial glossary, which signals increased interest and acceptance of the digital asset within mainstream finance. XRP’s inclusion highlights its importance in international payments, regulatory debates, and cross-border settlement innovation by placing it alongside significant financial products and cutting-edge technologies. As seen in the Glossary list, the altcoin is now being listed alongside global payment terms such as Central bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) , Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). According to Crypto Dyl News, this is a significant achievement as it shows the token is being recognized as a legitimate cross-border settlement asset. With this milestone, the altcoin is now included in the same framework as central banks and global institutions. The move is a clear indication that the IMF is openly acknowledging Ripple ’s growing role in global payments, pointing to more institutional adoption ahead. “This isn’t hype, it’s in their own glossary,” Crypto Dyl News added. A Foundational Building Block For The Digital Economy Amid its growing interest and acceptance in mainstream finance, Franklin Templeton has hailed XRP as a foundational building block for the digital economy. The statement from the leading asset manager, which suggests a shift in institutional sentiment toward the Ripple-backed asset, has sent ripples throughout the crypto and financial landscape. Roger Bayston, the head of digital assets at the firm, stated that fast-growing businesses are being propelled by blockchain innovation. In such an environment, digital asset tokens, such as XRP, function as powerful incentive mechanisms that support the development of decentralized networks and align the interests of stakeholders. Franklin Templeton’s view is likely one of the key drivers behind the launch of its XRPZ Spot ETF , which provides regulated custody, daily transparency, and liquidity without the operational complexity of directly holding the altcoin. These kind of endorsements from large corporate firms portrays the token as essential infrastructure for the upcoming era of digital banking, rather than just another cryptocurrency. Since the inception of the XRP Spot ETFs , demand for the altcoin is growing globally. John Squire, an investor and crypto influencer, shared an interesting report that proves Asia is becoming a battleground for crypto dominance, and the token is leading the charge. In a notable takeover, XRP has officially overthrown Bitcoin and seized the top spot on Upbit, the biggest exchange in South Korea. This flip underscores Asia’s renewed interest in the altcoin and its long-term utility.",XRP|AML/CFT|Anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism|Bank for International Settlements|BIS|bitcoin|CBDCs|Central Bank Digital Currencies|Circle’s USD Coin|Crypto Dyl News|Franklin Templeton|IMF FinTech|John Squire|Real-Time Gross Settlement|ripple|ripple news|Roger Bayston|RTGS|Upbit|USDC|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Spot ETFs|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|XRPZ Spot ETF,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-25 14:00:25

Yet digital assets evolve through rapid adoption cycles that often distort linear tools. This tension has sparked a new debate around XRP, especially as analysts observe structural changes on long-term charts. A recent post by Egrag Crypto has drawn significant attention because it challenges long-held assumptions while presenting a renewed case for exponential price behavior. Why Traditional Moving Averages Create False Signals Simple moving averages worked well in low-volatility markets. They smooth historical data and reveal broad trend direction. However, that smoothing introduces heavy lag during strong expansion phases. Lag becomes a serious issue when an asset grows through nonlinear adoption. XRP and Bitcoin both follow growth curves that accelerate as networks expand. A slow tool cannot react fast enough to model that pace. This limitation explains why Bitcoin easily broke below the “never under the 200-MA” myth during the previous cycle. #XRP – Exponential Assets Don’t Obey Moving Averages: Here’s the truth: The 50-MA theory being pushed by Benjamin Cowen @intocryptoverse has misled a huge part of this space. His model simply does not apply to exponential assets, and it has zero mathematical relevance when… pic.twitter.com/DRF6Ad4eAF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 25, 2025 Exponential Assets Behave Differently Egrag Crypto argues that XRP behaves like an exponential asset, not a linear one. Exponential assets grow through network effects, compounding users, and expanding liquidity. Their market structures do not respect moving averages built on fixed intervals. Time alone shifts these averages, even when adoption accelerates. This mismatch creates misleading signals and false interpretations. Egrag stresses that this issue is mathematical, not emotional. Why Exponential Tools Fit XRP Better Analysts must use tools that reflect reality rather than tradition. Exponential regression models track price behavior more accurately during long expansions. Logarithmic growth channels map high-timeframe cycles without distortion. Macro wave structures help identify strong expansion phases that follow accumulation periods. Liquidity and cycle extension models reveal when supply shocks or onboarding events trigger explosive moves. These tools align with the way XRP historically expands through multi-year structures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Egrag Crypto’s Updated Chart Structure Egrag Crypto’s chart highlights the “Genuine Wake-Up Line,” which XRP recently broke through. The breakout suggests a shift from compression into expansion. The chart marks key levels around $0.60 and $1.50, which align with historical reaction zones. Egrag also displays a projected “Critical Target Level” near the $7 region. The structure builds on his long-term calls that once targeted $7, $10, $20, and even $27 . The disbelief surrounding such targets remains strong, yet the chart still supports exponential expansion if the breakout holds. Market Context Strengthens the Argument The XRP ecosystem has experienced meaningful technical and structural changes. Liquidity conditions have improved since legal clarity emerged in 2023. Market behavior shifted again after speculative activity increased in 2024 and 2025. These shifts strengthen the need for advanced tools rather than slow-moving averages. XRP’s current pattern resembles earlier accumulation phases that preceded strong rallies. Traders Must Evolve With the Market Indicators must fit the market they measure. Linear tools struggle with nonlinear growth. Egrag Crypto’s analysis argues for a modern approach that reflects XRP’s exponential nature. Traders who adapt will gain clearer insight into long-term market structure. Those who rely on outdated tools may continue to misread crucial signals.

The chain’s team claimed the lead investor did not have a true option to back out of investing in BERA up to a year post its token launch. Berachain’s co-founder, pseudonymously known as Smokey the Bera, denied rumors that one of the lead investors was offered a backout option for up to a year after the launch of BERA. Smokey explained that the provision of the Nova investment vehicle was actually a protection in the case that Berachain never reached the TGE stage. The general conditions of the funding round were outlined in a term sheet, containing the parameters of the deal between Berachain and the Nova fund. “Nova’s compliance team required a provision to guard for a scenario in which Berachain failed to TGE and get listed, and thus the LOCKED BERA purchased in the financing would not be an eligible investment via Nova’s liquid strategy,” explained Smokey on X. Berachain was one of the protocols to delay its mainnet and token for years, while also creating a strong community with a sense of expectation. In total, Berachain raised $142M in a multitude of rounds, led by Polychain Capital and some of the most prominent investment angels in crypto space. Berachain offered a $25M refund According to recent investigations, Nova, backed by Brevan Howard Digital, worked in a clause that would protect the fund from exposure to the Berachain token for up to a year. Nova participated in a Series B round, providing $25M to Berachain. An additional side letter to the deal contained the refund conditions. For now, there are no signs of potential claims, despite the slide in BERA market prices. Berachain offered a refund option for the Nova Fund, outlined in a side letter. The option was valid until February 6, 2025. | Source: Berachain The refund period extends until February 6, 2026, exactly a year following the Berachain TGE. According to the Berachain team, there is no danger that Nova, or Brevan Howard Digital, would ask for a refund. BERA trades near all-time lows BERA tokens traded at $1.02, after briefly dipping below $1. BERA is down over 87% since its launch in February. The token is represented on Binance and other major centralized exchanges. After the initial hype locked in over $2.5B on Berachain, liquidity quickly flowed out . The network had limited DeFi apps, despite the initial ambitions of becoming a major hub for Web3 activity. As a result, total value locked sank to new lows of only around $250M , a loss of 90% of available liquidity. The Berachain ecosystem is separate from other networks, though it was connected to other ecosystems. During the initial hype, $5B in liquidity flowed into Berachain, but around $4.9B returned to Ethereum. In the past three months, $144.5M in liquidity flowed out of the chain. Despite the large-scale funding, Berachain serves around 21.9K daily active users. Critics noted Berachain did not show the expected signs of activity and was mostly abandoned by both developers and users. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

It currently trades at just north of $0.40, representing a 52% decline on a 90-day scale. However, some optimists believe a resurgence could be on the horizon. We asked four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots if they support that thesis and whether a rally beyond $1 before the end of 2025 is possible. Not a High Probability ChatGPT stated that ADA can finish the year above that level, adding that the odds are moderate rather than high. It noted that investors have not been particularly intrigued by the asset lately, and some have sold their holdings instead of entering the ecosystem. The recent whale sell-off supports that assumption. As CryptoPotato reported , large investors offloaded around 440 million ADA tokens in the span of just one month. At the same time, ChatGPT suggested that the remaining weeks of 2025 could mark a major rebound in the broader cryptocurrency market, which could benefit Cardano’s token. The chatbot estimated that the chance of ADA to touch $1 at least once before New Year’s Eve is 60-65%. Grok, the chatbot built into the social media platform X, claimed such a rise will only be possible in “a strong bull market scenario.” According to its estimate, key catalysts could include protocol upgrades and ETF decisions that may spark an upward move. The chatbot is much more bullish for next year, saying: “If ADA stabilizes support in December, 2026 could see $1.50-$3 amid Voltaire governance rollout and Hydra scaling.” Perplexity shared a similar opinion to Grok. It stated that an ascent above $1 could only happen in the event of major network upgrades, increased adoption, and favorable market sentiment. “Without such strong drivers, it is more likely to stay under or hover close to $1 toward year-end,” it added. The Bearish Outlook Google’s Gemini made the most pessimistic prediction. It suggested that the cryptocurrency market is in a bearish condition, adding that global economic uncertainty may further suppress the sector in the short term. The chatbot described ADA as a highly speculative asset with a high correlation to macro trends, forecasting that it has little chance of pumping above $1 sometime this year. On the other hand, it assumed that a spike above the resistance level of $0.60 could reignite such hopes.

In a post, Sapijiju called the allegation “complete misinformation,” while stating that “$0 has been cashed out.” The exec denied any involvement in the transactions Lookonchain linked to crypto exchange Kraken and stablecoin issuer Circle. USDC Transfers Spark Drama According to Sapijiju, the movements flagged in the earlier tweet were related to Pump.fun’s internal treasury management, specifically the redistribution of USDC raised from the PUMP token ICO into different wallets so the company’s runway can be reinvested into the business. They further added that Pump.fun has never directly worked with Circle. The original claims by Lookonchain stated that since October 15, Pump.fun had deposited 436.5 million USDC into Kraken, while 537.6 million USDC reportedly moved from Kraken to Circle through a wallet identified as DTQK7G during the same period. Additionally, Lookonchain reported that between May 19, 2024, and August 12, 2025, Pump.fun had sold 4.19 million SOL worth $757 million at an average price of $181, with 264,373 SOL allegedly dumped on-chain for $41.64 million, and 3.93 million SOL worth $715.5 million deposited into Kraken. Sapijiju’s clarification received mixed reactions. Some pointed out a contradiction: the team denied involvement in Kraken and Circle transactions but admitted that USDC moves were part of treasury management from the PUMP ICO. Others were relieved to see that the team is still active and engaging with the community. Many noted that treasury management is often mistaken for cash-outs. But critics still questioned the team’s strategy, and even called their airdrop explanation weak and warned that PUMP could collapse. Some urged proof that the USDC reserves fully back the circulating supply. Controversies Pump.fun’s ICO in July for the native PUMP token was also controversial. The Solana-based meme coin launchpad raised $500 million in just 12 minutes, after selling 12.5% of the total supply at $0.004 per token in a public offering. Initially, 33% of PUMP was allocated for the ICO, with 18% reserved for institutional buyers and 15% for the public sale, but only 12.5% was actually sold publicly. Just days before the ICO, crypto exchange Gate.io suddenly canceled PUMP’s pre-market listing and refunded all presale participants. The exchange later explained that the decision was made following discussions with the Pump.fun team. Last year, the platform temporarily paused its livestream feature after it was exploited for disturbing acts, including threats of self-harm and violence linked to token performance. Rapid growth, with livestream activity increasing over 100 times in a week, overwhelmed moderation systems. To address this, Pump.fun expanded its moderation team and improved automated and human oversight.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.865214. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.41 with an average trading price of $1.35. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 1.32% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.145 level. As of November 25, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a downward trend. The memecoin’s price decreased to $0.149 today, representing a significant 1.32% loss since it closed at the $0.151 level yesterday. This downtrend indicates a comparatively negative market sentiment, as the memecoin is shedding again; however, the coin may find support around the $0.145 zone as it continues to fall toward that level. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day chart for Dogecoin indicates a bearish trend with selling pressure, as sellers are currently dominating the market.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 39.76 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative as of now. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour chart for Dogecoin also shows a slight uptrend with bulls leading the market during the last four hours. Selling pressure remains present above the SMA, which is evident from a few red candlesticks, but bulls are striving for the lead. The DOGE/USD pair is facing decreasing volatility as it approaches the $0.149 level on an hourly basis. This decreased volatility signals less volatile price movements in the coming hours.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding current market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.149 in the past 24 hours. If sellers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and retest the $0.145 support. Conversely, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may spike toward the $0.151 resistance in the current trading session. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.396556–$0.504708 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.149 over the last 24 hours as sellers tried to maintain resistance around $0.151 and succeeded. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.270379 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2029. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,780 DOGE in November; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.41 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down.

The company is developing it in collaboration with the blockchain investment firm Hashed. The wallet is dubbed “Silk Pocket.” In addition to Naver Financial and Hashed, the Busan digital exchange has also contributed to its development. It is specially made for Busan citizens. According to reports, it has completed the first version of development and is undergoing final verification for its launch next month. The KRW-stablecoin exchange feature is set to go international The project commenced development in May. Hashed will provide technical support in collaboration with the Busan digital asset exchange. On the other hand, Naver Financial, which possesses the payment infrastructure, will be responsible for wallet activation. The KRW-stablecoin wallet is expected to be popular among international tourists. It will enable them to easily convert their local currency into KRW-pegged stablecoins for payment simply by depositing it into their wallets. This will eliminate the need for separate currency exchange procedures or fees. Once stablecoins are legally recognized, these institutions also plan to integrate Silk Pocket with a feature that allows users to exchange local fiat currencies for “Dongbaekjeon instantly.” Dongbaekjeon is an existing regional currency payment system, currently operating like a credit card that offers cashback benefits to residents. The Busan city government launched the original program to protect and revitalize local commerce and economy by promoting spending. BNK Busan Bank, which issues Dongbaekjeon, has already begun researching how to convert Dongbaekjeon from a prepaid card or points system into a stablecoin. Dongbaekjeon already boasts 1.5 million monthly active users (MAU) in the Naver Pay stablecoin payment ecosystem. Naver Financial stated, “We are also planning integration with our existing digital asset wallet, ‘Naver Pay Wallet.'” More details of the service are expected to be revealed at “Blockchain Week in Busan (BWB) 2025,” which will be held in Busan on February 22, 2025. Hashed CEO Kim Seo-jun will be presenting at the event, while Naver Financial CEO Park Sang-jin is considering attending.

As reported by Cryptopolitan, the merger between the two companies is expected to proceed through a comprehensive stock exchange method. Dunamu shareholders will exchange their shares for new Naver Financial shares, with the merger exchange ratio favoring 1 to 3. Once the acquisition is finalized, Song Chi-hyung, chairman of Dunamu, will become the largest shareholder by securing about 28% of the integrated corporation. Naver (70% of Naver Financial), the previous largest shareholder, will be diluted to 17%, falling to the second largest shareholder. Market participants expect the combined entity to pursue a listing on the Nasdaq exchange. This could unlock a valuation of at least $34.5 billion (50 trillion won) if its stablecoin and blockchain infrastructure attract global investor interest. Meanwhile, Naver reported a revenue of 3.14 trillion Korean won ($2.32 billion) and an operating profit of 570.6 billion won ($422.67 million) in the third quarter. On the other hand, Dunamu reported a 35% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, with 385.9 billion won ($262.87 million) in revenue for the third quarter. Meanwhile, its net profit rose 145% during the same period, reaching 239 billion won ($162.80 million).

54882311,https://coinpaper.com/12616/hedera-hbar-price-prediction,1764080695,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Hedera ($HBAR) Price Prediction 2025,https://coinpaper.com/12616/hedera-hbar-price-prediction,"Hedera trades near $0.143 and climbs from the recent $0.129 support. The market now watches the fight toward the $0.160 resistance zone. The price sits inside a structure shaped by a long-term descending trendline that started after the $0.30 peak in July 2025. Traders want to see if this new wave of adoption can change the trend. The Hedera Council just launched a global partnership program, enterprise interest grows, and ETF momentum continues to rise at a surprising pace. Hedera Council Expands Global Reach Through New Partnership Program The Hedera Council revealed a global partnership program designed to strengthen the network’s influence in enterprise and institutional markets. The initiative targets real-world adoption and deep engagement across financial, regulatory, and industrial sectors. This move signals a strong commitment to long-term expansion rather than short bursts of activity. The program seeks to accelerate integration in key markets that want regulated blockchain solutions. Hedera’s council members believe structured collaboration offers a natural path to higher trust and broader visibility. A large pool of developers supports this direction. More than 10,000 developers show active interest, and the ecosystem expects rising participation once new partnerships move into production. A major highlight includes more than $1 million in grants for builders who design high-value use cases. Hedera plans to attract teams that contribute to tokenization, CBDC pilots, payment rails, and regulatory-focused innovation. Partnerships with banks and government entities already spark discussion. Could this be the cycle where Hedera gains the real-world traction it always aimed for? Enterprise Momentum Grows With High-Profile Collaborations Past Hedera programs produced growth in enterprise tokenization and stablecoin rails. Experts from Kanalcoin predict this new program may drive even stronger adoption. Gregory Bell, Chief Business Officer at the Hedera Foundation, says the goal is simple: increase enterprise engagement and bring real-world use cases into regulated markets. That mindset aligns well with global finance trends. Projects with the Reserve Bank of Australia highlight Hedera’s appeal in CBDC research. These pilots push value beyond theory. They give the network a chance to prove its efficiency under real policy conditions. That type of proof often attracts institutional partners who want reliable infrastructure. ETF Momentum and Futures Trading Push Institutional Interest Higher HBAR continues to draw institutional attention . Coinbase Derivatives plans to launch 24/7 HBAR futures on December 5, and the news triggered a sharp spike in trading volume. The IRS now permits staking inside ETFs, which gives HBAR-based funds a clear yield advantage. Source: X The SEC also approved new listing standards that make future HBAR ETFs faster to bring to market. The numbers look strong. Fourteen total ETF filings Canary Capital holds more than 421 million HBAR Hedera’s supply cap sits at 50 billion Canary now controls about 0.84% of the entire supply Wyoming also selected Hedera for its state-backed stablecoin, and tokenized ETFs on Hedera continue to expand. These steps build a narrative that points toward deep institutional confidence. Technical Outlook: Can HBAR Break the 0.160 Barrier? HBAR fell from the $0.30 high in July and respected a descending trendline for months. The drop broke the $0.160 support and sent the price into the $0.129 zone. That level now acts as short-term support. Source: X Key levels show a clear roadmap: Support: $0.129, $0.081 Resistance: $0.160, descending trendline, $0.21, $0.30 A move above $0.160 opens the path toward $0.21. A break of the descending trendline may ignite a stronger run that targets the $0.30 zone again. If markets reject the rally, the price could slide back toward $0.129. HBAR Price Prediction Table Month (2025) Minimum Average Maximum October 2025 $0.13 $0.15 $0.18 November 2025 $0.14 $0.16 $0.20 December 2025 $0.14 $0.17 $0.23 Hedera stands at an interesting point.

According to Steingraber, the mechanism is simple yet powerful. During ETF trading hours, XRP often gains $0.10–$0.20, small moves that make XRP ETFs look strong and draw both retail and institutional interest. Prices may stabilize or dip after hours, but the cycle repeats daily, steadily building momentum. Over weeks, this consistent performance can create the conditions for a major price surge. Steingraber highlights that XRP ETFs do more than boost short-term gains, they offer regulated, transparent, and accessible exposure, lowering barriers for investors worldwide. This growing institutional and retail engagement could fast-track adoption and cement XRP as a key liquidity asset in global markets. XRP spot ETFs are now live in the U.S., with Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale leading the charge. Franklin Templeton and Grayscale stand out as major catalysts, leveraging their trusted reputations to attract significant institutional capital and cement XRP’s role in mainstream investment portfolios. As ETFs gain traction, XRP’s market dynamics are set to strengthen and stabilize. Investors may see consistent gains during trading hours, minor adjustments after hours, and a steady buildup of momentum. In the months ahead, this pattern could trigger a significant price surge, enhancing XRP’s utility and cementing its role in global digital finance. Therefore, Steingraber highlights XRP ETFs as catalysts for market expansion. With major ETFs now trading in the U.S., XRP is set for increased adoption, visibility, and potentially significant price momentum with the 4th-largest cryptocurrency having reclaimed the psychological price of $2.20. Conclusion As XRP ETFs gain momentum, they are redefining market dynamics by blending accessibility, credibility, and liquidity. Small, consistent intraday gains could quickly compound into a major price surge, cementing XRP’s role in global digital finance. For investors and institutions, XRP ETFs signal not just profit potential, but a broader shift toward mainstream adoption and lasting market influence.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-25 14:25:07

Best Wallet is a non-custodial, no-KYC, wallet with top security and access to 330 DEXs and 30 cross-chain bridges as some of its main features. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) targets 40% wallet market share by 2026, combining institutional-grade MPC security, custom portfolios, and curated presale access in one app. The $BEST presale is now at $17.4M, three days away from completion; the opportunity window is closing fast for investors. Crypto is ending 2025 on a very different note than it started. After a year of rotating narratives around restaking, modular chains, and RWA, attention is quietly shifting back to something more fundamental: where users actually hold and move their assets. Wallets are becoming the new battleground for liquidity, attention, and yield. You’re already seeing this in how fast everyday users are graduating from single-chain browser extensions to multi-chain, mobile-first stacks. With thousands of assets across dozens of networks, a wallet that only stores coins is no longer enough. Users want security-grade infrastructure, simple cross-chain swaps, and direct access to opportunities like presales and yield. At the same time, many of the incumbents look dated. Some are highly centralized with clear custody and KYC bottlenecks; others are fully non-custodial but clunky on mobile, lacking real incentives beyond basic send/receive. This gap between user expectations and what wallets deliver is opening space for aggressively product-led challengers. That’s the backdrop for Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , whose presale ends in under three days. Positioned as; The Next Gen Crypto Wallet’, Best Wallet is going after 40% of the global wallet market by the end of 2026, using a mix of institutional-grade security, presale access, and integrated DeFi tools to differentiate itself. Buy your $BEST on the official presale page today. Best Wallet Aims To Turn Your Wallet Into a Full Crypto Super-App Best Wallet is designed around a simple idea: your wallet should be the easiest and safest place to manage everything you do in Web3, not just a key manager. It delivers a mobile-first experience with intuitive UX, aiming to make multi-chain DeFi, presales, and even iGaming feel as straightforward as using a mainstream fintech app. Under the hood, Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks MPC-CMP , bringing institutional-grade multi-party computation security into a fully non-custodial, no-KYC setup. On top of that, users can build custom multi-wallet portfolios, access a curated Upcoming Tokens portal for vetted presales, and use the Best DEX aggregator powered by Rubic to route trades across 330 DEXs and 30 cross-chain bridges. Unlike many legacy wallets that stop at basic storage and swapping, Best Wallet layers in tangible benefits for $BEST holders: reduced ecosystem fees, higher APY opportunities via an integrated staking aggregator, and early access to token launches surfaced in the app. The presale has already raised over $17.4M with $BEST at $0.025995, signaling strong demand for a more feature-rich wallet layer. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. Can $BEST Become a 1000x Crypto? Presale Numbers and Long-Term Predictions If the Best Wallet ecosystem sees widespread adoption, $BEST could reach roughly $0.62 by 2026, for an ROI of 2,285% based on today’s price. This price prediction for $BEST considers factors such as ecosystem utility, community hype, and successful marketing, which could help catapult the service into the mainstream. More importantly, this is a conservative scenario based only on modest penetration relative to the project’s stated 40% market share ambition by 2026; the price could get considerably higher. Beyond price speculation, $BEST is wired directly into the app’s incentive design. There is an 8% allocation – 800 million tokens – reserved for staking rewards via a dynamic pool that pays out proportionally to each user’s share. The number is now at 75% for stakers. Based on these numbers, $BEST does look like the next 1000x crypto for 2026 and beyond. Best Wallet’s presale, ending in under three days, crystallizes a simple narrative: wallets are becoming revenue-generating platforms, not just passive interfaces. $BEST sits at the center of that ecosystem, connecting security, presales, trading, and staking into a single tokenized value layer aimed at everyday investors rather than only power users. If you believe the next cycle will reward projects solving real infrastructure pain points – mobile UX, security, cross-chain complexity, and aligned incentives – then Best Wallet Presale is one of the few plays directly targeting that stack. The presale is three days away from completion, so read our guide on how to buy $BEST while you still have time. Buy $BEST before the presale ends. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR before investing.

While the platform continues to push for EVM compatibility and lower fees, its price remains fragile and susceptible to broader market fears. As investors seek assets with clearer paths to explosive growth, many are turning to GeeFi, a multi-chain financial ecosystem that analysts believe shows serious signs of being a 100x gem. The Problem with Single-Chain Dependence Tron’s recent performance highlights the risks of investing in an ecosystem whose value is heavily tied to its stablecoin dominance and a single blockchain. While its low transaction fees are an advantage, the token’s price is still vulnerable to technical breakdowns, regulatory concerns around USDT, and shifts in developer interest. Relying on one network means your investment is exposed to its specific set of challenges. GeeFi solves this by offering a diversified, chain-agnostic platform that prioritizes real-world utility over singular blockchain metrics. Its live and operational GeeFi Wallet already supports over 14 different blockchains , including Tron. This allows users to build a resilient and diversified portfolio from a single secure application, shielding them from the isolated risks and volatility associated with any individual network. The GeeFi Presale: A Ground-Floor Opportunity While Tron traders watch for bearish continuation signals, the GeeFi presale is generating significant attention and delivering tangible results. The project has already raised over $300,000 and sold more than 6.1 million GEE tokens , signaling strong market confidence. With Phase 1 over 50% complete , the chance to acquire GEE tokens at the introductory price of $0.05 is rapidly closing. The price is set to increase in the next stage, maximizing the potential returns for early investors. An Ecosystem for the Real World GeeFi is building a complete financial hub that bridges the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. Unlike projects focused solely on on-chain metrics, GeeFi delivers immediate value with its live wallet. The platform’s roadmap includes the GeeFi HUB and GeeFi DEX , which will offer users access to advanced trading tools and direct cross-chain swaps without ever leaving the application. This simplifies decentralized finance and enhances user security. The most anticipated feature is the GeeFi Crypto Card . Through partnerships with payment giants VISA and Mastercard , the card will let users spend their digital assets at millions of merchants worldwide. This functionality turns a crypto portfolio into a practical source of funds for daily expenses and includes cashback rewards, providing a level of utility that is still rare in the crypto space. Tokenomics Designed for Explosive Growth The GeeFi Token (GEE) is built with a deflationary model to support long-term value. This strong foundation has led many analysts to call GEE the next $1 project . GeeFi further incentivizes holding through a competitive staking program, offering APYs of up to 55% for users who lock their tokens for 12 months. This not only generates passive income for holders but also reduces the token’s circulating supply. A 5% referral bonus also helps to expand the community. With a live product, a successful presale, and a vision for practical application, GeeFi shows all the signs of being the next 100x gem in the crypto market.

While retail investors chase short-term market trends, smart money is flowing into Digitap ($TAP) due to its massive banking utility. Digitap is experiencing massive crypto presale demand because it is building an omni-bank ecosystem—something that Bitcoin never attempted. Although Bitcoin was developed to offer users financial freedom, it has not enjoyed massive utility in the real world. Digitap, on the other hand, has built a platform that integrates real banking infrastructure with crypto utility, making digital assets spendable in daily transactions. At a time when Bitcoin’s volatility is rising, large investors are buying into $TAP due to its guaranteed growth in its presale. Furthermore, its utility at an early stage makes it one of the best altcoins to buy this November. BTC Drops Toward $80K, $TAP Becomes the Smart-Money Pick Bitcoin’s drop from October 2025 highs above $120,000 to the low $80,000s caused a huge shift in investor sentiment. The flagship crypto dipped to seven-month lows near $80,553 amid risk-off flows, large-scale liquidations, and macro concerns linking crypto to the broader tech market plunge. Experts noted this drop, with some suggesting that BTC could break below the $80,000 structural support zone before December. A drop below this level could cause a deeper correction. With Bitcoin’s upside momentum fading and leverage still high, its narrative of being the only safe crypto bet is no longer convincing. BTC faces diminishing return potential, and its role is increasingly shifting toward a store of value, not a growth vehicle. Thus, BTC is not appealing to investors who want up to 100x ROI. $TAP’s crypto presale is attracting smart investors because it offers a massive growth potential opportunity. Bitcoin Tops Out as Smart Money Rotates Into Digitap As Bitcoin tops out, capital is getting reallocated into early‐stage projects offering higher leverage and stronger utility. Previously, BTC’s dominance was strong, but now it has become a drag on growth. When investors need to escape topping assets, presale opportunities become the focus. Digitap stands at the center of payments, banking, and crypto, a blend rarely achieved by projects in their early stages. While other coins rely on vague concepts and promises, Digitap is building an entire financial ecosystem with significant integrations. The omni-bank ecosystem offers something Bitcoin cannot replicate without extensive development and regulatory negotiation: full banking interoperability. Investors prefer the upside of Web3 enhanced with banking-grade foundations. This explains why smart money is moving aggressively into $TAP. Utility is the next trend that will determine the future of the crypto market. Digitap outpaces Bitcoin because it makes crypto spendable. With this cycle leaning toward real-world spending power, $TAP ranks as the best crypto to buy for huge growth as the market slides. Digitap’s Omni-Bank Outshines Bitcoin’s Missed Vision Digitap is building an omni-bank ecosystem where users can store fiat and crypto assets and transfer money across borders instantly. It also enables users to spend digital assets at merchant terminals and transact using mainstream financial rails. That is the infrastructure Bitcoin flirted with but never delivered. This full-stack ecosystem merges blockchain with a banking-grade network. Notably, Digitap enables global spending through cards linked to crypto and powers smooth cross-border transfers without legacy banking delays. Imagine using crypto balances to complete daily transactions instantly; that is Digitap’s vision. Most crypto projects overpromise but under-deliver. For over a decade, they have promised to make crypto spendable but never delivered at scale. Digitap changes everything with its Visa integration. With mainstream adoption of payments expected to shape the future of crypto, $TAP’s ecosystem is perfectly positioned for mass usage. This explains why investors are buying into the project’s crypto presale aggressively, expecting it to explode in the coming months. Visa Partnership Makes $TAP a Spendable Crypto Asset One of Digitap’s biggest catalysts is its integration with Visa. This collaboration makes crypto usable in the real world. Instead of relying only on exchange listings and token hype, Digitap enables everyday spending, making crypto work like cash in the physical world. While other presales promise future partnerships, Digitap has integrated with Visa, enabling users to access more than 80 million merchant locations globally. This development makes $TAP a network token fueling actual commerce. Hence, the partnership has created real demand, helping its presale to fly off the shelf as smart money flows in rapidly. The growing demand and massive banking utility make $TAP one of the best cryptos to buy now. $TAP Outpaces BTC as Utility Beats Maturity Bitcoin, as a trillion-dollar asset, needs institutional tsunami-scale flows to record 2× or 3× gains. On the other hand, Digitap can scale faster with smaller inflows if it commands payment market traction. Utility delivers recurring value while speculation does not. Bitcoin’s narrative is mature, and its story has already been told. Digitap invites a new narrative where traditional finance is restructured, global payments reimagined, and consumers empowered. These types of developments translate into massive growth when adoption picks up. Additionally, presale utility tokens previously delivered greater upside than large-cap assets in previous cycles. Digitap aligns with this pattern, making it a good crypto to buy now. $TAP’s 76% Crypto Presale Discount Fuels Investor Inflows Investors are not just testing Digitap; they are backing its massive utility. The project surpassed $2 million in early funding more quickly than most crypto presales this year. Growth is still accelerating while Bitcoin’s chart shows exhaustion. Despite being at an early stage, Digitap combines product readiness, institutional partnerships, and real utility. These factors justify why experts believe $TAP is the most undervalued asset in the industry. It offers real technology, strong early adoption, and makes crypto spendable in the real world. Currently available at $0.0326, $TAP’s entry price and growth potential explain its increased demand as the market slides. Over 132 million $TAP tokens have been purchased, raising more than $2.1 million. The price will rise to $0.0334 in the next stage. The current value is a 76.71% discount from the launch price of $0.14. Digitap Rises in the Shadows of Bitcoin’s November Pullback With Bitcoin under growing pressure and macro risks rising, capital entry conditions have improved for Digitap. The presale offers huge discounts for current buyers before the full global rollout. While BTC offers modest upside, $TAP offers asymmetric risk-reward, where moderate investment today could deliver massive returns later. Digitap ’s trajectory seems more explosive because the ecosystem is in its early stages. The banking utility appears ready to be scaled, and market sentiment is leaning toward utility-first projects. Hence, $TAP is the best crypto to buy this November. Capital Isn’t Leaving Crypto, It’s Moving to $TAP Bitcoin is slowing down, but the market is thriving. Capital is not leaving crypto; it is leaving stagnant tokens. It is focusing on real utility, real adoption, and real financial infrastructure. Digitap is where smart money is flowing. For investors looking to capitalize on the next major frontier of crypto banking, $TAP looks like the best bet. With its multiple utilities, investors and analysts agree it is an excellent crypto to buy now.

The Fear and Greed Index has lifted to 15 from last week’s historical low of 10, yet conditions still reflect extreme caution. Bitcoin continues to trade below recent highs and remains sensitive to liquidations and shifting macro expectations, which keep risk appetite constrained across most major assets. Within this environment, a small group of altcoins has moved higher. Kaspa, Ethena, and Quant each show gains, but their performance appears selective, shaped by specific factors and short-term positioning rather than a broad recovery across the market. Kaspa Draws Renewed Network Attention Kaspa (KAS) is currently trading near $0.049 , up by about 22% in 24 hours. Volume has increased across active trading pairs, and participation from its user base has become more visible over recent sessions. The move aligns with sustained interest in its proof-of-work design and its focus on fast block processing, which continues to attract attention even when overall sentiment remains subdued. vProgs as L1 logic means synchronous composability and unified liquidity without rollup spaghetti. Pure $KAS fee market, no tourists. https://t.co/a4PcS0n1Hp — Kaspa (@kaspaunchained) November 25, 2025 Recent data suggests that the rise is supported by consistent engagement instead of a single headline or sudden narrative shift. Liquidity conditions look steadier than earlier in the month, helping prices hold above recent ranges as the market searches for footing. Ethena Stabilises After Earlier Volatility Ethena (ENA) is now trading around $0.28, up by roughly 16% in 24 hours. Activity has picked up following a period of sharp repricing tied to concerns around its synthetic dollar mechanics and yield structure. Current trading shows calmer funding conditions and more balanced positioning, which has supported a gradual rebound. ENA Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The move appears tied to improved confidence in its current risk framework and steadier participation from larger venues. While the wider market remains cautious, Ethena’s ability to maintain controlled price action suggests a more measured pace compared with previous swings. Quant Holds Firm on Infrastructure Use Quant (QNT) is trading near $86 , gaining about 12% over the past day. Trading activity remains steady, supported by ongoing focus on interoperability tools and cross-network settlement frameworks that form the basis of its use case. Liquidity remains workable and participation steady, helping Quant avoid the sharper drawdowns seen in more speculative segments of the market. Altcoin Season Outlook Remains Restrained Despite these scattered gains, the broader market still demonstrates a cautious phase. The limited improvement in sentiment has not translated into widespread participation, and most tokens continue to trade under the weight of Bitcoin’s direction and macro uncertainty. Altcoin season, in a traditional sense, remains distant, with activity concentrated in a narrow selection of assets rather than across the full market. For now, the environment points to consolidation and selective engagement rather than a decisive shift. Any wider recovery is likely to depend on continued stabilisation in Bitcoin and a clearer improvement in overall risk conditions, which have yet to fully emerge.

54883897,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=31001,1764090294,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,Trading spaces recap: Is this a dead cat bounce or the start of a recovery?,https://blog.kraken.com/crypto-education/dentoshi-dead-cat-bounce-or-start-of-recovery,"With BTC plunging toward $80k on Friday — leaving many U.S. traders waking up to carnage — and then sharply rebounding across the weekend toward $90k , the question on everyone’s mind is simple: Is this a true recovery or just a dead cat bounce? Kraken VP of growth Matt Howells-Barby and pro trader Dentoshi (Den) spent the session digging into the macro catalysts, the key technical levels and what traders should realistically expect in the weeks ahead. As always, nothing discussed is financial advice — only market commentary and education. Macro: why everything hinges on the December rate cut Before diving into charts, Matt unpacked the macro environment behind last week’s huge swings. In short, it’s all about rate cuts and the lack of reliable data. Here’s what happened: The market’s expectation for a December rate cut dropped as low as 33% last Thursday — the lowest since the previous Fed meeting A series of hawkish remarks from non-voting Fed officials spooked markets The U.S. government shutdown meant missing datasets including no October non-farm payrolls report September’s jobs report was mixed: Unemployment ticked up (rate-cut friendly) Payrolls surged far above expectations (rate-cut unfriendly) Then sentiment flipped : NY Fed President John Williams voiced support for a December cut Governor Waller, historically dovish, echoed the same Within hours, the market swung back to ~77% odds of a December cut The result: equities rallied and crypto followed. BTC’s weekend rebound is almost a mirror image of these shifts. Why this matters for crypto Crypto sits at the furthest end of the risk curve. If money is pulling out of AI equities, it’s pulling out of crypto twice as fast — and when liquidity returns, crypto feels it twice as strongly. The next major catalysts: PPI on Tuesday (the big one to watch) PCE later in the week Initial jobless claims (a key proxy while other data is missing) A low PPI print could push rate-cut expectations toward 90%+ , and a hot inflation surprise could trigger another wobble across risk assets. “Time to clear the charts” – Den on why the structure has changed Den made a strong point early: this is the first true structural breakdown of the bull trend. Specifically, BTC has lost the 3-day 100 EMA — a level that held throughout the entire bull market so far. Previous pulls back to this EMA had always produced clean bounces. This time, we got a clean break. According to Den: “When something that has worked all the way through the cycle suddenly stops working, that’s your signal to start fresh. Clear the charts. Reset the bias.” The speed and shape of the recent dump also stood out: No reaction at several major levels (yearly open, ETF cost basis, prior supports) No “standard” bull-market bounces A type of breakdown more reminiscent of capitulation than controlled retrace This doesn’t mean the cycle is over, but it does mean the market we’re in now is not the same market we were in three weeks ago. BTC: a strong bounce but with heavy work ahead BTC has moved sharply off the lows, but context is key. The monthly chart Den calls it “super rejection-y.” The first obvious magnet is the cluster of lows below. The new range Starting fresh, Den mapped BTC into a wide structural range defined by: Support zone: low–mid $70ks Major resistance 1: yearly open Major resistance 2: around $100k (mid-range confluence plus psychological level) Major resistance 3: 2024 highs and the local cluster of equal highs BTC is now pushing off support, but according to Den: “We have a lot of resistance above us. It would be more logical to see a move toward $100k and reject than to expect a straight reclaim — unless risk assets go absolutely wild.” A positive sign: the first 4h trend shift For the first time since late October, BTC has: Broken above the 4h EMAs Established early low-timeframe bullish structure Pulled a clean deviation-and-reclaim out of Den’s support zone This supports a relief bounce but doesn’t confirm a full recovery. The psychological challenge Four consecutive red weekly candles have people shaken. Den’s advice: Look for strength (reclaiming levels) Or look for logical sweeps of key levels But don’t blindly knife-catch “Zoom into the lower timeframes. Find structure that makes sense. Let it align with your higher timeframe thesis.” ETH: oversold mid-range bounce but still a long road back Den joked that looking at ETH “hurts,” but the chart is cleaner than BTC’s. ETH’s range is extremely well-defined. The mid-range in the $2,800s held — exactly where Den expected a mean-reversion bounce. She noted that: The stochastic RSI Cuban’s reversion bands Pure price structure All pointed toward oversold conditions. ETH is now pushing a local trend shift faster than BTC, but: “It’s a long way to go. The more you dump, the more work you need to get back to the same place.” The real test for ETH is reclaiming level-to-level resistance looming above us; starting with the Yearly Open, 1D EMA’s, and quarterly range levels (not shown in this stream). We want to have a conservative approach and not directly aim towards cycle highs; it’s a step-by-step approach. Until then, everything is provisional. What broke? Why 10 October changed everything Both Matt and Den agreed something changed in mid-October. Den’s observations: Zero bounce at key high-probability levels, which is rare in past cycles Yearly open ignored, despite being untouched since early in the year Speed of breakdown inconsistent with prior bull-market pullbacks Daily EMAs about to cross bearish for the first time since the FTX collapse That doesn’t confirm a macro top, but it absolutely confirms a behavioral shift. BTC is acting differently. Alts are acting differently. The bear case: what would confirm a cycle top? Den laid out her criteria carefully. 1. Daily EMAs crossing bearish This is already in motion, and the last time we saw it was during the FTX period. 2. Rejections at key reclaim levels If BTC tags the yearly open or $100k and gets slammed straight back down, that would be a very bearish signal. 3. Sweeping into the mid-$60ks to mid-$70ks and dumping straight through These levels hold enormous structural significance (2021 highs, untested liquidity). A clean break through them would imply: Structure fully broken Likely cycling into a multi-month accumulation phase A path toward high-$40ks forming over many months Importantly, Den does not see an immediate collapse to $60k or $40k happening in one shot. “If we ever get to the $40ks again, it will be a long bleed-out, not a fast V-reversal.” There is a lot of liquidity between $60k–$70k that has not been revisited since the 2022–23 base. Total market charts: still holding… barely Den walked through TOTAL and TOTAL3: TOTAL is sandwiched between the 2021 ATH and rejected highs The attempted breakdown last week did not continue, which is slightly bullish If TOTAL re-enters the prior range from below, that would be a strong structural breakdown signal TOTAL3 (alts excluding BTC and ETH) still clings to trend support despite many alts looking awful individually On all charts, the story is the same: We’re holding for now, but the next move decides everything. Macro momentum: the case for optimism Matt wrapped with a cautiously optimistic outlook. If December brings a rate cut, even a small one, it may not send BTC to all-time highs immediately, but: It restores momentum It unlocks risk appetite It creates a path toward Q1 and Q2 follow-through, especially with data returning after months of silence Between a new Fed chair, pent-up economic releases and the renewed correlation between BTC and the Nasdaq 100, the next few inflation prints will decide the fate of the first half of 2025. So… dead cat bounce or recovery? The honest answer: We won’t know this week. We need to see: How BTC behaves at the yearly open Whether ETH can hold the midrange and reclaim some levels to the upside If TOTAL can hold 2021 ATHs How markets digest PPI, PCE and jobless claims Den summed it up: “Something has clearly changed. The question is: how different, and for how long?” The next few weeks will define that.

After gaining 7% today, the price sits at $2.19. Traders are now debating whether this rally could be the start of a significant final wave in XRP’s long-term Elliott Wave structure. Charting Guy, a respected technical analyst on X, shared his view on X. He traces XRP’s rise from the $0.38 low in 2023, labeling it the start of a multi-wave sequence. According to his analysis, XRP is now in a wave 5 extension, aiming toward $8. This projection is both ambitious and carefully considered. $XRP still going to $8 idc pic.twitter.com/xzbyvmA8Ma — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) November 25, 2025 Elliott Wave Setup In his analysis, Charting Guy identifies waves 1 and 2 as completed in early 2025. Wave 3 followed with a steep impulse upward. Wave 4 unfolded as a complex A–B–C corrective pattern , retracing part of wave 3’s gains. He interprets a bounce from $2.72 to $3.38 in August as a B-wave, suggesting the C-wave correction is ongoing. Fibonacci levels are central to his methodology. Retracements like 0.786 ($2.87293) and 0.888 ($3.1273) highlight key correction zones. Extension levels at 1.272 ($4.63) and 1.618 (~$5.39) mark potential upside targets for wave 5 before reaching the $8 ceiling. Key Price Levels and Risks XRP must reclaim $2.65 to confirm the bullish path. Failing this could push the price back. He cautions that without a clear breakout, the $8 target may remain out of reach. He also notes an extended move toward $8 could occur later in the year, but timing is uncertain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Comparison with Other Analysts Charting Guy’s target is more optimistic than some Elliott Wave analysts, yet more cautious than extreme forecasts. Others project smaller targets, like $3.88, based on inverse retracement calculations. Some aggressive analysts, however, see the $8+ level as achievable if wave 5 fully extends, creating excitement among long-term holders. Investor Takeaways Charting Guy’s analysis highlights a potential path for XRP but stresses caution. The wave 4 correction may not yet be complete. Clear breakouts above resistance zones are required to sustain momentum. Traders should prepare for volatility in both directions while monitoring Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave developments. In conclusion, the $8 target remains a plausible, carefully reasoned projection. However, XRP’s journey there may involve further corrections and sideways consolidation before a decisive breakout occurs. Investors should remain patient and disciplined.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $85.92 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $271.99 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS.

The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space.

The price is hugging the lower band of the Bollinger Bands, which means that selling pressure is still strong and demand is weak. RSI around 35 shows weak momentum, but not yet deeply oversold, which means that the price could still go down more. If ENS doesn’t get back to the mid-band near $12.66, the next move could be to support around $10.39. Any bounce is likely to be a correction rather than a full reversal. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis E NSUSD chart by TradingView ENS on the 4-hour chart continues to trade in a broad downtrend, with price struggling below the 20-period SMA and repeatedly rejecting the mid-Bollinger Band. Momentum remains weak as the MACD stays in negative territory despite a slight attempt at convergence, signaling limited bullish strength. The Balance of Power also shows sellers maintaining control. Current support sits near $10.66, while resistance lies around $11.60–$11.80. Unless ENS breaks above the descending channel and reclaims the 20-SMA with strong volume, the market is likely to remain bearish or consolidate sideways with a slight downward bias.

ENS appears to be attempting a short-term stabilization after a long period of steady decline, but momentum is still weak overall. On both the 1-day and 4-hour charts, price remains below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, showing that sellers still control the trend. RSI is rising slightly from oversold territory, suggesting a mild relief bounce is possible, but not yet a confirmed reversal. Bollinger Bands indicate compression, suggesting a potential expansion of volatility soon. If buyers defend the $11 zone, ENS may attempt a move toward $12.6, but losing support could send it back toward $10.7. Why is ENS down today? Today, ENS is down because both the 1-day and 4-hour charts show clear bearish momentum. The price is still below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which shows that it is still under pressure to go down. The RSI is near oversold territory, which means that sellers are still in charge because demand is weak and confidence is low. The price is hugging the lower band of the Bollinger Bands, which means that selling is still going on. The 4-hour chart shows that the downtrend is still going on because there have been lower highs and lower lows. The MACD is still negative. Overall, ENS is going down because of technical weakness, fading momentum, and sellers still being in charge. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $110.11 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $271.99. by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

The minimum price for ENS could reach $22.45 Month Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price November $22.45 $23.30 $23.94 Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2025 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is forecasted to trade at a minimum of $22.70, an average of $23.77, and a maximum of $25.11 in 2025. This relatively stable range is expected because ENS adoption continues to grow, with integrations into PayPal, L2 networks, and broader Web3 identity use cases supporting consistent demand. Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $22.70 $23.77 $25.11 Ethereum Name Service price predictions 2026 – 2031 Year Minimum price Average price Maximum price 2026 $34.60 $35.55 $40.09 2027 $49.38 $51.16 $60.17 2028 $72.29 $74.34 $85.92 2029 $107.14 $110.11 $126.64 2030 $154.51 $160.01 $185.68 2031 $220.03 $228.03 $271.99 Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2026 In 2026, ENS is projected to reach a minimum of $34.60, an average of $35.55, and a maximum of $40.09 This growth is expected due to rising Web3 identity adoption, L2 integrations reducing costs, potential ENS Layer-2 development, and easing token unlock pressures, which will support stronger demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2027 In 2027, ENS is forecasted to trade between $49.38 and $60.17, with an average of $51.16. This rise is attributed to the wider adoption of Web3 identities, stronger cross-chain interoperability, and ENS’s maturity as a decentralized naming standard. Reduced token unlock pressure and sustained Ethereum ecosystem growth will further support higher valuation potential. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2028 It is expected that ENS will trade between $72.29 and $85.92 in 2028, with an average of $74.34. This growth is anticipated as ENS becomes a key Web3 identity layer, widely used in DeFi, NFTs, and payments, and gaining more recognition around the world. Better scalability, lower costs, and more mature governance will all help maintain high demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2029 In 2029, ENS is forecasted between $107.14 and $126.64, averaging $110.11 Growth is driven by ENS’s role as a universal Web3 identity standard, stronger enterprise and government adoption, and Ethereum’s maturity. Reduced token supply pressures and solidified network effects support higher stability, making ENS a key digital identity infrastructure. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2030 The Ethereum Name Service’s price for 2030 is projected to be a minimum of $154.51. According to expert analysis, ENS could reach a maximum possible level of $185.68, and an average price of $160.01. However, this is anticipated as ENS establishes itself in the crypto space with widespread use in finance, social media, and digital governance. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2031 In 2031, ENS is forecasted between $220.03 and $271.99, with an average of $228.03. This projection stems from ENS’s deep integration into global Web3 and Web2 systems, powering digital identity, payments, and decentralized governance. With entrenched network effects, strong enterprise adoption, and Ethereum’s ecosystem maturity, ENS demand and valuation are expected to rise further.

The company disclosed the borrowing in a November 21 filing under a previously established $500 million credit facility announced in late October. The lender remains undisclosed at the counterparty’s request. According to the filing, the loan carries a floating interest rate, renews daily, and can be repaid at any time. It is fully secured by the company’s Bitcoin reserves. Source: Metaplanet Metaplanet currently holds 30,823 BTC, valued at approximately $2.7 billion, with an average acquisition cost of $108,070 per BTC and a total cost basis of $3.33 billion. Source: Coingecko With Bitcoin trading below that level, Metaplanet has an unrealized loss of $635.97 million, or –19.1%, as of the most recent treasury update. Metaplanet Leverages BTC Reserves for Credit, Share Buybacks, and Income Growth The firm emphasized that its collateral capacity remains strong. As of October 31, its Bitcoin holdings totaled the equivalent of $3.5 billion, meaning the combined $230 million it has drawn from the credit line represents a small share of its available backing. The company said its borrowing strategy maintains a “sufficient collateral buffer even during periods of strong Bitcoin price volatility.” According to the filing, funds from the new loan will be directed toward accumulating additional Bitcoin, expanding Metaplanet’s Bitcoin income generation business, and executing share repurchases when market conditions allow. The income business, selling bitcoin options, reached record sales during the third quarter. Source: Coinpost Supporters frame the strategy as a calculated bet on Bitcoin’s long-term strength. The company has positioned BTC as its financial backbone, using it as a hedge against Japan’s weakening yen and employing a model similar to Strategy’s . Critics, however, warn that leveraging a volatile asset could trigger forced sales. A sharp price drop could trigger margin calls and force liquidations, while Metaplanet’s stock performance hasn’t consistently reflected its growing BTC reserves, showing investor skepticism. Bitcoin Dip Hits Corporate Treasuries; Metaplanet Launches Preferred Share Program Metaplanet’s loan comes as the Tokyo-listed firm restructures its capital base and seeks alternatives to issuing more common equity. Last week, the company unveiled plans for two classes of preferred shares , known internally as “Mars” and “Mercury,” designed to raise capital while limiting shareholder dilution. Metaplanet approves the issuance of new Class B shares via a third-party allotment. #Bitcoin #Metaplanet https://t.co/p8fYF0FyZt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 20, 2025 The initial sale of 23.6 million Mercury shares raised ¥21.2 billion ($135 million), with a 4.9% annual dividend and optional conversion to common stock if Metaplanet’s share price triples from current levels. The Mars class offers a variable dividend and no conversion feature, giving it higher seniority than common shares. Metaplanet said the preferred share program is key after its stock began trading below its Bitcoin reserves. Its market-to-net-asset-value ratio sits at 0.99, a rare discount that led to approval of a ¥75 billion share repurchase program . In October, Metaplanet became the first major Bitcoin-holding company to consistently trade below its net asset value . Metaplanet's mNAV hits 0.99, trading below $3.4B Bitcoin reserves as one in four treasury firms are trading at discount, with corporate buying down 95% since July. #Metaplanet #Bitcoin https://t.co/1KgbHxWGf5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 The pressure comes amid crypto market losses, with Bitcoin falling 10% in a single session and Ethereum and Solana also sliding. Across the sector, 26 of 168 Bitcoin-holding companies now trade below the value of their crypto reserves. Corporate accumulation has collapsed as well, dropping to 1,428 BTC in September, a 95% decline from July . Rival firms are reporting similar stress , with major unrealized losses reported by Marathon, Bitmine, and Galaxy Digital. Despite the market strain, Metaplanet says it remains committed to its long-term goal of acquiring 210,000 BTC by 2027, adding 17,000 BTC in Q3, ahead of its annual target.

This dramatic shift represents a major setback for users who’ve come to rely on seamless AI integration within their favorite messaging platform. The sudden removal highlights the volatile nature of AI partnerships in today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape. Why Microsoft Copilot is Leaving WhatsApp The abrupt departure stems directly from WhatsApp’s revised platform policies announced last month. Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, has decided to stop supporting general-purpose AI chatbots through its WhatsApp Business API. This strategic move reallocates these valuable resources exclusively to other business types, effectively cutting off access for major AI players like Microsoft Copilot. The Impact on WhatsApp Integration This policy change fundamentally alters how businesses and users interact with AI through messaging platforms. The WhatsApp integration that millions have grown accustomed to will completely disappear after January 15. Users currently accessing Copilot through WhatsApp will find themselves locked out unless they transition to Microsoft’s official platforms. Direct chatbot access through WhatsApp messages ends permanently Businesses must rethink their customer service AI strategies Users lose the convenience of AI assistance within their primary messaging app Understanding the AI Chatbot Migration Challenge One of the most concerning aspects of this transition involves user data. Since the WhatsApp access was unauthenticated, Microsoft confirms that chat history won’t be preserved during the migration. This creates a significant hurdle for users who rely on their conversation history for reference or continuity. Platform Access Method Data Preservation WhatsApp (Until Jan 15) Direct messaging No automatic transfer Microsoft Copilot Apps Dedicated mobile applications Full history available Web Platform Browser access Account-based storage How Meta Policies Reshape AI Distribution Meta’s decision to restrict Business API access represents a fundamental shift in how AI chatbots will be distributed moving forward. This policy change doesn’t prevent businesses from using AI to serve customers, but it eliminates WhatsApp as a distribution channel for third-party AI services. The implications extend beyond Microsoft Copilot to affect other major AI providers including OpenAI and Perplexity, both of whom face similar restrictions. Actionable Steps for Copilot Users Microsoft strongly recommends that users take immediate action to preserve their valuable chat histories. Before the January 15 deadline, users should: Export conversations using WhatsApp’s built-in export tools Download and install Microsoft’s official Copilot mobile apps Familiarize themselves with the web interface at copilot.microsoft.com Test the new platforms to ensure smooth transition What This Means for Business API Users The revised Business API policies create both challenges and opportunities. While general-purpose AI chatbots lose access, specialized business solutions may benefit from reduced competition for API resources. Companies must now evaluate whether to develop their own AI solutions within WhatsApp’s new framework or redirect customers to alternative platforms. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Microsoft Copilot being removed from WhatsApp? The removal results from Meta ‘s revised WhatsApp Business API policies that no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots. What happens to my chat history? Chat history won’t automatically transfer because WhatsApp access was unauthenticated. Users must manually export conversations before January 15. Where can I access Microsoft Copilot after January 15? Users can continue using Microsoft Copilot through the official mobile apps or web platform at copilot.microsoft.com. Are other AI chatbots affected? Yes, OpenAI has already announced similar WhatsApp integration wind-down plans, and other providers like Perplexity face identical restrictions. Can businesses still use AI on WhatsApp? Businesses can develop their own AI solutions within WhatsApp’s new framework, but cannot use third-party general-purpose AI chatbots. The Future of AI in Messaging Platforms This development signals a broader trend toward platform-controlled AI ecosystems. As messaging platforms mature, they’re increasingly asserting control over what types of AI services can operate within their environments. This could lead to more curated, platform-specific AI experiences but may limit user choice and innovation from third-party providers. The January 15 deadline marks a pivotal moment for AI accessibility. While the immediate impact is disruptive, it may ultimately lead to more specialized, purpose-built AI solutions across different platforms. Users and businesses alike must adapt to this new reality where AI access becomes more fragmented across dedicated applications rather than integrated within universal messaging platforms.

After pulling back from its recent peak, the price is sitting right at a former resistance that’s now being tested as support. Consequently, this area has held before and is once again in play as traders reassess short-term positioning. BNB Returns to Channel Support BNB is priced at $850 at press time, showing a slight 24-hour gain of over 1%, though it’s down 7% over the week. On the 2-week chart, it has tapped the upper boundary of an ascending channel, a level that capped the price action for most of 2024 and early 2025. After breaking out and reaching above $1,350, the asset has retraced to retest that same trendline. “BNB just tapped a huge confluence level,” said CryptoPulse. Notably, the area lines up with the previous resistance-turned-support and sits in the middle of the prior rally range. If buyers step in here, a push toward $950–$1,050 remains possible. So far, volume has not shown signs of major selling, which keeps the structure intact. On the monthly timeframe, BNB has returned to a key trendline that has held since 2024. According to Cryptocium, BNB has not closed a monthly candle below this line with strong downside momentum. “ BNB back to the major bullish trendline ,” they noted, adding that the price has respected this trend for nearly two years. As November’s monthly close approaches, traders are watching to see if bulls can defend this zone once again. User Activity Continues to Grow While the price action has pulled back, BNB Chain’s network activity has grown steadily in 2025. Charts shared by TCC show a rising trend in active addresses. From under a million daily users in early 2025, the chain has maintained levels above 1.5 million since July, occasionally peaking near 3.5 million. “ BNB Chain is quietly climbing ,” they posted, pointing to stronger usage despite the recent drop in price. The continued rise in network engagement may suggest underlying demand remains solid. In addition, data from YZi Labs shows that more BNB is being stored in self-custody. Exchange balances are dropping as users move tokens to private wallets. CryptoPotato reported this shift earlier in November, noting that ownership is becoming more dispersed across the network. Meanwhile, open interest on BNB futures is now at $1.34 billion, well below the September high near $2.8 billion. The chart shows that both the price and open interest have trended lower since that peak, pointing to less speculative activity in recent weeks. Source: Coinglass While the asset has found some footing in the $850–$900 range, futures interest remains muted, suggesting traders are still waiting for stronger signals.

According to Mikybull Crypto, XRP is in a strong accumulation phase, with the $2.20 level acting as a key support. This zone reflects growing investor confidence and sets the stage for potential sharp rallies, consistent with XRP’s historical resilience at critical support points. Technical indicators reinforce XRP’s bullish outlook. Momentum oscillators signal a shift from oversold to neutral, indicating room for upward movement, while steadily rising trading volumes suggest growing market interest. Therefore, analysts see this convergence as a strong catalyst for potential rallies toward higher resistance levels in the coming weeks. XRP’s bullish case is gaining momentum beyond technical signals. The XRP Ledger is increasingly recognized as a fast, low-cost, and energy-efficient platform for cross-border payments. Rising adoption by financial institutions and payment providers boosts its utility and long-term demand. Mikybull Crypto notes that these network developments, combined with favorable market conditions, could spark a self-reinforcing buying cycle. Therefore, Mikybull Crypto identifies $2.20 as a pivotal bullish level for XRP, backed by strong technical and fundamental support. Rising trading volumes and positive market developments suggest renewed upward momentum may be imminent. XRP Supply Shock Incoming? JP Morgan Predicts $14B Inflows From New XRP & SOL ETFs Banking giant JP Morgan predicts XRP and SOL ETFs could drive $14B in new inflows. Market expert Diana calls it a potential ‘supply shock,’ signaling a pivotal boost for XRP’s price and liquidity. ETFs have long opened the door for institutional capital, offering regulated, hassle-free exposure without managing digital wallets. JP Morgan highlights rising institutional demand for digital assets, with XRP and Solana poised as utility-driven networks with strong adoption potential. XRP ETFs from Canary Capital, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton are already live. With circulating supply constrained by long-term holders and staking, an influx of institutional demand via ETFs could trigger a supply-demand imbalance. Diana notes this dynamic often accelerates price gains, potentially driving strong bullish momentum in the coming months if ETF adoption and investor interest continue as expected. Solana could see a major boost from ETF exposure. Its fast, low-cost blockchain already attracts DeFi projects and NFT platforms. An SOL ETF would legitimize Solana for institutional investors, driving adoption and liquidity. JP Morgan’s $14B inflow estimate highlights the substantial capital poised to enter once ETFs launch. Diana highlights that the proposed XRP and SOL ETFs could spark a surge in adoption and prices. With $14 billion in potential inflows, XRP may face a supply shock, presenting early investors a prime opportunity to ride the next wave of institutional interest. Conclusion XRP at $2.20 sits at a pivotal support zone where technical strength, rising adoption, and investor optimism align. Mikybull Crypto highlights this level as a potential launchpad for renewed bullish momentum, positioning XRP as a must-watch crypto. On the other hand, the potential launch of XRP and SOL ETFs could redefine the crypto market. With JPMorgan projecting $14B in inflows, XRP may face a supply crunch as demand outpaces availability.

The company said on Tuesday that it will launch a U.S. dollar-backed token called KlarnaUSD, positioning the move as a step toward faster and cheaper global payments at a time when the stablecoin sector is expanding under growing regulatory scrutiny. Introducing KlarnaUSD, our first @Stablecoin . We’re the first bank to launch on @tempo , the payments blockchain by @stripe and @paradigm . With stablecoin transactions already at $27T a year, we’re bringing faster, cheaper cross-border payments to our 114M customers. Crypto is… — Klarna (@Klarna) November 25, 2025 Klarna Joins PayPal and Stripe in Stablecoin Push With 2026 Launch of KlarnaUSD KlarnaUSD is currently in testing and is scheduled to go live on the Tempo blockchain in 2026. Tempo, developed by Stripe and Paradigm, is designed specifically for payments and serves as the backbone for Stripe’s own blockchain infrastructure product, Bridge, which will issue the token. Klarna said the asset will be fully backed by U.S. dollars and built for everyday commerce, including cross-border transactions that remain slow and expensive for many users. The decision places Klarna among a rising group of global payment firms rolling out their own stablecoins. PayPal launched its U.S. dollar token last year , while Stripe entered the market after its $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge . @Stripe is in advanced discussions to acquire stablecoin-focused fintech firm Bridge, per sources close to the matter. #Stripe #Stablecoin #Bridge https://t.co/Jc5V6WWA2S — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 17, 2024 Klarna is now the first bank to adopt Stripe’s stablecoin stack for global payment settlement, expanding on an existing partnership in which Stripe processes a large share of Klarna’s transactions worldwide. Klarna’s U.S. business remains its largest market, giving the company a broad user base for a potential stablecoin rollout. Klarna’s entrance comes after CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, long skeptical of crypto, confirmed the firm’s shift in approach, saying in a statement that digital assets had reached a point where they are “fast, low-cost, secure, and built for scale.” Klarna has more than 114 million users and processed $112 billion in gross merchandise value over the past year, giving it the scale to test blockchain payments at a global level. The announcement also follows the company’s stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, its first since its highly anticipated September listing. Global Institutions Accelerate Stablecoin Adoption as Market Tops $300B The launch is unfolding during a broader wave of institutional adoption of stablecoins. Western Union plans to release a dollar-backed token on Solana in 2026, seeking to reduce international remittance fees that total roughly $120 billion annually. @WesternUnion is stepping into crypto, unveiling plans to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin on Solana in 2026 to power faster, cheaper global payments. #WesternUnion #Solana https://t.co/g3HqFcAm13 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 29, 2025 Visa has reported more than $140 billion in stablecoin and crypto payment flows since 2020 and plans to support additional tokens across multiple blockchains.

That puts the firm right in the middle of a growing push by U.S. financial giants to move money faster and cheaper using blockchain tech. The Minneapolis-based bank, which operates as U.S. Bank, has already formed a new division focused on crypto and money movement. During an earnings call in October, Gunjan Kedia, President and CEO, stated that Bancorp is now working on two stablecoin fronts: holding cryptocurrency for clients and testing actual payments using stablecoins. “Client demand is more muted” on the payments side, she admitted. Bancorp builds in-house rails for stablecoin transfers Mike Villano, senior vice president and head of digital asset products at U.S. Bank, said in an interview that stablecoins bring obvious advantages: faster settlement, lower cost, and 24/7 access. But, he added, banks like his can’t just plug into off-the-shelf tokens and call it a day. “But for bank customers, we had to think about other protections around know-your-customers, the ability for online transactions, the ability to claw back transactions,” Mike said. That’s where Stellar comes in. The public blockchain, originally co-founded by Jed McCaleb, was designed from the start for finance-first applications. The network allows token issuers to freeze assets, a feature that gives traditional institutions more control than most blockchains can offer. Mike said that was a key reason Bancorp chose Stellar over alternatives. Circle, the company behind USDC, and asset manager Franklin Templeton are already using Stellar’s rails. And the ecosystem is growing. As of September, Stellar had 9.8 million unique wallets. In the last year, it processed $32 billion in payments, based on the latest quarterly update from the Stellar Development Foundation, the nonprofit that maintains the network. The foundation’s president and chief growth officer, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, said more institutions are getting comfortable with moving operations on-chain. “One of the very important things is that institutions are considering deploying on-chain,” Jose said. “That’s a ton of progress from where the institutional market was a few years back.” More firms race to serve banks in crypto Bancorp isn’t the only one circling the stablecoin runway. Citigroup has already linked up with Coinbase, while Ripple just raised $500 million from big-money names like Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities. Ripple’s plan? Roll out products for financial firms, the exact same crowd Bancorp is targeting. Base, a chain built by Coinbase on top of Ethereum, is also going after the same space. So is Tempo, a blockchain project incubated by Stripe. But Jose says Stellar’s independence gives it an edge. He believes banks are more likely to trust a network that’s not tied to a direct competitor. “We think that it is very important that there are open blockchains out there that are independent, that are not affiliated with a corporate,” he said. “That’s going to give a ton of confidence for institutions that they’re building on someone that is not related to a competitor, but also someone who’s playing the long game and devoted to the progress of the technology itself.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Business|Stellar|U.S. Bancorp,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-25 17:33:15

This announcement comes despite earlier reports suggesting the two leaders were preparing for crucial November talks. What’s the Current Status of the Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting? A White House official recently clarified that no specific date has been set for the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting. This statement directly contradicts previous media reports indicating the leaders planned to meet on November 27th. The potential meeting was expected to focus on finalizing a significant peace agreement between their nations. The timing of this clarification raises important questions about diplomatic coordination. However, officials emphasize that communication channels remain open between both administrations. The delay doesn’t necessarily indicate problems in bilateral relations. Why Does This Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting Matter? The proposed Trump-Zelenskyy meeting carries substantial geopolitical weight. Here are the key reasons this diplomatic engagement matters: Peace Process Advancement – The meeting could accelerate ongoing peace negotiations Bilateral Relations – Face-to-face discussions often break diplomatic deadlocks International Stability – Successful talks could influence regional security dynamics Economic Cooperation – New agreements might open trade and investment opportunities What Challenges Could Delay the Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting? Several factors might explain the scheduling uncertainty for the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting. Diplomatic engagements at this level require meticulous planning and coordination. Both leaders have demanding domestic and international agendas that must align perfectly. Moreover, the substance of discussions requires thorough preparation. Officials need to ensure all negotiation points are carefully reviewed before the leaders convene. This careful approach actually demonstrates the importance both sides place on making the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting productive. What Can We Expect From the Future Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting? When the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting eventually occurs, observers anticipate several key outcomes. The peace agreement framework likely tops the agenda, but other bilateral issues will probably surface. Both nations have shared interests in security cooperation and economic partnerships. The delayed Trump-Zelenskyy meeting might actually work in diplomacy’s favor. Additional preparation time could lead to more substantial agreements. Sometimes, slower diplomatic processes yield better long-term results than rushed negotiations. Key Takeaways From the Meeting Delay The scheduling uncertainty surrounding the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting reminds us that international diplomacy operates on complex timelines. While the delay might disappoint some observers, it doesn’t necessarily signal diplomatic trouble. In fact, careful preparation often precedes the most successful international summits. The world continues watching for official announcements about the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting. When confirmed, this engagement could mark a significant step toward regional stability and enhanced bilateral cooperation. Frequently Asked Questions When was the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting originally supposed to happen? Earlier reports suggested November 27th, but the White House has confirmed no date is currently scheduled. What is the main purpose of the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting? The primary focus is expected to be finalizing a peace agreement between the United States and Ukraine. Does the delay indicate problems in US-Ukraine relations? Not necessarily – diplomatic meetings at this level often face scheduling challenges due to complex leader calendars. How will we know when the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting is confirmed? The White House will issue an official statement and media advisory once dates are finalized. What other topics might the leaders discuss besides peace agreements? Economic cooperation, security partnerships, and regional stability issues will likely be on the agenda. Has there been communication between the administrations despite the meeting delay? Yes, officials confirm that diplomatic channels remain open and active between both governments. Found this update on the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting helpful?

Real infrastructure testing for regulated deposit tokens — the kind that could reshape how banks move money. Here's what’s happening. https://t.co/C7sqTIDJZF pic.twitter.com/ZFXC5Q1a49 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) November 25, 2025 The development was announced during the bank’s Money 20/20 podcast episode, The Tokenized Future of Banking, featuring leaders from U.S. Bank, SDF, and PwC discussing how tokenization will reshape the future of financial services. The initiative shows a growing shift among major financial institutions toward programmable money—digital assets built with safeguards and compliance features required by traditional banking. Why U.S. Bank Chose Stellar for Stablecoin R&D During the podcast, Mike Villano, Senior Vice President and Head of Digital Asset Products at U.S. Bank, emphasized that safety and control are non-negotiable when bringing tokenized assets into the banking environment. “For bank customers, we have to think about protections around know-your-customer, the ability to unwind transactions, the ability to claw back transactions,” Villano said. “One of the great things about the Stellar platform, as we did more research and development on it, was learning that they have the ability at their base operating layer to freeze assets and unwind transactions,” Villano added. Stellar says its architecture was built specifically for issuing assets and moving money at scale. With 99.99% uptime over more than a decade, fast 3–5 second settlement, and transaction fees that cost a fraction of a U.S. cent. Institutional Confidence in Stellar’s Reliability José Fernández da Ponte, President and Chief Growth Officer at the Stellar Development Foundation, pointed out that institutional-grade reliability is the foundation of Stellar’s appeal. “When you are doing mission-critical systems, when you are doing financial services, and you are moving consumers’ money, you need to make sure that your blockchain is going to be there,” he said. “We are honored to have the confidence of U.S. Bank and our partners at PwC. We take that confidence and that trust very, very seriously,” said Villano. ECB Warns Stablecoins Are Rising Fast With Spillover Risks On Monday, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoins—despite their still-limited footprint in the euro area— poses emerging financial-stability risks , especially as interlinkages with global markets deepen. The findings come from the ECB report “Stablecoins on the rise: still small in the euro area, but spillover risks loom,” prepared by Senne Aerts, Claudia Lambert, and Elisa Reinhold, which examines structural vulnerabilities, use cases, and cross-border risks tied to the accelerating stablecoin ecosystem. According to the authors, the combined market capitalisation of all stablecoins has surged past $280 billion, reaching an all-time high and accounting for roughly 8% of the total crypto-asset market. Two U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins dominate overwhelmingly: Tether (USDT) with $184 billion and USDC with $75 billion.

This dramatic move could signal significant changes ahead for cryptocurrency investors and traditional markets alike. Why Does the US 10-year Treasury Yield Matter for Crypto Investors? The US 10-year Treasury yield serves as a crucial benchmark for global financial markets. When this key interest rate declines, it typically indicates changing investor sentiment about economic growth and inflation expectations. More importantly for crypto enthusiasts, falling Treasury yields often create a more favorable environment for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Here’s what you need to understand about this development: Lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers Reduced competition from safe-haven assets Improved risk appetite among institutional investors Potential capital rotation into growth-oriented assets What’s Driving This Sudden Treasury Yield Decline? Several factors have converged to push the US 10-year Treasury yield below that psychological 4% barrier. Cooling inflation data has been the primary catalyst, with recent CPI reports showing slower price increases than expected. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s more dovish tone in recent communications has markets anticipating potential rate cuts in 2024. Moreover, economic indicators suggest the US economy might be heading toward a soft landing rather than a harsh recession. This combination of factors has created perfect conditions for the US 10-year Treasury yield to retreat from its recent highs. How Could This Impact Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies? The relationship between the US 10-year Treasury yield and cryptocurrency markets has become increasingly important. Historically, when Treasury yields fall, cryptocurrencies often benefit from improved market sentiment and increased capital flows. This inverse relationship has strengthened as institutional adoption of digital assets has grown. Consider these potential implications: Bitcoin could see renewed institutional interest as yield-seeking capital looks for alternatives Altcoins might experience increased volatility as risk appetite shifts DeFi yields could become more competitive relative to traditional fixed income Crypto mining profitability might improve with lower financing costs What Should Crypto Investors Watch Next? While the US 10-year Treasury yield breaking below 4% is significant, the real question is whether this trend will sustain. Investors should monitor upcoming economic data releases, particularly inflation reports and employment figures. The Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting will also be crucial for determining whether this yield decline marks a lasting trend or temporary fluctuation. Furthermore, keep an eye on how traditional financial institutions respond to these yield movements. Large asset managers and pension funds often adjust their portfolio allocations based on Treasury yield changes, which could indirectly affect cryptocurrency markets through broader risk sentiment shifts. Actionable Insights for Navigating This Market Shift Given the US 10-year Treasury yield movement, crypto investors should consider several strategic adjustments. First, reassess your portfolio’s risk exposure and ensure proper diversification. Second, monitor how major cryptocurrencies correlate with Treasury yield movements in the coming weeks. Third, stay informed about macroeconomic developments that could reverse or accelerate this trend. Remember that while falling Treasury yields generally support risk assets, cryptocurrency markets remain influenced by multiple factors including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market-specific dynamics. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Risk Assets The US 10-year Treasury yield dropping below 4% represents more than just a numerical milestone—it signals a potential paradigm shift in investor psychology and capital allocation. For cryptocurrency markets, this could open the door to renewed institutional interest and improved market sentiment. However, prudent investors will watch for confirmation that this trend has staying power before making significant portfolio changes. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is the US 10-year Treasury yield? The US 10-year Treasury yield represents the return investors receive for lending money to the US government for ten years. It’s considered a benchmark for global interest rates and risk-free returns. Why does the Treasury yield affect cryptocurrency prices? When Treasury yields fall, safe-haven assets become less attractive, potentially driving capital toward riskier investments like cryptocurrencies that offer higher potential returns. How low could the US 10-year Treasury yield go? While predictions vary, many analysts suggest the yield could test 3.5% if economic data continues to show cooling inflation and slowing growth. Should I change my crypto investment strategy because of this? While this development is positive for risk assets, maintain a balanced approach and consider your individual risk tolerance and investment timeline before making significant changes. How often does the US 10-year Treasury yield update? The yield updates continuously during trading hours as bond prices fluctuate in response to market demand and economic news. Could this yield drop reverse quickly? Yes, Treasury yields can be volatile and may reverse if inflation concerns resurface or the Federal Reserve signals a more hawkish policy stance.

The move comes as Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ ETF began trading on NYSE Arca on November 25, joining Grayscale’s newly listed GXRP product. The two products attracted roughly $164 million of first-day inflows according to CoinShares data , a signal that investor demand for XRP exposure is expanding beyond crypto-native venues. The ETF launches coincided with a 7.9% advance in XRP, the strongest performance among the top 10 digital assets on the day, as traders moved to reprice the token after weeks of consolidation. ETF Access Strengthens the Bull Case: XRP Holds $2 The arrival of XRP ETFs reduces the friction for traditional investors who prefer regulated wrappers over direct token custody. Strategists see the listings as a step toward institutional validation of XRP’s long-standing positioning as a cross-border payments network, especially as asset managers broaden their product lines beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Technically, XRP is again defending the $1.95–$2.05 support band, marking the seventh successful test since December 2024. Short-term charts show a constructive shift: on the 4-hour timeframe, XRP has printed a bullish divergence, with RSI(14) rising from 42 to 57 even as price moved sideways — a setup often associated with early-stage trend exhaustion. Smart PR in Volatile Markets: Outset PR’s Syndication-First Model As ETF launches reshape market narratives, visibility becomes part of the price cycle. In crypto, sentiment often swings as much on perceived momentum as on fundamentals — which is why projects increasingly lean on data-driven communications to stay credible during volatile phases. The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Outlook XRP’s ability to defend $2 while ETFs begin trading suggests that institutional access is arriving at a moment of technical importance. If inflows remain steady and price clears the $2.23–$2.28 resistance band, the market could see a higher-low forming within the broader downtrend. Until the descending channel breaks, however, rallies are likely to face heavy overhead supply. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This move makes it the latest global fintech company to tap blockchain rails for powering global transfers. The token is set to go live on Tempo, a blockchain developed by Stripe and Paradigm specifically for payment use cases. The token will be issued through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin infrastructure product, and is currently in test mode. A full public rollout is planned for next year. Introducing KlarnaUSD, our first @Stablecoin . We’re the first bank to launch on @tempo , the payments blockchain by @stripe and @paradigm . With stablecoin transactions already at $27T a year, we’re bringing faster, cheaper cross-border payments to our 114M customers. Crypto is… — Klarna (@Klarna) November 25, 2025 At launch, Klarna’s stablecoin will serve internal payment processes, with expansion to merchant and consumer use expected in the future. The rollout aims to streamline international payments and reduce costs for both consumers and merchants. KlarnaUSD to help reduce the cost of cross-border payments The fintech giant is also known for its “buy now, pay later” empire. Its CEO is known to dismiss crypto. However, earlier this year, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski announced that the fintech giant would embrace crypto. Siemiatkowski said at the time that Klarna was preparing to integrate crypto services and invited the community to weigh in on potential features. To that end, Klarna stated that the token will help reduce the cost of cross-border payments, a space where global fees amount to roughly $120 billion annually. The partnership also builds on Klarna’s existing work with Stripe, which handles much of Klarna’s payment processing across 26 global markets. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co-founder and CEO of Klarna, stated, “Crypto is finally at a stage where it is fast, low-cost, secure, and built for scale With 114 million customers and $112 billion in annual GMV [gross merchandise value], Klarna has the scale to change payments globally: with Klarna’s scale and Tempo’s infrastructure, we can challenge old networks and make payments faster and cheaper for everyone.” Klarna promises more crypto projects amidst its 52-week lows Klarna aims for its stablecoin to be used in everyday transactions, not just on crypto platforms. The company also hinted at more crypto-related partnerships in the press release to come in the weeks ahead. The move also puts Klarna alongside other big names in the race. As reported by Cryptopolitan, PayPal launched its own stablecoin, and Stripe rolled out one after acquiring Bridge for $1.1 billion. Klarna is now joining the shortlist of mainstream payments firms that are bringing stablecoins into their core business. Additionally, last month, remittances service provider Western Union announced that it would introduce a stablecoin on the Solana network with Anchorage Digital. Klarna enters crypto with solid momentum. The company recently listed on the NYSE, raising $1.37 billion. In Q3, it posted 23% growth in gross merchandise volume and revenue of $903 million, beating analyst expectations. Meanwhile,the stock is trading near its 52-week lows. However, Klarna’s liquidity remains extremely strong, giving the company room to push into new products, including its first stablecoin. Stablecoin transaction volume exceeds $27 trillion The announcement comes as stablecoin usage continues to surge. McKinsey estimates that annual stablecoin transaction volume already exceeds $27 trillion and could surpass traditional payment systems by the end of the decade. Interest in the asset class has also grown since the US’s GENIUS Act, the first federal crypto law, and Europe is finally giving large firms the green light to build. Additionally, the stablecoin market cap jumped from $260 billion to $304 billion between July and November. This has prompted issuers to purchase $44 billion in US Treasury bills to comply with a federal mandate embedded in the GENIUS Act. The Bank for International Settlements’ findings show that a $3.5 billion increase in stablecoin market cap reduces government borrowing costs by 0.025%. At the projected $3 trillion mark, this could save the US $114 billion a year, or $900 per household. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicted that stablecoins would reach $3 trillion by 2030, yielding $114 billion in annual government savings. Also, the European Central Bank reported in November that the global stablecoin market surpassed $280 billion, led by Tether at $184 billion and USD Coin at $75 billion in market capitalization.

This massive acquisition represents one of the largest institutional investments in crypto assets by a publicly traded company, potentially marking a turning point for mainstream crypto adoption. Why are Rain tokens attracting major institutional interest? Rain tokens serve as the native cryptocurrency for Rain Protocol, a prediction market platform that launched on the Arbitrum blockchain in 2023. Prediction markets allow users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events, creating decentralized forecasting mechanisms. The substantial investment by Enlivex suggests they see significant potential in this emerging sector. To finance this groundbreaking acquisition, Enlivex plans to sell 212 million of its shares at $1 each. This funding strategy demonstrates the company’s serious commitment to entering the cryptocurrency space and positions them as pioneers among traditional biopharma firms embracing digital assets. What makes this Rain tokens acquisition so significant? This move represents several important developments in the cryptocurrency landscape. First, it shows that established public companies are now willing to make substantial bets on crypto assets. Second, the biopharmaceutical sector’s entry into crypto suggests broader industry acceptance beyond tech and finance companies. Institutional validation – A Nasdaq-listed company’s major investment lends credibility to the entire crypto space Cross-industry adoption – Biopharma entering crypto signals wider mainstream acceptance Market confidence – The $212 million size demonstrates serious financial commitment Strategic positioning – Enlivex may be positioning for future blockchain integration in healthcare How does Rain Protocol work with these Rain tokens? Rain Protocol operates as a decentralized prediction market platform where users can trade shares in the outcomes of various events. The Rain tokens function as the platform’s utility token, enabling transactions, governance, and ecosystem participation. Built on Arbitrum, the protocol benefits from Ethereum’s security while offering lower transaction costs and faster processing times. The platform’s potential applications span numerous industries, including healthcare outcomes prediction, clinical trial results forecasting, and pharmaceutical market analysis. This may explain why a biopharmaceutical company like Enlivex sees strategic value in acquiring Rain tokens. What challenges might Enlivex face with their Rain tokens investment? While this acquisition represents an exciting development, several challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty continues to surround cryptocurrency investments by public companies. Additionally, the volatile nature of crypto markets could impact the value of their Rain tokens holdings. The company must also navigate shareholder expectations and potential skepticism about diversifying from their core biopharma business. However, the potential rewards could be substantial. If prediction markets gain mainstream adoption and Rain Protocol becomes a leading platform, Enlivex’s early investment in Rain tokens could generate significant returns while positioning them at the forefront of blockchain innovation in healthcare. Conclusion: A landmark moment for crypto institutional adoption Enlivex’s planned $212 million Rain tokens acquisition represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency acceptance by traditional institutions. This move not only validates the potential of prediction market platforms but also demonstrates how established companies are actively seeking exposure to innovative blockchain technologies. As more corporations follow suit, we may be witnessing the beginning of a new era where crypto assets become standard components of corporate investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What are Rain tokens used for? Rain tokens are the native cryptocurrency of Rain Protocol, used for transactions, governance, and participation in the prediction market platform’s ecosystem. Why would a biopharma company invest in cryptocurrency? Enlivex likely sees strategic value in prediction markets for healthcare forecasting and wants exposure to innovative blockchain technology that could disrupt their industry. How is Enlivex funding this Rain tokens purchase? The company plans to sell 212 million shares at $1 each to raise the $212 million needed for the acquisition. What blockchain does Rain Protocol use? Rain Protocol operates on the Arbitrum blockchain, which is built on Ethereum but offers lower fees and faster transactions. When did Rain Protocol launch? The platform launched in 2023 and has been growing its ecosystem since then. Is this the largest crypto investment by a public company? While not the largest overall, it represents one of the most significant investments specifically in prediction market tokens by a Nasdaq-listed company.

The analyst frames such ambitious forecasts as unrealistic and highly speculative. Considering the recent decline in the BTC market, if the projection is taken at face value without supporting data, it overlooks ongoing market trends, macroeconomic conditions, and potential investor risks. Strategist Labels $220,000 Bitcoin Price Forecast “Nonsense” South Korean scientist YoungHoon Kim, who holds the world’s highest reported IQ of 276, recently predicted that Bitcoin could more than double its current price and reach $220,000 within 45 days. Based on this forecast, the BTC price is expected to surge by over 151% from current levels below $87,500, potentially reaching a new all-time high by mid-January 2026. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Price Action With Chinese Astrology Shares When Prices Will Surge With Bitcoin down more than 31% from its ATH above $126,000, the bold forecast came as a surprise to many crypto members. The founder of Black Swan Capitalist, Versan Aljarrah, in particular, criticized the projection, calling it “nonsense.” He described it as an example of the speculative behavior that has long characterized the crypto space. Aljarrah argued that predictions like Kim’s, which lack the visible support of a technical analysis, are what transform the crypto space into a “circus.” He highlighted that Bitcoin maxis will often go to extreme lengths to sustain the hype, promoting narratives that keep the speculative bubble alive even when market fundamentals raise caution. The Black Swan Capitalist founder also disclosed that Bitcoin has historically functioned more as a tool for predators and bad actors. His statements suggest that Kim’s forecast oversimplifies the complexities of the crypto market and distracts investors and traders from the fundamental structural factors driving Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Price Continues To Falter Amidst Bullish Forecasts The Bitcoin market remains at a crossroads, with analysts forecasting sharp upward moves despite choppy price action. Despite predictions of a potential rally, BTC’s recent performance paints a more cautious picture, as its price has fallen by more than 20% over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Why Bitwise Thinks Bitcoin Still Hits $200,000 In 2026 Crypto analyst Pepesso recently issued a bullish forecast, suggesting that Bitcoin may have hit its bottom and could potentially start a recovery toward levels between $126,000 and $160,000. However, broader market indicators, such as the Fear and Greed Index, point to extreme fear, suggesting investors remain highly uncertain about BTC’s near-term outlook. Other analysts, like Gen Detector, have presented a more conservative outlook, predicting that Bitcoin could first stabilize around the $100,000 psychological level before its next bear wave begins. However, he has not ruled out the likelihood of further price corrections, highlighting the potential for BTC to revisit the $70,000 to $50,000 range before the next major bull run.

That stockpile includes addresses that expose public keys, which are the main target if quantum attacks become practical. Some analysts estimate roughly 6–7 million BTC sit in these vulnerable formats. Those holdings are already being watched by security experts. Bitcoin Uses Elliptic Curve Signatures Bitcoin’s current protection relies on ECDSA and Schnorr signatures. According to researchers and standards bodies, those schemes can be broken by Shor’s algorithm if a large enough quantum computer appears. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology has approved several quantum-resistant signature schemes, and Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 references post-quantum options. Adoption, however, requires wide agreement across the network. You allow the old coins to come back to market. Since there is no chance we come to consensus to freeze them, focus on the tech side of quantum safe wallets, and let the market sort out the rest. https://t.co/7xOZRVYl5r — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) November 23, 2025 Technical Timelines And Estimates Today’s quantum devices have about 1,000 physical qubits . Some researchers now say a specialized machine with roughly 126,000 physical qubits could break elliptic curve signatures. Others put the bar at around 2,300 logical qubits. These gaps matter because physical and logical qubits are not the same; heavy error correction is required to turn the former into the latter. Estimates place a workable attack window in the late 2020s or early 2030s, though timelines vary. Some scientists say a serious threat is unlikely for at least two to four decades, arguing the machines are unreliable and not close to practical use. Institutional Steps And Wary Firms Reports say some actors are already changing how they handle Bitcoin. El Salvador reportedly split its 6,284 BTC reserve across 14 addresses to lower risk. Major firms have listed quantum concerns in filings, and stablecoin operators have raised warnings about long-inactive wallets. i think a lot of confusion on quantum and btc is that everyone frames it as a tech problem, but what makes the problem specifically unique to btc is that the tech problem is secondary quantum resistant bitcoin will be feasible but it doesn’t solve what you do with the old coins — ceteris (@ceterispar1bus) November 23, 2025 Politics Could Decide The Outcome James Check argues the main danger is governance. He believes there is “no chance” the community will agree to freeze or forcibly migrate coins that owners do not move themselves. That political reality, he says, could leave millions of coins exposed even if technical fixes exist. Some developers and industry figures urge faster action; others believe the switch can wait until post-quantum standards are ready. The debate splits experts: some push for early migration plans, while others say the threat is distant and manageable. Based on reports and the numbers above, the picture is clear: the risk is real, the dates are uncertain, and the biggest obstacle may be human agreement rather than hardware.

Solana’s surge in asset-bridging inflows, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, and Monad’s public-sale-driven mainnet launch are reshaping how users and developers distribute their activity across major chains. The race now revolves around user acquisition, liquidity migration, and developer-facing infrastructure. Outset PR , a data-driven crypto PR agency, has been tracking a sharp escalation in Layer 1 competition. By leveraging market intelligence and on-chain data analysis, the agency decodes current trends, maps market sentiment, and guides the timing and narrative strategy for its clients. Solana extends its lead with user growth, asset inflows, and soaring volume Solana continues to post metrics that reinforce its status as the most active high-performance Layer 1. Monthly active users recently reached almost 45 million, up nearly 10 million from mid-October as per the data from Tokenterminal . The momentum coincides with accelerated asset migration: users bridge assets into Solana to access liquidity pools, consumer applications, and a rapidly expanding retail base. Over the last 30 days, Solana recorded $290 billion in trading volume — a figure fueled partly by the Firedancer client’s incremental rollout. Its architectural improvements reduce bottlenecks while preparing the network for future throughput expansion. These changes have strengthened confidence that Solana can support sustained high activity without relying on a single validator client. Bridging activity reflects the same pattern. Solana remains one of the top destinations for cross-chain inflows, consistently capturing multi-billion-dollar monthly volumes. Even in short-term trading windows, Solana’s relative strength stands out. In the last 24 hours, its volume-weighted performance exceeded the market by +1.31%, suggesting that liquidity continues to consolidate within its ecosystem Monad enters the arena with the mainnet launch One of the most anticipated entrants to the L1 competition is Monad, which has recently launched its mainnet following a public token sale. Monad’s value proposition focuses on parallel execution, full EVM compatibility, and an aggressive performance roadmap. The project claims high throughput while maintaining Ethereum tooling — a combination aimed at attracting developers who want speed without leaving familiar environments. Monad is launching into a market with rising liquidity concentration in top L1s, but its entry demonstrates that investors and builders still see room for new execution-layer competitors, provided their performance gains are tangible. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade: usability, validator flexibility and an 8× throughput boost Ethereum is responding to competitive pressure with its Pectra upgrade, rolled out earlier this year. Pectra improves account abstraction (via EIP-7702), increases validator effective balance limits, and enhances communication between the execution and consensus layers. It also expands blob throughput for rollups. The upgrade delivers a meaningful 8× increase in throughput capacity for rollups — strengthening Ethereum’s layered scaling strategy. Rather than competing directly with Solana on raw transaction speed, Ethereum is aiming to retain developers and consolidate the rollup ecosystem by improving the underlying execution and data-availability pathways. Layer 1 liquidity is consolidating, and the competition is escalating The broader trend across the market is consolidation. Liquidity and users are flowing from smaller chains toward a concentrated group of high-throughput networks and rollup ecosystems. Solana’s recent inflows illustrate the pattern, but Ethereum’s and Monad’s upgrades show that the contest remains open. The competitive dynamics now revolve around: User access — Solana’s 45M MAUs give it a strong gravitational pull. Developer tooling — Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap and Pectra’s account-abstraction improvements reinforce its ecosystem stickiness. Performance breakthroughs — Monad is testing whether new architectures can attract users in a market that increasingly rewards speed and compatibility. Liquidity migration — asset flows tell the story of where users believe applications will thrive. How Outset PR reads the competitive landscape Outset PR was founded on the idea that crypto stories should be grounded in market reality. The agency applies a market-fit, analytics-focused approach to PR by monitoring on-chain data and media trends daily. Founded by crypto PR expert Mike Ermolaev , the agency evaluates market developments the same way it evaluates campaigns — through measurable signals, not assumptions. Its work is built on: selecting media outlets based on discoverability, domain authority, conversion, and viral potential, tailoring each pitch to the outlet’s audience, timing publications to align with momentum, and using proprietary tools like Syndication Map to forecast where stories gain the strongest lift. As Layer 1 competition escalates, these same principles apply: understanding where attention, users and liquidity naturally flow — and aligning strategy with those movements. The takeaway With Solana, Ethereum and Monad all in focus, Layer 1s are absorbing liquidity from smaller chains. The trend is visible in user activity, volume concentration and bridging flows. At the same time, Solana still faces network congestion concerns and ongoing centralization debates, which remain part of the broader Layer 1 conversation.

54886044,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90666,1764093904,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert: XRP Price Will Shock Millions of People. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-xrp-price-will-shock-millions-of-people-heres-why/,"A growing sense of urgency surrounds XRP as discussions intensify about institutional entry, expiring agreements, and a possible shift in market structure. The broader crypto market often rewards patience, yet it can also punish hesitation. Many analysts argue that XRP is approaching a moment that could redefine expectations, especially as previously restricted information begins to surface. Ben Malena introduced the strongest catalyst in his recent video. He noted that Ripple’s confidential agreements are reportedly “expiring by the day,” suggesting that new corporate contracts are being released with increasing frequency. This development has renewed speculation about major institutions preparing to adopt Ripple’s technology at scale. THE #XRP PRICE IS GOING TO SHOCK MILLIONS OF PEOPLE #RIPPLE NDA’S EXPIRING BY THE DAY, CONTRACTS BEING RELEASED DAILY YOU HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO ACCUMULATE #XRP AT CHEAP PRICES! INSTITUTIONS WILL PRICE RETAIL OUT! pic.twitter.com/VjtMZdl7Sk — HighVibeAssets Ben Malena (@HighVibeAssets) November 25, 2025 The Role of NDA Expirations According to Malena, many of Ripple’s partnerships have remained hidden due to long-term non-disclosure agreements . He explained that his earlier research showed how “contracts being released daily” may signal a shift in transparency. While NDAs are standard in enterprise technology, their expiration could reveal the depth of Ripple’s global integrations. Malena stressed that these developments matter because retail investors had “plenty of time to accumulate XRP at cheap prices.” He suggested that institutional demand could soon absorb available liquidity. His argument implies a structural tightening that could elevate prices quickly. Why Analysts Measure XRP in Bitcoin Terms In the same discussion, Malena highlighted a critical historical observation. He said, “There were only two coins ever to have a new all-time high in Bitcoin terms.” He explained that XRP achieved a higher peak in 2017 than in 2013. He added that Dogecoin also reached such a peak during the 2021 rally. A second speaker reinforced this analytical approach. He urged traders to “stop measuring this coin in fiat and plug in Bitcoin.” He argued that true valuation strength appears only when assets are compared against BTC. He also suggested that many altcoin investors eventually become Bitcoin-focused because the comparison exposes weaker projects. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Positioning and Market Impact Growing institutional involvement strengthens the broader argument. Recent ETF launches , new liquidity corridors, and expanding enterprise payment integrations all point toward increased adoption. If institutions scale their positions, retail buyers may face higher entry prices. This dynamic supports Malena’s warning that “institutions will price retail out.” At the same time, the discussion reflects a shift in confidence. XRP continues to attract attention from payment companies, liquidity providers, and financial institutions seeking faster settlement solutions. These developments set the stage for a potential rerating of XRP’s long-term value. A Market on the Edge of Discovery XRP trades in a zone defined by anticipation and structural change. Traders expect that clarity around partnerships, utility, and institutional inflows could produce a sharp market reaction. If unreleased contracts confirm large-scale use of XRP for settlement, demand could accelerate quickly. Malena’s message remains clear. He believes XRP is positioned for a dramatic revaluation due to increasing transparency and rising institutional interest. His historical analysis and commentary on market structure offer a strong context for this view. Whether the price “shocks millions” depends on how quickly these catalysts materialize, yet the foundation behind the claim is gaining attention.

The banking giant plans to launch structured notes linked to IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, creating a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets that could transform how conservative investors approach cryptocurrency exposure. What Are These Structured Notes Linked to IBIT? JPMorgan’s new financial product represents a sophisticated approach to cryptocurrency investment. These structured notes linked to IBIT function as derivative-style instruments tied directly to the performance of BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to SEC filings, the notes feature two primary scenarios with distinct payout structures that cater to different market conditions and investor preferences. The innovative design includes an auto-call option that activates after one year and a final maturity date set for 2028. This dual-timeframe approach provides multiple opportunities for investors to realize returns while managing risk exposure in the volatile cryptocurrency market. How Do the Returns and Protection Work? The structured notes linked to IBIT offer compelling features that balance potential rewards with risk management: 16% minimum fixed return if IBIT exceeds specified price levels after one year Principal protection against declines up to 30% in IBIT’s value Capped maximum returns to balance risk-reward profile Loss exposure only if IBIT falls more than 30% from initial levels This structure particularly benefits investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside while maintaining downside protection. The auto-call feature after one year provides an early exit opportunity with guaranteed returns under favorable conditions. Why Are Structured Notes Linked to IBIT Important for Crypto Adoption? JPMorgan’s move signals growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency assets through regulated vehicles. By creating structured notes linked to IBIT, the bank provides traditional investors with a familiar investment wrapper for Bitcoin exposure. This approach eliminates the technical complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership while offering professional risk management. The timing coincides with increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock’s IBIT accumulating significant assets since its January 2024 launch. These structured notes linked to IBIT represent the next evolution in cryptocurrency financial products, bridging the gap between conventional structured products and digital asset innovation. What Should Investors Consider Before Investing? While the structured notes linked to IBIT offer attractive features, investors should understand several key considerations: Return caps limit upside potential during major Bitcoin rallies Credit risk exposure to JPMorgan as the issuer Liquidity constraints compared to direct ETF investments Complex payout structure requires thorough understanding Potential investors should carefully review the prospectus and consult financial advisors to ensure these structured notes linked to IBIT align with their investment objectives and risk tolerance. The Future of Cryptocurrency Structured Products JPMorgan’s pioneering move with structured notes linked to IBIT likely represents just the beginning of cryptocurrency-linked structured products. Other major financial institutions will probably follow suit, creating competitive offerings with varying terms and conditions. This development marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency’s journey toward full financial market integration. As regulatory frameworks evolve and investor comfort grows, we can expect more sophisticated products bridging traditional finance and digital assets. The success of these initial structured notes linked to IBIT will influence how quickly other institutions enter this emerging market segment. Frequently Asked Questions What happens if IBIT increases significantly in value? Returns are capped, meaning investors won’t participate fully in extreme upside movements beyond predetermined levels. How does the principal protection work? The notes protect against the first 30% decline in IBIT’s value. Only losses beyond this threshold affect the principal. Can I sell these notes before maturity? Secondary market liquidity may be limited. The auto-call feature after one year provides the first potential exit opportunity. What are the tax implications? Structured notes typically generate ordinary income rather than capital gains, but investors should consult tax professionals. How does this differ from buying IBIT directly? These notes offer principal protection and guaranteed minimum returns, unlike direct ETF ownership which has unlimited upside but full downside risk. Is JPMorgan the first bank to offer such products? While other banks have explored cryptocurrency products, JPMorgan’s structured notes linked to IBIT represent among the most sophisticated offerings from a major traditional bank.

Analysts now anticipate a potential recovery window between $96,000 and $99,000, with weak investors exiting the market and liquidity, rather than narratives, beginning to drive the next big move. Indices Point to Bear Fatigue as Price Lags Fair Value On-chain researcher Axel Adler Jr. reported on Tuesday that the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Structure Index has been lodged in negative territory since November 11, indicating sustained selling pressure. However, a short-term reversal is now in motion, with the metric improving from a deeply negative -43% to around -20%. This, according to the analyst, points to a clear reduction in bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Futures Flow Index is still stuck in a bearish zone near 41, which is still below the 45–55 band Adler associates with a more neutral or bullish backdrop. According to him, until that level is cleared, “upward momentum is unlikely.” Adding to that, the current fair-value line is sitting near $99,000 and has left a visible $11,000 gap to spot, framing a recovery target between $96,000 and $99,000 if sentiment improves. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades also offered proof that pressure may indeed be easing, pointing out that the Coinbase premium, which had been deeply negative for weeks, moved back toward neutral over the weekend after heavy selling hit a local bottom last Friday. Nonetheless, short-term structure remains fragile, with Titan of Crypto identifying $88,700 as the first level bulls need to reclaim. Meanwhile, analyst Ed_NL highlighted a “red box” resistance zone near $93,500 that could either cap a three-leg bounce before new lows or form the base for a fifth wave higher if buyers regain control. Recent Price Movement Looking at the market, Bitcoin was up slightly at the time of writing, gaining a modest 1% in the last 24 hours. However, it remains in the red across all other timeframes, dipping nearly 5% over seven days and 18% across two weeks. Additionally, it has lost 23% of its value this past month and is currently sitting about 30% below its all-time high of over $126,000, reached in October. The recent downturn has been characterized by a distinct “institutional redistribution,” where the largest whale cohorts, specifically those holding between 1,000 and 10,000+ BTC, have been consistent net sellers, taking profits and creating a persistent headwind for any significant rally. At the same time, data from Santiment shows the number of wallets holding 100 BTC or more has increased by 0.47% since November 11, adding 91 new wallets to this tier. This shows accumulation is happening, but primarily in the mid-sized whale category of 10 to 1,000 BTC holders, rather than the very largest.

This surge in activity coincided with renewed headlines about exchange-traded products and viral posts regarding licensing and banking claims. Reuters has reported on structural steps that could expand crypto ETFs in the U.S., and on corporate efforts linked to XRP exposure that keep the asset in the institutional conversation. According to LunarCrush, the mix of product talk and regulatory speculation continues to shape the narrative in real time. Source: LunarCrush.com XRP ETF Launches Driving Social Spike XRP-linked ETFs are now trading in the United States, which ties liquidity, distribution, and perceived legitimacy to live products rather than rumors.

The mix of large sponsors and niche issuers provides market watchers with several key indicators to track, which helps sustain attention even when price action is choppy. These listings land after the SEC’s generic listing standards shortened timelines for commodity-based exchange-traded products, which encouraged issuers to expand beyond BTC and ETH. With XRP funds now live, the narrative shifts from whether a launch will happen to how much demand appears through creations and secondary volume, a framing that tends to keep sentiment engaged even when positioning is cautious. Product Headlines, Institutional Reads, And Sentiment Gaps When new funds come out, institutional adoption becomes an explicit part of the conversation because allocations, creations, and inventory moves are observable rather than speculative. That visibility supports higher mentions and engagements on days when issuer announcements, tickers, and TV segments align, yet composite scores can lag because not every datapoint points the same way, and price action still carries weight in the crowd’s read. This gap between activity and conviction tends to widen when official filings and launch notices sit next to unverified claims about banking status, payment rails, or standards integration.

The plan will start in 2026, when crews begin building new federal‑grade data centers with 1.3 gigawatts of power. That is the kind of load you normally see from hundreds of thousands of American homes, not a single project. Amazon said the point is simple: the government wants stronger AI tools, and the company is preparing to deliver them through AWS. The company said federal teams will get AWS AI tools, Anthropic’s Claude models, Nvidia chips, and Amazon’s Trainium processors. These will run inside cloud regions designed to meet strict federal rules. Every part of this build sits inside a wider race among tech giants to secure long‑term contracts tied to AI systems. Amazon expands government AI push with new federal infrastructure Amazon said its move lines up with what others are already doing. Anthropic and Meta announced new AI data centers in the U.S. earlier this year. Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank launched their Stargate joint venture in January, a plan built around a $500 billion U.S. infrastructure spend spread out over four years. AWS said the new federal sites will let agencies build custom AI systems and clean up datasets while also helping teams “enhance workforce productivity,” a phrase the company used in its announcement. Amazon said AWS already supports more than 11,000 government agencies, and that this investment is designed to increase that capacity. AWS CEO Matt Garman said the $50 billion plan “removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” Matt said it was about meeting the demand that federal agencies keep bringing forward, especially as the Trump administration pushes for stronger domestic AI systems. Analysts have said Amazon leads cloud services overall, but has lost ground in AI‑driven cloud growth as Google and Oracle move faster. Jacob Bourne, an analyst at Emarketer, said large infrastructure commitments are now required if Amazon wants to compete at the scale the AI market demands. Jacob said the company’s decision lines up with the direction of the federal technology market under Trump. AWS said the move fits the White House AI Action Plan, which the Trump team kept as part of its domestic AI strategy. The company also noted prior milestones in its government cloud work. It launched GovCloud (US‑West) in 2011 for federal security rules. In 2014, it put out the first air‑gapped commercial cloud for classified workloads. In 2017, it became the first provider cleared to run regions for unclassified, secret, and top‑secret data. Amazon said this new investment builds on those steps and expands what agencies can run inside AWS. Amazon builds new Indiana campuses as AI spending explodes Amazon raised its capital spending forecast in October, saying it now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025, up from $118 billion. This came as tech firms like OpenAI, Alphabet, and Microsoft kept raising their own spending on compute needed for large AI models. Everyone in the market is buying hardware at levels nobody even talked about five years ago, and nobody is slowing down. Amazon said Monday it is also putting $15 billion into new data center campuses in Indiana, adding to the $11 billion it announced last year in St. Joseph County. These new sites will bring 2.4 gigawatts of capacity and use the same architecture used in Project Rainier, which Amazon describes as the world’s biggest AI supercomputer. Amazon said the Indiana plan will create more than 1,100 technical jobs in areas like operations, networking, engineering, and security. The company added that the expansion will support thousands of supply‑chain roles, including construction workers, electricians, and fiber‑installation teams. The company said the federal build, the Indiana sites, and the overall capital push are all tied to the same demand: government agencies want more compute, and Amazon wants to be the one selling it during Trump’s second term.

According to the latest X post, the New York Department of Financial Services has granted the fintech company a Limited Purpose Trust Charter. With this certification, MoonPay can now run a compliant MoonPay Trust Company in New York. The announcement reads: MoonPay is now authorized by NYDFS to operate MoonPay Trust Company in New York. This expanded regulatory footprint unlocks digital asset custody and OTC trading for our financial infrastructure. MoonPay 🟣 @moonpay · Follow 🗽 MoonPay is now authorized by NYDFS to operate MoonPay Trust Company in New York!🍎 this expanded regulatory footprint unlocks digital asset custody and OTC trading for our financial infrastructure🚀 NY BitLicense + Trust Charter = a new era of compliant innovation 6:05 PM · Nov 25, 2025 433 Reply Copy link Read 157 replies NYDFS approval is crucial in MoonPay’s vision to dominate the crypto-institutions sector. With over-the-counter trading and crypto custody, the firm can work with family offices, hedge funds, and wealth investors interested in compliant networks. MoonPay enriches institutional crypto offerings The regulatory move reflects MoonPay’s dedication to offering top-notch institutional-level crypto services. OTC trading and custody are witnessing robust demand as businesses and large-scale investors seek a streamlined way to invest in digital tokens. Reputable companies have showcased massive interest in virtual assets this year, with products like crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and treasury witnessing notable interest. Instead of pursuing the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a federal charter, MoonPay went for state-level compliance. Why is the NYDFS approval critical? New York is among the toughest regions for cryptocurrency businesses. The BitLicense, launched a decade ago, in 2015, introduced high standards of security, reporting, and operating in New York. Furthermore, the Limited Purpose Trust Charter allows financial firms to operate at levels of traditional banks. Thus, MoonPay’s dual compliance standing reflects its dedication to compliance, institutional preparedness, and transparency. These perks can distinguish it from rivals as regulators tighten the grip. Meanwhile, MoonPay is among the few cryptocurrency companies granted a BitLicense and a Trust Charter in New York. Commenting on the development, Crypto America host and former Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret said: MoonPay now holds both a BitLicense and a Limited Purpose Trust Charter, a combo that only a handful of crypto firms (Coinbase, PayPal, Ripple, and NYDIG) have been able to secure under NY’s strict licensing regime.

This mix of technical progress and market turbulence highlights the volatility even in established projects. As investors look for more reliable growth opportunities, projects like GeeFi are gaining attention. GeeFi offers a complete, secure ecosystem designed for real-world utility and long-term value, making it a compelling alternative for savvy investors. Many analysts believe its token, GEE, could be the next 100x gem . Avalanche’s Upgrade Struggles and the GeeFi Solution Despite the promising Granite upgrade, which aims to deliver faster block times and biometric-style approvals, Avalanche’s price remains in a persistent downtrend, struggling to hold key support at the $13–$14 zone . This shows that even significant technological improvements aren’t enough to overcome bearish market sentiment. Investors are left wondering if the next upgrade will be enough to spark a real recovery. GeeFi solves this by building its value on a foundation of tangible, everyday use cases rather than promises of future performance. Its ecosystem is designed to be a self-sustaining financial platform that works right now. This focus on real-world utility provides a stable base for growth, independent of market hype cycles. For investors tired of the “buy the news, sell the event” pattern, GeeFi offers a refreshing and reliable alternative. Your Path to a Potential 40x Return: The GeeFi Presale The most legendary stories in crypto often begin with investors who saw a project’s potential before anyone else. The GeeFi presale is one of those rare ground-floor opportunities. While established coins like AVAX face an uphill battle, GeeFi provides a clear path to substantial growth. Many industry experts are pointing to GEE as the next 100x gem . The native GEE token operates on a deflationary model , meaning its total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens is designed to shrink as the platform grows, creating scarcity that can boost long-term value. With the project having all the potential to become the next $2 project , a $1,000 investment at the current presale price of just $0.05 could turn into an incredible $40,000 . The presale has already seen explosive success, selling over 6.1 million tokens and raising $300,000 almost immediately, reaching 50% of its Phase 1 target with remarkable speed. You can also earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens by sharing your referral link. Take Full Control with the GeeFi Wallet At the heart of the GeeFi ecosystem is the GeeFi Wallet , a powerful tool designed to give you absolute control over your digital wealth. It is a non-custodial wallet , which means you, and only you, hold the private keys to your funds. This is the ultimate security feature in a volatile market, ensuring no exchange or third party can ever freeze your assets or deny you access. The GeeFi Wallet is also built for the modern, multi-chain crypto user. It provides seamless support for over 14 different networks , including Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This allows you to manage all of your investments in one secure, user-friendly application. The wallet is available now on Android , with an iOS version coming soon. An Ecosystem for Real-World Use The GeeFi Team has been developing a comprehensive financial platform since 2023 , with its public launch in 2024 . Their vision extends far beyond just a wallet. The roadmap includes the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange for secure and direct asset trading, and the GeeFi Card , which will let you spend your crypto as easily as cash. This commitment to continuous development of practical tools proves GeeFi is building a durable platform designed to thrive, offering a reliable path forward while other projects simply follow market trends.

The central question now circulating through trading floors and digital-asset circles is: if his prediction plays out, what would it mean for Bitcoin’s strategic outlook ? Why Kiyosaki Believes A Major Global Crash Is Approaching In a post on X, Kiyosaki said the economic collapse he predicted over a decade ago in Rich Dad’s Prophecy is now unfolding. He pointed to simultaneous weakness across the United States, Europe, and Asia as clear evidence that the downturn is spreading globally. A major factor he highlighted is the impact of artificial intelligence on employment, which he believes could accelerate job losses across multiple sectors. According to him, these growing job losses will create additional pressure on both office and residential real estate markets, further deepening the financial strain on workers, businesses, and property markets. Within this backdrop, Kiyosaki outlined the assets he believes are particularly important to hold during such a historic downturn. He stated that he intends to buy more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. While he positioned silver as the safest and most undervalued asset, predicting it could hit $70 in the near term and possibly $200 by 2026, he also made it clear that Bitcoin remains a strategic part of his crisis playbook and long-term financial strategy. His repeated endorsement of Bitcoin—despite forecasting one of the most severe market declines in modern history—underscores that he views it as a strategic hedge aligned with the structural weaknesses of the current economy. He frames the crash as a wealth-transfer moment that could reward investors who are prepared and positioned with both digital assets and tangible, income-generating investments. How Bitcoin Fits Into His Broader Wealth Strategy While Kiyosaki briefly mentioned a recent sale of some of his Bitcoin in another X post, he clarified two key points relevant to understanding his broader positioning on Bitcoin. First, the sale was not an exit from Bitcoin; he remains bullish and intends to continue buying more . Second, the move reflects his long-standing playbook—using gains from one asset class to build or acquire cash-flow–generating businesses. With this move, Kiyosaki demonstrates how Bitcoin fits into his system: an asset he accumulates during downturns, leverages during upcycles , and reintegrates into his portfolio to drive recurring income. By emphasizing both the severity of the crash and the continued relevance of Bitcoin in his strategy, Kiyosaki positioned the asset as part of the solution rather than part of the problem.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-25 19:00:17

However, beneath the surface, the original meme coin faces significant challenges that leave its future uncertain. While DOGE investors ride a wave of hype, many are looking for a more stable and rewarding alternative. A new project, GeeFi , is stepping into the spotlight with a utility-driven ecosystem that analysts are calling the next potential 100x gem . Dogecoin’s Hype Problem vs. GeeFi’s Utility Dogecoin’s biggest weakness is its reliance on external hype and speculation. Its price is heavily influenced by Elon Musk’s announcements and the whims of large “whale” investors. On-chain data reveals that large holders have been selling off billions of tokens, creating immense selling pressure that suppresses any real upward momentum. Technical indicators show weak buying interest, and the recent ETF launch failed to create a sustained rally. This dependence on outside factors makes DOGE a risky and unpredictable investment. GeeFi offers a clear solution by focusing on building a self-sustaining, valuable ecosystem. Instead of relying on hype, GeeFi delivers real utility and puts you in control with a non-custodial wallet . Its growth is driven by features that provide tangible benefits. A prime example is its upcoming staking feature, which will offer an impressive APR of up to 55% . This provides a steady and predictable income stream, making GeeFi a far more dependable investment for long-term growth. The Presale Opportunity You Don’t Want to Miss While Dogecoin’s future hangs in the balance, the GeeFi Token (GEE) presale is showing incredible strength. The project has already sold over 6.1 million tokens and raised more than $300,000 , blowing past 50% of its Phase 1 target . This proves that smart investors are moving away from hype-driven coins and toward projects with solid fundamentals and massive upside. This is a critical moment to get involved. GeeFi has all the ingredients to become the next $3 project , which could turn a $1,000 investment today into $60,000 . The GEE token is currently priced at just $0.05 , but this price is only available for a limited time. The price will increase in the next phase, so securing your tokens now guarantees the lowest possible entry point for the highest potential returns. A Central Hub for All Your Crypto Needs GeeFi is building a platform to simplify and unify the entire crypto experience. The GeeFi HUB will serve as a single, intuitive dashboard for managing all your digital assets. This HUB will be connected to the GeeFi DEX , a decentralized exchange engineered for fast, secure, and low-cost trading across a wide range of blockchains. The GeeFi DEX is being developed to eliminate the high fees and confusing interfaces that are common on other platforms. From the HUB, you will be able to monitor your portfolio, manage your digital collectibles, and trade with total confidence. It is a complete, all-in-one solution built for the modern crypto user. An Ecosystem Designed for Long-Term Growth The foundation of the GeeFi platform is its powerful wallet. The GeeFi Wallet is already live for Android devices, and an iOS version is on the way. It supports more than 14 networks , giving you one secure place to manage your entire crypto portfolio. The GeeFi Team has been developing this platform since 2023 , with a proven track record of delivering on its promises and building for the long term. GeeFi is also rewarding its community for helping it grow. The project’s referral program gives you a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your personal link. While Dogecoin continues to be a gamble, GeeFi is building real value and rewarding its supporters, positioning itself as what many believe could be the next 100x gem .

Related Reading: Bitcoin Creator Somehow Becomes ‘Poor’ By Losing $41 Billion Without Saying A Word The complaint lists 306 American plaintiffs who say they were killed, injured, or taken hostage and are demanding damages. Dormant Accounts Draw Scrutiny According to the filing, the plaintiffs allege Binance helped move more than $1 billion for Hamas and other US-designated groups over several years. They claim that more than $50 million passed through the platform after the October 7, 2023 assault. These figures sit at the center of the case and could shape the request for compensatory and treble damages. The complaint also highlights unusual account activity that lawyers say should have triggered alarms. One example involves an account tied to a Venezuelan woman linked to a Brazilian livestock business. Binance Holdings faces a lawsuit claiming the cryptocurrency platform “knowingly facilitated” crypto transactions by Hamas before the group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. https://t.co/B3rO7bAjN6 — The Japan Times (@japantimes) November 25, 2025 Reports say the account received over $177 million in deposits after opening in 2022 and later sent out more than $130 million in withdrawals. Attorneys argue that movements of this size should have been examined more closely. Large Sums And Strange Flows Based on reports, the plaintiffs argue that Binance’s controls were weak or ignored, allowing questionable transfers to move across borders. The lawsuit lists alleged links to Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Lawyers claim the platform became a tool for shifting money while avoiding standard financial checks. Binance has said it complies with international sanctions laws and has denied having any special ties to terrorist groups. Its legal history forms part of the background: in late 2023, the company pleaded guilty in a major federal case and paid a $4.32 billion penalty tied to anti-money-laundering and sanctions violations. That earlier case, along with Zhao’s four-month prison sentence, is referenced in the new complaint.

The complaint was filed in federal court in North Dakota and is separate from another case in Manhattan that is already moving through the court system. The filing also recalls that Zhao’s prison sentence was later followed by a pardon from US President Donald Trump, something the plaintiffs point to as part of the exchange’s complicated legal path. They argue this new lawsuit is necessary to push for accountability after years of what they see as weak controls.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-inflows-are-exploding-heres-the-latest/,"XRP has entered a new phase of institutional attention. Market activity has intensified following multiple XRP ETF launches , and inflows are rising at an unusual pace. Investors are watching closely as demand accelerates across several newly launched products. Recent data highlighted by Xaif on X shows a dramatic spike in capital rotation into XRP exchange-traded funds. His figures reveal daily net inflows of about $164 million and total ETF assets exceeding $628 million. These numbers confirm a rapid shift in institutional behavior toward XRP exposure. Surging ETF Demand The arrival of multiple spot XRP ETFs has changed market dynamics. Each product is attracting steady inflows from institutional buyers seeking regulated access to XRP. Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital now anchor this expanding landscape. Their combined activity has created strong demand within a short time. Several analysts note that these inflows exceeded early expectations. The funds have gained traction faster than comparable products launched in past cycles. This speed suggests rising interest from funds, trading desks, and yield-driven allocators. Their participation is increasing the depth and strengthening price discovery. XRP ETF INFLOWS ARE EXPLODING! Massive $164M daily net inflow and total net assets soaring to $628M+ $XRP demand is going vertical. This isn’t normal growth… This is institutional FOMO kicking in. https://t.co/RcQJdjSzmI pic.twitter.com/EyoTyDcY57 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 25, 2025 Drivers Behind the Inflow Boom Multiple factors explain the rapid acceleration. Regulatory clarity has removed major barriers to institutional participation. Issuers now operate within a more predictable environment. This stability has allowed larger players to commit fresh capital with greater confidence. The ETF structure itself encourages heavy inflows. Physically backed designs require direct XRP purchases during creation cycles. This mechanism reduces available supply and increases market pressure during periods of positive inflow. Competitive fees across issuers have also encouraged broader adoption. Marketing efforts by the institutions have amplified the trend. Each issuer continues to promote its product to clients seeking exposure without direct custody. This outreach has accelerated inflow velocity and broadened the investor base. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional FOMO Takes Hold Institutional FOMO is now visible in flow behavior. Large investors often react when early inflows exceed expectations. This reaction creates a feedback loop that attracts additional buyers. The XRP market is experiencing this pattern in real time. Market depth has improved as inflows rise. Trading activity has increased, and liquidity has expanded across several exchanges. These developments support stronger price stability during buying cycles. They also attract quant funds searching for deep and predictable markets. Market Implications and Forward Outlook The inflow surge has immediate consequences for XRP. Reduced free float can amplify price reactions when new capital enters the market. Analysts caution that inflows may remain volatile during the early stages. However, current trends show expanding interest from institutional buyers. The long-term trajectory depends on sustained demand. Steady inflows would strengthen XRP’s position within regulated markets. They would also support broader adoption among asset managers pursuing diversified crypto exposure. Continued issuer competition may further accelerate growth. In conclusion, XRP ETFs are gaining momentum at an impressive rate. Xaif’s figures capture the scale of the shift now unfolding. Institutional demand is rising quickly and reshaping expectations around XRP’s market role. If inflows remain strong, XRP could enter a new phase of institutional engagement with lasting impact.

Recent data reveals a startling trend: the November Bitcoin sell-off wasn’t evenly distributed across global markets. Instead, it concentrated overwhelmingly during US trading sessions, creating unique opportunities and risks for investors worldwide. Why Did the Bitcoin Sell-off Hit Hardest During US Hours? The November Bitcoin sell-off presented a clear geographical pattern that caught many traders by surprise. According to CoinDesk analysis, Bitcoin fell approximately 30% specifically during US market sessions. Meanwhile, Asian and European trading hours showed remarkable stability with only minor declines. This timing pattern suggests that US market participants drove the majority of selling pressure. Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com, explains this phenomenon clearly. Bitcoin maintains a strong correlation with US technology stocks , he notes. Both asset classes share crucial characteristics that make them react similarly to market conditions. What Connects Bitcoin to US Market Dynamics? The relationship between Bitcoin and traditional US markets runs deeper than many investors realize. Several key factors explain why the Bitcoin sell-off concentrated during American trading hours: Risk asset classification : Both Bitcoin and tech stocks fall into the risk-on category Monetary policy sensitivity : US Federal Reserve decisions impact both markets significantly Retail investor participation : High leverage usage among US retail traders amplifies movements Institutional timing : Major US funds and institutions trade primarily during their market hours This interconnectedness means that when US investors react to economic news or policy changes, the Bitcoin sell-off often follows similar patterns to technology stocks. The November data perfectly illustrates this relationship in action. How Can Traders Use This Timing Knowledge? Understanding the concentration of the Bitcoin sell-off during specific hours provides valuable insights for global traders. The pattern suggests that risk management strategies should account for time-based volatility. Asian and European traders might consider adjusting their positions before US market open, while US traders should monitor domestic economic developments more closely. The consistent correlation with tech stocks also offers hedging opportunities. When technology shares show weakness during US hours, traders might anticipate similar pressure on Bitcoin. Conversely, strength in tech could signal potential Bitcoin support. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Performance? The November Bitcoin sell-off pattern highlights the cryptocurrency’s evolving market structure. As institutional participation grows, these timing patterns may become even more pronounced. However, the relationship also demonstrates Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class that responds to traditional market forces. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key indicators that could influence future Bitcoin sell-off events: US Federal Reserve interest rate decisions Technology stock performance, particularly the NASDAQ US economic data releases during trading hours Retail trading volume and leverage ratios Key Takeaways from November’s Market Movement The concentrated Bitcoin sell-off during US trading hours teaches us valuable lessons about market dynamics. First, geographical trading patterns matter significantly for cryptocurrency investors. Second, the strong correlation with traditional risk assets continues to shape Bitcoin’s price action. Finally, understanding these relationships can help traders develop more effective timing strategies. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, monitoring these patterns becomes increasingly important. The November Bitcoin sell-off serves as a powerful reminder that global markets don’t move uniformly, and smart investors can use these disparities to their advantage. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin fall more during US trading hours? Bitcoin fell more during US hours due to its strong correlation with US technology stocks and higher participation from US-based retail investors using leverage. Both assets react similarly to US monetary policy changes. How much did Bitcoin drop during November’s sell-off? Bitcoin experienced approximately a 30% decline specifically during US trading sessions, while Asian and European hours showed much smaller movements. Does Bitcoin always follow US market patterns? While not absolute, Bitcoin has shown consistent correlation with US technology stocks, particularly during periods of significant market movement and policy changes. Can traders use this timing pattern for advantage? Yes, understanding these patterns helps global traders anticipate volatility and manage risk more effectively by accounting for time-based market behavior. Will this trading pattern continue in the future? As institutional participation grows, these patterns may become more pronounced, though market evolution could also introduce new dynamics over time. What other factors influence Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks? Key factors include monetary policy outlook, risk appetite among investors, leverage usage, and institutional trading activity during specific market hours. Found this analysis helpful?

The company said its tech is still a full generation ahead, and it made sure to say it with a straight face. Nvidia also reminded everyone that it continues supplying Google, even as talk grew that Meta might test Google’s tensor processing units for its data centers. Nvidia’s stock fell 3% earlier in the day after that Meta report came out, but the company used its X post to calm markets and smack back at the idea that its lead was slipping. Nvidia insisted its platform “runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done,” and said its Blackwell chips stay more flexible and powerful than Google’s ASIC-based TPUs, which only work for specific tasks inside one company. Nvidia hits back with Blackwell advantages Nvidia said its chips offer “greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,” and it pointed out that its graphics processors now control more than 90% of the AI chip market, based on analyst data. Google’s in-house TPUs have gained more attention lately, mostly because Blackwell chips are pricey, but Nvidia stressed that these custom chips are limited to Google’s own systems. Google does not sell TPUs to outside buyers. It only uses them internally or rents them to customers on Google Cloud. Google has tried to show the strength of its line by releasing Gemini 3 earlier this month. The model was trained fully on TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. A Google spokesperson said demand is rising for both its custom TPUs and for Nvidia’s GPUs, adding, “We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also stepped in during an earnings call this month. He said Google continues to buy Nvidia’s GPUs and confirmed that Gemini can also run on Nvidia hardware. Jensen said he has been in touch with Demis Hassabis, the DeepMind chief, who texted him that the industry’s “scaling laws” remain “intact.” Scaling laws are the idea that larger data loads and more chips produce stronger AI models. Nvidia believes these laws will push demand even higher for its own chips and full systems across the industry. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

It is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker VBNB. If approved, VBNB will offer institutional and retail investors new access to the fifth-largest crypto coin by market cap, directly through traditional brokerage accounts. According to the amended S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC, the fund will maintain physical custody of BNB, avoiding cash-settled derivatives or futures contracts.

Still, Vaneck has left an open chance. VanEck stated that if staking is conducted in the future, it will be done through a third-party staking service provider, and investors will be notified in advance. The trust is not regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Therefore, it carries higher investment risks, which may result in total loss. VanEck is a major global ETF provider and has a track record of pioneering crypto-based investment vehicles. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the firm already operates several spot and futures-based crypto ETFs, including those tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana in the US and Europe. This filing lands just as NYSE Arca approved DOGE and XRP spot ETFs. Both began trading on Monday. Altcoin ETFs are clearly moving into the mainstream. Now all eyes turn to the SEC’s next move and whether VBNB becomes the ETF that finally brings BNB into the US institutional spotlight. US spot altcoin exchange-traded funds record daily inflows US spot altcoin exchange-traded funds continue to see daily inflows amid a broader crypto market selloff that has pushed overall sentiment into fearful territory. Spot Solana ETFs have attracted $843.81 million in total net assets since their launch, noting $57.99 million in inflows on Monday. Bitwise’s BSOL led the day with $39.5 million, marking its third-largest daily inflow since going live and the most impressive since November 3. Similarly, spot XRP ETFs have raised $628.82 million, attracting a whopping $164.04 million in inflows on the same day. Both Grayscale and Franklin Templeton ETF products pulled over $60 million each. On the other side, Grayscale launched the first spot Dogecoin ETF (GDOG) . Its opening day saw zero net flows, though trading volume hit $1.41 million. Now, markets are closely watching to see whether DOGE can achieve the same level of consistency as Solana or XRP. Meanwhile, Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that trading volume for the DOGE-based fund could reach $11m. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows of $151.1 million on Monday. Spot Ethereum ETFs attracted net inflows of $96.6 million, but still underperformed against the XRP ETFs. BNB steadies on Tuesday alongside other crypto coins BNB has seen a small surge in the last 24 Hours. According to on-chain data, the coin is up 0.86%, shifting position to a new trend line in a fresh rally in the crypto market on Tuesday. Top crypto coins performance.

BTC is steady at 0.39% decline, Ethereum is up 2.9%, XRP is up 2,7%, and Solana is also up 2.4%. These gains have developed amidst US Fed rate cut expectations, a new catalyst to drive sharp bargain hunting.

Market analysts point to several factors that could be influencing this downturn. However, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and price corrections are not uncommon in the digital asset space. Key factors potentially affecting the current Bitcoin price include: Market sentiment shifts among institutional investors Technical resistance levels being tested Broader economic indicators influencing risk appetite Regulatory developments in major markets How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Movement? While any drop in the Bitcoin price below key psychological levels creates concern, it’s important to maintain perspective. The cryptocurrency market has experienced much larger fluctuations throughout its history. Therefore, experienced traders often view these movements as natural market corrections rather than long-term trend reversals. The current Bitcoin price of $86,969.5 represents a meaningful decline, but market fundamentals remain strong for many analysts. Moreover, the underlying technology and adoption trends continue to show positive development, which could support recovery in the longer term. What Should Investors Do About the Bitcoin Price Drop? When the Bitcoin price experiences volatility, investors face important decisions. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this market condition: Stay informed about market developments and technical analysis Diversify your portfolio to manage risk exposure Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Set clear investment goals and risk management strategies Remember that the Bitcoin price has historically recovered from similar corrections. Many long-term investors actually view these dips as potential buying opportunities, though individual circumstances vary. Looking Beyond the Current Bitcoin Price The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains intact despite short-term price movements. The network continues to process transactions securely, institutional adoption grows steadily, and technological improvements continue to enhance the ecosystem. Consequently, many experts suggest focusing on long-term trends rather than daily price fluctuations. As we monitor the Bitcoin price development, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency investing requires patience and risk management. The market’s history shows that periods of consolidation often precede new growth phases. Frequently Asked Questions How low could the Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, technical analysts watch key support levels around $85,000 and $82,000 as potential floors for the current correction. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some traders see price dips as buying opportunities, but investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. What’s causing the Bitcoin price volatility? Multiple factors contribute, including market sentiment, trading volume, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory news. How long might this Bitcoin price correction last? Cryptocurrency corrections can last from days to weeks, depending on market conditions and catalyst developments. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this drop? Investment decisions should be based on your strategy rather than emotional reactions to price movements. What indicators should I watch for Bitcoin price recovery? Key indicators include trading volume increases, positive funding rates, and breaking above resistance levels. Share Your Thoughts Found this analysis helpful?

Sales dropped to 6,964 units in October, crashing 48.5% from the same time last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). That’s the company’s 10th straight monthly decline in the region. And while Tesla stumbled, the rest of the EV market sprinted ahead. Total electric vehicle registrations across Europe (covering the UK and the European Free Trade Association) jumped by 32.9%. Even total car registrations across all types went up by 4.9%. EVs now hold a 16.4% share of Europe’s auto market. Tesla? Just 1.6%, down from 2.4% a year ago. The newer Model Y couldn’t reverse the trend. Neither could the hype. Blame it on surging Chinese competition or on Elon Musk’s fading reputation across European markets. Whatever it is, Tesla’s not winning here anymore. Chinese rivals take the wheel as Tesla slumps Year-to-date numbers make it worse. In the first 10 months of 2025, Tesla sold 180,688 units, which is a 29.6% fall from last year. That’s a lot of metal missing from European roads. Meanwhile, China’s BYD exploded into the scene with a 207% sales surge, hitting 17,470 units sold in Europe. Another Chinese brand, SAIC, wasn’t far behind, clocking in nearly 24,000 vehicles, up 46% year-on-year. Tesla’s dominance is slipping hard, and its rivals aren’t slowing down. Despite all this, the stock didn’t care. On Monday, Tesla shares jumped nearly 7%. Why? Because Wall Street’s not buying it for the cars. It’s about the software, the AI, and the dream of autonomy. Melius Research called Tesla a “must own,” not because of sales charts, but because it thinks self-driving is coming soon. Analyst Rob Wertheimer wrote: “One of the reasons we called Tesla a ‘must own’ in our recent launch — despite all the obvious risks — is that the world is about to change, dramatically. Autonomy is coming very soon, and it will change everything about the driving ecosystem.” The latest version of Tesla’s full self-driving software (FSD) is out in the US and a few other areas. But it’s still not available in Europe. That might change in February, though. The Dutch RDW automotive regulator confirmed Tesla has a slot to demonstrate FSD next year. It hasn’t been approved yet. But if it passes, it could be a major shift for Tesla’s European play. That one greenlight could help stop the bleeding. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Its price has climbed by double digits within the timeframe, currently trading at roughly $1.53. According to some analysts, the rally might be just starting. What’s Next? One of the well-known market observers to touch upon SUI’s performance as of late is the X user Ali Martinez. He claimed the asset has reached a key support trendline that has held since 2023. He noted that the previous two tests of that zone triggered massive pumps of 450% and 750%, suggesting that if history repeats, the valuation could soon skyrocket above $4. Michael van de Poppe also chipped in. He predicted that SUI will outperform many cryptocurrencies in the near future, “as people tend to go back to the ones that have been performing over the past few years.” He pointed out the recent launch of Grayscale’s Sui Trust, arguing that the current condition could be “an ultimate opportunity” for investors to increase their exposure to the asset. SUI’s exchange netflow supports the bullish theory. In the last few weeks, outflows have dominated over inflows, meaning some investors have moved their holdings from centralized platforms to self-custody solutions. This, in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure. SUI Exchange Netflow, Source: CoinGlass Jump Above $2? X user CryptoBullet infused additional optimism by claiming that SUI has recently reached its most oversold level on the 3-day and 1-day charts since 2023. The analyst thinks this could be a precursor of a bounce to the $1.90-$2.20 range. According to CryptoWaves, SUI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 30 on a daily scale, which aligns with the aforementioned analysis. The metric measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price movements to give traders an idea of whether the asset is about to have a reversal moment. Ratios below 30 signal that SUI is oversold and could be due for a rally, whereas anything above 70 is interpreted as bearish territory.

Texas Leverages BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Market expert MartyParty disclosed on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that this investment was executed on November 25, 2025, through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This strategic move positions Texas as a trailblazer in state-level cryptocurrency adoption, reflecting a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and as a vehicle for financial innovation. The initiative is rooted in legislative actions encapsulated in Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), known as the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act. Signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott on June 20, 2025, this bill was sponsored by State Senator Charles Schwertner and garnered bipartisan support, passing the Senate with a vote of 25-5 in March and the House with a 101-42 vote in May. Setting A Precedent Ahead Of Arizona And New Hampshire MartyParty noted that the allocation of $10 million represents a mere 0.0004% of Texas’s biennial budget, which totals approximately $338 billion. Importantly, this investment establishes a standalone reserve managed independently by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, thereby shielding it from routine fiscal sweeps. This reserve is designed to hold Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies that have a market cap exceeding $500 billion. Additionally, Texas residents will have the option to donate Bitcoin to further enhance this reserve. The execution of this purchase marks the first instance of taxpayer-funded state acquisition of Bitcoin. MaryParty highlighted states like Arizona and New Hampshire, which have passed similar authorization bills. However, they have yet to commit public funds into such digital asset treasuries. As of press time, the leading cryptocurrency was trading at $86,930, down roughly 3% over the last 24 hours.

The deal is structured as investment-grade asset-backed financing and is expected to yield $10.5 million annually to Valereum at a 5.25% coupon rate. Valereum unveils $100M funding deal According to an official report from the company, the partnership has seen the involved parties, Valereum and Valereum QGP-SP, agree to a $200 million investment partnership. The partnership will not only strengthen Valereum’s liquidity and balance sheet but also turbocharge growth and expedite the pursuit of a NASDAQ/NYSE listing targeting H1 2026. While Valereum Plc is to receive $200 million of investment-grade asset-backed financing, Valereum QGP-SP will receive a one-year option to acquire up to 49.9% of Valereum Plc, proportionate to the size and structure of capital committed. The funding is expected to be used for various endeavors, including strengthening Valereum’s capital position, advancing its next-gen digital market infrastructure, building out its digital asset treasury (DAT), which will let the company strategically accumulate and manage digital assets, and enabling the pursuit of new acquisitions and partnerships to accelerate commercial development and diversify revenue streams. The deal is also expected to broaden the company’s commercial footprint and unlock additional revenue opportunities while advancing its planned U.S. National Exchange listing to enhance global investor access and market visibility. Gary Cottle, Group CEO of Valereum, talked about the funding plans: “This unprecedented agreement reflects the level of institutional confidence in our strategy of uniting traditional finance with regulated digital markets. It gives us access to major capital that will drive expansion, innovation, and growth across our entire ecosystem.” DATs are at a critical point Valereum’s $200 million funding seems to be specifically earmarked for a DAT strategy. However, there is heavy scrutiny on corporate treasury players. Saylor’s Strategy , the poster child of the DAT model, is under serious attack from index providers like MSCI and analysts at JPMorgan who say Strategy could see billions of dollars leave its stock if MSCI removes it from major equity indices, an outcome that could leave Strategy a wreck while rendering the DAT model obscure. The analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlighted in a report how Strategy’s share price has fallen more than Bitcoin in recent months as its valuation premium has been sharply compressed. However, according to them, the more recent drop in the share price is most likely the result of growing concern about the company being dropped from key benchmark indices. As things stand, Strategy is included in major indices such as the Nasdaq-100, MSCI USA, and MSCI World. According to JPMorgan analysts , roughly $9 billion of its $50 billion market value sits in passive funds that track these indices. Its inclusion in those indices has effectively helped Bitcoin exposure seep into both retail and institutional portfolios via passive investment vehicles; however, if removed from those indices, analysts say the flow would reverse. “If MicroStrategy is excluded from these indices, it could face considerable pressure on its valuation given that passive index-tracking funds represent a substantial share of its ownership,” the analysts wrote. “Outflows could amount to $2.8 billion if MicroStrategy gets excluded from MSCI indices and $8.8 billion from all other equity indices if other index providers choose to follow MSCI.” MSCI’s decision will be made on January 15, 2026, and analysts believe the date will be “pivotal” for the MSTR stock. Talk of Strategy getting excluded began last month when MSCI revealed it is consulting on a proposal to exclude companies whose primary activity is Bitcoin or other digital asset treasury management if those holdings represent 50% or more of total assets. The announcement was made quietly on October 10, and now many users have linked it to the crash of BTC’s price from the October highs that had the price in the $120,000 range. Even now, some analysts are claiming it is all a coordinated attack on Strategy, the poster child of the DAT business model.

These powerful tools are set to revolutionize how consumers research and purchase products, but the question remains: can specialized AI shopping startups survive against these industry titans? How AI Shopping Assistants Are Changing E-commerce OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Perplexity AI have introduced remarkably similar shopping features just in time for the holiday rush. ChatGPT now helps users find specific products like gaming laptops under $1000 or identify affordable alternatives to high-end fashion items through image recognition. Meanwhile, Perplexity leverages its chatbot’s memory to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and location data. Why OpenAI ChatGPT Dominates General Shopping Queries OpenAI’s massive user base gives it an immediate advantage in the AI shopping assistants market. With millions already using ChatGPT daily, the platform can seamlessly integrate shopping functionality without requiring users to adopt new tools. Their partnership with Shopify enables direct checkout within conversations, creating a frictionless shopping experience that could challenge traditional e-commerce models. Perplexity AI’s Unique Approach to Personalized Shopping Unlike traditional search engines, Perplexity AI focuses on contextual understanding and memory retention. The platform’s shopping assistant remembers user preferences, location, and past interactions to deliver highly tailored product recommendations. This personalized approach positions Perplexity as a serious contender in the AI shopping assistants space, particularly for users seeking curated shopping experiences. The Unbeatable Advantage of Specialized E-commerce AI Despite the tech giants’ entry, specialized startups like Onton, Daydream, and Phia maintain significant advantages in their respective niches. According to Zach Hudson, CEO of interior design tool Onton, “Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources. Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google.” Why Shopping Startups Remain Confident Against Giants Specialized AI shopping startups have developed proprietary datasets that outperform general-purpose tools in specific domains. Julie Bornstein, CEO of Daydream, emphasizes that “fashion is uniquely nuanced and emotional – finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television.” These startups invest in domain-specific data and merchandising logic that understands silhouettes, fabrics, and how people build outfits over time.

54890407,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=867582,1764100800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54890407.jpeg,"How to Turn $12,500 into $1,000,000 with RentStac (RNS)",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-turn-12500-into-1000000-with-rentstac-rns/,"Crypto investors are always searching for the next breakthrough. RentStac (RNS) positions itself at the intersection of blockchain and real estate, offering a presale entry point that combines discounted token pricing with layered rewards. Presale Structure and Rewards Unlike a simple fixed bonus, RentStac’s presale features a multi‑layer reward model . Investors can benefit from discounted token prices, referral bonuses, milestone giveaways, and even entry into cash prize pools worth up to $200,000. This structure allows early participants to maximize their allocation before the token lists on exchanges. The Millionaire Target The long‑term vision is clear: reaching $1 per RNS token. This target is supported by the project’s property‑backed model, buyback and burn mechanisms to increase scarcity, and a roadmap focused on liquidity and visibility over the next 12 months. The Math Behind the Investment To build a $1,000,000 position, an investor needs 1,000,000 RNS tokens. At the current presale price of $0.025 per token, $1,000 secures 40,000 RNS. With layered rewards and bonuses, allocations can increase further depending on participation in referral programs or milestone promotions. Scaling up, an investment of around $12,500 could secure the million‑token target, positioning investors for seven‑figure potential if RNS reaches $1. Why Timing Matters Presale phases are progressive: token prices rise with each stage, while rewards and bonuses evolve. Acting early locks in the lowest entry price and the most generous reward opportunities. Waiting means paying more per token and missing out on limited‑time incentives. Real Estate Meets Blockchain Each RNS token is backed by real estate assets structured through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Investors avoid the burdens of direct property ownership, no tenants, no maintenance, no paperwork. Professional teams manage operations, while investors track positions via the RentStac dashboard. Returns come from both token appreciation and rental cash flows, which fund buybacks, burns, and staking pools that distribute monthly rental income in USDC. Security and Roadmap RentStac emphasizes safety. Smart contracts have already been audited with strong results, and an additional audit by CertiK is underway. The roadmap highlights rapid property acquisition, strengthening rental income streams, and listings on major exchanges to boost liquidity. Each milestone achieved supports demand growth and pushes the project closer to its $1 target. The Investment Formula Presale price: $0.025 per RNS. Reward system: multi‑layer bonuses, referrals, and prize pools. Key investment: ~$12,500 for 1,000,000 RNS. Target price: $1 per RNS. Potential value: $1,000,000.

Fear continues to spread across investors, and liquidity conditions are tightening, putting additional weight on assets that previously demonstrated strength. Related Reading: Bitmine Scoops Up Another 28,625 Ethereum ($82.1M) as Market Bleeds – Details One of the clearest signs of stress now comes from Binance data — the largest trading platform by volume — showing that XRP Open Interest has dropped to its lowest level since November 2024. This decline highlights a significant shift in trader positioning, signaling that speculative appetite is drying up and leverage is being unwound across the market. According to the latest derivatives metrics, XRP is entering a critical phase marked by weakening sentiment and a steady loss of momentum. The sharp contraction in Open Interest reflects reduced participation from both long and short traders, suggesting that the market currently lacks conviction to support a sustained directional move. This shift comes at a time when XRP had previously been attempting to stabilize above key psychological levels, but continued selling pressure has prevented a clean rebound. XRP Derivatives Show Liquidity Drain and Bearish Control A CryptoQuant report from Arab Chain reveals a sharp deterioration in XRP derivatives conditions, highlighting growing stress across the market. Open Interest on Binance has fallen dramatically from record highs above $1.7 billion to nearly $504 million, and briefly down to $473 million. This steep contraction reflects a major outflow of liquidity from both long and short positions, signaling that traders no longer have the conviction needed to sustain a clear directional trend. The decline in OI aligns closely with XRP’s price drop to $2, after trading above the $2.5–$3 range in recent weeks. This correlation suggests that traders are not reopening positions after being flushed out, leaving the market driven by short-term flows rather than sustained accumulation. Funding rates reinforce this weakness. Over the past two months, funding has frequently turned negative, showing that short sellers are willing to pay to maintain their positions. Negative funding typically indicates that selling pressure outweighs buying demand, increasing the probability of continued downside unless fresh liquidity enters the market. Taken together — collapsing Open Interest, persistent negative funding, and declining price action — the data paints a picture of deep fragility. There are no visible signs of meaningful accumulation from whales or institutions, and without a reversal in derivatives behavior, XRP remains firmly under seller control.

After failing to hold above the $2.50–$2.70 range, price broke down sharply and recently tagged lows near $1.90 before attempting a modest rebound. The rejection from the 50-day and 100-day moving averages shows that sellers remain firmly in control, with both moving averages now sloping downward — a sign of sustained bearish momentum. Additionally, XRP remains below the 200-day moving average, reinforcing the broader downside bias and signaling that the market has not yet regained long-term support.

Each recovery attempt has been met with resistance, forming lower highs and lower lows — a classic bearish continuation pattern. To shift sentiment, XRP would need to reclaim the $2.40 level and consolidate above it; otherwise, the risk of retesting $1.90 or even falling toward $1.70 remains elevated.

Analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex revealed in a weekly report that the record marked the fourth consecutive weekly decline for the leading digital asset. According to Bitfinex, the last time BTC recorded four straight weeks of negative returns was during the lengthy consolidation phase between March and October 2024. However, at the time, the peak-to-trough plunge was roughly 24.1%. This time, BTC has fallen 30.6% over the past four weeks. BTC Corrective Phase Continues Last week, BTC recorded a peak-to-trough decline of 16%, closing the 7-day period with an 8.65% plunge. The correction has extended the drawdown from its all-time high to 36%, highlighting the ongoing decline as the largest in this cycle, both in percentage and in the scale of long liquidations. Amid the drawdown, short-term holders (those holding BTC for 155 days or less) are capitulating. This investor cohort is seeing an acceleration in selling at a loss, with BTC falling below the lower band of their cost-basis model. The seven-day Exponential Moving Average of short-term holder realised losses has risen to $523 million per day. This is the highest level recorded since the collapse of the defunct crypto exchange FTX. Currently, there is a high level of distress among recent BTC buyers. They have been forced to exit their positions amid mounting unrealized losses. This level of loss realization shows how top-heavy the market became before the ongoing correction – the BTC supply between $106,000 and $118,000 was far denser than in previous cycle peaks. November to End on Negative Note The current downturn is so severe that the market has recorded unprecedented liquidation activity. The $19.2 billion liquidation event of October 10 is the largest seen in a single day in history. The market saw an additional $3.9 billion in liquidations last week, underscoring the pressure on leveraged traders across the derivatives sector. Meanwhile, the market is on track to end November on negative terms. This month has historically yielded an average return of 40.8% and a median of over 8.2% since 2013. If the bears persist, then November will follow October, which closed in the red for the first time in seven years.

54890269,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90672,1764101102,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Will Shock the World. Here’s Fresh Bull Signal,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-will-shock-the-world-heres-fresh-bull-signal/,"The crypto community rarely sees a chart setup that demands immediate attention. Yet a recent analysis suggests XRP could enter a price trajectory few expect —and many will wonder whether it’s realistic or reckless. Technical Foundations of the Bull Case In a recent X post, analyst (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho, known as @Cryptobilbuwoo0, presents a bullish thesis using long-term logarithmic channel structure, ascending trend lines, and a 1.618 Fibonacci extension. According to the post, that combination points to a potential target of $26.60, if XRP repeats a fractal-like pattern that echoes its 2017 ascent. The analysis argues that recent price behavior aligns with those major structural components. Same Structure & Same Build-up. $XRP will shock the world. https://t.co/tj1CE4TtSm pic.twitter.com/YkVWhtHN8Q — (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho (@Cryptobilbuwoo0) November 25, 2025 As of report time, XRP trades at $2.18, reflecting a modest recovery but still far from the projected extension level. The recent surge of about 7 percent has reignited momentum and drawn renewed attention to the long-term channel framework. Fractal Echoes and Historical Comparison The core of the bullish scenario hinges on a fractal resemblance to XRP’s 2017 cycle. Fractal analysis finds structural symmetry in channel slope, swing behavior, and retracement levels that mirror earlier price runs. This repeating pattern forms the backbone of the $26.60 target. Some crypto outlets have previously flagged fractal signals. For instance, a rising-channel outlook recently projected XRP toward $6–$7 if certain support holds. That shorter-term fractal doesn’t carry the same magnitude as the 1.618 extension, but it supports a variant of the broader rising-trend thesis. Empirical Evidence and Strategy Validity While chart patterns like those described by @Cryptobilbuwoo0 can be compelling, academic and empirical research offers more caution. Momentum-based strategies in crypto have shown some success, but their reliability varies by cycle. Peer-reviewed studies and working papers analyze time-series momentum and neural-enhanced strategies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These studies demonstrate that momentum can generate positive Sharpe ratios, but also that performance drops sharply after regime shifts or rapid reversals. Overly aggressive extrapolation of past fractals may obscure the risk of market regime change. Risks, Timeframes, and Real-World Constraints A Fibonacci extension to $26.60 is a long-term projection , not a near-term certitude. To reach that level, XRP would likely require sustained bullish volume, macro tailwinds, and consistent risk-on sentiment. A retest of lower structural supports remains a credible alternative path. Without disciplined risk management, traders chasing such lofty targets risk overextending. Furthermore, this call assumes that past fractal patterns replicate nearly perfectly. Markets do not repeat in exact loops; they only rhyme. Institutional adoption, regulatory shifts, and liquidity dynamics could derail or accelerate any such move. In conclusion, the analysis from (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho (@Cryptobilbuwoo0) represents one of the boldest XRP bullish scenarios to date. By combining ascending channels, Fibonacci extensions, and fractal symmetry, it paints a case for multi-year, multi-digit gains. However, empirical research on momentum strategies moderates that enthusiasm. Reaching $26.60 would require flawless execution, favorable macro conditions, and a deep, sustained trend. For now, it stands as a powerful scenario signal—not a simple forecast certainty. Investors should weigh it among other scenarios, size positions wisely, and remain alert to regime risk.

This deal represents a pivotal moment for artists, technology innovators, and the future of music creation in the digital age. Warner Music Embraces AI Music Innovation Warner Music Group’s strategic partnership with Suno marks a significant departure from the music industry’s previously adversarial stance toward AI music technology. The agreement, announced on Tuesday, not only resolves the copyright infringement lawsuit but establishes a framework for collaborative innovation. According to WMG’s press release, this partnership will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.” Suno’s AI Music Technology Gets Industry Validation The settlement comes with substantial benefits for Suno’s AI music platform. As part of the agreement, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models next year, replacing its current offerings. The partnership also includes WMG selling Songkick, the live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition positions Suno to expand beyond music creation into the broader music ecosystem. Key Changes to Suno’s Service: Advanced licensed models launching in 2026 Audio downloads restricted to paid accounts Free tier users limited to playing and sharing songs Songkick integration for enhanced fan experiences Copyright Lawsuit Settlement Sets Industry Precedent This settlement follows a similar resolution between Warner Music and another AI music startup, Udio, just one week earlier. Both cases originated from lawsuits filed last year by Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. The consecutive settlements suggest a broader industry trend toward licensing rather than litigation when dealing with AI music technology. Company Lawsuit Status Partnership Details Warner Music Settled Full licensing agreement with Suno Universal Music In negotiations Reportedly discussing licensing Sony Music In negotiations Reportedly discussing licensing Music Industry Transformation Through AI Partnerships The Warner Music-Suno deal represents a fundamental shift in how major record labels approach disruptive technology. Rather than fighting innovation, WMG has chosen to shape it from within. WMG CEO Robert Kyncl emphasized this strategic approach, stating: “This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone. With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.” Artist Protections in the AI Era: Full control over name, image, and likeness usage Voice protection and composition rights Approval rights for AI-generated music featuring their work Compensation frameworks for AI-assisted creations Investment Surge in AI Music Technology The timing of this settlement coincides with significant investor confidence in AI music technology. Last week, Suno announced a massive $250 million Series C funding round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix Partners. This substantial investment underscores the market’s belief in the long-term viability of AI music platforms. What This Means for Artists and Consumers For Warner Music artists including Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, and Sabrina Carpenter, this agreement provides crucial protections while opening new creative and revenue opportunities. Artists will maintain control over how their identities and work are used in AI-generated music, addressing one of the industry’s primary concerns about artificial intelligence. For music consumers, the partnership promises more sophisticated AI music tools with proper licensing and artist compensation. The integration of Songkick’s concert discovery capabilities suggests a more holistic approach to music engagement, connecting AI creation with live music experiences. FAQs: Warner Music and Suno Partnership What companies were involved in the lawsuit? The copyright lawsuit involved Warner Music Group , Universal Music Group , and Sony Music Entertainment against AI startups Suno and Udio . Who is the CEO of Warner Music Group? Robert Kyncl serves as the CEO of Warner Music Group and was instrumental in negotiating the Suno partnership. What artists are represented by Warner Music? Warner Music represents major artists including Lady Gaga , Coldplay , The Weeknd , and Sabrina Carpenter , all of whom are covered by the new AI protections. What is Songkick and who acquired it? Songkick is a live music and concert-discovery platform that Warner Music acquired in 2017 and has now sold to Suno as part of their partnership agreement. Conclusion: A New Era for Music and AI The Warner Music-Suno settlement represents a transformative moment for the music industry. By choosing collaboration over confrontation, WMG has established a blueprint for how traditional entertainment companies can work with AI innovators while protecting artist rights. This partnership not only resolves legal conflicts but creates a foundation for responsible AI music development that benefits creators, technology companies, and music fans alike. As the industry continues to evolve, this agreement will likely serve as a model for future partnerships between legacy media companies and AI startups.
