While Cardano is struggling with bear market conditions and is trading well below most of its key moving averages, Mutuum Finance is flourishing; raising over $18.9 million, supported by over 18,140 unique community holders. The presale is in the final stages of phase 6, and the price of the tokens is $0.035. The price is scheduled to increase, making it a great consideration by anyone looking to invest in an asset with great flexibility. The unique revenue earning mechanism coupled with the precious tokens makes this cheap crypto a great consideration for anyone looking to invest, positioning the token as one of the most flexible to enter the market. Cardano’s Problems Show Change in the Market Cardano (ADA) is still in a noticeable downtrend. More technical indicators show ADA is still making lower highs and losing momentum. The asset is still below the 20-day and 50-day moving average lines. The RSI is still in the bearish low range. This shows ADA is losing strength. Even though some long-term estimates predict a recovery to $1.01 by 2026, higher price points have strong resistance around the $0.48 to $0.53 range. Players are beginning to invest in multiple opportunity projects in the market. The market is showing great interest in what crypto to invest in and the best opportunity is in presale projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to the lower entry price and new narratives. Last Chance To Buy Mutuum Finance Presale in Phase 6 Unlike the large caps’ price stagnancy, the presale of Mutuum Finance is the last chance to get these tokens cheap, as they are currently priced at $0.035. The project is currently at the end of their Phase 6 presale and has raised $18.9 million with 18,140+ holders. As with any presale, the later phases sell out very quickly, and in Phase 6, over 95% of the tokens have been already bought by the presale investors. Phase 6 is about to sell out completely and will be the last time investors have the chance to buy these tokens at this price. After sellout, more tokens will become available in Phase 7, priced at $0.040, further increasing the importance of this Phase 6 closing window. For anyone interested in the best cryptos to buy right now, this is their last chance to invest in a well-developed protocol and is a clear front-runner considering the potential the protocol has. Buy-and-Distribute Stablecoin Sustainable Value In addition to the presale success, Mutuum Finance is designing a model centered around their stablecoin. The network is deploying a buy-and-distribute strategy, where ecosystem activity is tied to the token’s value. A portion of all protocol fee revenue is directed toward the purchase of MUTM tokens off the open market. Tokens that are bought are redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens, the interest-earning liquidity receipts. This forms a cycle where the focus on platform usage creates fee revenue which drives buy pressure on the MUTM token and distributes rewards to stakers. The model is a fundamental growth driver that provides the project a reputation as one of the best cryptos to invest in for users seeking real value and flexibility in tokenomics, deflationary pressure, and no speculatory hype. Get Ready for Upcoming Success In terms of the almost finished presale stage and self-sustaining economic structures in place, Mutuum Finance is in the position for a good trajectory after listing. While Cardano is still busy with some technical issues, MUTM is gaining momentum and getting closer to the mainnet launch. The remaining tokens in Phase 6 is the last chance to get these tokens at the lowest price. This is a no-brainer for investors that are analyzing which new crypto to buy. The new crypto has an ecosystem that is planned to grow, and the tokens will appreciate with it. The price point on these tokens will go up, and if buying now is not on your to-do list, you will be unfortunately missing out on a chance to be an early investor in an impressive new asset that will level up the DeFi marketplace.

54865320,633456,1764032406,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Regains Strength With a $2,800 Rebound, Will BitMine’s $59M Bet Break the Downtrend?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-regains-strength-rebound-will-bitmines-59m/,"Ethereum (ETH) is showing early signs of stabilization after a turbulent month, bouncing back above the crucial $2,800 level as fresh institutional inflows reignite optimism across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Quantum-Break Catastrophe Is Pure FUD, Says Gabor Gurbacs ETH currently trades near $2,821, up modestly over the past 24 hours, with traders closely watching to see whether this rebound can evolve into a sustained trend reversal. The renewed momentum follows major accumulation from BitMine, which has doubled down on its Ethereum strategy despite steep market drawdowns. BitMine’s $59M ETH Accumulation Sparks Fresh Investor Confidence The catalyst for Ethereum’s latest recovery came on November 23, when blockchain data confirmed that BitMine acquired 21,537 ETH worth roughly $59–60 million. The purchase increases the company’s total holdings to more than 3.5 million ETH, equivalent to approximately 3% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. While Ethereum prices have fallen nearly 30% in the last month, BitMine maintains that the downturn stems from a temporary liquidity shock rather than deteriorating fundamentals. Bitmine is simultaneously expanding its ecosystem footprint through its upcoming MAVAN staking network, expected to launch in early 2026, and recently announced a dividend issuance, moves that collectively signal long-term conviction. Investors appear to be taking notice. Exchange reserves have dipped to multi-year lows as whales continue accumulating ETH, even as traditional ETF products face outflows. This divergence suggests deep-pocketed players view the current range as a strategic entry zone. Ethereum Battles the Downtrend but Momentum Improves Despite the bounce, Ethereum remains inside a steep descending channel, with resistance stacking between $2,947 and $3,000. This zone contains compressed EMAs, trendline resistance, and the upper Bollinger Band, making it the first major test for buyers. A clean break above $3,000 could pave the way for ETH to reach $3,120, $3,250, and potentially even $3,450. However, a failure at this level may send ETH back toward $2,760 or lower. Indicators remain mixed. The RSI near 40 signals oversold conditions, hinting that a reversal may be developing, while the MACD and moving averages still indicate lingering bearish pressure. Rising open interest and elevated long-short ratios across exchanges reflect aggressive long positioning, momentum that could amplify volatility in either direction. Institutional Products and Upgrades Add Momentum Beyond price action, Ethereum continues to gain structural support. The Singapore Exchange just launched regulated ETH perpetual futures, giving institutions a compliant on-ramp. Meanwhile, anticipation builds around Ethereum’s December Fusaka upgrade , expected to deliver meaningful scalability improvements. With whales accumulating, institutional demand rising, and network upgrades approaching, Ethereum’s rebound above $2,800 may be more than a dead-cat bounce.

Many analysts are leaning toward calling the start of a new bear market, arguing that Bitcoin likely topped in early October near $126,000. Momentum has weakened sharply since then, and investor behavior now reflects a shift toward risk-off positioning. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse A new report from CryptoOnchain, published via CryptoQuant, highlights one of the most significant developments of this cycle: a historic 63,000 BTC has moved from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs). This unprecedented transfer is clearly visible in the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change chart, which shows a massive red bar — a negative daily difference signaling heavy outflows from long-term holder wallets. This type of behavior typically appears during late-stage bull markets or near local and cycle tops, when long-time investors with substantial profit margins begin realizing gains. At the same time, the corresponding Short-Term Holder Net Position Change chart shows a huge green bar, confirming that newer, more reactive market participants are buying these coins, often at elevated prices. Long-Term Holders Distribute as Short-Term Buyers Absorb Supply CryptoOnchain explains that the current market structure is being shaped by a clear divergence in behavior between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). LTHs — historically considered the “strong hands” of the market — are now heavily distributing, sending large amounts of Bitcoin into the market after months or even years of holding. At the same time, STHs are aggressively buying and accumulating this supply, often entering positions at elevated prices despite growing volatility. This dynamic is not inherently a bearish signal on its own. In fact, such transitions are common during late-stage bull markets, where early investors secure profits while new participants enter the market with fresh capital. It reflects a natural rotation of supply from experienced holders to newer ones, a pattern seen repeatedly in previous cycles. However, the volume of distribution is significant, and it raises an important risk: if incoming demand fails to fully absorb the coins being offloaded by LTHs, the market could face a deeper correction or extended consolidation phase. This supply pressure can weigh on price, especially in a context where sentiment is fragile and macro conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle Weekly Chart Signals a Critical Retest of Macro Support Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize around the $87,000 level after an intense multi-week sell-off that dragged price as low as $85,946. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has now tapped the 100-week moving average (green line), a historically important support level during bull-market retracements. This line acted as a springboard in previous cycles, but the current bounce remains weak and indecisive, reflecting the fear dominating the market. Momentum has clearly shifted bearish. The breakdown from the $110K–$100K consolidation zone triggered accelerated selling, confirming a loss of market structure on the weekly timeframe. Candles over the past three weeks show high-volume distribution, with sellers overwhelming demand each time Bitcoin attempted to reclaim higher levels. The steep slope of the 50-week MA turning slightly down is another sign that trend strength has softened. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details However, the reaction at the 100-week MA is critical. Bulls aggressively defended this area in prior macro corrections, and holding above $83K–$86K keeps the long-term bull structure intact. A weekly close below this zone, however, opens the door to deeper downside toward the 200-week MA near $56K–$60K.

This bold move comes just weeks after the same trader secured a substantial $2.8 million profit from previous Ethereum positions, signaling strong belief in ETH’s future performance. What Does This Massive Leveraged ETH Long Mean? The trader deposited 10 million USDC into Hyperliquid early this morning, immediately opening a $44.15 million long position on Ethereum with 5x leverage. This leveraged ETH long represents one of the most significant single-position bets we’ve seen recently from experienced cryptocurrency investors. The use of leverage amplifies both potential gains and risks, showing the trader’s conviction in Ethereum’s upward trajectory. Why Are Experienced Traders Bullish on Ethereum? This isn’t the first time this Bitcoin OG has shown confidence in Ethereum. The same address previously closed an entire long position of 55,133 ETH on November 11, realizing an impressive $2.8 million profit. Now, the return with another substantial leveraged ETH long suggests several key factors: Strong technical analysis supporting upward momentum Positive fundamental developments in the Ethereum ecosystem Market conditions favoring altcoin performance Institutional growing interest in Ethereum Understanding the Risks of Leveraged Positions While this leveraged ETH long position demonstrates confidence, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved. With 5x leverage, the trader faces amplified losses if the market moves against their position. However, experienced traders like this Bitcoin OG typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies including: Stop-loss orders to limit potential losses Careful position sizing relative to portfolio value Continuous market monitoring and adjustment Diversification across multiple assets What This Leveraged ETH Long Signals for the Market The timing of this leveraged ETH long position is particularly noteworthy. Coming after a successful previous trade, it suggests the trader sees continued upside potential in Ethereum. This move could influence other market participants and potentially signal: Growing institutional confidence in Ethereum Anticipation of positive market developments Technical breakout patterns forming Increased altcoin season momentum Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This substantial leveraged ETH long from an experienced Bitcoin OG provides valuable insights for all cryptocurrency investors.

Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, recently dropped a bombshell that’s shaking the crypto community. He declared that while artificial intelligence has clear, tangible use cases, cryptocurrency struggles to demonstrate real-world utility. This bold statement raises crucial questions about the future of digital assets and their place in our economy. What Are the Real Cryptocurrency Use Cases According to Critics? Kashkari’s criticism centers on one fundamental question: What problems does cryptocurrency actually solve? Unlike AI, which is transforming industries from healthcare to transportation, critics argue that cryptocurrency use cases remain largely theoretical. They point to several key areas where crypto has failed to gain mainstream traction. However, this perspective ignores the growing adoption in specific sectors and among certain demographics. The debate around cryptocurrency use cases isn’t new, but it’s gaining fresh urgency as regulatory scrutiny increases. Proponents counter that real-world applications do exist, including: Cross-border payments and remittances Decentralized finance platforms Digital ownership through NFTs Financial inclusion in developing nations How Does AI Demonstrate More Concrete Utility? Artificial intelligence presents a stark contrast to cryptocurrency when examining practical applications. AI systems are already embedded in our daily lives through virtual assistants, recommendation algorithms, and automated customer service. More importantly, businesses can clearly measure AI’s impact on efficiency, cost reduction, and innovation. The transparency of AI benefits makes it easier for policymakers like Kashkari to endorse. From medical diagnostics to supply chain optimization, AI delivers measurable results that cryptocurrency use cases often struggle to demonstrate at scale. This tangible value proposition gives AI a significant advantage in gaining institutional acceptance. What Challenges Do Cryptocurrency Use Cases Face? Several fundamental obstacles hinder wider adoption of cryptocurrency use cases. Regulatory uncertainty remains the elephant in the room, with governments worldwide grappling with how to oversee digital assets. Additionally, technical complexity and volatility create barriers for average users who simply want reliable financial tools. Security concerns also plague cryptocurrency use cases, with high-profile hacks and scams damaging public trust. Meanwhile, scalability issues continue to challenge many blockchain networks, limiting their ability to handle transaction volumes comparable to traditional payment systems. These practical hurdles make it difficult for skeptics like Kashkari to see cryptocurrency as anything beyond speculative assets. Where Are Cryptocurrency Use Cases Actually Succeeding? Despite the criticism, evidence of successful cryptocurrency use cases continues to emerge. In countries experiencing hyperinflation or capital controls, digital assets provide lifelines for preserving wealth and conducting international trade. The gaming industry has embraced blockchain technology for in-game assets, while content creators use crypto platforms for direct monetization. Moreover, institutional adoption is gradually increasing, with major companies exploring blockchain for supply chain management and settlement systems. These developments suggest that cryptocurrency use cases may be evolving rather than absent. The key question becomes whether these applications will achieve the scale and stability needed to convince mainstream skeptics. What Does the Future Hold for Cryptocurrency Utility? The path forward for cryptocurrency use cases likely involves greater integration with traditional finance and clearer regulatory frameworks. As the technology matures, we may see more hybrid solutions that combine blockchain efficiency with conventional financial security. The emergence of central bank digital currencies could also force innovation in the private cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, the success of cryptocurrency use cases will depend on solving real problems for real people. Whether it’s reducing remittance costs, enabling financial inclusion, or creating new digital economies, crypto must demonstrate value beyond price speculation. The conversation started by Kashkari serves as an important reality check for the entire industry. The debate around cryptocurrency use cases versus AI utility reflects broader questions about technological adoption and value creation. While Kashkari’s comments highlight legitimate concerns, they also ignore the gradual progress happening beneath the surface. The truth likely lies somewhere between the extremes – cryptocurrency may not yet match AI’s obvious utility, but dismissing its potential entirely would be premature. As with any emerging technology, the most meaningful applications often take time to develop and recognize. Frequently Asked Questions What specific cryptocurrency use cases did Kashkari criticize? While Kashkari didn’t specify individual use cases, his comments suggest he sees cryptocurrency primarily as speculative assets rather than practical tools for solving real-world problems. How does AI demonstrate more tangible benefits than cryptocurrency? AI shows measurable improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and problem-solving across multiple industries, making its value proposition clearer to policymakers and businesses. Are there any legitimate cryptocurrency use cases gaining traction? Yes, cross-border payments, decentralized finance, and digital ownership applications are seeing growing adoption, though not yet at mainstream scale. What would help cryptocurrency develop stronger use cases? Clearer regulations, improved scalability, better user experience, and demonstrated solutions to actual consumer problems would significantly advance cryptocurrency utility. Could cryptocurrency and AI work together in the future? Absolutely. Many experts believe blockchain and AI could complement each other, with crypto providing secure data exchange and AI offering advanced analytics capabilities. How do other Federal Reserve officials view cryptocurrency? Opinions vary among Fed officials, with some expressing cautious optimism about innovation while others share Kashkari’s skepticism about current utility.

This dramatic fluctuation highlights the volatility that can occur even with stablecoins designed to maintain consistent value. What Caused the USDC Price Spike on Bithumb? The USDC price spike occurred at approximately 1:08 a.m. UTC, when the stablecoin’s value surged to 6,120 won (about $4.43) on the South Korean exchange. This represents more than four times its typical trading value. Market analysts suggest several potential causes for this unusual USDC price movement: Technical glitches in trading algorithms Large mistaken market orders Liquidity issues during low-volume trading hours Potential manipulation attempts Fortunately, the USDC price spike was temporary, and the stablecoin quickly returned to its normal trading range near 1,503 won ($1.09). How Do Stablecoins Maintain Their Peg? Stablecoins like USDC are designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, making this USDC price spike particularly unusual. These digital assets achieve price stability through: Asset backing : Each USDC is backed by real US dollar reserves Redemption mechanisms : Users can always redeem USDC for $1 Market arbitrage : Traders profit from price discrepancies When a USDC price spike occurs, arbitrage traders quickly step in to sell at the higher price and buy back at the normal rate, effectively correcting the imbalance. Why Should Traders Monitor These Events? While the USDC price spike was brief, it offers valuable lessons for cryptocurrency investors. Such events demonstrate that even stable assets can experience temporary volatility. Traders should: Set limit orders to avoid buying at inflated prices Monitor multiple exchanges for price discrepancies Understand the redemption mechanisms for stablecoins Keep emergency sell orders ready for unusual price movements The rapid correction following this USDC price spike shows that market mechanisms generally work effectively to restore equilibrium. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Stability? This USDC price spike incident, while isolated, raises important questions about market infrastructure. However, the quick recovery demonstrates the resilience of modern cryptocurrency markets. The event highlights how automated trading systems and arbitrage opportunities help maintain overall market efficiency. Moreover, the temporary nature of this USDC price spike reinforces that these events are typically short-lived and don’t indicate fundamental problems with the stablecoin itself. Key Takeaways from the Bithumb USDC Incident The dramatic USDC price spike serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and occasionally unpredictable. However, the swift correction to normal levels shows that market forces effectively maintain stablecoin pegs over time. This USDC price spike event ultimately demonstrates the robustness of cryptocurrency market mechanisms. Frequently Asked Questions How long did the USDC price spike last? The price surge was extremely brief, lasting only minutes before correction mechanisms brought the price back to normal levels. Could traders profit from this USDC price spike? While theoretically possible, the speed of the spike made it difficult for most traders to execute profitable trades before the price corrected. Has this happened with USDC before? Minor price deviations occur occasionally, but a spike of this magnitude on a major exchange like Bithumb is relatively rare. Should I worry about my USDC holdings? No, the quick correction demonstrates that USDC maintains its peg effectively through market mechanisms and redemption options. Can I prevent buying during price spikes? Yes, using limit orders instead of market orders ensures you never pay more than your specified price for any cryptocurrency. Do other stablecoins experience similar spikes? All stablecoins can experience temporary price deviations, though most correct quickly through arbitrage trading. Found this analysis of the USDC price spike helpful?

While more miners compete to secure the blockchain, the reward per unit of computing power is falling, leaving even some of the largest operators struggling to break even. Bitcoin mining has long been a booming business for entrepreneurs looking to extract the cryptocurrency. Still, the energy-intensive process has become far less profitable due to its soaring electricity costs. However, growing competition, a decline in Bitcoin’s price, and rising operational costs are beginning to test the industry. The challenge of keeping mining profitable is so great that many miners are exploring high-performance computing and other artificial intelligence workloads to seek new revenue streams. In October 2025, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate broke the 1.1 zettahashes-per-second mark for the first time. The hashrate is the overall computing power committed to securing the network and validating transactions. And while higher hashrates contribute to Bitcoin’s security, they also make mining more challenging. Miners now face increased competition for the same rewards, and only the most efficient operators can maintain healthy margins. Meanwhile, the “hashprice,” a crucial measurement that denotes revenue per unit of computing power, has tumbled. By November, it had fallen to about $35 per PH/s, the lowest it had been in over five years. Declining Bitcoin prices and dwindling transaction fees are exacerbating the issue. As rewards in terms of coins per hash dwindle, many miners are struggling to recoup their electricity and equipment costs. Payback periods for new rigs are stretched out to more than 1,200 days, or over three years. Miners take on more debt to stay afloat To stay afloat, many mining companies are borrowing heavily. Convertible debt and other financial instruments are now crucial for paying increasingly high energy bills, upgrading equipment, and meeting daily expenses. Public miners, in particular, have taken advantage of the debt market aggressively in recent months, seeking to preserve liquidity as Bitcoin prices fluctuate. This already stretches the finances even further due to increasing overheads. Electricity rates in some of the major mining regions are higher, and second-hand equipment is more expensive than ever. Companies are facing regulatory and logistical hurdles, including permitting delays, supply chain challenges, and compliance with regulations. Others are hoarding Bitcoin as a hedge against market uncertainty. Larger inventories can cushion companies against short-term revenue fluctuations, but they also expose firms to price swings, adding to their financial uncertainty. That need has only intensified as miners face increasing pressure on their low margins and mounting debt. As the vice tightens, several miners are investigating high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence workloads to generate new revenue streams. Companies are no longer waiting to mine Bitcoin directly; instead, they are switching their infrastructure to host GPUs for AI cloud services and other compute-intensive tasks. Large operators have secured long-term agreements with technology firms to deliver such services. Others are going all in, gradually pivoting away from traditional Bitcoin mines to the business of AI data centers. For starters, Bitfarm says it will exit Bitcoin mining altogether by 2027 and redirect the hundreds of megawatts currently allocated for crypto mining to facilitate AI computing. Miners face rising risks and uncertain markets However, amid those struggles, some miners are finding new opportunities. Publicly listed companies have seen some recovery in stock prices, partially resulting from investor enthusiasm for the AI and HPC transition. Analysts say that companies able to manage costs effectively and diversify their operations will emerge stronger, while less efficient miners may struggle or be forced to exit the market. However, the path forward is far from clear. The price of Bitcoin remains volatile, and the difficulty and hashrate continue to increase. Additionally, there are energy costs, regulatory challenges, and capital requirements for growth to consider. The next year could be a moment of reckoning for the wider industry, one that divides firms capable of change from those fated to remain stuck in their ways.

This revenue outcome demonstrated outstanding performance for the software company’s diverse range of business tools. In a statement released on Monday, November 24, Zoom noted that its sales increased by 4.4% to reach an all-time high of $1.23 billion in the fiscal third quarter. The profit gained, after eliminating specific items, was reported at $1.52 per share. According to the earlier prediction presented by the analysts, a reliable source noted that the company’s average earnings were expected to be $1.44 per share. At the same time, revenue was estimated to total around $1.21 billion. Zoom makes significant progress in increasing revenue Recent reports highlighted that Zoom is expanding its reach in the tech market by broadening its offerings to provide business phone systems and software designed for contact centers. Notably, the company is famous for its popularly adapted videoconferencing application . Additionally, it launched the newest versio n of its artificial intelligence assistant during its September annual conference. This AI assistant included upgraded features that allowed users to develop custom AI tools for a monthly fee of $12. Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, commented on this progress . Yuan noted that they expected a substantial rise in AI Companion usage following the launch of their artificial intelligence assistant, AI Companion 3.0, in this quarter. He made these remarks after acknowledging rapid growth in Custom AI Companion and its AI-first Customer Experience suite. Meanwhile, reports from sources indicated that the company’s shares surged approximately 4% in after-hours trading. This increase occurred after the stock closed at $78.60 in New York on Monday of this week. The stocks, on the other hand, dropped drastically by 3.7% this year, following general concerns raised in the market regarding application software. Revenue collected from enterprise clients surged by 6.1% to reach $741.4 million. This figure exceeded analysts’ earlier prediction of $731.6 million. When reporters inquired about these impressive results, Zoom stated that it had a total of 4,363 clients at the time who had contributed more than $100,000 each within the past year. In the last quarter, the average monthly churn rate for individuals and small businesses was 2.7%. This percentage reflected a decline from 2.9% in the previous quarter. Sources explained that this decrease was observed after many casual users decided not to renew their Zoom licenses as pandemic restrictions eased. Rishi Jaluria admits that Zoom’s enterprise business continues to be a major strength During a call with analysts after Zoom’s revenue results were made public, Michelle Chang, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the company, confessed that they have implemented several processes to increase revenue while maintaining strong profitability and minimizing dilution. In the meantime, apart from increasing its revenue, Zoom also raised its total share buyback limit by $1 billion. The company, based in San Jose, California, stated that its revenue for this period would be approximately $1.23 billion following this achievement. Profit (excluding specific items) is estimated to be around $1.49 per share. Analysts, on the other hand, expected $1.23 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.45 per share. Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, acknowledged Zoom’s enterprise business as a major strength. According to Jaluria’s argument, investors are paying attention to the progress of the new AI companion tool, the stabilization of churn among casual users, and expected long-term profit margins.

The Financial Services Commission’s recent opposition to expanding the Bank of Korea’s authority signals a crucial turning point for cryptocurrency oversight in one of Asia’s most dynamic markets. Why Is Stablecoins Regulation Sparking Such Intense Debate? The heart of the controversy lies in balancing innovation with protection. South Korea’s FSC firmly believes that granting the Bank of Korea emergency powers over stablecoin issuers would create unnecessary burdens. They argue that small-scale issuers simply don’t pose systemic risks to monetary policy. This stance reflects a growing global conversation about appropriate stablecoins regulation frameworks. Moreover, the commission highlighted a significant gap in international precedent. No major economy currently provides direct liquidity support to stablecoin issuers through deposit insurance systems. This careful approach to stablecoins regulation demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to thoughtful policymaking rather than rushed decisions. What Specific Powers Did the Bank of Korea Seek? The proposed authority would have granted the central bank two key abilities: Request emergency orders from stablecoin issuers Conduct joint inspections of won-denominated stablecoin operations The FSC’s opposition centers on the belief that these stablecoins regulation measures would be excessive for smaller players. Since their trading volumes remain relatively low, they argue these issuers don’t significantly impact broader monetary policy. This nuanced understanding of stablecoins regulation shows regulators are considering scale and actual risk rather than applying blanket rules. How Does This Decision Align With Global Stablecoins Regulation Trends? South Korea’s position actually places it in careful company with other major economies. The FSC correctly noted that no leading financial jurisdiction has established direct liquidity support mechanisms for stablecoin issuers. This global hesitation stems from the unique nature of stablecoins regulation challenges. Stablecoins primarily function as payment methods rather than investment vehicles. Therefore, regulators worldwide are approaching stablecoins regulation with particular caution. The ongoing international discussions about appropriate oversight frameworks make South Korea’s deliberate stance both timely and strategic. What Does This Mean for South Korea’s Crypto Future? This decision represents a victory for measured growth in the digital asset space. By rejecting excessive stablecoins regulation for small issuers, the FSC supports innovation while maintaining necessary oversight. The approach acknowledges that not all market participants require the same level of scrutiny. The stablecoins regulation debate in South Korea will undoubtedly continue evolving. However, this initial position establishes important boundaries that could influence how other nations approach similar questions. It demonstrates that effective stablecoins regulation requires understanding both the technology and the market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar or Korean won. Why does the FSC oppose the Bank of Korea’s proposal? The FSC believes the proposed powers would be excessive for small-scale stablecoin issuers whose volumes don’t affect monetary policy. How does South Korea’s stance compare to other countries? South Korea aligns with major economies that haven’t established direct liquidity support for stablecoin issuers through deposit insurance. What powers was the Bank of Korea seeking? The central bank wanted authority to request emergency orders and conduct joint inspections of won-denominated stablecoin issuers. Will this decision affect cryptocurrency innovation in South Korea? Yes, by avoiding excessive regulation of small issuers, the decision supports continued innovation in the digital asset space. What happens next for stablecoin regulation in South Korea? Discussions will continue as regulators balance innovation with consumer protection in this rapidly evolving sector.

54867444,633215,1764036027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54867444.jpeg,"Bitcoin Capitulation Now Mirrors COVID, China Ban, and Luna Collapse Levels – Historical Stress Point",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-capitulation-now-mirrors-covid-china-ban/,"Bitcoin has officially entered a capitulation phase as relentless selling pressure and macro uncertainty push the market into one of its most stressful moments of the cycle. After reaching its $126,000 all-time high in early October, BTC has collapsed to a fresh local low near $80,000 in under two months — a stunning 35% drawdown that has shaken investor confidence. Many market participants who expected a continuation of the bullish trend are now facing steep unrealized losses, amplifying fear and forcing short-term holders to exit at a loss. According to top analyst Axel Adler, the strength of the US dollar has become one of the dominant forces behind this wave of capitulation. As the DXY index holds firmly above 100, global liquidity tightens, historical patterns show that Bitcoin short-term holders tend to realize losses more aggressively. Adler notes that this dynamic is currently playing out with intensity, mirroring previous phases of market stress. However, not all signals point downward. The probability of a December Federal Reserve rate cut has climbed to 69%, and Adler suggests that if markets begin pricing this more aggressively, it could flip macro momentum and trigger a reversal . For now, Bitcoin remains in a fragile state — but a macro catalyst may be forming. Short-Term Holder Capitulation Deepens as Macro Pressure Overrides Behavioral Signals Axel Adler explains that short-term holders are now realizing losses with an intensity comparable to some of Bitcoin’s most violent historical shocks — including the COVID crash of 2020, the China mining ban in 2021, and the Luna collapse in 2022. The latest data shows that SOPR Momentum, a key indicator of realized profitability, has dropped nearly to 0, a level that typically marks full capitulation among reactive market participants. Historically, readings this depressed have aligned with explosive V-shaped reversals or sharp relief rallies, as selling pressure becomes exhausted and stronger hands begin absorbing supply. However, Adler emphasizes an important nuance: while behavioral capitulation is clearly underway, macro forces currently dominate market structure. Extreme SOPR readings can produce bottoms, but they can also generate short-lived bounces within broader downtrends when macro conditions remain unfavorable. With the dollar index (DXY) still elevated above 100, liquidity remains tight — and Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure. Adler notes that everything now hinges on the Federal Reserve. If markets begin actively pricing in the December rate cut, it could weaken the dollar and relieve some of the stress weighing on BTC. Until then, macro remains the stronger force, overshadowing even severe capitulation signals. Testing Support After a Steep Breakdown Bitcoin’s price action on the 1D chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after one of the sharpest multi-week declines of this cycle. BTC dropped from the $126,000 peak to the $80,000–$86,000 range in less than two months, and the chart clearly reflects this capitulation structure. The series of long red candles highlights aggressive selling pressure, with bears firmly in control throughout November. The chart shows BTC trading below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—confirming a clear breakdown in trend structure. The 200-day MA around the mid-$88K region is now acting as resistance rather than support. This flip is typically a bearish signal and aligns with the ongoing macro-driven weakness highlighted by analysts across the market. Volume remains elevated during the downturn, reinforcing that the sell-off has been driven by strong hands exiting. However, the most recent candles show wicks forming near $83K–$86K, suggesting early attempts at demand absorption. If BTC can hold above the recent low around $80K and close back above the 200-day MA, the market could see a short-term relief rally.

Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The wider crypto market is finally flashing green, but the HBAR price is clearly outpacing the pack thanks to a wave of institutional interest, rising ETF inflows, and growing excitement ahead of Coinbase’s futures launch. Still, despite the bullish sentiment, chart signals warn that the token isn’t out of danger just yet. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview ETF Inflows, Futures Launch Fuel the Rally The sudden HBAR price acceleration comes at a moment when multiple catalysts are stacking in its favor. Trading volume has surged by more than 190%, pushing Hedera into the top gainer bracket of the day. A major driver is Coinbase’s upcoming rollout of 24/7 HBAR futures trading on December 5, which opens the door for more institutional hedging, speculation, and liquidity. The ETF space is also turning increasingly supportive. Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF has boosted its holdings to over 421 million HBAR, now valued at nearly $55 million, after three straight sessions of positive net inflows. Since its launch, the ETF has attracted over $72 million, a rare trend during a period when other major crypto funds, particularly those focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced significant outflows. Additionally, the IRS’s new stance allowing staking inside ETFs and the SEC’s updated listing standards have brightened the long-term outlook for HBAR-based investment products. Meanwhile, real-world adoption narratives are strengthening thanks to Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot on Hedera and tokenized ETF assets deployed. HBAR Price Bullish Setup, But Still Below Key Trendlines Technically, the HBAR price is showing early signs of a possible reversal. Analysts highlight a triple bottom pattern forming around the $0.123 zone, an area buyers have defended multiple times this year. Rising futures open interest and an improving long/short ratio add to the bullish backdrop. However, Hedera remains trapped beneath a dominant descending trendline that has rejected every rally since September. The 20-day EMA at $0.155 continues to cap upside attempts, while the 50- and 100-day EMAs reinforce heavy resistance above. Momentum indicators have improved, but the broader trend remains bearish unless the HBAR price decisively breaks above $0.155. Short-Term Outlook: Cautious Optimism If buyers maintain pressure, the HBAR price could retest the $0.16–$0.18 region. A clean breakout above the falling channel would set the stage for a larger move toward $0.228, the neckline of the triple bottom. But failure to overcome resistance keeps the token vulnerable to retracements toward $0.14, then $0.125, and potentially $0.10 if bearish momentum resurfaces.

Recent warnings from blockchain security experts suggest the official claim page may have been compromised, putting users’ funds at risk. What’s Happening with the Monad Airdrop? Cos, founder of renowned blockchain security firm SlowMist, has issued an urgent warning about potential security breaches affecting the Monad airdrop claim process. Multiple users report that wallet addresses displayed on the official claim page differ from those they originally registered. This discrepancy suggests a possible website compromise where hackers may have altered destination addresses to redirect funds. The security expert noted that a white-hat hacker previously identified similar vulnerabilities, indicating this exploit method isn’t new to the crypto space. How Can You Protect Your Assets? While confirmation of active exploitation remains pending, extreme caution is essential during any Monad airdrop application. Here are critical safety measures: Double-check every wallet address before confirming transactions Verify website URLs to ensure you’re on the legitimate platform Use hardware wallets for additional security layers Monitor official channels for security updates Avoid rushing the claim process despite excitement Why Are Airdrops Particularly Vulnerable? Airdrops create perfect conditions for scammers because they generate significant user excitement and involve mass transactions. The Monad airdrop situation highlights how hackers exploit this enthusiasm to bypass security measures. Moreover, the technical nature of cryptocurrency transactions means once funds transfer to wrong addresses, recovery becomes nearly impossible. This makes prevention absolutely crucial for protecting your investments. What Should You Do Immediately? If you plan to participate in the Monad airdrop , take these proactive steps immediately. First, pause any claim attempts until security concerns resolve. Second, monitor official Monad communication channels for updates. Third, consider using alternative verification methods beyond the primary claim page. Finally, report any suspicious activity to both Monad developers and security firms like SlowMist to help protect the broader community. Conclusion: Safety First in Crypto Rewards The potential Monad airdrop compromise serves as a stark reminder that cryptocurrency security requires constant vigilance. While airdrops offer exciting opportunities for token distribution, they also present attractive targets for malicious actors. By exercising caution, verifying information, and implementing security best practices, you can navigate these opportunities while minimizing risks to your digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions How do I know if my Monad airdrop claim is safe? Currently, you should wait for official confirmation that security issues have been resolved before attempting any claims. Monitor official Monad channels for updates. What should I do if I already submitted a claim? Immediately check your transaction history and verify the receiving address matches your intended wallet. Contact support if you notice discrepancies. Can I recover funds sent to a wrong address? Unfortunately, cryptocurrency transactions to incorrect addresses are typically irreversible, making prevention critically important. How can I verify the legitimate Monad airdrop page? Always access the claim page through official Monad website links and verified social media channels, never through third-party links. Are hardware wallets safer for airdrop claims? Yes, hardware wallets provide additional security layers by keeping private keys offline during transactions. When will we know if the security issue is resolved? Security firms and Monad developers will announce when they’ve confirmed the platform’s safety. Follow their official communications.

This landmark transaction represents a significant shift in institutional crypto strategy and marks WLFI’s first-ever engagement with the HTX platform. What Does This Massive TRX Deposit Mean for Crypto Markets? The substantial TRX deposit occurred over a concentrated 10-hour period, according to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa.

Frequently Asked Questions How significant is a 40.71 million TRX deposit? This TRX deposit represents a substantial institutional move, indicating serious capital allocation and strategic positioning within the TRON ecosystem. Why did World Liberty Financial choose HTX for this deposit? The HTX selection suggests diversification strategy, potentially seeking better liquidity, competitive fees, or specific trading pairs not available on their usual exchanges.

The first spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund in the United States made its market debut with surprising results that have left crypto enthusiasts and investors buzzing with questions. What Exactly Happened with the DOGE ETF Launch? Grayscale’s highly anticipated DOGE ETF arrived on the New York Stock Exchange with mixed performance metrics. According to data from SoSoValue, the ETF recorded $1.41 million in trading volume during its first day. However, the most startling figure was the zero net inflows, indicating balanced buying and selling activity. The total net asset value settled at $1.71 million, creating an interesting starting point for this new cryptocurrency investment vehicle. This DOGE ETF represents a significant milestone for meme coin institutional adoption. Why Zero Net Inflows Matter for the DOGE ETF Zero net inflows tell us something crucial about market sentiment. This balance suggests that: Initial investor interest was matched by profit-taking The market found an equilibrium price point quickly There was no immediate rush of new capital into the DOGE ETF This trading pattern differs from other cryptocurrency ETF launches we’ve witnessed. The DOGE ETF’s debut reflects cautious optimism rather than explosive demand. Understanding the DOGE ETF Trading Volume Significance The $1.41 million trading volume indicates healthy market activity for a new financial product. This level of volume demonstrates: Substantial investor awareness and participation Liquidity that supports future growth potential Market maker engagement in the DOGE ETF ecosystem While not record-breaking, this volume establishes a solid foundation for the DOGE ETF’s future trading activity and market presence. What This Means for Dogecoin’s Institutional Future The launch of a DOGE ETF marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency mainstream acceptance. However, the zero net inflows suggest institutional investors might be taking a wait-and-see approach. This cautious stance could change as: More track record data becomes available Market conditions for meme coins evolve Regulatory clarity improves for cryptocurrency ETFs The DOGE ETF’s performance will be closely watched as an indicator of institutional appetite for alternative digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key Takeaways from the DOGE ETF Debut The initial trading day provided valuable insights about market reception. The DOGE ETF achieved respectable volume while maintaining balance between buyers and sellers. This suggests a measured rather than speculative launch, which could benefit long-term stability. As the first spot Dogecoin ETF in the U.S. market, this Grayscale product opens new doors for cryptocurrency investment strategies. The DOGE ETF creates accessible exposure to Dogecoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Frequently Asked Questions What is a DOGE ETF? A DOGE ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning or storing it. Why were there zero net inflows? Zero net inflows occur when the amount of money entering the ETF equals the amount leaving, indicating balanced investor interest without significant new capital injection. How does this compare to other crypto ETF launches? The DOGE ETF debut showed moderate volume compared to some Bitcoin ETF launches, reflecting the different market positions of established cryptocurrencies versus meme coins. Can the DOGE ETF impact Dogecoin’s price? Yes, increased institutional access through the DOGE ETF could potentially influence Dogecoin’s price dynamics and trading patterns over time. Is the DOGE ETF available to all investors? Yes, like other ETFs, the DOGE ETF is available to any investor with access to brokerage accounts that support NYSE trading. What risks come with investing in a DOGE ETF? DOGE ETF investors face cryptocurrency market volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the specific risks associated with meme-based digital assets.

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has just announced an urgent temporary suspension of Worldcoin (WLD) deposits and withdrawals starting at 10:00 a.m. UTC today. This crucial Upbit WLD suspension comes as the Worldcoin network undergoes a significant hard fork upgrade, requiring enhanced security measures and technical adjustments. Why Did Upbit Implement This WLD Suspension? The primary reason behind this temporary halt is Worldcoin’s network hard fork. Hard forks represent major protocol upgrades that create permanent divergences from previous blockchain versions. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily suspend services to ensure: Secure network transition during the upgrade process Proper wallet compatibility with the new blockchain Asset protection for all user funds Seamless integration with the updated protocol What Does This Upbit WLD Suspension Mean for Traders? While the Upbit WLD suspension affects deposit and withdrawal functions, important trading activities remain operational. Users can still: Execute WLD trading pairs on the exchange Monitor price movements and market trends Place limit and market orders Manage existing WLD holdings in their wallets However, traders should note that external WLD transfers to and from Upbit wallets will remain paused until the hard fork completes successfully. When Will Upbit Resume WLD Services? Upbit has confirmed the suspension is temporary, though the exact resumption time depends on the hard fork’s completion and subsequent network stability checks. Typically, such maintenance periods last several hours to ensure thorough testing. The exchange will provide updates through: Official website announcements Mobile app notifications Social media channels Email alerts to registered users How Can Traders Prepare During This Suspension? Smart cryptocurrency management during exchange maintenance involves several proactive steps. First, ensure you have alternative trading options if needed. Second, monitor official communication channels regularly. Moreover, avoid attempting deposits during the suspension period as transactions may fail or face delays. Finally, use this time to research the hard fork’s potential impact on WLD’s long-term value proposition. What Are the Broader Implications of This Upbit WLD Suspension? This temporary Upbit WLD suspension demonstrates the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation. Exchanges now prioritize security over convenience during critical network upgrades. Furthermore, such proactive measures help prevent potential fund losses and technical issues that previously plagued early blockchain projects. The careful handling of this hard fork reflects Upbit’s commitment to operational excellence and user asset protection. In conclusion, the temporary Upbit WLD suspension represents standard industry practice during significant network upgrades. While inconvenient for short-term transfers, this precautionary measure ultimately safeguards user assets and ensures smooth post-fork operations. The crypto community recognizes such responsible actions as essential for mainstream adoption and institutional confidence. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade WLD on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, all WLD trading pairs remain active. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. How long will the Upbit WLD suspension last? The duration depends on the hard fork completion and network stability. Typically, such suspensions last several hours to a day. Will my existing WLD funds be safe during this period? Absolutely. All user funds remain secure in cold storage during the maintenance period. Should I move my WLD to another exchange before the suspension? This isn’t necessary unless you require immediate withdrawal capabilities. The suspension is temporary and trading continues normally. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will announce the resumption through official channels including their website, app, and social media accounts. Could this suspension affect WLD’s price? Temporary suspensions during upgrades typically have minimal long-term price impact, though short-term volatility is possible. Found this update helpful?

This substantial capital movement represents one of the most significant single-day inflows for XRP spot ETFs this year, highlighting growing mainstream acceptance of digital asset investment vehicles. What Makes XRP Spot ETFs So Attractive to Investors? The recent $164 million inflow into XRP spot ETFs demonstrates several key advantages that make these investment vehicles increasingly popular. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency purchases, XRP spot ETFs offer regulated exposure to the digital asset through familiar brokerage accounts. Moreover, they provide institutional-grade security and eliminate the technical complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Investors benefit from several compelling features: Regulatory compliance and institutional oversight Simplified investment process through traditional brokerage platforms Enhanced security measures compared to personal wallet management Liquidity advantages during market volatility Breaking Down the $164 Million XRP Spot ETF Inflows According to data from SoSoValue, the November 24 inflows were distributed across four major XRP spot ETF providers. Grayscale’s GXRP led the pack with an impressive $67.36 million, followed closely by Franklin’s XRPZ at $62.59 million. The remaining inflows were split between Bitwise’s XRP fund at $17.71 million and Canary’s XRPC at $16.38 million. This distribution pattern reveals important market dynamics. The substantial allocations to established players like Grayscale and Franklin indicate that investors prefer providers with proven track records in digital asset management. However, the meaningful contributions to smaller funds suggest diversification strategies are also at play. Why Are Institutions Flocking to XRP Spot ETFs Now? The timing of these massive XRP spot ETF inflows coincides with several positive market developments. Regulatory clarity surrounding XRP has improved significantly in recent months, reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. Additionally, broader cryptocurrency market recovery and increasing adoption of blockchain technology by traditional financial institutions have created favorable conditions for XRP investment products. Several factors are driving this institutional interest: Improved regulatory outlook for XRP and digital assets Growing institutional adoption of blockchain technology Portfolio diversification benefits in uncertain economic conditions Long-term growth potential of the XRP ecosystem What This Means for the Future of XRP Spot ETFs The $164 million inflow represents more than just a single-day trading event—it signals a fundamental shift in how institutions approach XRP investment. As more traditional financial players enter the digital asset space through regulated vehicles like XRP spot ETFs, we can expect increased liquidity, improved price discovery, and enhanced market stability. This development also suggests that XRP spot ETFs are becoming mainstream investment options rather than niche products. The substantial capital allocation indicates that institutional investors now view these vehicles as legitimate components of diversified investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions What are XRP spot ETFs? XRP spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual XRP tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why are XRP spot ETFs important? These ETFs provide regulated, accessible investment vehicles for both institutional and retail investors, bridging traditional finance with digital assets. How do XRP spot ETFs differ from Bitcoin ETFs? While both are cryptocurrency ETFs, XRP spot ETFs track XRP specifically, which serves different use cases in cross-border payments and financial settlements. Are XRP spot ETFs safe investments? Like all investments, XRP spot ETFs carry risks, but they offer regulatory oversight and institutional custody that may reduce some risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. Can retail investors access XRP spot ETFs? Yes, retail investors can purchase shares of XRP spot ETFs through their regular brokerage accounts, similar to traditional ETFs. What factors affect XRP spot ETF performance? Performance depends on XRP price movements, market demand, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency market trends.

The sharp decline has flipped market sentiment decisively bearish, with many traders fearing that ETH has entered a prolonged downtrend. Bulls are struggling to establish a reliable support level, and the lack of strong buy-side reaction so far has only intensified uncertainty. Liquidity continues to thin out across major exchanges, reinforcing the narrative that the market is still deep in a risk-off phase. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse Yet, despite the heavy selling pressure and underwhelming price performance, not all major players are stepping back. In fact, some are doubling down. Fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that Tom Lee’s Bitmine — a well-known crypto-focused investment operation—continues to buy ETH aggressively at current prices. Bitmine has been one of the few entities consistently adding to its position during the downturn, signaling strong conviction that Ethereum remains undervalued in the long term. This divergence between retail fear and whale accumulation is becoming increasingly notable. As ETH hovers around a critical psychological level, the coming days may determine whether this whale’s confidence translates into broader market stabilization or remains an isolated bet against the prevailing trend. Bitmine’s Aggressive Accumulation Signals Confidence According to Lookonchain, Tom Lee’s Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation, purchasing another 28,625 ETH worth $82.11 million. This move reinforces the growing narrative that some of the market’s most sophisticated players are positioning for a rebound despite the prevailing fear and relentless selling pressure. Large-scale buying during deep corrections has historically aligned with early reversal zones, and Bitmine’s conviction adds weight to the idea that Ethereum may be approaching a significant turning point. Still, a recovery is far from guaranteed. ETH remains trapped near the $2,800 zone, a level that has acted as a fragile line of defense during this downturn. For momentum to shift, Ethereum must not only hold this area but also reclaim the $3,000 mark, which has now flipped into an important resistance zone. A decisive move above this level would signal that buyers are finally stepping back in with strength, potentially setting the stage for a broader trend reversal. Until then, the situation remains delicate. Bitmine’s accumulation offers a bullish signal, but without confirmation from price structure, Ethereum continues to walk a tightrope. A failure to hold current levels could invite another wave of capitulation, but stability here may spark the rebound whales seem to be anticipating.

Price has now pulled back to around $2,800, a level that aligns closely with the 200-week moving average—a historically important area where ETH has often found long-term support. This zone previously acted as a launchpad during major market reversals in both 2022 and mid-2023, making its defense crucial for maintaining broader structural strength. The recent breakdown below the 50- and 100-week moving averages highlights the intensity of the current selloff. Momentum clearly shifted in favor of bears over the past weeks, with several large red candles confirming aggressive distribution. However, ETH’s current stabilization attempt above the 200-week MA signals that buyers are finally stepping in, preventing a deeper slide toward $2,400.
