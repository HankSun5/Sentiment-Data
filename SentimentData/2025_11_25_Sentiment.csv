While Cardano is struggling with bear market conditions and is trading well below most of its key moving averages, Mutuum Finance is flourishing; raising over $18.9 million, supported by over 18,140 unique community holders. The presale is in the final stages of phase 6, and the price of the tokens is $0.035. The price is scheduled to increase, making it a great consideration by anyone looking to invest in an asset with great flexibility. The unique revenue earning mechanism coupled with the precious tokens makes this cheap crypto a great consideration for anyone looking to invest, positioning the token as one of the most flexible to enter the market. Cardano’s Problems Show Change in the Market Cardano (ADA) is still in a noticeable downtrend. More technical indicators show ADA is still making lower highs and losing momentum. The asset is still below the 20-day and 50-day moving average lines. The RSI is still in the bearish low range. This shows ADA is losing strength. Even though some long-term estimates predict a recovery to $1.01 by 2026, higher price points have strong resistance around the $0.48 to $0.53 range. Players are beginning to invest in multiple opportunity projects in the market. The market is showing great interest in what crypto to invest in and the best opportunity is in presale projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to the lower entry price and new narratives. Last Chance To Buy Mutuum Finance Presale in Phase 6 Unlike the large caps’ price stagnancy, the presale of Mutuum Finance is the last chance to get these tokens cheap, as they are currently priced at $0.035. The project is currently at the end of their Phase 6 presale and has raised $18.9 million with 18,140+ holders. As with any presale, the later phases sell out very quickly, and in Phase 6, over 95% of the tokens have been already bought by the presale investors. Phase 6 is about to sell out completely and will be the last time investors have the chance to buy these tokens at this price. After sellout, more tokens will become available in Phase 7, priced at $0.040, further increasing the importance of this Phase 6 closing window. For anyone interested in the best cryptos to buy right now, this is their last chance to invest in a well-developed protocol and is a clear front-runner considering the potential the protocol has. Buy-and-Distribute Stablecoin Sustainable Value In addition to the presale success, Mutuum Finance is designing a model centered around their stablecoin. The network is deploying a buy-and-distribute strategy, where ecosystem activity is tied to the token’s value. A portion of all protocol fee revenue is directed toward the purchase of MUTM tokens off the open market. Tokens that are bought are redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens, the interest-earning liquidity receipts. This forms a cycle where the focus on platform usage creates fee revenue which drives buy pressure on the MUTM token and distributes rewards to stakers. The model is a fundamental growth driver that provides the project a reputation as one of the best cryptos to invest in for users seeking real value and flexibility in tokenomics, deflationary pressure, and no speculatory hype. Get Ready for Upcoming Success In terms of the almost finished presale stage and self-sustaining economic structures in place, Mutuum Finance is in the position for a good trajectory after listing. While Cardano is still busy with some technical issues, MUTM is gaining momentum and getting closer to the mainnet launch. The remaining tokens in Phase 6 is the last chance to get these tokens at the lowest price. This is a no-brainer for investors that are analyzing which new crypto to buy. The new crypto has an ecosystem that is planned to grow, and the tokens will appreciate with it. The price point on these tokens will go up, and if buying now is not on your to-do list, you will be unfortunately missing out on a chance to be an early investor in an impressive new asset that will level up the DeFi marketplace.

54865320,633456,1764032406,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Regains Strength With a $2,800 Rebound, Will BitMine’s $59M Bet Break the Downtrend?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-regains-strength-rebound-will-bitmines-59m/,"Ethereum (ETH) is showing early signs of stabilization after a turbulent month, bouncing back above the crucial $2,800 level as fresh institutional inflows reignite optimism across the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Quantum-Break Catastrophe Is Pure FUD, Says Gabor Gurbacs ETH currently trades near $2,821, up modestly over the past 24 hours, with traders closely watching to see whether this rebound can evolve into a sustained trend reversal. The renewed momentum follows major accumulation from BitMine, which has doubled down on its Ethereum strategy despite steep market drawdowns. BitMine’s $59M ETH Accumulation Sparks Fresh Investor Confidence The catalyst for Ethereum’s latest recovery came on November 23, when blockchain data confirmed that BitMine acquired 21,537 ETH worth roughly $59–60 million. The purchase increases the company’s total holdings to more than 3.5 million ETH, equivalent to approximately 3% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. While Ethereum prices have fallen nearly 30% in the last month, BitMine maintains that the downturn stems from a temporary liquidity shock rather than deteriorating fundamentals. Bitmine is simultaneously expanding its ecosystem footprint through its upcoming MAVAN staking network, expected to launch in early 2026, and recently announced a dividend issuance, moves that collectively signal long-term conviction. Investors appear to be taking notice. Exchange reserves have dipped to multi-year lows as whales continue accumulating ETH, even as traditional ETF products face outflows. This divergence suggests deep-pocketed players view the current range as a strategic entry zone. Ethereum Battles the Downtrend but Momentum Improves Despite the bounce, Ethereum remains inside a steep descending channel, with resistance stacking between $2,947 and $3,000. This zone contains compressed EMAs, trendline resistance, and the upper Bollinger Band, making it the first major test for buyers. A clean break above $3,000 could pave the way for ETH to reach $3,120, $3,250, and potentially even $3,450. However, a failure at this level may send ETH back toward $2,760 or lower. Indicators remain mixed. The RSI near 40 signals oversold conditions, hinting that a reversal may be developing, while the MACD and moving averages still indicate lingering bearish pressure. Rising open interest and elevated long-short ratios across exchanges reflect aggressive long positioning, momentum that could amplify volatility in either direction. Institutional Products and Upgrades Add Momentum Beyond price action, Ethereum continues to gain structural support. The Singapore Exchange just launched regulated ETH perpetual futures, giving institutions a compliant on-ramp. Meanwhile, anticipation builds around Ethereum’s December Fusaka upgrade , expected to deliver meaningful scalability improvements. With whales accumulating, institutional demand rising, and network upgrades approaching, Ethereum’s rebound above $2,800 may be more than a dead-cat bounce.

Many analysts are leaning toward calling the start of a new bear market, arguing that Bitcoin likely topped in early October near $126,000. Momentum has weakened sharply since then, and investor behavior now reflects a shift toward risk-off positioning. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse A new report from CryptoOnchain, published via CryptoQuant, highlights one of the most significant developments of this cycle: a historic 63,000 BTC has moved from long-term holders (LTHs) to short-term holders (STHs). This unprecedented transfer is clearly visible in the Long-Term Holder Net Position Change chart, which shows a massive red bar — a negative daily difference signaling heavy outflows from long-term holder wallets. This type of behavior typically appears during late-stage bull markets or near local and cycle tops, when long-time investors with substantial profit margins begin realizing gains. At the same time, the corresponding Short-Term Holder Net Position Change chart shows a huge green bar, confirming that newer, more reactive market participants are buying these coins, often at elevated prices. Long-Term Holders Distribute as Short-Term Buyers Absorb Supply CryptoOnchain explains that the current market structure is being shaped by a clear divergence in behavior between Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). LTHs — historically considered the “strong hands” of the market — are now heavily distributing, sending large amounts of Bitcoin into the market after months or even years of holding. At the same time, STHs are aggressively buying and accumulating this supply, often entering positions at elevated prices despite growing volatility. This dynamic is not inherently a bearish signal on its own. In fact, such transitions are common during late-stage bull markets, where early investors secure profits while new participants enter the market with fresh capital. It reflects a natural rotation of supply from experienced holders to newer ones, a pattern seen repeatedly in previous cycles. However, the volume of distribution is significant, and it raises an important risk: if incoming demand fails to fully absorb the coins being offloaded by LTHs, the market could face a deeper correction or extended consolidation phase. This supply pressure can weigh on price, especially in a context where sentiment is fragile and macro conditions remain uncertain. Related Reading: STH Panic Emerges as Bitcoin Crashes To $81K: Realized P/L Turns Negative For The First Time This Cycle Weekly Chart Signals a Critical Retest of Macro Support Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize around the $87,000 level after an intense multi-week sell-off that dragged price as low as $85,946. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has now tapped the 100-week moving average (green line), a historically important support level during bull-market retracements. This line acted as a springboard in previous cycles, but the current bounce remains weak and indecisive, reflecting the fear dominating the market. Momentum has clearly shifted bearish. The breakdown from the $110K–$100K consolidation zone triggered accelerated selling, confirming a loss of market structure on the weekly timeframe. Candles over the past three weeks show high-volume distribution, with sellers overwhelming demand each time Bitcoin attempted to reclaim higher levels. The steep slope of the 50-week MA turning slightly down is another sign that trend strength has softened. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Deposits Final 2,499 BTC ($228M) to Kraken – Details However, the reaction at the 100-week MA is critical. Bulls aggressively defended this area in prior macro corrections, and holding above $83K–$86K keeps the long-term bull structure intact. A weekly close below this zone, however, opens the door to deeper downside toward the 200-week MA near $56K–$60K.

This bold move comes just weeks after the same trader secured a substantial $2.8 million profit from previous Ethereum positions, signaling strong belief in ETH’s future performance. What Does This Massive Leveraged ETH Long Mean? The trader deposited 10 million USDC into Hyperliquid early this morning, immediately opening a $44.15 million long position on Ethereum with 5x leverage. This leveraged ETH long represents one of the most significant single-position bets we’ve seen recently from experienced cryptocurrency investors. The use of leverage amplifies both potential gains and risks, showing the trader’s conviction in Ethereum’s upward trajectory. Why Are Experienced Traders Bullish on Ethereum? This isn’t the first time this Bitcoin OG has shown confidence in Ethereum. The same address previously closed an entire long position of 55,133 ETH on November 11, realizing an impressive $2.8 million profit. Now, the return with another substantial leveraged ETH long suggests several key factors: Strong technical analysis supporting upward momentum Positive fundamental developments in the Ethereum ecosystem Market conditions favoring altcoin performance Institutional growing interest in Ethereum Understanding the Risks of Leveraged Positions While this leveraged ETH long position demonstrates confidence, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved. With 5x leverage, the trader faces amplified losses if the market moves against their position. However, experienced traders like this Bitcoin OG typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies including: Stop-loss orders to limit potential losses Careful position sizing relative to portfolio value Continuous market monitoring and adjustment Diversification across multiple assets What This Leveraged ETH Long Signals for the Market The timing of this leveraged ETH long position is particularly noteworthy. Coming after a successful previous trade, it suggests the trader sees continued upside potential in Ethereum. This move could influence other market participants and potentially signal: Growing institutional confidence in Ethereum Anticipation of positive market developments Technical breakout patterns forming Increased altcoin season momentum Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This substantial leveraged ETH long from an experienced Bitcoin OG provides valuable insights for all cryptocurrency investors.

Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, recently dropped a bombshell that’s shaking the crypto community. He declared that while artificial intelligence has clear, tangible use cases, cryptocurrency struggles to demonstrate real-world utility. This bold statement raises crucial questions about the future of digital assets and their place in our economy. What Are the Real Cryptocurrency Use Cases According to Critics? Kashkari’s criticism centers on one fundamental question: What problems does cryptocurrency actually solve? Unlike AI, which is transforming industries from healthcare to transportation, critics argue that cryptocurrency use cases remain largely theoretical. They point to several key areas where crypto has failed to gain mainstream traction. However, this perspective ignores the growing adoption in specific sectors and among certain demographics. The debate around cryptocurrency use cases isn’t new, but it’s gaining fresh urgency as regulatory scrutiny increases. Proponents counter that real-world applications do exist, including: Cross-border payments and remittances Decentralized finance platforms Digital ownership through NFTs Financial inclusion in developing nations How Does AI Demonstrate More Concrete Utility? Artificial intelligence presents a stark contrast to cryptocurrency when examining practical applications. AI systems are already embedded in our daily lives through virtual assistants, recommendation algorithms, and automated customer service. More importantly, businesses can clearly measure AI’s impact on efficiency, cost reduction, and innovation. The transparency of AI benefits makes it easier for policymakers like Kashkari to endorse. From medical diagnostics to supply chain optimization, AI delivers measurable results that cryptocurrency use cases often struggle to demonstrate at scale. This tangible value proposition gives AI a significant advantage in gaining institutional acceptance. What Challenges Do Cryptocurrency Use Cases Face? Several fundamental obstacles hinder wider adoption of cryptocurrency use cases. Regulatory uncertainty remains the elephant in the room, with governments worldwide grappling with how to oversee digital assets. Additionally, technical complexity and volatility create barriers for average users who simply want reliable financial tools. Security concerns also plague cryptocurrency use cases, with high-profile hacks and scams damaging public trust. Meanwhile, scalability issues continue to challenge many blockchain networks, limiting their ability to handle transaction volumes comparable to traditional payment systems. These practical hurdles make it difficult for skeptics like Kashkari to see cryptocurrency as anything beyond speculative assets. Where Are Cryptocurrency Use Cases Actually Succeeding? Despite the criticism, evidence of successful cryptocurrency use cases continues to emerge. In countries experiencing hyperinflation or capital controls, digital assets provide lifelines for preserving wealth and conducting international trade. The gaming industry has embraced blockchain technology for in-game assets, while content creators use crypto platforms for direct monetization. Moreover, institutional adoption is gradually increasing, with major companies exploring blockchain for supply chain management and settlement systems. These developments suggest that cryptocurrency use cases may be evolving rather than absent. The key question becomes whether these applications will achieve the scale and stability needed to convince mainstream skeptics. What Does the Future Hold for Cryptocurrency Utility? The path forward for cryptocurrency use cases likely involves greater integration with traditional finance and clearer regulatory frameworks. As the technology matures, we may see more hybrid solutions that combine blockchain efficiency with conventional financial security. The emergence of central bank digital currencies could also force innovation in the private cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, the success of cryptocurrency use cases will depend on solving real problems for real people. Whether it’s reducing remittance costs, enabling financial inclusion, or creating new digital economies, crypto must demonstrate value beyond price speculation. The conversation started by Kashkari serves as an important reality check for the entire industry. The debate around cryptocurrency use cases versus AI utility reflects broader questions about technological adoption and value creation. While Kashkari’s comments highlight legitimate concerns, they also ignore the gradual progress happening beneath the surface. The truth likely lies somewhere between the extremes – cryptocurrency may not yet match AI’s obvious utility, but dismissing its potential entirely would be premature. As with any emerging technology, the most meaningful applications often take time to develop and recognize. Frequently Asked Questions What specific cryptocurrency use cases did Kashkari criticize? While Kashkari didn’t specify individual use cases, his comments suggest he sees cryptocurrency primarily as speculative assets rather than practical tools for solving real-world problems. How does AI demonstrate more tangible benefits than cryptocurrency? AI shows measurable improvements in efficiency, cost reduction, and problem-solving across multiple industries, making its value proposition clearer to policymakers and businesses. Are there any legitimate cryptocurrency use cases gaining traction? Yes, cross-border payments, decentralized finance, and digital ownership applications are seeing growing adoption, though not yet at mainstream scale. What would help cryptocurrency develop stronger use cases? Clearer regulations, improved scalability, better user experience, and demonstrated solutions to actual consumer problems would significantly advance cryptocurrency utility. Could cryptocurrency and AI work together in the future? Absolutely. Many experts believe blockchain and AI could complement each other, with crypto providing secure data exchange and AI offering advanced analytics capabilities. How do other Federal Reserve officials view cryptocurrency? Opinions vary among Fed officials, with some expressing cautious optimism about innovation while others share Kashkari’s skepticism about current utility.

This dramatic fluctuation highlights the volatility that can occur even with stablecoins designed to maintain consistent value. What Caused the USDC Price Spike on Bithumb? The USDC price spike occurred at approximately 1:08 a.m. UTC, when the stablecoin’s value surged to 6,120 won (about $4.43) on the South Korean exchange. This represents more than four times its typical trading value. Market analysts suggest several potential causes for this unusual USDC price movement: Technical glitches in trading algorithms Large mistaken market orders Liquidity issues during low-volume trading hours Potential manipulation attempts Fortunately, the USDC price spike was temporary, and the stablecoin quickly returned to its normal trading range near 1,503 won ($1.09). How Do Stablecoins Maintain Their Peg? Stablecoins like USDC are designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, making this USDC price spike particularly unusual. These digital assets achieve price stability through: Asset backing : Each USDC is backed by real US dollar reserves Redemption mechanisms : Users can always redeem USDC for $1 Market arbitrage : Traders profit from price discrepancies When a USDC price spike occurs, arbitrage traders quickly step in to sell at the higher price and buy back at the normal rate, effectively correcting the imbalance. Why Should Traders Monitor These Events? While the USDC price spike was brief, it offers valuable lessons for cryptocurrency investors. Such events demonstrate that even stable assets can experience temporary volatility. Traders should: Set limit orders to avoid buying at inflated prices Monitor multiple exchanges for price discrepancies Understand the redemption mechanisms for stablecoins Keep emergency sell orders ready for unusual price movements The rapid correction following this USDC price spike shows that market mechanisms generally work effectively to restore equilibrium. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Stability? This USDC price spike incident, while isolated, raises important questions about market infrastructure. However, the quick recovery demonstrates the resilience of modern cryptocurrency markets. The event highlights how automated trading systems and arbitrage opportunities help maintain overall market efficiency. Moreover, the temporary nature of this USDC price spike reinforces that these events are typically short-lived and don’t indicate fundamental problems with the stablecoin itself. Key Takeaways from the Bithumb USDC Incident The dramatic USDC price spike serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and occasionally unpredictable. However, the swift correction to normal levels shows that market forces effectively maintain stablecoin pegs over time. This USDC price spike event ultimately demonstrates the robustness of cryptocurrency market mechanisms. Frequently Asked Questions How long did the USDC price spike last? The price surge was extremely brief, lasting only minutes before correction mechanisms brought the price back to normal levels. Could traders profit from this USDC price spike? While theoretically possible, the speed of the spike made it difficult for most traders to execute profitable trades before the price corrected. Has this happened with USDC before? Minor price deviations occur occasionally, but a spike of this magnitude on a major exchange like Bithumb is relatively rare. Should I worry about my USDC holdings? No, the quick correction demonstrates that USDC maintains its peg effectively through market mechanisms and redemption options. Can I prevent buying during price spikes? Yes, using limit orders instead of market orders ensures you never pay more than your specified price for any cryptocurrency. Do other stablecoins experience similar spikes? All stablecoins can experience temporary price deviations, though most correct quickly through arbitrage trading. Found this analysis of the USDC price spike helpful?

While more miners compete to secure the blockchain, the reward per unit of computing power is falling, leaving even some of the largest operators struggling to break even. Bitcoin mining has long been a booming business for entrepreneurs looking to extract the cryptocurrency. Still, the energy-intensive process has become far less profitable due to its soaring electricity costs. However, growing competition, a decline in Bitcoin’s price, and rising operational costs are beginning to test the industry. The challenge of keeping mining profitable is so great that many miners are exploring high-performance computing and other artificial intelligence workloads to seek new revenue streams. In October 2025, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate broke the 1.1 zettahashes-per-second mark for the first time. The hashrate is the overall computing power committed to securing the network and validating transactions. And while higher hashrates contribute to Bitcoin’s security, they also make mining more challenging. Miners now face increased competition for the same rewards, and only the most efficient operators can maintain healthy margins. Meanwhile, the “hashprice,” a crucial measurement that denotes revenue per unit of computing power, has tumbled. By November, it had fallen to about $35 per PH/s, the lowest it had been in over five years. Declining Bitcoin prices and dwindling transaction fees are exacerbating the issue. As rewards in terms of coins per hash dwindle, many miners are struggling to recoup their electricity and equipment costs. Payback periods for new rigs are stretched out to more than 1,200 days, or over three years. Miners take on more debt to stay afloat To stay afloat, many mining companies are borrowing heavily. Convertible debt and other financial instruments are now crucial for paying increasingly high energy bills, upgrading equipment, and meeting daily expenses. Public miners, in particular, have taken advantage of the debt market aggressively in recent months, seeking to preserve liquidity as Bitcoin prices fluctuate. This already stretches the finances even further due to increasing overheads. Electricity rates in some of the major mining regions are higher, and second-hand equipment is more expensive than ever. Companies are facing regulatory and logistical hurdles, including permitting delays, supply chain challenges, and compliance with regulations. Others are hoarding Bitcoin as a hedge against market uncertainty. Larger inventories can cushion companies against short-term revenue fluctuations, but they also expose firms to price swings, adding to their financial uncertainty. That need has only intensified as miners face increasing pressure on their low margins and mounting debt. As the vice tightens, several miners are investigating high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence workloads to generate new revenue streams. Companies are no longer waiting to mine Bitcoin directly; instead, they are switching their infrastructure to host GPUs for AI cloud services and other compute-intensive tasks. Large operators have secured long-term agreements with technology firms to deliver such services. Others are going all in, gradually pivoting away from traditional Bitcoin mines to the business of AI data centers. For starters, Bitfarm says it will exit Bitcoin mining altogether by 2027 and redirect the hundreds of megawatts currently allocated for crypto mining to facilitate AI computing. Miners face rising risks and uncertain markets However, amid those struggles, some miners are finding new opportunities. Publicly listed companies have seen some recovery in stock prices, partially resulting from investor enthusiasm for the AI and HPC transition. Analysts say that companies able to manage costs effectively and diversify their operations will emerge stronger, while less efficient miners may struggle or be forced to exit the market. However, the path forward is far from clear. The price of Bitcoin remains volatile, and the difficulty and hashrate continue to increase. Additionally, there are energy costs, regulatory challenges, and capital requirements for growth to consider. The next year could be a moment of reckoning for the wider industry, one that divides firms capable of change from those fated to remain stuck in their ways.

This revenue outcome demonstrated outstanding performance for the software company’s diverse range of business tools. In a statement released on Monday, November 24, Zoom noted that its sales increased by 4.4% to reach an all-time high of $1.23 billion in the fiscal third quarter. The profit gained, after eliminating specific items, was reported at $1.52 per share. According to the earlier prediction presented by the analysts, a reliable source noted that the company’s average earnings were expected to be $1.44 per share. At the same time, revenue was estimated to total around $1.21 billion. Zoom makes significant progress in increasing revenue Recent reports highlighted that Zoom is expanding its reach in the tech market by broadening its offerings to provide business phone systems and software designed for contact centers. Notably, the company is famous for its popularly adapted videoconferencing application . Additionally, it launched the newest versio n of its artificial intelligence assistant during its September annual conference. This AI assistant included upgraded features that allowed users to develop custom AI tools for a monthly fee of $12. Eric Yuan, the founder and CEO of Zoom, commented on this progress . Yuan noted that they expected a substantial rise in AI Companion usage following the launch of their artificial intelligence assistant, AI Companion 3.0, in this quarter. He made these remarks after acknowledging rapid growth in Custom AI Companion and its AI-first Customer Experience suite. Meanwhile, reports from sources indicated that the company’s shares surged approximately 4% in after-hours trading. This increase occurred after the stock closed at $78.60 in New York on Monday of this week. The stocks, on the other hand, dropped drastically by 3.7% this year, following general concerns raised in the market regarding application software. Revenue collected from enterprise clients surged by 6.1% to reach $741.4 million. This figure exceeded analysts’ earlier prediction of $731.6 million. When reporters inquired about these impressive results, Zoom stated that it had a total of 4,363 clients at the time who had contributed more than $100,000 each within the past year. In the last quarter, the average monthly churn rate for individuals and small businesses was 2.7%. This percentage reflected a decline from 2.9% in the previous quarter. Sources explained that this decrease was observed after many casual users decided not to renew their Zoom licenses as pandemic restrictions eased. Rishi Jaluria admits that Zoom’s enterprise business continues to be a major strength During a call with analysts after Zoom’s revenue results were made public, Michelle Chang, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the company, confessed that they have implemented several processes to increase revenue while maintaining strong profitability and minimizing dilution. In the meantime, apart from increasing its revenue, Zoom also raised its total share buyback limit by $1 billion. The company, based in San Jose, California, stated that its revenue for this period would be approximately $1.23 billion following this achievement. Profit (excluding specific items) is estimated to be around $1.49 per share. Analysts, on the other hand, expected $1.23 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.45 per share. Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, acknowledged Zoom’s enterprise business as a major strength. According to Jaluria’s argument, investors are paying attention to the progress of the new AI companion tool, the stabilization of churn among casual users, and expected long-term profit margins.

The Financial Services Commission’s recent opposition to expanding the Bank of Korea’s authority signals a crucial turning point for cryptocurrency oversight in one of Asia’s most dynamic markets. Why Is Stablecoins Regulation Sparking Such Intense Debate? The heart of the controversy lies in balancing innovation with protection. South Korea’s FSC firmly believes that granting the Bank of Korea emergency powers over stablecoin issuers would create unnecessary burdens. They argue that small-scale issuers simply don’t pose systemic risks to monetary policy. This stance reflects a growing global conversation about appropriate stablecoins regulation frameworks. Moreover, the commission highlighted a significant gap in international precedent. No major economy currently provides direct liquidity support to stablecoin issuers through deposit insurance systems. This careful approach to stablecoins regulation demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to thoughtful policymaking rather than rushed decisions. What Specific Powers Did the Bank of Korea Seek? The proposed authority would have granted the central bank two key abilities: Request emergency orders from stablecoin issuers Conduct joint inspections of won-denominated stablecoin operations The FSC’s opposition centers on the belief that these stablecoins regulation measures would be excessive for smaller players. Since their trading volumes remain relatively low, they argue these issuers don’t significantly impact broader monetary policy. This nuanced understanding of stablecoins regulation shows regulators are considering scale and actual risk rather than applying blanket rules. How Does This Decision Align With Global Stablecoins Regulation Trends? South Korea’s position actually places it in careful company with other major economies. The FSC correctly noted that no leading financial jurisdiction has established direct liquidity support mechanisms for stablecoin issuers. This global hesitation stems from the unique nature of stablecoins regulation challenges. Stablecoins primarily function as payment methods rather than investment vehicles. Therefore, regulators worldwide are approaching stablecoins regulation with particular caution. The ongoing international discussions about appropriate oversight frameworks make South Korea’s deliberate stance both timely and strategic. What Does This Mean for South Korea’s Crypto Future? This decision represents a victory for measured growth in the digital asset space. By rejecting excessive stablecoins regulation for small issuers, the FSC supports innovation while maintaining necessary oversight. The approach acknowledges that not all market participants require the same level of scrutiny. The stablecoins regulation debate in South Korea will undoubtedly continue evolving. However, this initial position establishes important boundaries that could influence how other nations approach similar questions. It demonstrates that effective stablecoins regulation requires understanding both the technology and the market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar or Korean won. Why does the FSC oppose the Bank of Korea’s proposal? The FSC believes the proposed powers would be excessive for small-scale stablecoin issuers whose volumes don’t affect monetary policy. How does South Korea’s stance compare to other countries? South Korea aligns with major economies that haven’t established direct liquidity support for stablecoin issuers through deposit insurance. What powers was the Bank of Korea seeking? The central bank wanted authority to request emergency orders and conduct joint inspections of won-denominated stablecoin issuers. Will this decision affect cryptocurrency innovation in South Korea? Yes, by avoiding excessive regulation of small issuers, the decision supports continued innovation in the digital asset space. What happens next for stablecoin regulation in South Korea? Discussions will continue as regulators balance innovation with consumer protection in this rapidly evolving sector.

54867444,633215,1764036027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54867444.jpeg,"Bitcoin Capitulation Now Mirrors COVID, China Ban, and Luna Collapse Levels – Historical Stress Point",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-capitulation-now-mirrors-covid-china-ban/,"Bitcoin has officially entered a capitulation phase as relentless selling pressure and macro uncertainty push the market into one of its most stressful moments of the cycle. After reaching its $126,000 all-time high in early October, BTC has collapsed to a fresh local low near $80,000 in under two months — a stunning 35% drawdown that has shaken investor confidence. Many market participants who expected a continuation of the bullish trend are now facing steep unrealized losses, amplifying fear and forcing short-term holders to exit at a loss. According to top analyst Axel Adler, the strength of the US dollar has become one of the dominant forces behind this wave of capitulation. As the DXY index holds firmly above 100, global liquidity tightens, historical patterns show that Bitcoin short-term holders tend to realize losses more aggressively. Adler notes that this dynamic is currently playing out with intensity, mirroring previous phases of market stress. However, not all signals point downward. The probability of a December Federal Reserve rate cut has climbed to 69%, and Adler suggests that if markets begin pricing this more aggressively, it could flip macro momentum and trigger a reversal . For now, Bitcoin remains in a fragile state — but a macro catalyst may be forming. Short-Term Holder Capitulation Deepens as Macro Pressure Overrides Behavioral Signals Axel Adler explains that short-term holders are now realizing losses with an intensity comparable to some of Bitcoin’s most violent historical shocks — including the COVID crash of 2020, the China mining ban in 2021, and the Luna collapse in 2022. The latest data shows that SOPR Momentum, a key indicator of realized profitability, has dropped nearly to 0, a level that typically marks full capitulation among reactive market participants. Historically, readings this depressed have aligned with explosive V-shaped reversals or sharp relief rallies, as selling pressure becomes exhausted and stronger hands begin absorbing supply. However, Adler emphasizes an important nuance: while behavioral capitulation is clearly underway, macro forces currently dominate market structure. Extreme SOPR readings can produce bottoms, but they can also generate short-lived bounces within broader downtrends when macro conditions remain unfavorable. With the dollar index (DXY) still elevated above 100, liquidity remains tight — and Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure. Adler notes that everything now hinges on the Federal Reserve. If markets begin actively pricing in the December rate cut, it could weaken the dollar and relieve some of the stress weighing on BTC. Until then, macro remains the stronger force, overshadowing even severe capitulation signals. Testing Support After a Steep Breakdown Bitcoin’s price action on the 1D chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after one of the sharpest multi-week declines of this cycle. BTC dropped from the $126,000 peak to the $80,000–$86,000 range in less than two months, and the chart clearly reflects this capitulation structure. The series of long red candles highlights aggressive selling pressure, with bears firmly in control throughout November. The chart shows BTC trading below all major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—confirming a clear breakdown in trend structure. The 200-day MA around the mid-$88K region is now acting as resistance rather than support. This flip is typically a bearish signal and aligns with the ongoing macro-driven weakness highlighted by analysts across the market. Volume remains elevated during the downturn, reinforcing that the sell-off has been driven by strong hands exiting. However, the most recent candles show wicks forming near $83K–$86K, suggesting early attempts at demand absorption. If BTC can hold above the recent low around $80K and close back above the 200-day MA, the market could see a short-term relief rally.

Related Reading: Will The Low XRP Price Force Ripple To Dump Its Holdings? Exec Answers Community The wider crypto market is finally flashing green, but the HBAR price is clearly outpacing the pack thanks to a wave of institutional interest, rising ETF inflows, and growing excitement ahead of Coinbase’s futures launch. Still, despite the bullish sentiment, chart signals warn that the token isn’t out of danger just yet. HBAR's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview ETF Inflows, Futures Launch Fuel the Rally The sudden HBAR price acceleration comes at a moment when multiple catalysts are stacking in its favor. Trading volume has surged by more than 190%, pushing Hedera into the top gainer bracket of the day. A major driver is Coinbase’s upcoming rollout of 24/7 HBAR futures trading on December 5, which opens the door for more institutional hedging, speculation, and liquidity. The ETF space is also turning increasingly supportive. Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF has boosted its holdings to over 421 million HBAR, now valued at nearly $55 million, after three straight sessions of positive net inflows. Since its launch, the ETF has attracted over $72 million, a rare trend during a period when other major crypto funds, particularly those focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, have experienced significant outflows. Additionally, the IRS’s new stance allowing staking inside ETFs and the SEC’s updated listing standards have brightened the long-term outlook for HBAR-based investment products. Meanwhile, real-world adoption narratives are strengthening thanks to Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot on Hedera and tokenized ETF assets deployed. HBAR Price Bullish Setup, But Still Below Key Trendlines Technically, the HBAR price is showing early signs of a possible reversal. Analysts highlight a triple bottom pattern forming around the $0.123 zone, an area buyers have defended multiple times this year. Rising futures open interest and an improving long/short ratio add to the bullish backdrop. However, Hedera remains trapped beneath a dominant descending trendline that has rejected every rally since September. The 20-day EMA at $0.155 continues to cap upside attempts, while the 50- and 100-day EMAs reinforce heavy resistance above. Momentum indicators have improved, but the broader trend remains bearish unless the HBAR price decisively breaks above $0.155. Short-Term Outlook: Cautious Optimism If buyers maintain pressure, the HBAR price could retest the $0.16–$0.18 region. A clean breakout above the falling channel would set the stage for a larger move toward $0.228, the neckline of the triple bottom. But failure to overcome resistance keeps the token vulnerable to retracements toward $0.14, then $0.125, and potentially $0.10 if bearish momentum resurfaces.

Recent warnings from blockchain security experts suggest the official claim page may have been compromised, putting users’ funds at risk. What’s Happening with the Monad Airdrop? Cos, founder of renowned blockchain security firm SlowMist, has issued an urgent warning about potential security breaches affecting the Monad airdrop claim process. Multiple users report that wallet addresses displayed on the official claim page differ from those they originally registered. This discrepancy suggests a possible website compromise where hackers may have altered destination addresses to redirect funds. The security expert noted that a white-hat hacker previously identified similar vulnerabilities, indicating this exploit method isn’t new to the crypto space. How Can You Protect Your Assets? While confirmation of active exploitation remains pending, extreme caution is essential during any Monad airdrop application. Here are critical safety measures: Double-check every wallet address before confirming transactions Verify website URLs to ensure you’re on the legitimate platform Use hardware wallets for additional security layers Monitor official channels for security updates Avoid rushing the claim process despite excitement Why Are Airdrops Particularly Vulnerable? Airdrops create perfect conditions for scammers because they generate significant user excitement and involve mass transactions. The Monad airdrop situation highlights how hackers exploit this enthusiasm to bypass security measures. Moreover, the technical nature of cryptocurrency transactions means once funds transfer to wrong addresses, recovery becomes nearly impossible. This makes prevention absolutely crucial for protecting your investments. What Should You Do Immediately? If you plan to participate in the Monad airdrop , take these proactive steps immediately. First, pause any claim attempts until security concerns resolve. Second, monitor official Monad communication channels for updates. Third, consider using alternative verification methods beyond the primary claim page. Finally, report any suspicious activity to both Monad developers and security firms like SlowMist to help protect the broader community. Conclusion: Safety First in Crypto Rewards The potential Monad airdrop compromise serves as a stark reminder that cryptocurrency security requires constant vigilance. While airdrops offer exciting opportunities for token distribution, they also present attractive targets for malicious actors. By exercising caution, verifying information, and implementing security best practices, you can navigate these opportunities while minimizing risks to your digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions How do I know if my Monad airdrop claim is safe? Currently, you should wait for official confirmation that security issues have been resolved before attempting any claims. Monitor official Monad channels for updates. What should I do if I already submitted a claim? Immediately check your transaction history and verify the receiving address matches your intended wallet. Contact support if you notice discrepancies. Can I recover funds sent to a wrong address? Unfortunately, cryptocurrency transactions to incorrect addresses are typically irreversible, making prevention critically important. How can I verify the legitimate Monad airdrop page? Always access the claim page through official Monad website links and verified social media channels, never through third-party links. Are hardware wallets safer for airdrop claims? Yes, hardware wallets provide additional security layers by keeping private keys offline during transactions. When will we know if the security issue is resolved? Security firms and Monad developers will announce when they’ve confirmed the platform’s safety. Follow their official communications.

This landmark transaction represents a significant shift in institutional crypto strategy and marks WLFI’s first-ever engagement with the HTX platform. What Does This Massive TRX Deposit Mean for Crypto Markets? The substantial TRX deposit occurred over a concentrated 10-hour period, according to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa.

Frequently Asked Questions How significant is a 40.71 million TRX deposit? This TRX deposit represents a substantial institutional move, indicating serious capital allocation and strategic positioning within the TRON ecosystem. Why did World Liberty Financial choose HTX for this deposit? The HTX selection suggests diversification strategy, potentially seeking better liquidity, competitive fees, or specific trading pairs not available on their usual exchanges.

The first spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund in the United States made its market debut with surprising results that have left crypto enthusiasts and investors buzzing with questions. What Exactly Happened with the DOGE ETF Launch? Grayscale’s highly anticipated DOGE ETF arrived on the New York Stock Exchange with mixed performance metrics. According to data from SoSoValue, the ETF recorded $1.41 million in trading volume during its first day. However, the most startling figure was the zero net inflows, indicating balanced buying and selling activity. The total net asset value settled at $1.71 million, creating an interesting starting point for this new cryptocurrency investment vehicle. This DOGE ETF represents a significant milestone for meme coin institutional adoption. Why Zero Net Inflows Matter for the DOGE ETF Zero net inflows tell us something crucial about market sentiment. This balance suggests that: Initial investor interest was matched by profit-taking The market found an equilibrium price point quickly There was no immediate rush of new capital into the DOGE ETF This trading pattern differs from other cryptocurrency ETF launches we’ve witnessed. The DOGE ETF’s debut reflects cautious optimism rather than explosive demand. Understanding the DOGE ETF Trading Volume Significance The $1.41 million trading volume indicates healthy market activity for a new financial product. This level of volume demonstrates: Substantial investor awareness and participation Liquidity that supports future growth potential Market maker engagement in the DOGE ETF ecosystem While not record-breaking, this volume establishes a solid foundation for the DOGE ETF’s future trading activity and market presence. What This Means for Dogecoin’s Institutional Future The launch of a DOGE ETF marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency mainstream acceptance. However, the zero net inflows suggest institutional investors might be taking a wait-and-see approach. This cautious stance could change as: More track record data becomes available Market conditions for meme coins evolve Regulatory clarity improves for cryptocurrency ETFs The DOGE ETF’s performance will be closely watched as an indicator of institutional appetite for alternative digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key Takeaways from the DOGE ETF Debut The initial trading day provided valuable insights about market reception. The DOGE ETF achieved respectable volume while maintaining balance between buyers and sellers. This suggests a measured rather than speculative launch, which could benefit long-term stability. As the first spot Dogecoin ETF in the U.S. market, this Grayscale product opens new doors for cryptocurrency investment strategies. The DOGE ETF creates accessible exposure to Dogecoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Frequently Asked Questions What is a DOGE ETF? A DOGE ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning or storing it. Why were there zero net inflows? Zero net inflows occur when the amount of money entering the ETF equals the amount leaving, indicating balanced investor interest without significant new capital injection. How does this compare to other crypto ETF launches? The DOGE ETF debut showed moderate volume compared to some Bitcoin ETF launches, reflecting the different market positions of established cryptocurrencies versus meme coins. Can the DOGE ETF impact Dogecoin’s price? Yes, increased institutional access through the DOGE ETF could potentially influence Dogecoin’s price dynamics and trading patterns over time. Is the DOGE ETF available to all investors? Yes, like other ETFs, the DOGE ETF is available to any investor with access to brokerage accounts that support NYSE trading.

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has just announced an urgent temporary suspension of Worldcoin (WLD) deposits and withdrawals starting at 10:00 a.m. UTC today. This crucial Upbit WLD suspension comes as the Worldcoin network undergoes a significant hard fork upgrade, requiring enhanced security measures and technical adjustments. Why Did Upbit Implement This WLD Suspension? The primary reason behind this temporary halt is Worldcoin’s network hard fork. Hard forks represent major protocol upgrades that create permanent divergences from previous blockchain versions. Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily suspend services to ensure: Secure network transition during the upgrade process Proper wallet compatibility with the new blockchain Asset protection for all user funds Seamless integration with the updated protocol What Does This Upbit WLD Suspension Mean for Traders? While the Upbit WLD suspension affects deposit and withdrawal functions, important trading activities remain operational. Users can still: Execute WLD trading pairs on the exchange Monitor price movements and market trends Place limit and market orders Manage existing WLD holdings in their wallets However, traders should note that external WLD transfers to and from Upbit wallets will remain paused until the hard fork completes successfully. When Will Upbit Resume WLD Services? Upbit has confirmed the suspension is temporary, though the exact resumption time depends on the hard fork’s completion and subsequent network stability checks. Typically, such maintenance periods last several hours to ensure thorough testing. The exchange will provide updates through: Official website announcements Mobile app notifications Social media channels Email alerts to registered users How Can Traders Prepare During This Suspension? Smart cryptocurrency management during exchange maintenance involves several proactive steps. First, ensure you have alternative trading options if needed. Second, monitor official communication channels regularly. Moreover, avoid attempting deposits during the suspension period as transactions may fail or face delays. Finally, use this time to research the hard fork’s potential impact on WLD’s long-term value proposition. What Are the Broader Implications of This Upbit WLD Suspension? This temporary Upbit WLD suspension demonstrates the cryptocurrency industry’s maturation. Exchanges now prioritize security over convenience during critical network upgrades. Furthermore, such proactive measures help prevent potential fund losses and technical issues that previously plagued early blockchain projects. The careful handling of this hard fork reflects Upbit’s commitment to operational excellence and user asset protection. In conclusion, the temporary Upbit WLD suspension represents standard industry practice during significant network upgrades. While inconvenient for short-term transfers, this precautionary measure ultimately safeguards user assets and ensures smooth post-fork operations. The crypto community recognizes such responsible actions as essential for mainstream adoption and institutional confidence. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade WLD on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, all WLD trading pairs remain active. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. How long will the Upbit WLD suspension last? The duration depends on the hard fork completion and network stability. Typically, such suspensions last several hours to a day. Will my existing WLD funds be safe during this period? Absolutely. All user funds remain secure in cold storage during the maintenance period. Should I move my WLD to another exchange before the suspension? This isn’t necessary unless you require immediate withdrawal capabilities. The suspension is temporary and trading continues normally. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will announce the resumption through official channels including their website, app, and social media accounts. Could this suspension affect WLD’s price? Temporary suspensions during upgrades typically have minimal long-term price impact, though short-term volatility is possible. Found this update helpful?

This substantial capital movement represents one of the most significant single-day inflows for XRP spot ETFs this year, highlighting growing mainstream acceptance of digital asset investment vehicles. What Makes XRP Spot ETFs So Attractive to Investors? The recent $164 million inflow into XRP spot ETFs demonstrates several key advantages that make these investment vehicles increasingly popular. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency purchases, XRP spot ETFs offer regulated exposure to the digital asset through familiar brokerage accounts. Moreover, they provide institutional-grade security and eliminate the technical complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Investors benefit from several compelling features: Regulatory compliance and institutional oversight Simplified investment process through traditional brokerage platforms Enhanced security measures compared to personal wallet management Liquidity advantages during market volatility Breaking Down the $164 Million XRP Spot ETF Inflows According to data from SoSoValue, the November 24 inflows were distributed across four major XRP spot ETF providers. Grayscale’s GXRP led the pack with an impressive $67.36 million, followed closely by Franklin’s XRPZ at $62.59 million. The remaining inflows were split between Bitwise’s XRP fund at $17.71 million and Canary’s XRPC at $16.38 million. This distribution pattern reveals important market dynamics. The substantial allocations to established players like Grayscale and Franklin indicate that investors prefer providers with proven track records in digital asset management. However, the meaningful contributions to smaller funds suggest diversification strategies are also at play. Why Are Institutions Flocking to XRP Spot ETFs Now? The timing of these massive XRP spot ETF inflows coincides with several positive market developments. Regulatory clarity surrounding XRP has improved significantly in recent months, reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. Additionally, broader cryptocurrency market recovery and increasing adoption of blockchain technology by traditional financial institutions have created favorable conditions for XRP investment products. Several factors are driving this institutional interest: Improved regulatory outlook for XRP and digital assets Growing institutional adoption of blockchain technology Portfolio diversification benefits in uncertain economic conditions Long-term growth potential of the XRP ecosystem What This Means for the Future of XRP Spot ETFs The $164 million inflow represents more than just a single-day trading event—it signals a fundamental shift in how institutions approach XRP investment. As more traditional financial players enter the digital asset space through regulated vehicles like XRP spot ETFs, we can expect increased liquidity, improved price discovery, and enhanced market stability. This development also suggests that XRP spot ETFs are becoming mainstream investment options rather than niche products. The substantial capital allocation indicates that institutional investors now view these vehicles as legitimate components of diversified investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions What are XRP spot ETFs? XRP spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual XRP tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why are XRP spot ETFs important? These ETFs provide regulated, accessible investment vehicles for both institutional and retail investors, bridging traditional finance with digital assets. How do XRP spot ETFs differ from Bitcoin ETFs? While both are cryptocurrency ETFs, XRP spot ETFs track XRP specifically, which serves different use cases in cross-border payments and financial settlements. Are XRP spot ETFs safe investments? Like all investments, XRP spot ETFs carry risks, but they offer regulatory oversight and institutional custody that may reduce some risks associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. Can retail investors access XRP spot ETFs? Yes, retail investors can purchase shares of XRP spot ETFs through their regular brokerage accounts, similar to traditional ETFs. What factors affect XRP spot ETF performance? Performance depends on XRP price movements, market demand, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency market trends.

The sharp decline has flipped market sentiment decisively bearish, with many traders fearing that ETH has entered a prolonged downtrend. Bulls are struggling to establish a reliable support level, and the lack of strong buy-side reaction so far has only intensified uncertainty. Liquidity continues to thin out across major exchanges, reinforcing the narrative that the market is still deep in a risk-off phase. Related Reading: Anti-CZ Whale Loses Big: $61M in Profit Wiped Out As Ethereum and XRP Longs Collapse Yet, despite the heavy selling pressure and underwhelming price performance, not all major players are stepping back. In fact, some are doubling down. Fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that Tom Lee’s Bitmine — a well-known crypto-focused investment operation—continues to buy ETH aggressively at current prices. Bitmine has been one of the few entities consistently adding to its position during the downturn, signaling strong conviction that Ethereum remains undervalued in the long term. This divergence between retail fear and whale accumulation is becoming increasingly notable. As ETH hovers around a critical psychological level, the coming days may determine whether this whale’s confidence translates into broader market stabilization or remains an isolated bet against the prevailing trend. Bitmine’s Aggressive Accumulation Signals Confidence According to Lookonchain, Tom Lee’s Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation, purchasing another 28,625 ETH worth $82.11 million. This move reinforces the growing narrative that some of the market’s most sophisticated players are positioning for a rebound despite the prevailing fear and relentless selling pressure. Large-scale buying during deep corrections has historically aligned with early reversal zones, and Bitmine’s conviction adds weight to the idea that Ethereum may be approaching a significant turning point. Still, a recovery is far from guaranteed. ETH remains trapped near the $2,800 zone, a level that has acted as a fragile line of defense during this downturn. For momentum to shift, Ethereum must not only hold this area but also reclaim the $3,000 mark, which has now flipped into an important resistance zone. A decisive move above this level would signal that buyers are finally stepping back in with strength, potentially setting the stage for a broader trend reversal. Until then, the situation remains delicate. Bitmine’s accumulation offers a bullish signal, but without confirmation from price structure, Ethereum continues to walk a tightrope. A failure to hold current levels could invite another wave of capitulation, but stability here may spark the rebound whales seem to be anticipating.

Price has now pulled back to around $2,800, a level that aligns closely with the 200-week moving average—a historically important area where ETH has often found long-term support. This zone previously acted as a launchpad during major market reversals in both 2022 and mid-2023, making its defense crucial for maintaining broader structural strength. The recent breakdown below the 50- and 100-week moving averages highlights the intensity of the current selloff. Momentum clearly shifted in favor of bears over the past weeks, with several large red candles confirming aggressive distribution. However, ETH’s current stabilization attempt above the 200-week MA signals that buyers are finally stepping in, preventing a deeper slide toward $2,400.

He told listeners that a clear US regulatory framework and a formal banking license for Ripple would be the real switch that unlocks big institutional interest in XRP . That idea is getting attention in crypto markets today. CEO Sees Ripple As A Bank Gilbertie compared Ripple’s organization to a financial institution with strong capital and coordinated leadership. He pointed out that Ripple’s network includes many former employees who stay active in the wider ecosystem, which he said helps the company expand even when people move on. According to Gilbertie, the firm functions much like “a machine.” He also asked a sharp question about token sales: “Why would they want to sell XRP? They’re incredibly well capitalized.” That comment was offered to calm concerns that Ripple might flood the market with tokens. Ripple’s Token Strategy And Reserves Based on reports , Gilbertie believes Ripple has less motive to sell large amounts of XRP as its balance sheet grows and use cases for the token increase. He framed XRP as a tool that could be used by institutional clients and a bank, noting that holding tokens could be similar to how banks keep capital reserves. Critics point out Ripple has sold XRP in the past to fund operations. But Gilbertie argued that a licensed Ripple Bank would change how those holdings are treated and how often they are moved. Regulatory Clarity And A Banking License Regulatory clarity in the US is central to Gilbertie’s view. He said that a banking license , combined with clear rules, would open doors to products and clients who now wait on the sidelines. That is the milestone he expects will have the most direct impact on price and demand. Until regulators spell out how these services will work, many institutional buyers remain cautious. Market Moves And Volatility Volatility has marked XRP’s recent path. Reports noted that some market swings are part of a broader trend where assets that surged by “hundreds of percent” in the prior year then give back gains. Gilbertie described a 30–50% pullback as natural after big rallies. He added that falling volatility in major assets, plus more institutional entry through ETFs and a friendlier US administration toward crypto, may make markets calmer over time as more supply is held by long-term owners.

This strategic move could significantly enhance liquidity and trading efficiency in these emerging markets, creating new opportunities for investors and traders alike. What Does a Market Maker Actually Do? A market maker plays a crucial role in financial ecosystems by providing continuous buy and sell orders. This ensures that traders can execute transactions quickly and at stable prices. For decentralized prediction markets, having a reliable market maker like Galaxy Digital means better pricing and smoother trading experiences for everyone involved. Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital’s CEO, revealed they’re currently testing market making operations on a small scale. This cautious approach allows them to understand the unique dynamics of prediction markets before committing larger resources. The company’s extensive experience in cryptocurrency markets positions them perfectly for this expansion. Why Are Prediction Markets Gaining Traction? Prediction markets represent one of blockchain’s most promising use cases. They allow people to bet on real-world events, from election outcomes to weather patterns. However, these markets often struggle with liquidity issues that can deter participation. Enhanced price discovery through continuous liquidity Reduced spreads between buy and sell orders Increased market depth for larger trades Improved overall market stability Galaxy Digital’s entry as a market maker could solve these challenges. Their involvement brings institutional credibility and substantial capital, which typically leads to more efficient markets. This development signals growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets as legitimate financial instruments. What Challenges Do Market Makers Face? While the opportunities are significant, market making in prediction markets presents unique hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern, as different jurisdictions view prediction markets differently. Additionally, the volatile nature of event outcomes requires sophisticated risk management strategies. Galaxy Digital’s gradual approach demonstrates their understanding of these complexities. By starting small and scaling carefully, they can develop robust systems to handle market fluctuations and regulatory requirements. This methodical expansion reflects their commitment to sustainable growth in this emerging sector. How Will This Impact Crypto Traders? The involvement of established firms like Galaxy Digital brings multiple benefits to individual traders. Better liquidity means you can enter and exit positions more easily. Tighter spreads reduce trading costs, while increased market depth allows for larger positions without significant price impact. Moreover, institutional participation often precedes broader market adoption. As more reputable companies enter the prediction market space, we can expect improved infrastructure, enhanced security measures, and potentially clearer regulatory frameworks. These developments create a more trustworthy environment for all participants. What’s Next for Prediction Markets? The future looks bright for decentralized prediction platforms. With Galaxy Digital’s potential market making role, we’re likely to see increased competition and innovation in this space. Other institutional players may follow suit, leading to rapid market maturation and expanded use cases. This evolution could transform how we approach risk assessment and information aggregation. Prediction markets have the potential to become valuable tools for businesses, researchers, and policymakers seeking crowd-sourced insights about future events. Frequently Asked Questions What is a market maker in simple terms? A market maker is a company or individual that continuously provides buy and sell prices for assets, ensuring there’s always someone to trade with and helping maintain market liquidity. Why is Galaxy Digital’s involvement significant? As a well-established cryptocurrency firm, their participation brings credibility, capital, and expertise that can help prediction markets grow and become more accessible to mainstream users. How will this affect trading fees? Increased competition and better liquidity typically lead to lower spreads, which means reduced trading costs for individual participants over time. Are prediction markets legal? Regulations vary by jurisdiction. Some countries allow prediction markets for certain types of events, while others restrict them. Always check local laws before participating. When will Galaxy Digital start market making? The company is currently in discussions and testing phases. While no specific timeline has been announced, their gradual approach suggests careful planning before full-scale implementation. Can individual traders benefit from this development? Yes, better market making typically results in improved trading conditions, including tighter spreads, better liquidity, and more stable prices for all market participants.

Japan and South Korea led regional advances as Tokyo reopened after a holiday, while US shares had climbed at Monday’s close when tech stocks extended their recovery from last week’s slump and traders positioned for a busy data calendar. A gauge of Chinese companies listed in New York rose 2.8% after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held their first talks since agreeing a tariff truce last month.

The update reinforced the market’s sense that big tech remains at the centre of both the artificial intelligence trade and broader risk sentiment. $META IS REPORTEDLY IN ADVANCED TALKS TO DEPLOY $GOOGLE TPUS ACROSS ITS DATA CENTERS IN A DEAL THAT COULD BE WORTH BILLIONS. pic.twitter.com/RChQTsXduG — Shay Boloor (@StockSavvyShay) November 24, 2025 The major US indexes started the holiday-shortened week with solid advances, with strength in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of AI-related momentum stocks once again putting the Nasdaq in front. Signals from the Fed added fuel to the rebound. Fed Governor Christopher Waller lifted spirits on Monday by signalling support for a rate cut next month, helping to ease nerves after a choppy spell driven by worries over stretched AI related valuations and uncertainty about the policy path. Some investors now see November’s pullback as a possible prelude to a seasonal rally into year end. Dovish Signals From Multiple Fed Voices Push Rate Bets Higher Waller’s comments followed similar remarks from other policymakers. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly voiced support for a December cut in a television interview, while New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday that a near term reduction in borrowing costs remained on the table, reinforcing the market’s tilt toward easier policy. US 10-year Treasury yields slipped four basis points to about 4.02% on Monday as rate expectations shifted. Money markets now imply roughly a 90% chance that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate at the December meeting, a sharp change from the more hesitant pricing seen only weeks ago and a backdrop that tends to favour assets such as growth stocks and Bitcoin. Attention now turns to a full slate of economic releases. Ahead of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, September retail sales data due Tuesday are expected to show some cooling as households continue to wrestle with high prices. Producer prices and durable goods orders are also on the docket this week, while jobless claims covering the key November survey week will carry extra weight as the Fed leans on alternative indicators in the absence of regular payroll figures. Economic Reports Strengthen Market View That A December Cut Is Likely A batch of economic reports, released with a delay after a six-week government shutdown, has pointed to a softer labour market alongside stubborn inflation. That mix has strengthened the case in markets that the Fed can deliver what many see as a third and final rate cut of 2025 at the December meeting. Earnings have added support. By Friday, nearly 95% of S&P500 companies had reported third-quarter results, with about 83% beating estimates. Analysts now expect aggregate earnings growth of 14.7% for the quarter, compared with an 8.8% forecast at the start of October, according to LSEG data, giving equity bulls another reason to stay engaged. Crypto analysts are watching how Bitcoin trades against this backdrop. In a pattern seen earlier in 2025, the token has once again peaked ahead of major equity benchmarks, a sequence that some read as a warning that traditional markets could still face another leg of correction even as they bounce. Analysts at Bitfinex said recent on-chain data show a heavy wave of loss-taking, reflecting how top-heavy the market has become, with dense concentrations of buying between $106,000 and $118,000 now capitulating at a loss. They argued that this structure leaves two broad paths, either a strong resurgence in demand steps in to absorb ongoing selling, or the market is pushed into a longer and potentially deeper accumulation phase before it can find a more stable equilibrium.

The cryptocurrency perpetual futures market just experienced exactly that – a staggering $235 million in crypto futures liquidations that primarily devastated short sellers across major digital assets. What Caused These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations? The past 24 hours delivered a brutal lesson in leverage trading as crypto futures liquidations reached alarming levels. When prices move sharply against positioned traders, exchanges automatically close their leveraged positions to prevent further losses. This creates a cascade effect that amplifies market movements and creates tremendous pressure on both sides. Bitcoin led the carnage with $123 million in crypto futures liquidations, while Ethereum followed with $78.67 million. Solana traders faced even more severe consequences relative to its market size. The overwhelming majority of these crypto futures liquidations came from traders betting against the market. Which Assets Suffered the Worst Crypto Futures Liquidations? The distribution of pain across different cryptocurrencies reveals fascinating patterns about market sentiment and positioning: Bitcoin : $123 million total, with 66.42% short positions Ethereum : $78.67 million total, with 71.46% short positions Solana : $33.60 million total, with 84.96% short positions These crypto futures liquidations demonstrate how crowded short trades became before the market moved against them. Solana’s extreme percentage suggests traders were particularly bearish on the asset, leading to catastrophic results when prices rallied. Why Did Short Positions Dominate the Liquidation Wave? Market dynamics created a perfect storm for short sellers. When too many traders bet against an asset, any upward price movement triggers margin calls and forced position closures. These crypto futures liquidations then fuel further buying pressure as exchanges cover the short positions, creating a vicious cycle that amplifies the original move. The dominance of short positions in these crypto futures liquidations indicates widespread bearish sentiment that got caught wrong-footed. Traders likely anticipated price declines but instead faced a sharp reversal that obliterated their leveraged bets. How Can Traders Avoid Future Crypto Futures Liquidations? Surviving volatile markets requires disciplined risk management strategies. These recent crypto futures liquidations offer valuable lessons for all traders: Use appropriate position sizing to avoid over-leverage Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Monitor funding rates for crowded trade warnings Maintain adequate margin buffers for volatility spikes Understanding market sentiment extremes can help identify when crypto futures liquidations might occur. When too many traders lean one direction, the risk of violent reversals increases dramatically. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Signal for Market Health? While painful for affected traders, large-scale crypto futures liquidations actually serve an important market function. They help reset excessive leverage and restore balance between buyers and sellers. The market emerges healthier after flushing out overextended positions, though the process remains brutal for those caught in the crossfire. These crypto futures liquidations also demonstrate the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency markets. The mechanisms work similarly to traditional futures markets, providing price discovery while managing counterparty risk through automated position closures. Conclusion: Learning From the $235M Liquidation Lesson The devastating wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a stark reminder about the risks of leveraged trading. While the opportunity for amplified returns attracts many traders, the reality of sudden position closures can wipe out accounts in moments. The $235 million lesson teaches us that market sentiment extremes often precede violent corrections, and proper risk management remains the key to longevity in crypto trading. Frequently Asked Questions What are crypto futures liquidations? Crypto futures liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close leveraged positions because traders can no longer meet margin requirements, preventing further losses. Why were short positions hit harder in these liquidations? Short positions dominated because most traders were betting against price increases before the market moved upward, triggering massive position closures. How can I avoid getting liquidated in crypto futures? Use proper risk management, avoid over-leveraging, set stop-loss orders, and maintain adequate margin buffers for volatility. Which cryptocurrency saw the highest percentage of short liquidations? Solana experienced the most extreme short dominance with 84.96% of its $33.60 million liquidations coming from short positions. Do large liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, large liquidations can amplify price movements as exchanges automatically buy or sell to close positions, creating additional market pressure. Are crypto futures liquidations common? Liquidations occur regularly in volatile markets, but $235 million events represent significant market moves that reset excessive leverage.

The cryptocurrency community was buzzing with rumors about preferential terms, but the truth might surprise you. Let’s dive into the real story behind the Berachain investment controversy that’s making waves in the crypto space. What Really Happened with the Berachain Investment? Berachain has firmly denied allegations that it offered preferential investment refund terms to Brevan Howard. The controversy started when Unchained published an article claiming Brevan Howard’s 2024 investment agreement included a unique refund clause. However, anonymous Berachain founder Smokey The Bera took to X to set the record straight about this Berachain investment situation. The founder explained that Brevan Howard participated in the Series B round approximately 1.5 years ago through its Abu Dhabi-based Nova fund. Importantly, they emphasized that all investors received the same basic terms. This clarification addresses the core of the Berachain investment controversy directly. Understanding the Side Letter Agreement So where did the confusion come from? The founder acknowledged that Nova’s $25 million investment did include a side letter with specific provisions. However, this wasn’t about special privileges. The side letter granted Nova the right to request a refund one year after the Token Generation Event (TGE). This arrangement serves as protection for the fund’s principal investment. If the BERA token price falls significantly below the $3 investment price, Nova can recover its initial capital. The founder stressed this was a mutual agreement tied to the fund’s operating requirements. Why This Berachain Investment Matters for Crypto The transparency around this Berachain investment situation sets an important precedent for cryptocurrency projects. Here’s what makes this case significant: Investor confidence: Clear communication builds trust in the project Industry standards: Sets expectations for future crypto investments Regulatory clarity: Demonstrates proper disclosure practices Market stability: Reduces uncertainty for token holders This approach to handling the Berachain investment controversy shows maturity in how crypto projects manage investor relations. The Bigger Picture for Berachain Investment Strategy Looking beyond the current controversy, the Berachain investment strategy appears focused on long-term growth. The project’s handling of this situation demonstrates their commitment to fair treatment of all investors. The clarification about the Berachain investment terms shows they’re building for sustainable development rather than quick gains. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, transparent communication about investment terms becomes increasingly crucial. The way Berachain addressed these allegations could become a model for other projects facing similar scrutiny. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main allegation against Berachain? The main allegation claimed Berachain offered preferential refund terms to Brevan Howard that weren’t available to other investors. How did Berachain respond to the allegations? Berachain firmly denied the claims, stating that Brevan Howard invested under the same conditions as all other Series B participants. What is the side letter mentioned in the controversy? The side letter allowed Brevan Howard’s Nova fund to request a refund one year after token launch if the price fell significantly below their $3 investment price. Was this refund clause a special privilege? According to Berachain, this was not a special privilege but a mutual agreement related to the fund’s operating rules and liquidity requirements. How much did Brevan Howard invest in Berachain? Brevan Howard’s Nova fund invested $25 million in Berachain’s Series B round approximately 1.5 years ago. What does this mean for other Berachain investors? The clarification suggests all investors were treated equally, with the side letter being specific to institutional fund requirements rather than preferential treatment.

This strategic partnership marks a significant milestone in the evolution of regulated real-world assets on blockchain, bringing institutional-grade financial products to the decentralized ecosystem. Why Plume Network Stands Out in the Blockchain Space Plume Network has positioned itself as a specialized blockchain focusing exclusively on regulated real-world assets. The platform’s selection as the primary launch network for USDG0 demonstrates its growing influence in the digital asset space. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid and Aptos join as additional launch networks, creating a powerful trifecta for stablecoin deployment. The Plume Network ecosystem benefits tremendously from this partnership. Developers gain access to native liquidity and a regulated stablecoin foundation, while users enjoy exposure to U.S. Treasury rates through on-chain yield structures. This integration represents a major step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized applications. What Makes USDG0 Different From Other Stablecoins? USDG0 represents an expanded, cross-chain version of Paxos’s existing USDG stablecoin, which already boasts an impressive $997 million market capitalization. The key differentiators include: Full reserve-backing with regulatory oversight Cross-chain functionality using LayerZero’s OFT standard Direct exposure to U.S. Treasury yields Regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions The utilization of LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard enables seamless transfers between different blockchains. This technological foundation ensures that USDG0 maintains its value and regulatory status regardless of which blockchain it operates on. How Will Plume Network Transform DeFi Development? The integration of USDG0 into Plume Network creates unprecedented opportunities for DeFi developers. They now have access to a regulated stablecoin liquidity base that combines the security of traditional finance with the innovation of blockchain technology. This partnership addresses one of the biggest challenges in DeFi – the need for reliable, regulated stable assets. Developers building on Plume Network can leverage several key advantages: Native liquidity for faster transaction processing Regulatory clarity for compliant application development Yield opportunities tied to traditional financial instruments Cross-chain interoperability for broader user reach The Future of Regulated Assets on Blockchain This partnership between Plume Network and Paxos signals a broader trend toward regulated financial products entering the blockchain space. The combination of real-world asset tokenization with stablecoin technology creates a powerful foundation for the next generation of financial applications. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, platforms like Plume Network that prioritize compliance while maintaining decentralization will likely lead the market. The successful implementation of USDG0 on Plume Network could set a new standard for how traditional financial instruments integrate with blockchain technology. This development represents a crucial step toward mass adoption of decentralized finance by providing the security and reliability that institutional and retail investors demand. Frequently Asked Questions What is Plume Network’s main focus? Plume Network specializes in regulated real-world assets (RWA) on blockchain, providing a compliant platform for tokenizing traditional financial instruments. How is USDG0 different from other stablecoins? USDG0 is fully reserve-backed, regulated, and uses LayerZero’s OFT standard for cross-chain functionality while offering exposure to U.S. Treasury yields. Which other networks will launch USDG0? Besides Plume Network as the primary launch platform, Hyperliquid and Aptos will also serve as launch networks for the stablecoin. What benefits does USDG0 bring to DeFi developers? Developers gain access to regulated stablecoin liquidity, native yield structures, and cross-chain interoperability for their applications. Is USDG0 available on multiple blockchains? Yes, through LayerZero’s OFT standard, USDG0 can transfer seamlessly between different blockchain networks while maintaining its value and regulatory status. What is the current market cap of Paxos’s existing USDG? The current USDG stablecoin has a market capitalization of $997 million, demonstrating significant market trust and adoption.

The US spot Bitcoin ETFs just recorded a shocking $145.4 million net outflow, reversing the previous day’s gains and sending ripples through the digital asset market. This significant shift in investor sentiment demands immediate attention from anyone involved in Bitcoin ETFs. What Caused the Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Surge? According to data from TraderT, the outflow pattern reveals crucial insights about institutional behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest withdrawal at $143.48 million, representing the majority of the total outflow. This massive movement from one of the world’s largest asset managers signals potential concerns about short-term Bitcoin ETF performance. Other major players also contributed to the outflow trend. Ark Investment’s ARKB saw $11.65 million exit, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded a $5.79 million withdrawal. The coordinated nature of these outflows suggests broader market forces at play rather than isolated investor decisions. Is There Any Positive News for Bitcoin ETFs? Despite the overwhelming outflow trend, Fidelity’s FBTC emerged as the lone bright spot. The fund attracted $15.49 million in net inflows, demonstrating that some investors remain confident in specific Bitcoin ETFs. This divergence in performance highlights the importance of fund selection even within the same asset class. The market for Bitcoin ETFs continues to show volatility as investors weigh various factors: Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency Broader market conditions and risk appetite Specific fund management strategies and track records Short-term price movements in underlying Bitcoin assets What Do These Bitcoin ETFs Movements Mean for Investors? The sudden return to outflows after just one day of net inflows indicates ongoing uncertainty in the Bitcoin ETF space. This volatility pattern suggests that investors are actively rebalancing their positions rather than making long-term commitments to these Bitcoin ETFs. For current investors in Bitcoin ETFs, this development serves as a crucial reminder to monitor fund flows regularly. The concentration of outflows in specific funds like BlackRock’s IBIT underscores the need for diversified exposure across multiple Bitcoin ETFs to mitigate single-fund risk. How Should You Approach Bitcoin ETFs Now? The recent $145.4 million outflow from Bitcoin ETFs doesn’t necessarily signal a long-term trend reversal. However, it does emphasize the importance of understanding fund-specific dynamics within the broader Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Smart investors should consider both the quantitative data and qualitative factors when evaluating their Bitcoin ETF positions. Key considerations for Bitcoin ETF investors include: Track fund flow patterns over multiple periods Analyze fund manager reputation and strategy Monitor overall market sentiment toward Bitcoin Consider dollar-cost averaging to manage volatility Final Thoughts on Bitcoin ETFs Market Movement The $145.4 million net outflow from US spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency investments. While short-term fluctuations can be concerning, they also present opportunities for informed investors who understand the underlying market mechanics of Bitcoin ETFs. The divergence between Fidelity’s inflows and other funds’ outflows suggests that selective investment strategies may outperform broad market approaches in the volatile Bitcoin ETF space. As always, thorough research and careful position sizing remain essential for navigating these digital asset waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly holding digital assets. Why did Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? The outflows likely resulted from investor profit-taking, market uncertainty, or portfolio rebalancing strategies amid changing market conditions. Should I be worried about investing in Bitcoin ETFs? While outflows indicate short-term sentiment shifts, they don’t necessarily reflect long-term prospects. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Which Bitcoin ETF performed best during the outflow period? Fidelity’s FBTC was the only fund to record net inflows, attracting $15.49 million while others experienced withdrawals. How often do Bitcoin ETFs experience significant outflows? Bitcoin ETFs can experience regular flow fluctuations based on market conditions, though $145 million represents a substantial single-day movement. Can I still invest in Bitcoin ETFs after this outflow? Yes, outflows don’t prevent new investments. However, investors should research current market conditions and fund specifics before committing capital. Found this analysis of Bitcoin ETFs outflow helpful?

Prices fell more than 30% from an October peak near $126,000 to around $85,500, and that slump has cut the value of the coins believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto by roughly $41 billion. Related Reading: Kiyosaki Dumps Bitcoin At $90K After Predicting A $250K Moonshot – Here’s Why Satoshi’s On-Chain Holdings Under Scrutiny According to on-chain analysts, about 1.1 million BTC are attributed to Satoshi by patterns seen in early mining. Reports have disclosed that this total was worth about $138 billion at Bitcoin’s October high. Based on current prices, those holdings are now estimated at close to $96 billion. That places the pseudonymous owner below US billionaire Bill Gates, who is estimated at about $104 billion. These figures are estimates, and the methods used to tie addresses to the creator are debated. Early Mining Pattern Still Contested Arkham Intelligence and other blockchain researchers point to the so-called Patoshi Pattern as the key evidence linking many early blocks to one actor. The pattern is a technical signature in the way early blocks were mined. It is not proof of identity. Some experts say the pattern strongly suggests a single miner was responsible for many of the earliest coins. Source: Arkham Others caution that assumptions about ownership must be treated carefully. The wallets in question have been largely inactive for years. That inactivity makes the idea of liquidating such a stake more theoretical than practical. Market Volatility Highlights Paper Wealth Risk A lesson here is simple. When most of a fortune is in one asset, swings in price move the headline number a lot. The $41 billion drop is a paper loss. No sale was reported. The funds remain where they have been for years. Still, the change in valuation has pushed Satoshi down in hypothetical rich lists compiled by observers and crypto outlets. Wealth trackers that require verified identities, like Forbes, do not include Satoshi because the ownership and identity are not confirmed. Long-Term Questions Remain Based on reports, the discussion also revived talk about what dormant crypto holdings mean for public measures of wealth. Some commentators raised more speculative concerns, such as future technical threats that could affect custody of private keys. Those scenarios are distant and uncertain, and they remain a matter for technical debate rather than immediate reality. Related Reading: $2 Billion Gone In Minutes: Bitcoin Slide Shakes Crypto World What This Means For The Market Traders watching Bitcoin see how much headline numbers can swing. A 30% move in a few weeks changes math dramatically. Investors who focus on stable, diversified holdings might view this as another reminder of crypto’s big swings. For now, Satoshi Nakamoto remains silent, as always, despite his/her massive loss; and the coins attributed to the enigmatic crypto creator sit largely untouched — and their paper value will rise or fall with Bitcoin’s next moves.

According to the report, 150 million XRP was moved to an unidentified wallet. The transfer, valued at approximately 317 million USD at the time of execution, was recorded on November 24, 2025, and classified as originating from a wallet linked to Ripple . Although transfers of this magnitude are not unprecedented, they often attract scrutiny because of the influence such movements can have on perceptions of corporate activity, treasury management, and liquidity conditions. 150,000,000 #XRP (317,388,174 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/TOYGW2aejB — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 24, 2025 Details of the Transaction The transaction was executed on the XRP Ledger with a minimal fee of 0.0004 units, consistent with the network’s low-cost design. Whale Alert’s post listed the transfer as “from Ripple to unknown wallet,” indicating that the receiving address is not publicly identified or labelled within major tracking systems. Transfers from known institutional or corporate wallets to unlabeled accounts typically raise questions about the underlying purpose, especially when involving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of tokens. At the moment the transfer was detected, the asset was priced at approximately 2.1265 USD, placing the total value at just over 317 million USD. Potential Interpretations Behind the Movement Although the alert does not explain the transaction’s intent, several common scenarios may apply. One possibility is that this represents an internal treasury operation, such as shifting assets between custodial environments, redistributing holdings for security purposes, or preparing reserves for corporate activities. These kinds of transfers often occur without external announcements. The receiving wallet may be part of Ripple’s broader internal infrastructure, even if not publicly labeled as such. Another plausible interpretation is that the tokens were moved to a custody partner or institutional entity. Large asset managers, financial institutions, or liquidity providers sometimes receive high-value transfers. Such movements may precede operational uses. Without an exchange tag or identifiable institutional label on the receiving account, the purpose remains unclear. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A further possibility is that the transfer could be associated with over-the-counter arrangements. OTC activity is often conducted using wallets that are not publicly associated with exchanges, and high-value transfers may occur without immediate reflection on open market order books. In these cases, the size of the movement does not necessarily imply imminent market impact. Market and Ledger Context There has been no indication from public data that the transfer immediately preceded unusual price movement or abnormal liquidity shifts on major trading venues. Additionally, on-chain metrics are yet to display a pattern of redistribution from the receiving address, though this may change as further ledger activity develops. As with similar movements in the past, the absence of a clear label for the destination wallet means that definitive conclusions cannot be drawn solely from the alert.

This significant movement, recorded on November 24th, marks the second consecutive day of positive momentum for Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds, signaling renewed institutional confidence in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. What Drove the ETH ETF Inflow Surge? The recent ETH ETF inflow data reveals a dramatic shift in investor sentiment. After ten consecutive days of outflows, BlackRock’s ETHA fund led the charge with an impressive $88.22 million inflow. This reversal suggests that institutional investors are once again betting on Ethereum’s long-term potential. The timing of this inflow surge coincides with broader market recovery signals, making it particularly noteworthy for crypto enthusiasts. Several factors likely contributed to this ETH ETF momentum shift: Improved market conditions for cryptocurrencies Growing institutional adoption of Ethereum Attractive entry points after recent price corrections Positive regulatory developments surrounding crypto ETFs Which ETH ETF Performers Stood Out? While BlackRock dominated the ETH ETF inflows, other players showed varied performance. Grayscale’s Mini ETH fund recorded $9.81 million in net inflows, demonstrating continued interest in alternative Ethereum investment products. Meanwhile, 21Shares’ CETH attracted $740,000, showing that smaller funds still maintain relevance in the competitive ETH ETF landscape. However, not all ETH ETF products shared in the positive momentum. Fidelity’s FETH experienced $2.23 million in outflows, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $4.26 million exit. This mixed performance across different ETH ETF offerings highlights the selective nature of current institutional investment strategies. Why Does This ETH ETF Momentum Matter? The consecutive days of positive ETH ETF flows represent more than just numbers—they signal a potential shift in market sentiment. When institutional giants like BlackRock reverse outflow trends, it often indicates broader market confidence. This ETH ETF performance could foreshadow increased mainstream adoption and potentially influence Ethereum’s price trajectory in the coming weeks. Moreover, the ETH ETF data provides valuable insights for retail investors considering Ethereum exposure. The institutional vote of confidence through ETH ETF investments suggests that professional money managers see long-term value in Ethereum’s technology and ecosystem development. What’s Next for ETH ETF Investments? Looking ahead, the ETH ETF market appears poised for continued evolution. The recent inflow patterns suggest that investors are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to cryptocurrency exposure. As regulatory clarity improves and more traditional financial players enter the space, we can expect further diversification of ETH ETF products and strategies. The current ETH ETF landscape demonstrates that despite market volatility, institutional interest in Ethereum remains strong. This bodes well for the future of cryptocurrency adoption and could pave the way for more innovative financial products centered around blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions What is an ETH ETF? An ETH ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Why did BlackRock’s ETH ETF see such large inflows? BlackRock’s ETH ETF attracted $88.22 million due to renewed institutional confidence, attractive pricing after recent outflows, and the fund’s strong reputation among traditional investors. Are ETH ETFs a good investment? ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum, making them suitable for investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles over direct cryptocurrency ownership. How do ETH ETF flows affect Ethereum’s price? Significant ETH ETF inflows can create buying pressure on underlying Ethereum assets, potentially supporting price appreciation over time. Which companies offer ETH ETFs? Major providers include BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, and Bitwise, each offering different ETH ETF products with varying features. Can I invest in ETH ETFs outside the US? ETH ETF availability varies by country, with some nations offering similar products while others restrict cryptocurrency-based investment funds.

On the other hand, $156 million was taken from Solana’s funds, and $1.27 billion was taken from Bitcoin’s funds. The subsequent largest outflow was $589 million for ether. In the meantime, Nansen’s “smart money” traders placed optimistic short-term bets on XRP while holding $325 million in bearish Bitcoin positions. The late-week inflows suggest that mood may gradually stabilize, but the significant withdrawals indicate short-term bearish pressure on BTC. After the current sell-off, Bitcoin might regain steam if inflows persist. Bitkub Plans Hong Kong IPO as Thai Markets Hit 5-Year Lows According to Bloomberg, Bitkub, Thailand’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is considering an IPO in Hong Kong rather than Thailand due to the extreme weakness of the local stock market. Through the planned IPO the company hopes to raise $200 million. Bitkub was established in 2018 and now manages a daily trade volume of about $66 million. The exchange’s initial intentions to go public in Thailand in 2025 have faltered. Due to trade concerns and political problems with Cambodia, Thailand’s stock market has suffered this year, dropping 10% and hitting a five-year low. Over $3 billion in Thai stocks has already been sold by foreign investors in 2025. Hong Kong, meanwhile, is seeing a surge in initial public offerings. In the first ten months of 2025, the city raised approximately $28 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs), a 209% increase over the previous year. Major cryptocurrency companies like HashKey Group and Bitcoin Depot are also drawn to its rapidly expanding digital asset sector.

This promotes a positive long-term attitude for Bitcoin and boosts Asia’s role in its adoption. JPMorgan Closes Strike CEO’s Accounts, Reviving Crypto Debanking Concerns In September, Jack Mallers, CEO of the Bitcoin payments app Strike, had his bank accounts abruptly frozen by JPMorgan Chase, which rekindled concerns about the “debanking” era of cryptocurrency. Mallers claimed the bank told him they were “not allowed to” reveal the cause of the closure, and refused to explain. According to a letter from JPMorgan, “concerning activity” was found during standard Bank Secrecy Act surveillance. Mallers’ banking is now located at Strike. The event reminds us of past times when U.S. banks denied services to cryptocurrency firms. Regulators have frequently pressured banks to stay away from high-risk sectors, such as cryptocurrency, under both the Obama and Biden administrations. President Donald Trump has yet to take action to buck this tendency. JPMorgan Chase abruptly closed Strike CEO Jack Mallers’ accounts, citing “concerning activity,” reigniting crypto debanking fears. @micahvzimmerman with more: https://t.co/UNZRTwtvNr — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 24, 2025 He issued an executive order in August that required authorities to investigate and penalize banks that unfairly refuse services to prevent “politicized debanking.” According to Trump officials, these actions targeted Trump’s family and cryptocurrency companies. The event supports Bitcoin’s central narrative: it is censorship-resistant and self-custodial. The long-term outlook may be bolstered by growing faith in Bitcoin as a new form of currency, as more crypto leaders face bank closures. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $94K Recovery as Channel Pressure Eases Bitcoin is stabilizing after rebounding from the $86,800 Fibonacci support, with buyers defending key levels following weeks of heavy selling. The daily chart shows BTC trading inside a descending channel, with resistance at $94,000, a confluence of the 20-day EMA and the 0.236 Fibonacci level. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is improving as the RSI recovers from oversold conditions near 30, showing early bullish divergence. A breakout above $90,800 could confirm a short-term reversal and open the path toward $94,000 and $97,000, which align with key retracement levels. If this pattern evolves into a falling wedge, the next upside target sits near $107,000, marking a full recovery from November’s decline. Holding above $86,800 keeps the bullish setup intact, offering limited downside with strong rebound potential. A close above $97,000 could reignite momentum toward the $100,000 mark, signaling renewed optimism heading into December’s trading cycle. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

Galaxy, which has built its brand around providing crypto infrastructure and services to institutional clients, would act as a market-maker on the platforms, posting regular bids and offers to deepen trading. Novogratz told Bloomberg in a recent interview that the firm is “doing some small-scale experimenting with market-making on prediction markets, but I think you’ll eventually see us providing broader liquidity.” Prediction Markets Surge As Traders Bet On Real-World Outcomes Prediction markets have grown rapidly in recent months, offering binary contracts tied to outcomes such as elections, sports results and key economic events. Traders buy “yes” or “no” shares on specific questions, with prices reflecting the crowd’s implied probability that a given outcome will occur. Bloomberg reports that Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says the firm is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi to provide liquidity in prediction markets, having already begun small-scale market-making experiments with plans to expand. Jump Trading has also quietly started making… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 25, 2025 The regulatory backdrop remains patchy. Some US states argue that prediction markets fall under gambling laws, while at the federal level the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees event contracts, has so far not stepped in to shut down the activity on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. Unlike traditional sportsbooks, which take the opposite side of customer bets, Polymarket and Kalshi run largely peer-to-peer order books. To buy “yes” on a market, a trader needs someone willing to hold the corresponding “no” position, which makes liquidity providers and active market makers central to the user experience. Both platforms have rolled out incentive schemes that reward participants who post orders in specific markets. Major Trading Firms Start Testing The Waters In Prediction Markets For years, event markets were too small to attract major trading firms. Susquehanna International Group has been one of the few players to publicly acknowledge its role as a market maker on Kalshi. Some exchanges also operate internal market-making entities to meet demand. Kalshi runs a unit called Kalshi Trading that trades against customers. The company says the desk is walled off and has no access to non-public information generated by the exchange. Polymarket, which originally built much of its volume outside the US, has started live testing its US exchange this month. The platform has quietly onboarded a limited group of users and is matching real trades as it prepares for a broader relaunch in the domestic betting market. Sector Matures As Tech Platforms And Liquidity Providers Step In Interest in wagering on real-world outcomes has risen since the last US presidential election, with traders treating prediction markets as both a speculative outlet and an informal polling tool. Liquidity from firms like Galaxy would make it easier for larger tickets to move through the order book without causing sharp price swings. Big tech is also helping to pull the sector into the mainstream. Google Finance recently said it will begin showing live data from Polymarket and Kalshi in the coming weeks, allowing users to ask about future events and see how the crowd is pricing the odds. For crypto natives and traditional investors alike, that kind of visibility could make prediction markets feel less like a niche experiment and more like a regular part of the market landscape.

Meanwhile, the US dollar maintains its stability ahead of a crucial week filled with economic indicators that could reshape global currency dynamics. Why are Asian currencies muted in current market conditions? Most Asian currencies traded within narrow ranges as investors weighed the implications of potential monetary policy shifts. The cautious sentiment reflects several key factors: Growing expectations for December rate cut actions by major central banks Uncertainty surrounding global economic growth prospects Technical resistance levels limiting upward momentum Seasonal factors affecting trading volumes and market participation How rate cut expectations are reshaping the forex market The increasing probability of December rate cut moves has created a complex environment for currency traders. Market participants are closely monitoring central bank communications and economic indicators for clues about future monetary policy directions. Currency Current Status Rate Cut Probability Japanese Yen Range-bound Moderate Chinese Yuan Stable Low Indian Rupee Moderate pressure High Australian Dollar Mixed signals Medium Dollar steady position before crucial economic data releases The US dollar remains dollar steady as traders await a significant wave of economic data that could determine short-term currency directions. Key indicators scheduled for release include inflation figures, employment data, and manufacturing reports that will provide critical insights into the health of the US economy. What economic data matters most for currency traders? Several key economic data points are commanding market attention this week. These indicators will significantly influence the forex market and potentially trigger substantial currency movements: Inflation reports from major economies Employment and unemployment figures Central bank meeting minutes and statements Manufacturing and services PMI data Retail sales and consumer confidence numbers Navigating the current forex market landscape The current forex market environment requires careful strategy and risk management. Traders should consider several approaches when dealing with Asian currencies and the dollar steady conditions: Monitor central bank communications for rate cut signals Stay informed about upcoming economic data releases Implement proper position sizing given current volatility levels Consider both technical and fundamental analysis in decision-making Actionable insights for currency market participants Market participants can take several practical steps to navigate the current environment. Focus on understanding the relationship between economic data releases and potential rate cut decisions. Monitor how Asian currencies respond to both regional and global developments. Watch for breakouts from the current dollar steady pattern that could signal new trends in the forex market . FAQs Which central banks are most likely to implement rate cuts? Several Asian central banks are monitoring economic conditions closely. The Federal Reserve , Bank of Japan , and Reserve Bank of Australia are among institutions carefully assessing inflation and growth data. How do economic data releases affect currency values? Economic data directly influences currency values by shaping market expectations for interest rates and economic growth. Strong data typically supports currency appreciation, while weak data can lead to depreciation pressures. What makes Asian currencies particularly sensitive to rate cut expectations? Asian currencies often react strongly to rate cut expectations due to their dependence on foreign investment flows and export-oriented economic structures. Changes in interest rate differentials can significantly impact capital movements. Which companies are most affected by Asian currency movements? Multinational corporations with significant Asian operations, including Apple , Samsung , and Toyota , closely monitor currency fluctuations that affect their international revenue and manufacturing costs. The current forex market landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for informed traders. The muted movement in Asian currencies combined with dollar steady conditions creates a waiting game ahead of crucial economic data releases.

The Financial Services Agency plans legal changes that would require exchanges to create liability reserves to compensate users if platforms are hacked or suffer other incidents that lead to lost funds, Nikkei reported Tuesday. The FSA aims to submit a bill to parliament in 2026, extending a framework long used in traditional securities markets into crypto. Japan already obliges exchanges to store customer coins primarily in cold wallets, which are kept offline and viewed as more secure. Under the current regime, however, platforms that follow these custody rules do not need to set aside specific reserves to cover potential losses, leaving customers exposed if a breach or failure does occur. According to the Nikkei, Japan’s Financial Services Agency plans to require crypto asset exchanges to establish mandatory reserve funds to cover losses from unauthorized access or other asset outflow incidents, ensuring rapid compensation for customers. The Financial System… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 24, 2025 Reserve Model Draws From Rules Long Used In Japan’s Securities Industry The new system would mirror the reserve requirements imposed on securities companies, which must provision funds to cover losses tied to illegal or unfair practices such as erroneous orders. Major Japanese brokers currently hold reserves of about 2b to 40b yen, or roughly $12.7m to $255m, with amounts linked to trading volumes and other risk factors. Regulators plan to use those precedents, along with past crypto leak cases, to determine appropriate reserve levels for digital asset exchanges. To ease the strain on balance sheets, the FSA is also considering allowing platforms to meet part of their obligations through insurance, blending capital buffers with risk transfer to third parties. Authorities want to tighten protections around insolvency as well as hacking. The proposed framework would reinforce rules that require customer assets to be segregated from a platform’s own funds and would make it easier for an independent administrator, such as a court-appointed lawyer, to return assets to users if management loses control or an exchange goes bankrupt. Recent Mega-Hacks Renew Pressure On Japan To Toughen Exchange Safeguards The push comes after a series of high-profile incidents. In May 2024, DMM Bitcoin reported that about 48.2b yen worth of Bitcoin had been stolen. In Feb. 2025, global exchange Bybit disclosed that hackers had taken roughly $1.46b in cryptocurrency. These episodes have revived concerns in Tokyo that even with cold storage, large platforms remain attractive targets. Other jurisdictions are moving in the same direction. The European Union requires crypto service providers to hold capital and use insurance to protect customer assets under its MiCA regime, while Hong Kong obliges licensed exchanges to secure loss compensation funds through insurance policies and deposits. Japan’s plan to formalize liability reserves would bring its safeguards closer to those models. Traders Face Tighter Safety Rails And Higher Compliance Costs As The Market Matures Domestic rules have been evolving alongside a shift in how policymakers view digital assets. Japan initially expected cryptocurrencies to grow mainly as payment instruments and regulated them under the Payment Services Act. Their rising use as investment products has since sparked debate over migrating parts of the sector under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which covers securities and derivatives and includes insider trading provisions. According to the Asahi newspaper, Japan is preparing a broader reset of its crypto rulebook that would treat more tokens as financial products subject to insider trading laws and would lower taxes on profits to encourage regulated participation. At the same time, Tokyo Stock Exchange operator Japan Exchange Group is weighing stricter use of backdoor listing rules and potential fresh audit requirements for listed companies that pivot into large digital asset treasuries, after heavy losses in recent hoarding waves raised investor protection concerns. For crypto exchanges, the planned reserve mandate signals that Japan wants to keep the market open, but with safety rails that look increasingly similar to those in mainstream finance. For traders, it offers the prospect of stronger protections if things go wrong, at the cost of higher compliance demands that may reshape which platforms can afford to operate at scale.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has seen $2.2 billion in outflows so far in November, according to FactSet data as of Monday. The withdrawals are nearly eight times the $291 million in losses recorded last October, the fund’s second-worst month since launching in early 2024. The exodus from the fund comes as bitcoin continues to slide sharply. The cryptocurrency was recently trading at $87,907, down more than 20% over the past month and more than 40% below its early October peak above $126,000. November is shaping up to be bitcoin’s worst month since June 2022, when the asset tumbled roughly 39%. Hot money pulls back as market sentiment weakens The sharp outflows reflect broader risk aversion across markets. “There’s no doubt that hot-money investments have had significant outflows,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in a CNBC report. He added that the pullback is concentrated in “the gambling part of the market,” with bitcoin serving as the most visible example. Investors have been shifting funds into traditional safe-haven assets such as gold as macroeconomic uncertainties mount. Recent data from the University of Michigan indicate that consumer sentiment is plunging toward historically low levels. Meanwhile, markets are awaiting key economic releases, including September retail sales and producer price index figures, which could influence expectations for Federal Reserve policy. Although the CME FedWatch Tool shows traders pricing in better than 80% odds of a rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting, that outcome is far from guaranteed. The uncertainty has pushed many investors to de-risk, creating conditions that amplify outflows from speculative corners of the market. Newer ETF investors add to selling pressure Spot bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for many new retail investors to enter the crypto space. But these newer holders may also be quicker to retreat during bouts of volatility. Frank Chaparro, head of content and special projects at GSR, noted that the macro backdrop is prompting broad de-risking, including reduced exposure to crypto and other risk-sensitive assets. “For newer entrants who came in through the funds, any downturn can be unsettling, they can sell just as quickly as they bought,” Chaparro told CNBC. This dynamic is contributing to the rapid outflows seen in BlackRock’s fund and could continue to pressure bitcoin in the near term. Institutional holders may help stabilize the market Despite the volatility, spot bitcoin ETFs have also attracted more stable long-term investors, including institutions, who may help temper extreme price swings. Joshua Levine, chairman of bitcoin treasury firm OranjeBTC, said these investors could “dampen some of the extreme downside, but also smooth upside, reducing bitcoin’s volatility as the asset class matures.” As bitcoin navigates a challenging macroeconomic environment, the divide between short-term retail sellers and long-term institutional holders may shape how the asset performs in the months ahead. For now, both the cryptocurrency and its largest ETF are confronting one of their most turbulent periods since the recent bull run began.

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, jumped 2.7% in late trading, while Nvidia dropped 2.7%, showing how fast investors reacted to the idea of Meta shifting part of its AI hardware stack. The Information said one unnamed person familiar with the talks described Meta’s plan to test TPUs for long-term use. Meta is one of the world’s heaviest spenders on AI infrastructure, so any change in Meta’s chip choices matters far beyond the company itself. Google expands TPU deals as Meta evaluates the hardware Google developed TPUs more than ten years ago for its internal AI work.They are ASIC chips designed for a single job: running and training AI models. While Nvidia’s GPUs were originally made for video game graphics and later adopted for AI because they handle huge amounts of data, TPUs were built only for AI tasks. This is one reason Meta is testing them now, as the company looks for more options in a market where Nvidia still controls most of the demand. Google already signed a deal to supply up to 1 million TPUs to Anthropic, and that announcement got attention on Wall Street. Jay Goldberg, an analyst at Seaport, called the Anthropic deal “a really powerful validation” and added, “A lot of people were already thinking about it, and a lot more people are probably thinking about it now.” The Meta talks increased that attention, especially since Meta spends more on data centers than most companies in the world. Asian markets reacted fast.In South Korea, IsuPetasys, which supplies multilayered boards to Alphabet, surged 18% to an intraday record. In Taiwan, MediaTek gained almost 5% as traders priced in potential demand growth linked to Google’s chip ecosystem. Investors in Asia were responding to the idea that Google may expand its hardware partnerships well beyond its own products. TPUs were built into Google’s internal systems, including AI models developed by Google and DeepMind. Engineers who work on Google’s Gemini models share what they learn with Google’s chip designers, which helps shape new versions of TPUs. That feedback loop also gives AI teams the ability to customize hardware for their own workloads, something that Meta is now studying. The developments around Google and Meta came as Nvidia was dealing with another story. Michael Burry, the investor known for his 2008 housing-market bet, criticized Nvidia’s stock-based compensation and buybacks last week in a post on X. Nvidia responded by sending a memo to Wall Street analysts to address his claims, something reported by Barron’s. Burry did not change his mind. In a new post on Monday, he said he stands by everything he wrote. Burry said he plans to share more comments on his timeline and directed people to a post on his Substack.

Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes believes the correction is nearing its end, and said that $80,000 should hold as support as the Federal Reserve prepares to halt quantitative tightening, a shift he says could reignite liquidity across risk assets. New Investors Are Panicking Bitcoin’s latest bout of volatility rattled newer institutional investors, but long-time holders argue that the recent drawdown is just part of the asset’s natural rhythm. On CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday, crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said seasoned Bitcoiners are unfazed by the correction, as the asset has experienced 30% declines more than twenty times over the past decade. According to him, Bitcoin historically undergoes a big drawdown roughly every 18 months, making the current slump well within expectations for those familiar with its market cycles. Pompliano argued that the anxiety is coming largely from newcomers entering the space from traditional finance, where sharp swings are rare. He said many Wall Street-based investors are now grappling with year-end concerns, portfolio reviews, and bonus calculations, which may be motivating them to reduce exposure. That uncertainty, he added, contributed to the downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price as some of these investors question their initial enthusiasm. VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel , offered a similar perspective on Monday, and explained that the recent sell-off was “overwhelmingly a US-session phenomenon.” He pointed to tightening liquidity conditions in the United States and widening credit spreads as key drivers of the decline. These pressures are emerging at the same time that markets are digesting the scale of corporate capital expenditures tied to artificial intelligence, creating a more fragile funding environment. Despite the turbulence, analysts argue that volatility is still a central feature of Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Jeff Park , a market analyst at Bitwise, said that Bitcoin’s volatility index climbed back toward 60 over the past few weeks, creating the potential for more dramatic price swings in either direction. Pompliano believes that volatility is not a sign of weakness but a necessary ingredient for Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. He warned that a lack of volatility would be far more concerning because it would suggest stagnation. Pompliano also mentioned Bitcoin’s historical performance, and pointed out that the asset has risen 240x over the past decade — equivalent to roughly a 70% annualized growth rate. While he warned that those extraordinary gains are unlikely to repeat, he believes even a more modest 20% to 35% annual growth rate over the next ten years will still allow Bitcoin to outperform equities. Bitcoin Will Hold $80K Support? On the bright side, Bitcoin may be nearing the end of its correction. This is according to Arthur Hayes, the former BitMEX CEO who believes the $80,000 level will hold as a key support zone. Hayes argued on X that shifting US liquidity conditions could strengthen the crypto market, setting the stage for a recovery after Bitcoin’s more than 35% pullback from its all-time highs. The core of his outlook centers on the Federal Reserve’s expected move to end its current phase of quantitative tightening next month. With the Fed’s balance sheet no longer shrinking, Hayes expects fresh liquidity to flow back into markets, which will benefit both Bitcoin and risk assets. He also pointed to an uptick in US bank lending in November as another early sign that liquidity is beginning to turn. Hayes stayed bullish throughout Bitcoin’s decline from its October peak, and repeatedly said that meaningful relief for the crypto market requires a return to quantitative easing. While he acknowledged the possibility of one more dip into the lower $80,000 range, he stuck to his belief that $80,000 should remain intact as a support level. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Hayes also suggested that a deeper sell-off in major US tech stocks, especially AI-related names, may be necessary before the Federal Reserve shifts decisively toward a more accommodative stance. He described the current environment as one where investors are essentially “playing for more money printing,” a condition he believes is ultimately bullish for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate decision have swung dramatically. The recent US government shutdown disrupted the flow of economic data, which fueled volatility in rate forecasts. Just a week ago, markets assigned less than a 50% probability to another December rate cut. Those odds have now surged to almost 80%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. This sharp shift caught the attention of economists like Mohamed El-Erian, who criticized the lack of stability in market expectations. El-Erian believes that the volatility stems from disrupted data, uncertainties around the Fed’s leadership, and the absence of a clear long-term policy framework — factors that have created an unpredictable macro backdrop for investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-25 05:30:00

Christine Lagarde, who leads the ECB, made these remarks during a Monday conference in Bratislava, Slovakia. She emphasized that European countries need to move fast to catch up with the United States and China, where companies are pouring massive amounts of money into AI development. The heavy investment in AI technology by American and Chinese firms has sparked discussions about whether this spending rush represents a dangerous financial bubble or signals a genuine breakthrough in technology. Some of Lagarde’s fellow central bank officials have expressed concerns about inflated prices for AI companies. However, Lagarde took a broader view of the situation. She pointed out that periods of intense investment, including ups and downs in cycles, are normal occurrences. She also noted that research shows real economic benefits from AI are appearing faster than gains from earlier technological advances. The ECB president stressed that Europe must prepare itself for this technological shift. She argued that the continent needs to eliminate all barriers preventing it from embracing this change, warning that failure to act could mean missing out on AI adoption and putting Europe’s economic future at risk. Central banks grapple with AI’s economic impact These comments show how central banks worldwide are wrestling with AI’s potential economic effects. Officials at the Federal Reserve agree that AI will bring major changes, though they have not taken firm positions on exactly how these impacts will unfold. In Europe, this AI discussion connects to broader talks about reviving economic growth. A 2024 report by former ECB head Mario Draghi identified Europe’s failure to take advantage of the first digital revolution as a key reason why the region’s productivity growth lagged behind. Lagarde said Europe should not repeat past mistakes. Even though America and China have taken early leads in AI innovation, she believes quick adoption and smart use of the technology could help Europe turn its late start into an advantage. Europe seeks to turn late start into advantage The ECB leader acknowledged that Europe has already lost its chance to be first in AI development. “Europe can still emerge as a strong second mover if it acts decisively,” she stated. She explained that Europe’s aim should focus on widespread AI deployment rather than trying to create the best AI systems. Lagarde has repeatedly called for reforms to unlock growth potential within Europe, especially as the region faces challenges including potential US trade tariffs and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Just last Friday, she pushed for stronger steps toward European integration, a theme she returned to in her AI comments. She warned that several factors could slow AI adoption across Europe. High energy costs, scattered regulations, and poorly integrated capital markets that fail to provide long-term, risk-taking funding could all hinder progress. Such problems would lead to reduced competitiveness across many European sectors and industries, she cautioned. The speech highlighted the urgency Lagarde feels about Europe’s need to act quickly on AI adoption to maintain its economic standing globally.

His video highlighted the inconsistencies across major AI models, which are challenging traders who attempt to determine whether the market is nearing the end of its cycle or preparing for another phase of expansion. Grok and ChatGPT Indicate High Bear Market Probability Rietveld explained that Grok produced the most bearish view, stating that there is an estimated 80% probability that the market has already peaked and transitioned into a bear phase. This assessment was described as decisive, leaving little room for an alternative reading. He added that ChatGPT’s DeepThink variant produced a similar but slightly less severe conclusion, estimating a 70% likelihood that the market is currently in bear territory. Rietveld highlighted the closeness of these figures, noting that two separate models independently pointed toward a downward trend as the dominant probability. Gemini Presents an Opposing XRP Projection A more optimistic viewpoint came from Gemini, which offered a projection focused specifically on XRP. According to Rietveld, Gemini suggested that XRP could reach a range of $6 to $10 before the end of the year. AI Predicts $XRP Price GROK is wild!! Comment down below! pic.twitter.com/yZ8MhQ3EYr — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 22, 2025 This forecast stood in direct contrast to the bearish prediction from the other two models, introducing a level of uncertainty about how the broader market conditions align with asset-specific expectations. The sharp difference between these predictions contributed to the overall sense of unpredictability described in Rietveld’s commentary. When assessing market direction independently, projections of this kind rely heavily on future regulatory actions, liquidity conditions, and institutional behavior. It should therefore be treated as speculative indicators rather than definitive outcomes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Utility Over Price In response to Rietveld’s post, X user Gordon Cameron shifted the focus away from short-term price expectations. He stated that cryptocurrency should be viewed as technology rather than as a traditional stock, emphasizing that its long-term value depends on practical use cases that can support financial system upgrades. Cameron added that assets lacking real utility will not maintain relevance once regulatory frameworks are fully established. His comment underscored an argument frequently made by those who prioritize functional adoption over market cycles.

Privacy is hygiene,” after hackers infiltrated several U.S. banks and stole client information. Reports indicate that hackers targeted JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley during a cyberattack on mortgage technology firm SitusAMC. The breach highlighted the vulnerability of sensitive data in banks and the ease with which large systems can expose customer information. Banks face risk as stolen data exposes sensitive client records SitusAMC was the victim of a cyberattack on November 12, 2025, that exposed large amounts of sensitive corporate information, including accounting records and legal documents. In this instance, customer data may have been compromised. The company announced that although the breach has been stopped, its systems are currently operational, and it has notified federal authorities of the incident. Notably, no encrypting malware (such as ransomware) was used, indicating that cybercriminals attempted to evade detection. Some of the banks that risk being affected are JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, according to multiple reports. The full extent of the leaked data remains to be seen. Still, the threat that one third-party vendor’s breach might affect multiple Wall Street banking giants underscores an emerging threat to supply chains that can be exploited through cyberattacks. Hackers infiltrated the security systems of SitusAMC and stole client information linked to major banks. They stole accounting papers, legal agreements , and other sensitive client and customer information, so officials at the company are investigating the extent of the theft and its potential use in fraudulent activities. Experts say that storing large amounts of personal and business information in one place is very risky, as hackers can use stolen information for illegal activities that damage the reputations of both companies and their customers. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley were all notified that their client data may have been compromised, and the news quickly spread on social media platforms. Financial news accounts and tech commentators on X discussed the incident, raising concerns among the public about how large banks must take responsibility for their own security systems and those of their clients. Members of the tech and crypto communities used the incident to highlight the dangers of storing sensitive data without robust security measures. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin even said privacy should be as essential as hygiene, so that banks and digital companies treat it as a routine. Ethereum developers are making new tools to keep people’s information safe Buterin wrote an essay in April that outlined a plan for Ethereum to enhance privacy by utilizing stealth addresses, which conceal transaction details. ETH would also display only the necessary information in specific situations, and zero-knowledge tools would enable users to interact without needing to understand complicated cryptography to protect themselves. Shiv Shankar, CEO of Boundless, said that privacy must be a routine practice to prevent hackers and mistakes from exposing sensitive information and causing real harm to people who use the network. The Ethereum Foundation introduced a new privacy-focused research cluster in October, hiring 47 engineers, cryptographers, coordinators, and researchers to collaborate on projects that enhance the safety and privacy of ETH for users. The team also showcased a privacy-first browser wallet and software toolkit called Kohaku, which Nicolas Consigny and Buterin created. The software helps users protect their information when using ETH applications. Bitcoin developers are also working on Taproot upgrades and wallet-level improvements that make transactions harder to trace and more secure. At the same time, developers are building new Ethereum layer-2 solutions with privacy as a fundamental part of the system, rather than adding it later. Companies that focus on privacy, such as Zcash, have also become increasingly popular now because they allow users to hide their transaction details. A Nasdaq-listed company purchased more ZEC, and the price increased by 469% in one month, which only proves that investors are starting to recognize the value of privacy.

With signs of a potential bear market emerging, fresh rumors suggest that one of the world’s largest banks allegedly holds a significant short position on Strategy’s stock (MSTR), which has plunged 69% from its record high of $543 per share last year. Strategy Faces Potential MSCI Exclusion The turmoil escalated last week when JPMorgan issued a warning that Strategy might soon be removed from major equity indices, specifically the MSCI USA Index. JPMorgan’s analysts noted that the issues facing Strategy extend beyond the recent downturn in cryptocurrency prices, which have seen Bitcoin fall more than 30% from its all-time highs. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,000, while the broader crypto market has experienced a staggering $1 trillion decline in total market capitalization over the past month. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Crash Below $2 Is Not A Problem – $20 Is Still The Target JPMorgan’s analysts indicated that MSCI is considering whether companies with over 50% of their total assets in digital currencies should qualify for inclusion in traditional equity indices. Given that Strategy’s balance sheet is heavily weighted with Bitcoin, it is at significant risk of exclusion. The analysts stated that “MicroStrategy [is] at risk of exclusion from major equity indices as the January 15th MSCI decision approaches.” They speculated that removal from the MSCI could trigger approximately $2.8 billion in outflows, and if other index providers follow MSCI’s lead, the total could reach as high as $8.8 billion. The situation is complicated by market dynamics, particularly the timing of JPMorgan’s bearish note, which coincided with Bitcoin’s weakness and MSTR’s decline, all while liquidity was thin and overall sentiment fragile. JPMorgan Faces Account Closures Surge According to analysts at the Bull Theory, JPMorgan has been noted for timing its market reports—bearing down when prices are already weak and striking a more bullish tone near market peaks. The analysts have highlighted that share lending for MSTR has reportedly increased, allowing brokers to lend shares to short sellers, which can exacerbate downward pressure on the stock price. Additionally, there are escalating reports of widespread account closures at JPMorgan, with thousands claiming to have exited due to perceived manipulation of both MSTR and Bitcoin. Related Reading: A Quiet Move In Bitcoin Options Is Starting To Raise Big Questions Amid these developments, the fear of a potential short squeeze is growing. The analysts believe that if Strategy’s stock were to rally around 40% to 50%, it could trigger a short squeeze in the bank’s position and spell major financial troubles. In response, Michael Saylor, the CEO of Strategy, has sought to clarify the company’s identity, emphasizing that it is not just a passive Bitcoin holder. He pointed out that Strategy operates as a software business with an active financial strategy, countering the narrative circulating around MSCI’s concerns. As the situation unfolds, several key points emerge. The October 10th crash appeared to align with the MSCI announcement, coinciding with an already fragile market state. JP Morgan’s strategic timing of its bearish insights has amplified existing fears, creating further uncertainty as MSCI’s final decision looms.

Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Plummeted Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish has discussed about the latest trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score . This on-chain indicator calculates the difference between the market cap of BTC and its Realized Cap, and takes its ratio with the standard deviation of the market cap. The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model for the asset that calculates its total value by assuming the ‘real’ value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In short, what this metric represents is the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the market cap is the value that they are carrying in the present. As the Bitcoin MVRV Z-score compares the market cap with the Realized Cap, it essentially tells us whether the overall network is in a state of profit or loss. Now, here is the chart shared by Beamish that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score over the last few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has gone through a decline recently. This drop in investor profitability is a result of the bearish trajectory that the cryptocurrency’s price has followed. The metric is still a notable distance above the zero mark, which suggests the market cap continues to be greater than the Realized Cap. In other words, the investors are still in a state of net unrealized profit. The degree of the holder gain, however, is low when compared to the profitability level of the last couple of years. In fact, the current MVRV Z-Score is at a similar level to when Bitcoin was trading around the $35,000 level. Historically, a cooldown in investor profitability has facilitated bottom formations for the cryptocurrency. Usually, however, major bearish phases have only reached their lows when the network has outright gone underwater . Currently, Bitcoin still has some ways to go before this can happen. Though, it’s possible that the current level is enough for the asset to reach a bottom, as it has already done a few times over this cycle. Just like how a low value on the MVRV Z-Score can lead to a bottom, a high one can result in a top instead as profit-taking explodes. From the chart, it’s apparent that the metric reached an extreme level during the bull run in the first half of 2021. So far in the current cycle, no peak in the indicator has been of a similar scale; the tops this time around have formed at a comparable profitability level to the second-half 2021 bull run. BTC Price Bitcoin has rebounded since its low below $81,000 on Friday as its price has now climbed back to $88,600.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin MVRV Ratio|Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score|Bitcoin Profits|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-25 06:00:25

54873938,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=867613,1764050460,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54873938.jpeg,Galaxy Digital is talking with Kalshi and Polymarket about becoming a liquidity provider,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/galaxy-digital-prediction-market-liquidity/,"According to Bloomberg, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is preparing to become a liquidity provider for Kalshi and Polymarket, two of the biggest names in the fast-expanding world of crypto-based prediction markets. These platforms let people place simple bets on real-world outcomes; like election results, sports scores, or even policy decisions. Now, Galaxy Digital is looking to plug directly into those bets by offering constant trade activity that keeps the wheels turning. Mike said the company is already “doing some small-scale experimenting with market-making on prediction markets,” and added that “you’ll eventually see us providing broader liquidity.” This would make Galaxy Digital a key player in a market that’s already seeing tons of involvement from retail traders and financial firms alike. And while Mike has spent years building Galaxy as a crypto infrastructure backbone for institutions, prediction markets open a new front in that strategy, one that’s raw, fast, and not yet fully regulated. Kalshi and Polymarket compete for bigger trade flows Unlike traditional sportsbooks, where the house always takes the opposite side, platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket match people directly. If you want to buy “yes” on a bet, someone else needs to sell you a “no.” This system needs liquidity providers to keep trades flowing, especially when demand surges. That’s why Kalshi and Polymarket rolled out incentive programs to reward active traders in specific markets. For years, these platforms were too small to attract serious Wall Street players. The only big name who jumped in early was Susquehanna International Group, which has publicly acknowledged its role on Kalshi. But the tides are turning. Jump Trading has begun market-making activity on Kalshi, according to Bloomberg, and Cliff Asness, co-founder of AQR Capital Management, said he’s thinking about moving into the sports betting arena. Kalshi also uses its own in-house desk called Kalshi Trading to keep trades moving and says this desk works separately and doesn’t get any private information. Not long ago, Kalshi gained a legal opening under the Trump administration, which softened federal attitudes toward event-based trading. That said, the backlash is real. Melinda Roth, a law professor at Washington & Lee University, said, “This is a mess for so many reasons. We have people taking money they often don’t have and not investing in the stock market or retirement savings.” She’s been researching the legal gray zone around these kinds of contracts and says the risks are getting harder to ignore. Trump family ties deepen as Polymarket reenters U.S. Earlier this year, Kalshi started offering markets tied to sports results just after winning a legal case to allow election betting. State gambling regulators came out against this move, arguing that it broke local laws. Kalshi pushed back, saying it offers financial products under federal CFTC oversight, not state gambling rules. The company stressed that it operates as a marketplace, not a bookmaker. So far, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission hasn’t stepped in. Meanwhile, the Trump family is doubling down. Donald Trump Jr. joined both Kalshi and Polymarket as an advisor. In the fall, Trump Media & Technology Group started talks with Crypto.com, one of Kalshi’s competitors, and ended up launching its own prediction exchange, Truth Predict. Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, played a central role in sealing that deal, which reportedly came together in just weeks. Polymarket, which had been shut out of the U.S. after a 2022 settlement with the CFTC, is now back in the game. In July, both the CFTC and the Justice Department said they were done investigating the company. That greenlight let Polymarket buy QCX, a tiny derivatives exchange trying to get regulatory approval. The deal cost $112 million and gave Polymarket a legal way to operate in the U.S. under federal rules. With that door now open, and Galaxy Digital ready to step in, the race to dominate prediction-market liquidity is getting very real, very fast.

54874256,https://invezz.com/?p=2979686,1764050535,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"XRP price prediction after strong Franklin, Grayscale ETFs debuts",https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/25/xrp-price-prediction-after-strong-franklin-grayscale-etfs-debuts/,"The XRP price has moved into a bull market after rising by over 24% from its lowest point this month. It has risen in the last three consecutive days and is now hovering at its highest level in a week. This rebound happened after the successful launch of the Grayscale XRP ETF on Monday. XRP ETF inflows are soaring The XRP price has done well in the past few days, reaching a high of $2.25 as investors cheered the launch of the Grayscale and Franklin Templeton ETF on Monday. These ETF launches were successful, with the Grayscale one generating over $67 million in inflows. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF had $62 million in inflows, while the existing Canary and Bitwise had $16 million and $17 million, respectively. The total daily XRP ETF inflows jumped to $164 million, bringing the total assets to over $628 million, which is equivalent to 0.46% of the coin’s market capitalization. The total value traded rose to nearly $90 million. Most importantly, SoSoValue data shows that XRP ETFs have had inflows in the last seven consecutive trading days. They have never had an outflow, which is notable because they were launched during a crypto market crash . There is a likelihood that the XRP ETFs will have robust inflows in the coming months. In a report released earlier this year, JP Morgan analysts predicted that these funds would have over $8 billion in assets in the first year. One way of estimating the future assets is to look at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin ETFs have $116 billion in assets, which is equivalent to 6.54% of the market cap. Ethereum ETFs, on the other hand, have $18.4 billion in assets or 5.14% of the market cap. XRP has a market cap of over $135 billion. As such, a 5% allocation in XRP ETFs would bring their total assets to about $6.75 billion, much higher than where they are today. Why Ripple ETF inflows are rising There are several reasons why XRP ETF inflows are rising. First, XRP was created by Ripple Labs, which has become a juggernaut in the financial service industry. The company recently r aised $500 million from Ken Griffin’s Citadel and Fortress, bringing its valuation to over $40 billion. Ripple Labs hopes to use these funds to grow its network and its market share in the cross-border payment industry. It has already made some major acquisitions this year, including Hidden Road, Rail, and GTreasury. Second, XRP ETFs are seeing robust demand because of its size. Data shows that XRP is the fourth-biggest coin in the crypto industry after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. As such, investors view it as a viable alternative asset. Third, the network’s growth is accelerating, with Ripple USD (RLUSD) having $1.02 billion in assets, a year after its launch. There are chances that the RLUSD growth will accelerate as stablecoins become more mainstream. XRP price technical analysis The daily timeframe chart shows that the XRP price crashed to a low of $1.8173 on November 21 and has now rebounded to $2.25. Its lowest level this month was a notable level as it coincided with the lowest point on October 10 this year. Therefore, there are signs that the coin has formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $2.6945, its highest point on October 27. A double-bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. Still, technicals points to more XRP price risk. For one, it remains below the Supertrend indicator and the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Therefore, the bearish outlook will persist as long as it remains below these indicators.

The Trump family's total wealth has eroded by $1 billion, falling from $7.7 billion at the beginning of September to about $6.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Much of this decline stems from losses in the value of the family's expanding crypto investments and related companies. During Trump's second term, cryptocurrencies have completely reshaped the family's wealth. Memecoins attributed to him have lost nearly 25% of their value since August, while shares in his son Eric Trump's Bitcoin mining venture have nearly halved from their peak. Trump's social media company, which has entered Bitcoin with significant volume this year, is also trading at historic lows. This scenario is part of a broader cryptocurrency downturn that has recently wiped out over $1 trillion in market value. These losses aren't limited to family fortunes; many individual investors involved in projects linked to the Trump brand have also suffered significant losses. Short-term investors who bought memecoins during the height of Trump's tenure have lost nearly all of their investments as of this month. Despite this, Eric Trump isn't backing down. Speaking to Bloomberg, Trump said, “Now is a perfect time to buy. Those who can buy on dips and withstand price fluctuations will win.” He added that he's more optimistic than ever about the future of the crypto market. Related News: Chinese Expert Analyst Answers the Question, “Has the Bear Market Begun for Bitcoin?” According to experts, not only investments but also issuance and transaction revenues play a significant role in the Trump family's crypto strategy. Professor Jim Angel of Georgetown University said, “Individual investors can only speculate. The Trump family, on the other hand, can speculate, issue and sell their own crypto assets, and generate consistent income from this process.” Trump Media & Technology Group, Truth Social's parent company, fell to an all-time low on November 19th following its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment push. According to a July report, the company holds approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency positions. Approximately 25% of the 11,500 BTC purchased at an average price of $115,000 are currently at a loss. Furthermore, the company's $147 million investment in Cronos (CRO) has nearly halved. The family's largest crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, has seen its own token, WLFI, fall from 26 cents in early September to around 15 cents. The value of WLFI holdings has fallen from $6 billion to around $3.15 billion. Despite this, the family has generated around $900 million from token sales, with $500 million from the deal with Alto5Sigma alone. American Bitcoin (ABTC), the new mining venture co-owned by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., is trading on the Nasdaq. Its share price has more than halved from its peak of $9.31 in early September, wiping out at least $300 million in Eric Trump's stake. The Trump memecoin associated with the family has suffered a sharp decline since its launch, falling 25% since the end of August. Bloomberg analysis shows that wallets linked to the family held 17 million tokens in the first few months. It's also estimated that 40% of the 90 million tokens unlocked in July went to the family. The current value of the coins is approximately $310 million, down $117 million since August, but the total value has increased by $220 million thanks to new unlocks. *This is not investment advice.

Trump said he would travel to Beijing in April, while Xi would come to the U.S. later next year. “It could be Florida, Palm Beach, or Washington, D.C.,” Trump said, adding that the meeting schedule was still being determined. The first report on the meeting came from China's official Xinhua news agency. According to the agency, Xi stated that “the momentum in bilateral relations must be maintained” following the two countries' summit in South Korea last month. Xi also stated that “Taiwan's return to China is an important part of the post-war international order.” Xi, recalling that China and the US are “fighting together in the war against fascism and militarism,” said, “We must protect the victory of World War II together.” Areas of bilateral cooperation were also discussed during the meeting, according to the Associated Press.

While the Trump administration is pressuring Taiwan to increase its defense spending, strategic uncertainty remains about whether US troops would be deployed in the event of a Taiwan Strait conflict. The call followed a trade truce reached last month between the world's two largest economies. Under the agreement, Washington reduced tariffs on certain Chinese products from 57 percent to 47 percent, while Beijing lifted select restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. Trump also announced that China had resumed purchases of American soybeans and assured that there would be no delays or additional restrictions on rare earth minerals. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s Everything We Know and the Facts,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/todays-hot-topic-did-jpmorgan-really-declare-war-on-bitcoin-heres-everything-we-know-and-the-facts/,"A claim that has been circulating rapidly on X in recent days suggested that JPMorgan holds a massive short position in MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares, suggesting that a 50% rise in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) would pose an “existential threat” to the bank. The post, which reached millions of users, brought with it GameStop comparisons, calls for boycotts, and talk of a mass purchasing campaign. However, financial writer Shanaka Anslem Perera points out that this narrative is a complete fabrication. Perera points to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing with Section 13F-HR dated November 7, 2025. The filing indicates that JPMorgan has no open short positions in MicroStrategy, meaning the reported short amount is “zero.” The records are publicly available and accessible on EDGAR. The bank reduced its MSTR holdings by 24.5% in the third quarter and also holds limited-sized call and put options. The put options, which some social media users cited as “evidence,” are said to be routine hedging compared to the $4.6 trillion in assets under management at JPMorgan. MicroStrategy's total short position is 9.74% of the market, according to FINRA data, but there's no evidence that JPMorgan owns it. A significant portion of the posts brought up the example of GameStop's short squeeze in 2021. According to Perera, this comparison is baseless: The short position ratio in GameStop exceeded 140%, while in MSTR it was 9.74% GameStop's free float was much smaller Short positions were concentrated among a few funds; there is no such concentration in MSTR Therefore, there is no similar structural compression condition in MicroStrategy. The claim reportedly began with a November 23rd post by Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser. According to Perera, the claim reached millions within hours, but no posts cited a primary source. Those opposed were accused of “defending the banks,” and verification mechanisms failed to keep pace with social media. Related News: Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network Altcoins That Developers Focused On Most in the Last Month Have Been Revealed Perera argues that false claims are overshadowing more important developments: JPMorgan reduces MicroStrategy position Harvard University Increases Its Holdings in BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT by 257% Abu Dhabi fund Al Warda increases IBIT position by 230% Total inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs exceed $60.8 billion This trend suggests that institutions are now choosing to access Bitcoin through regulated ETFs rather than through company stocks. According to Perera, the “leveraged Bitcoin stock” model MicroStrategy has offered for years is losing its edge. The company's market capitalization relative to its Bitcoin holdings is now at a discount, and a potential MSCI delisting in January 2026 could lead to billions of dollars in forced selling. Therefore, JPMorgan's position reduction is not considered “hostility towards Bitcoin” but rather portfolio risk management. *This is not investment advice.

Analyst ‘Sykodelic’ echoed the sentiment, opining that over the next month, “we are going to climb the biggest wall of worry that has ever existed in crypto.” “It should be clear by now that we are in a market position like 2019, not 2021,” they added. “We are just not in the liquidity/macro environment to enter a prolonged contraction or bear.” Echoes of Pandemic Crash MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe commented that the recent crash reminded him of the COVID market meltdown in 2020. “People expected to see another test at the lows, actually, during these times, lower lows were also expected in the COVID crash, it never happened,” he said. “The higher Bitcoin goes during these 1-2 weeks, the lower the chance of that low to happen again.” Bitcoin slumped more than 50% in March 2020 when the world locked down during the pandemic. However, it surged to a new all-time high by the end of that year. Meanwhile, ‘Altcoin Alf’ said it was time for markets to perform, noting Tether (USDT) dominance, which usually leads to rotation into crypto assets. “I truly believe we are about to start a massive run that most are not positioned for. BTC to ATH’s, but I expect ALTS to finally outperform.” Every time $USDT.D has had a weekly stochastic cross down for the last 28 months is when we had a rally. Markets also hate having built up equal lows. We just swept the liquidity up the top. Which leads me to believe the next target is the equal lows. I truly believe we are… pic.twitter.com/E8vevrM8VB — Altcoin Alf (@alfy11116) November 25, 2025 Crypto commentator ‘Colin Talks Crypto’ wasn’t as bullish, stating that “enough bear market signals have triggered,” but remaining hopeful that there is “one last leg up.” BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin has continued its recovery today, hitting an intraday high of just over $89,000 on Monday, before cooling during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session, where it was hovering around $88,000. It has gained 8.5% since it bottomed on Friday, but has a long way to go to reverse the almost two-month down trend.

The families of victims of the Hamas 2023 attack accused the exchange and recently pardoned CZ of helping to transfer over $1 billion to the accounts of terror groups. The exchange “deliberately” and “consciously” took efforts to carry out the financial crime on an “industrial scale,” the filing read. “Binance not only knowingly provided financial services to Hamas; it also actively tried to shield its Hamas customers and their funds from scrutiny by U.S. regulators or law enforcement—a practice that continues to this day,” the plaintiffs noted in the complaint, filed in federal court in North Dakota on Monday. The Hamas’ October 2023 deadly incursion in Israel killed around 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Binance Bypassed Sanctions, Warnings – Here’s How The crypto giant allowed large volumes of sanctioned money to move undetected, the lawsuit claims. According to the attorneys representing 306 American plaintiffs, Binance’s lax controls contributed directly to the attack’s financing. Further, the exchange relied on pooled wallets, having limited records and weak identity checks. “Binance’s conduct was far more serious and pervasive than what the U.S. government disclosed during its 2023 criminal enforcement actions,” the attorneys said in the suit. Binance told Reuters that the platform complies “fully with internationally recognized sanctions laws,” declining to comment on the lawsuit. Zhao and Guangying Chen, a close associate of CZ whom the lawsuit points to as Binance’s “de facto chief financial officer,” could not be reached for comment regarding the lawsuit. The complaint identified Ali Mohammad Alawieh, the son of Hezbollah chief, as one of the Binance account holders. Another Binance account was tied to a 25-year-old Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) operative who had opened his account in October 2020. The Agence France-Presse and Reuters photo shows the PIJ militant at a Hamas operative’s funeral. Source: AFP Hamas, Terrorist Groups’ Emerging Use of Crypto Per a recent study , the use of crypto is becoming a preferred mode for transnational terrorist and organized criminal networks. In 2019, Hamas engaged in crypto donation campaigns, leading to the US seizure of several websites and 150 crypto accounts. The WSJ reported in October 2023 that cryptocurrency wallets connected to Hamas received about $41 million between 2020 and 2023. Besides, wallets connected to another U.S.-designated terrorist organization, the PIJ, received as much as $93 million over a similar period. Binance and CZ separately defended against the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court.

South Korea’s leading crypto exchange Upbit has announced a crucial service suspension that affects all OP token holders. Starting December 2nd at 1:00 p.m. UTC, the platform will temporarily halt all deposit and withdrawal activities on the Optimism network. This strategic pause comes as the network prepares for a significant hard fork upgrade that could reshape its future trajectory. Why Is Upbit Suspending Optimism Network Services? The primary reason behind this temporary suspension is an upcoming hard fork on the Optimism network. Hard forks represent major upgrades in blockchain technology, requiring exchanges to pause services to ensure safe integration. Upbit’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to security and smooth operations during these critical network transitions. During this suspension period, users cannot move OP tokens or any other assets on the Optimism network to or from their Upbit accounts. However, trading of OP tokens within the exchange will continue uninterrupted. This means you can still buy and sell OP tokens on Upbit’s internal market while the network upgrades occur. What Does This Mean for Optimism Network Users? If you’re an active Optimism network user, this suspension requires careful planning. Here are the key implications: Deposit and withdrawal functions for OP tokens will be temporarily unavailable All other exchange services remain operational Users should complete any urgent transfers before the December 2nd deadline The suspension affects only Optimism network transactions, not other cryptocurrencies The timing of this suspension aligns perfectly with the network’s upgrade schedule, minimizing disruption for most users. Upbit typically resumes services shortly after network stability is confirmed post-upgrade. Understanding Optimism Network Hard Forks Hard forks represent significant milestones in blockchain development. They involve substantial protocol changes that often introduce new features, enhance security, or improve scalability. The Optimism network’s upcoming hard fork follows this pattern, aiming to deliver important upgrades to the Layer 2 scaling solution. These network improvements typically result in: Enhanced transaction speeds Reduced gas fees Improved security features Better user experience Exchanges like Upbit suspend services during these events to prevent potential transaction losses or technical conflicts that could occur during the transition period. How to Prepare for the Upbit Service Suspension Smart planning can help you navigate this temporary service interruption smoothly. Consider these actionable steps: Complete all urgent Optimism network transfers before December 2nd, 1:00 p.m. UTC Monitor Upbit’s official announcements for service restoration updates Explore alternative trading strategies during the suspension period Keep your OP tokens secure in your preferred wallet during the transition Remember that such suspensions are standard practice in the cryptocurrency industry and demonstrate the exchange’s commitment to user asset security. The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters for Crypto Adoption This temporary suspension actually highlights the growing maturity of cryptocurrency infrastructure. Major exchanges like Upbit implementing careful upgrade procedures shows how the industry is evolving toward more reliable and secure operations. These measures protect users during critical network improvements, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem. The Optimism network’s continued development through hard forks demonstrates the ongoing innovation in Layer 2 scaling solutions. Each upgrade brings us closer to faster, cheaper, and more accessible blockchain technology for everyday users. FAQs About Upbit’s Optimism Network Suspension When will Upbit resume Optimism network services? Upbit will restore services after confirming the Optimism network’s stability post-hard fork. The exact timing depends on network conditions, but typically resumes within hours of successful upgrade completion. Can I still trade OP tokens on Upbit during the suspension? Yes, trading of OP tokens within Upbit’s internal market continues uninterrupted. Only deposits and withdrawals on the Optimism network are affected. Will my OP tokens be safe during the suspension? Absolutely. Your tokens remain secure in your Upbit account. The suspension only affects movement of tokens to and from the Optimism network. What happens if I try to send OP tokens during the suspension? Any attempted transactions during the suspension period will fail or be queued. It’s best to wait until services resume to avoid potential issues. How often do such suspensions occur? Network suspensions for upgrades happen periodically across all major exchanges. They’re standard procedure for maintaining security during significant blockchain changes. Should I move my tokens elsewhere before the suspension? Only if you need immediate access to them on the Optimism network. Otherwise, keeping them on Upbit during the upgrade is perfectly safe.

The recent pullback in cryptocurrency markets and Bitcoin's (BTC) slide below critical support levels are worrying market experts. Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone, speaking on a podcast, described Bitcoin's current outlook as “Bit-Dog,” highlighting technical levels. McGlone noted that Bitcoin's recent bull run was “a tremendous surge” fueled by the halving, ETF inflows, and the Trump administration's support for the sector, but that this process has now peaked. The analyst said the market is currently experiencing a “classic bull market peak”-like decline, which is dragging down other assets. Related News: Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network Altcoins That Developers Focused On Most in the Last Month Have Been Revealed Pointing out that the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index fell 21%, McGlone said, “Bitcoin is currently down about 10% year-over-year. The real question is where it goes from here. The fact that stock market volatility (VIX) is so low while cryptos are falling suggests we may see more risk-off (de-risking) towards the end of the year.” McGlone, assessing the situation from a technical analysis perspective, argued that the $100,000 level was a psychological support level, but that it was rapidly being lost. He gave the following figures for the current outlook: Support level: $84,000 Resistance level: $94,000, McGlone painted a pessimistic picture, contrary to market expectations: “In my view, the risk of the $84,000 support being broken and the price heading towards $50,000 is higher than the chance of a rebound.” The analyst reminded that the $50,000 level is a very strong historical key point dating back to 2020 and 2021. *This is not investment advice.

His post emphasizes how her observations align with the argument that a sovereign, neutral, and interoperable digital asset could become essential in a changing monetary environment. The comments from Johnson, along with the examples she provided, form the basis of his position that infrastructure connected to XRP fits the characteristics being described. Franklin Templeton’s CEO sounds the alarm: the dollar’s dominance is being chipped away, and the world urgently needs a sovereign, neutral, free-floating currency, interoperable with all others. That’s exactly what XRP and Ripple’s infrastructure provide. pic.twitter.com/8zjawSdAox — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 23, 2025 Dollar Dominance Under Pressure In the video referenced by Aljarrah, Johnson noted that the dollar remains the leading reserve currency, but she acknowledged that its position is facing gradual erosion. She explained that countries selecting a reserve currency seek stability, strong economic foundations, and the absence of heavy capital controls. According to her, the dollar still satisfies these conditions, yet certain developments have introduced new considerations among central banks and policymakers. Johnson explained that the shift did not stem from sudden distrust but from geopolitical and economic actions that prompted other nations to reassess their exposure. She pointed to the freezing of Russian assets following the Ukraine invasion as a moment that caused officials in other countries to consider whether similar measures could one day apply to them. This, in her view, encouraged diversification away from exclusive reliance on the U.S. dollar. Global Transactions Reflect Changing Preferences Johnson noted that this adjustment is visible in how certain countries structure international trade. She referenced India’s purchase of oil from Russia using rupee-denominated invoicing, while China and Russia conduct transactions in yuan. These examples, she said, represent the incremental shift away from exclusive dollar usage while not eliminating its dominance.

The ongoing diversification indicates that global participants are preparing for a more distributed monetary landscape, with multiple currencies used depending on regional or political relationships. Aljarrah’s Interpretation and the Digital Asset Argument Aljarrah’s post connects Johnson’s remarks to the broader conversation around the need for a neutral and globally interoperable currency that is not dependent on any single nation’s policies. He stated that this aligns with the structure of XRP and the wider ecosystem built around it, emphasizing its capacity to operate as a free-floating asset designed for cross-border value transfer. While Johnson did not mention digital assets or XRP in her comments, the interpretation offered by Aljarrah reflects the view held by many digital asset advocates who believe that ongoing geopolitical and economic shifts may create space for alternative settlement mechanisms. He highlighted that the characteristics Johnson described match the qualities that supporters attribute to XRP’s role in international financial infrastructure.
