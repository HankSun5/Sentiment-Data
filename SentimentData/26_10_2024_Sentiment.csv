This allows users to track transactions on the Solana network and get notifications when something happens, which was a missing feature for many observing the Solana ecosystem. 𝗦𝗢𝗟𝗔𝗡𝗔 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗢𝗪 𝗟𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗢𝗡 𝗔𝗥𝗞𝗛𝗔𝗠 Arkham now supports on-chain data on the Solana blockchain. Here’s what you can expect: pic.twitter.com/M1BQVAgTIV — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) October 25, 2024 As a result of the integration of Solana, the Arkham network can track large value transfers made between certain wallets on the Solana blockchain. This addition is especially beneficial for traders and investors who want real-time data on the transaction flow in Solana to discern important financial events and make their trades accordingly. Arkham also offers its users the ability to enable real-time trade alerts which make it easier for them to monitor large or suspicious activity happening on the Solana network. Also, the new functionality also provides for a ‘User Trade Tracker’ which enables users to track their trades directly on the blockchain and view the whole history of their investments. This feature is suitable for both individual and institutional investors who are interested in having a high level of control over their on-chain trading activities. Solana now in focus for memecoin tracking As Solana becomes the go-to blockchain for memecoins, Arkham’s new tracking features come at the right time. The platform’s tools have recently expanded to include the ability to track memecoin traders on Solana, which has been a rapidly growing space this year. As reported by Arkham, Solana is now the most popular blockchain for memecoin trading with high frequency. At the moment, Solana is ranked fifth in the blockchain market based on market capitalization, after BNB, with a market capitalization of $78.34 billion. Solana’s native token SOL was valued at $166.22 as of this writing and was down by 5.92% in the past 24 hours. This puts Solana at the top of several other networks, thus confirming its position in the crypto space. Solana’s daily trading volume hit a record $7.93 million last week. This has considerably risen since late September and shows that the network is strong and expanding. The previous record of $7.07 million was seen on October 19, and then there was a slight dip to $5.1 million the following day. The upward process reached a histological apex, which identified Solana’s strong economic activity. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the main factors that define the value of Solana’s economy are tips (Jito) and priority fees, which account for more than 90% of daily transaction volume. On October 22, tips occupied 48.3% of the total revenue and priority fees occupied 48.9%. Base fees and vote fees formed small proportions, namely 0.8% and 2% respectively. This distribution shows the increasing role of fee models in the financial system of the network.",News|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-10-25 22:18:36

Authored by Dr. Matthew Ferranti, a Harvard-trained economist and former member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, presents several compelling arguments for why central banks might consider adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Bitcoin As A Modern Reserve Asset Dr. Ferranti begins by noting the trend of central banks increasing their gold reserves, suggesting that Bitcoin could serve as a modern counterpart. While only one central bank—the Central Bank of El Salvador—has publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings, Dr. Ferranti highlights that Bitcoin represents just under 10% of El Salvador’s reserves. He argues that an optimal allocation would fall between 2% and 5%, allowing for diversification without excessive risk. Related Reading: Tether Defends Its Record, Blasts WSJ For ‘Irresponsible Reporting’ One of the key points raised in the report is Bitcoin’s historical performance during economic crises. Dr. Ferranti argues that a crucial feature of any reserve asset is its ability to provide returns when traditional assets falter. The report cites examples such as the financial turmoil surrounding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 and the US sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both of which corresponded with significant spikes in Bitcoin’s value. Despite Bitcoin’s short-term volatility, Dr. Ferranti posits that it has the potential to outperform traditional assets over longer periods. He attributes this to Bitcoin’s Halving cycle, which reduces the rate of new coin production and can lead to price increases. Furthermore, the economist notes that both Bitcoin and gold perform well during inflationary periods, suggesting that rising Bitcoin prices might indicate forthcoming inflation. No Default Risk And Immunity To Financial Sanctions The report also references findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which indicate that Bitcoin’s price is largely unaffected by macroeconomic news, except for inflation-related information. This quality, the doctor says, makes Bitcoin an effective diversifier within a portfolio, especially given its low correlation with traditional reserve assets such as gold and foreign currencies. Dr. Ferranti outlines three reasons why Bitcoin is devoid of default risk. First, the doctor contends that it does not represent a claim on future cash flows, unlike stocks and bonds. Second, the network is secured through a robust mining process. Lastly, Bitcoin is immune to financial sanctions—an important consideration for central banks—since it cannot be “frozen” in the same way traditional assets can be. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible? While acknowledging that Bitcoin does not match the liquidity of the US Treasury market, Dr. Ferranti points out that its liquidity has improved significantly, with a current market cap exceeding $1.3 trillion. The economist concludes by suggesting that this level of liquidity is adequate for accommodating large transactions, making Bitcoin a more attractive option than in previous years for central banks worldwide. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $67,500, down 1.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Using chart patterns and key price levels, Melika offers both short and long-term perspectives on ADA’s price movement. Long-Term Cardano Price Outlook Melika identifies a significant support zone for ADA between $0.30 and $0.35. This range has historically shown strong buying interest, characterized by an engulfing candle pattern and previously established supply and demand (S&D) zones. This base formation suggests a robust floor where Cardano has consistently garnered market support. The analyst points out the potential for a bullish reversal, noting that ADA’s price action appears to be forming a bottom within this support zone. “The price seems to form a bottom after engulfing the support region, hinting at a potential bullish reversal,” Melika states. Looking ahead, Melika sets a long-term resistance target between $1.20 and $1.80. This target area is not arbitrary but is based on previous price peaks, making it a significant hurdle for future price action. Should ADA maintain its support base, the path to these higher resistance levels may be realized as buyer confidence rejuvenates, setting the stage for a potential bull run. Related Reading: Cardano’s Pullback Short-Lived, Fresh Rally Underway For ADA? “The next major resistance is in the $1.20-$1.80 zone, marked as a long-term target, which aligns with previous highs. If the current support holds, ADA could be positioned for a sustained rally toward the long-term target, especially as buyers regain confidence,” Melika writes. However, she also cautions investors about a bearish scenario where ADA fails to maintain the $0.30 support level. A breach below this threshold could lead to a decline to levels below $0.18, presenting a substantial risk for holders. “A failure to hold support around $0.30 could see the price retesting to below $0.18,” Melika warns. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? ADA Price Analysis: Short-Term Outlook In the immediate term, ADA is navigating a strong support zone identified between $0.33 and $0.34, aligned with a lower trendline that underscores its importance. “A bounce from this support zone could see ADA targeting the resistance zone at $0.38 – $0.39. The engulfed area suggests a possible reversal signal,” the crypto analyst claims. This resistance zone at $0.39 represents a critical point where previous sellers have previously dominated, making it a pivotal area for ADA’s short-term price action. A successful breach of this resistance could validate the bullish rebound scenario. “The $0.39 zone is a significant resistance where sellers previously controlled the market, making it a critical area to watch for any breakout,” Melika states. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain its current support, the price could retreat towards the broader long-term support at $0.30, underpinning the downside risks highlighted by Melika. At press time, ADA traded at $0.3437.

The analyst projects that Bitcoin’s next target is presently 70% above its current price, with the potential to surge as high as $116,652 as it experiences one of the most explosive bull waves ever seen. From Mark’s X post, it can be seen that the analyst has consistently projected the $116,600 price target for Bitcoin. His earliest Bitcoin prediction of this all-time high was on September 12, when he claimed that Bitcoin’s rise to over $116,600 was still 100% away. Mark’s unwavering confidence in this price target suggests a strong conviction that Bitcoin is poised to reach a new ATH this cycle. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $67,601, marking a 1.31% increase in the last 24 hours and a 5.86% increase over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Price Could Jump Even Higher Than $116,000 Another well-known crypto analyst, identified as ‘Yoddha’ on X has presented a Bitcoin price chart highlighting its next bullish price target. With a caption that reads: “When in doubt, zoom out,” the analyst has expressed his confidence that Bitcoin is set to skyrocket this season. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge In the price chart, the analyst pinpointed his next target for Bitcoin, indicating that the cryptocurrency could see its price soaring between $130,000 to $170,000. This price surge is expected to occur around 2025 when the bull market is fully underway. Conversely, Elja, a market expert on X, has projected a more conservative price target for Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to soar to a new ATH of around $94,000. However, the analyst believes that this massive price breakout will begin in October.

Recent declines have pushed FET’s price closer to key support levels, and the RSI’s current reading hints at a continuation of the bearish trend. With a potential drop toward the $0.966 target, investors are left wondering if FET can find a bottom or if additional losses lie ahead. This article analyzes the recent downward pressure on FET’s price, with a particular focus on the pessimistic signals indicated by the RSI. By examining the current market conditions, key support and resistance levels, and the RSI’s implications, we’ll explore whether the token will likely continue its decline toward the $0.966 target or if a potential reversal could be on the way. What The RSI Reveals For FET On the 4-hour chart, FET has demonstrated pronounced bearish momentum, slipping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it approaches the $0.966 mark. This movement below the 100-day SMA signals that negative forces are currently outweighing bullish attempts at price recovery, possibly opening the door to further declines. An analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now declined to the 34% level following an earlier attempt to rally that stalled at 46%. An RSI near 30% often suggests a potential reversal could be imminent. However, in this context, it may also signal the continuation of a bearish path unless buying interest returns to support a rebound. Related Reading: FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86? Meanwhile, on the daily chart, FET is displaying notable pessimistic movement as it tries to fall below the 100-day SMA. This downturn highlights rising selling pressure and negative market sentiment, which collectively heightens the probability of the asset dropping below the SMA and heading toward the $0.966 mark. A successful breach of the 100-day SMA could signal additional declines, pushing the price down to this critical support level. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows that negative pressure on FET is intensifying as the signal line has recently dropped below 50%, now settling at 39%. As the RSI remains in this lower range, it suggests that sellers are gaining dominance, potentially paving the way for further drops unless buying momentum can return to shift the sentiment. Key Support Levels: Can $0.966 Hold Against The Bears? As FET’s price remains under downward pressure, the $0.966 mark stands out as a crucial support level. If the price breaks below this threshold, it may signal a strong correction, possibly resulting in more decrease toward the $0.459 level and beyond. Related Reading: FET On Fire With 27% Rally, Analysts See Bigger Gains Ahead Conversely, if the token manages to hold its position above $0.966, it could indicate a potential reversal, enabling bulls to reclaim some control in the market and driving the price higher toward the $1.86 resistance level and beyond.

This gain is especially surprising given the sour mood around the crypto just weeks ago, with several analysts predicting the altcoin would suffer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing But Solana has defied the odds, increasing both in price and in market confidence. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, the gain coincides with a broader increase in positive sentiment for Solana, encouraging industry-wide discussions about its potential. Solana sentiment and mindshare keeps going through the roof. But the run is far from over.

According to experts, Solana’s present trajectory, which is supported by a bullish pennant pattern, indicates that SOL might reach as high as $260 if it breaks past resistance. 📈 Solana is outperforming most altcoins as prices are looking to rebound after a big fall Wednesday. The #5 market cap asset continues to be a prime example of how the crowd usually gets it WRONG. View the current bearish sentiment as a sign SOL can continue to pump. pic.twitter.com/pRkCnyxRxh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 23, 2024 Increasing Interest And Technical Indicators As Solana’s price rose, observers saw a dramatic surge in positive sentiment about the asset. According to data, the number of discussions surrounding Solana has contributed to the upsurge observed in the slant. Mindshare (a measure of the percentage of crypto discussions a coin commands) has remained high. For Deutscher, the increasing attentiveness on Solana is a sign that there is even more room for growth, contrary to the prevailing tendency in the market. Although some investors are wary, experts say the technical terrain is still favorable. If the item breaks over its barrier, the optimistic pennant formation in SOL’s price action usually denotes more gains. Depending on if Solana can break out from its present level, its token’s price might be positioned for a notable climb toward $260. The Ethereum-Solana Rivalry Surprisingly, Solana’s comeback happens at the same time that Ethereum co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko shows his accolade on Ethereum. Solana and Ethereum are competitors, but Yakovenko recently praised Ethereum’s core technology and said he liked its design and goal. I like @BanklessHQ and ethereum.

Related Reading: XRP Could Rally 27% This Week In ‘Tremendous Move’, Analyst Says Ethereum has long been the preferred protocol among developers, but Solana, dubbed a “Ethereum-killer,” has quickly gained favor because to its speed and lower transaction fees. Yakovenko’s recognition demonstrates a developing sector in which competitors can acknowledge each other’s contributions to blockchain innovation. Future Perspectives And Market Sentiment Meanwhile, Deutscher feels Solana’s price might double or possibly quadruple, particularly if Bitcoin rises to new highs, say $100,000. SOL’s continued performance despite recent falls suggests that it may have strong community and long-term holders. For the time being, SOL is a coin to keep an eye on, and with increased sentiment and a technical boost, it appears to be on track to continue challenging expectations.

As of July 15th, both cryptos were up 50% YTD, but Ethereum has since lost most gains while Bitcoin continued to rally. The Bitcoin to Ethereum ratio has widened to just under 27, a level not seen in over three years, highlighting Bitcoin's recent dominance. In the crypto space, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are considered two of the most credible with market caps of $1.3 trillion and $300 billion, respectively. While there is a tendency for many investors/speculators to lump the two together as highly correlated to each other, that has been far from the case over the last several months. Until mid-summer, Bitcoin and Ethereum followed similar paths, but since then, the paths of the two have diverged. The chart below shows the YTD performance of both cryptos and as recently as July 15th, both were up an identical 50% YTD. Since then, though, Ethereum has given up most of its YTD gains while Bitcoin has added modestly to its rally. Given the divergence between the two, the ratio of bitcoin to Ethereum has widened to just under 27, which is a level not seen in more than three years. As shown in the chart below, this is still half of where the ratio was in early 2021 (it was even higher than that in 2000), but in the short term, Bitcoin has become the ""Mag 1"" of the crypto space.

When Bitcoin soared to register fresh all-time highs, easing past $70,000 in March, ETH prices struggled to break $4,000. When it did, the best the coin could do was retest $4,100 before dumping hard. In the past seven months, after the second most valuable coin registered 2024 highs, it is down nearly 40%. Considering its performance over the past three months, there are concerns that Ethereum could post even more losses. Technically, this may be the case should it fail to breach $3,000 in the coming sessions. Don’t Blame Ethereum Or Its Leaders For ETH’s Underperformance Taking to X, one analyst thinks ETH is trailing Bitcoin, Solana, and even Tron, not because of how the network is designed or its leadership. In his view, the dismal performance over the past seven months concerns the “uninformed” investors. Related Reading: Is The Cat Season Here? MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH Admittedly, after prices peaked in March, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have been offloading their stash. According to Dune, the foundation has been transferring coins regularly. On September 6, they moved 1,000 ETH when the coin changed hands at $2,300. Most of these coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Although Buterin sells ETH from time to time, the co-founder has been selling meme coins heavily and donating to various charities across the globe. Usually, whenever a senior executive or foundation sells, it is bearish. However, pointing to the analyst’s assessment, their actions, including many others centered on network improvement, aren’t a big concern. ETH To Be A Better Store Of Value Than Bitcoin For Growth? The analyst on X thinks ETH is falling because investors lack knowledge about the project’s fundamental strengths. Most importantly, the argument is that ETH can be a better store of value than gold. The observer insists that Ethereum and Bitcoin compete, and claiming otherwise is a mistake. Both of these networks want to dominate the market eventually. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here’s What DOGE ‘Risk Indicator’ Says About Rally So far, Bitcoin is the most valuable. On the other hand, Ethereum is the most active smart contracts platform, offering more versatility and is “richer” than the first blockchain. For ETH to grow in strength, it must establish itself as a superior store of value, better than Bitcoin. This will require the network to have strong supply dynamics and a greater focus on finance as a primary use case. Once this happens, ETH will be more attractive not only to investors but also to developers. For now, Ethereum is growing in strength, looking at ETH net deflation since EIP-1559, looking at UltraSound Money. At the same time, its roll-up ecosystem is booming, scaling the mainnet. Altogether, the coin could benefit in the long-term, pushing valuation higher.
