This allows users to track transactions on the Solana network and get notifications when something happens, which was a missing feature for many observing the Solana ecosystem. 𝗦𝗢𝗟𝗔𝗡𝗔 𝗜𝗦 𝗡𝗢𝗪 𝗟𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗢𝗡 𝗔𝗥𝗞𝗛𝗔𝗠 Arkham now supports on-chain data on the Solana blockchain. Here’s what you can expect: pic.twitter.com/M1BQVAgTIV — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) October 25, 2024 As a result of the integration of Solana, the Arkham network can track large value transfers made between certain wallets on the Solana blockchain. This addition is especially beneficial for traders and investors who want real-time data on the transaction flow in Solana to discern important financial events and make their trades accordingly. Arkham also offers its users the ability to enable real-time trade alerts which make it easier for them to monitor large or suspicious activity happening on the Solana network. Also, the new functionality also provides for a ‘User Trade Tracker’ which enables users to track their trades directly on the blockchain and view the whole history of their investments. This feature is suitable for both individual and institutional investors who are interested in having a high level of control over their on-chain trading activities. Solana now in focus for memecoin tracking As Solana becomes the go-to blockchain for memecoins, Arkham’s new tracking features come at the right time. The platform’s tools have recently expanded to include the ability to track memecoin traders on Solana, which has been a rapidly growing space this year. As reported by Arkham, Solana is now the most popular blockchain for memecoin trading with high frequency. At the moment, Solana is ranked fifth in the blockchain market based on market capitalization, after BNB, with a market capitalization of $78.34 billion. Solana’s native token SOL was valued at $166.22 as of this writing and was down by 5.92% in the past 24 hours. This puts Solana at the top of several other networks, thus confirming its position in the crypto space. Solana’s daily trading volume hit a record $7.93 million last week. This has considerably risen since late September and shows that the network is strong and expanding. The previous record of $7.07 million was seen on October 19, and then there was a slight dip to $5.1 million the following day. The upward process reached a histological apex, which identified Solana’s strong economic activity. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the main factors that define the value of Solana’s economy are tips (Jito) and priority fees, which account for more than 90% of daily transaction volume. On October 22, tips occupied 48.3% of the total revenue and priority fees occupied 48.9%. Base fees and vote fees formed small proportions, namely 0.8% and 2% respectively. This distribution shows the increasing role of fee models in the financial system of the network.",News|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-10-25 22:18:36

Authored by Dr. Matthew Ferranti, a Harvard-trained economist and former member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, presents several compelling arguments for why central banks might consider adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Bitcoin As A Modern Reserve Asset Dr. Ferranti begins by noting the trend of central banks increasing their gold reserves, suggesting that Bitcoin could serve as a modern counterpart. While only one central bank—the Central Bank of El Salvador—has publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings, Dr. Ferranti highlights that Bitcoin represents just under 10% of El Salvador’s reserves. He argues that an optimal allocation would fall between 2% and 5%, allowing for diversification without excessive risk. Related Reading: Tether Defends Its Record, Blasts WSJ For ‘Irresponsible Reporting’ One of the key points raised in the report is Bitcoin’s historical performance during economic crises. Dr. Ferranti argues that a crucial feature of any reserve asset is its ability to provide returns when traditional assets falter. The report cites examples such as the financial turmoil surrounding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 and the US sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both of which corresponded with significant spikes in Bitcoin’s value. Despite Bitcoin’s short-term volatility, Dr. Ferranti posits that it has the potential to outperform traditional assets over longer periods. He attributes this to Bitcoin’s Halving cycle, which reduces the rate of new coin production and can lead to price increases. Furthermore, the economist notes that both Bitcoin and gold perform well during inflationary periods, suggesting that rising Bitcoin prices might indicate forthcoming inflation. No Default Risk And Immunity To Financial Sanctions The report also references findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which indicate that Bitcoin’s price is largely unaffected by macroeconomic news, except for inflation-related information. This quality, the doctor says, makes Bitcoin an effective diversifier within a portfolio, especially given its low correlation with traditional reserve assets such as gold and foreign currencies. Dr. Ferranti outlines three reasons why Bitcoin is devoid of default risk. First, the doctor contends that it does not represent a claim on future cash flows, unlike stocks and bonds. Second, the network is secured through a robust mining process. Lastly, Bitcoin is immune to financial sanctions—an important consideration for central banks—since it cannot be “frozen” in the same way traditional assets can be. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible? While acknowledging that Bitcoin does not match the liquidity of the US Treasury market, Dr. Ferranti points out that its liquidity has improved significantly, with a current market cap exceeding $1.3 trillion. The economist concludes by suggesting that this level of liquidity is adequate for accommodating large transactions, making Bitcoin a more attractive option than in previous years for central banks worldwide. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $67,500, down 1.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Using chart patterns and key price levels, Melika offers both short and long-term perspectives on ADA’s price movement. Long-Term Cardano Price Outlook Melika identifies a significant support zone for ADA between $0.30 and $0.35. This range has historically shown strong buying interest, characterized by an engulfing candle pattern and previously established supply and demand (S&D) zones. This base formation suggests a robust floor where Cardano has consistently garnered market support. The analyst points out the potential for a bullish reversal, noting that ADA’s price action appears to be forming a bottom within this support zone. “The price seems to form a bottom after engulfing the support region, hinting at a potential bullish reversal,” Melika states. Looking ahead, Melika sets a long-term resistance target between $1.20 and $1.80. This target area is not arbitrary but is based on previous price peaks, making it a significant hurdle for future price action. Should ADA maintain its support base, the path to these higher resistance levels may be realized as buyer confidence rejuvenates, setting the stage for a potential bull run. Related Reading: Cardano’s Pullback Short-Lived, Fresh Rally Underway For ADA? “The next major resistance is in the $1.20-$1.80 zone, marked as a long-term target, which aligns with previous highs. If the current support holds, ADA could be positioned for a sustained rally toward the long-term target, especially as buyers regain confidence,” Melika writes. However, she also cautions investors about a bearish scenario where ADA fails to maintain the $0.30 support level. A breach below this threshold could lead to a decline to levels below $0.18, presenting a substantial risk for holders. “A failure to hold support around $0.30 could see the price retesting to below $0.18,” Melika warns. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? ADA Price Analysis: Short-Term Outlook In the immediate term, ADA is navigating a strong support zone identified between $0.33 and $0.34, aligned with a lower trendline that underscores its importance. “A bounce from this support zone could see ADA targeting the resistance zone at $0.38 – $0.39. The engulfed area suggests a possible reversal signal,” the crypto analyst claims. This resistance zone at $0.39 represents a critical point where previous sellers have previously dominated, making it a pivotal area for ADA’s short-term price action. A successful breach of this resistance could validate the bullish rebound scenario. “The $0.39 zone is a significant resistance where sellers previously controlled the market, making it a critical area to watch for any breakout,” Melika states. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain its current support, the price could retreat towards the broader long-term support at $0.30, underpinning the downside risks highlighted by Melika. At press time, ADA traded at $0.3437.

The analyst projects that Bitcoin’s next target is presently 70% above its current price, with the potential to surge as high as $116,652 as it experiences one of the most explosive bull waves ever seen. From Mark’s X post, it can be seen that the analyst has consistently projected the $116,600 price target for Bitcoin. His earliest Bitcoin prediction of this all-time high was on September 12, when he claimed that Bitcoin’s rise to over $116,600 was still 100% away. Mark’s unwavering confidence in this price target suggests a strong conviction that Bitcoin is poised to reach a new ATH this cycle. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $67,601, marking a 1.31% increase in the last 24 hours and a 5.86% increase over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Price Could Jump Even Higher Than $116,000 Another well-known crypto analyst, identified as ‘Yoddha’ on X has presented a Bitcoin price chart highlighting its next bullish price target. With a caption that reads: “When in doubt, zoom out,” the analyst has expressed his confidence that Bitcoin is set to skyrocket this season. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge In the price chart, the analyst pinpointed his next target for Bitcoin, indicating that the cryptocurrency could see its price soaring between $130,000 to $170,000. This price surge is expected to occur around 2025 when the bull market is fully underway. Conversely, Elja, a market expert on X, has projected a more conservative price target for Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to soar to a new ATH of around $94,000. However, the analyst believes that this massive price breakout will begin in October.

Recent declines have pushed FET’s price closer to key support levels, and the RSI’s current reading hints at a continuation of the bearish trend. With a potential drop toward the $0.966 target, investors are left wondering if FET can find a bottom or if additional losses lie ahead. This article analyzes the recent downward pressure on FET’s price, with a particular focus on the pessimistic signals indicated by the RSI. By examining the current market conditions, key support and resistance levels, and the RSI’s implications, we’ll explore whether the token will likely continue its decline toward the $0.966 target or if a potential reversal could be on the way. What The RSI Reveals For FET On the 4-hour chart, FET has demonstrated pronounced bearish momentum, slipping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it approaches the $0.966 mark. This movement below the 100-day SMA signals that negative forces are currently outweighing bullish attempts at price recovery, possibly opening the door to further declines. An analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now declined to the 34% level following an earlier attempt to rally that stalled at 46%. An RSI near 30% often suggests a potential reversal could be imminent. However, in this context, it may also signal the continuation of a bearish path unless buying interest returns to support a rebound. Related Reading: FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86? Meanwhile, on the daily chart, FET is displaying notable pessimistic movement as it tries to fall below the 100-day SMA. This downturn highlights rising selling pressure and negative market sentiment, which collectively heightens the probability of the asset dropping below the SMA and heading toward the $0.966 mark. A successful breach of the 100-day SMA could signal additional declines, pushing the price down to this critical support level. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows that negative pressure on FET is intensifying as the signal line has recently dropped below 50%, now settling at 39%. As the RSI remains in this lower range, it suggests that sellers are gaining dominance, potentially paving the way for further drops unless buying momentum can return to shift the sentiment. Key Support Levels: Can $0.966 Hold Against The Bears? As FET’s price remains under downward pressure, the $0.966 mark stands out as a crucial support level. If the price breaks below this threshold, it may signal a strong correction, possibly resulting in more decrease toward the $0.459 level and beyond. Related Reading: FET On Fire With 27% Rally, Analysts See Bigger Gains Ahead Conversely, if the token manages to hold its position above $0.966, it could indicate a potential reversal, enabling bulls to reclaim some control in the market and driving the price higher toward the $1.86 resistance level and beyond.

This gain is especially surprising given the sour mood around the crypto just weeks ago, with several analysts predicting the altcoin would suffer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing But Solana has defied the odds, increasing both in price and in market confidence. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, the gain coincides with a broader increase in positive sentiment for Solana, encouraging industry-wide discussions about its potential. Solana sentiment and mindshare keeps going through the roof. But the run is far from over.

According to experts, Solana’s present trajectory, which is supported by a bullish pennant pattern, indicates that SOL might reach as high as $260 if it breaks past resistance. 📈 Solana is outperforming most altcoins as prices are looking to rebound after a big fall Wednesday. The #5 market cap asset continues to be a prime example of how the crowd usually gets it WRONG. View the current bearish sentiment as a sign SOL can continue to pump. pic.twitter.com/pRkCnyxRxh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 23, 2024 Increasing Interest And Technical Indicators As Solana’s price rose, observers saw a dramatic surge in positive sentiment about the asset. According to data, the number of discussions surrounding Solana has contributed to the upsurge observed in the slant. Mindshare (a measure of the percentage of crypto discussions a coin commands) has remained high. For Deutscher, the increasing attentiveness on Solana is a sign that there is even more room for growth, contrary to the prevailing tendency in the market. Although some investors are wary, experts say the technical terrain is still favorable. If the item breaks over its barrier, the optimistic pennant formation in SOL’s price action usually denotes more gains. Depending on if Solana can break out from its present level, its token’s price might be positioned for a notable climb toward $260. The Ethereum-Solana Rivalry Surprisingly, Solana’s comeback happens at the same time that Ethereum co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko shows his accolade on Ethereum. Solana and Ethereum are competitors, but Yakovenko recently praised Ethereum’s core technology and said he liked its design and goal. I like @BanklessHQ and ethereum. I even like the ethereum design and vision. If you told me to go build an alternative to bitcoin, ethereum settlement layer focused design is what I would steer the engineering towards.

Related Reading: XRP Could Rally 27% This Week In ‘Tremendous Move’, Analyst Says Ethereum has long been the preferred protocol among developers, but Solana, dubbed a “Ethereum-killer,” has quickly gained favor because to its speed and lower transaction fees. Yakovenko’s recognition demonstrates a developing sector in which competitors can acknowledge each other’s contributions to blockchain innovation. Future Perspectives And Market Sentiment Meanwhile, Deutscher feels Solana’s price might double or possibly quadruple, particularly if Bitcoin rises to new highs, say $100,000. SOL’s continued performance despite recent falls suggests that it may have strong community and long-term holders. For the time being, SOL is a coin to keep an eye on, and with increased sentiment and a technical boost, it appears to be on track to continue challenging expectations.

As of July 15th, both cryptos were up 50% YTD, but Ethereum has since lost most gains while Bitcoin continued to rally. The Bitcoin to Ethereum ratio has widened to just under 27, a level not seen in over three years, highlighting Bitcoin's recent dominance. In the crypto space, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are considered two of the most credible with market caps of $1.3 trillion and $300 billion, respectively. While there is a tendency for many investors/speculators to lump the two together as highly correlated to each other, that has been far from the case over the last several months. Until mid-summer, Bitcoin and Ethereum followed similar paths, but since then, the paths of the two have diverged. The chart below shows the YTD performance of both cryptos and as recently as July 15th, both were up an identical 50% YTD. Since then, though, Ethereum has given up most of its YTD gains while Bitcoin has added modestly to its rally. Given the divergence between the two, the ratio of bitcoin to Ethereum has widened to just under 27, which is a level not seen in more than three years. As shown in the chart below, this is still half of where the ratio was in early 2021 (it was even higher than that in 2000), but in the short term, Bitcoin has become the ""Mag 1"" of the crypto space.

When Bitcoin soared to register fresh all-time highs, easing past $70,000 in March, ETH prices struggled to break $4,000. When it did, the best the coin could do was retest $4,100 before dumping hard. In the past seven months, after the second most valuable coin registered 2024 highs, it is down nearly 40%. Considering its performance over the past three months, there are concerns that Ethereum could post even more losses. Technically, this may be the case should it fail to breach $3,000 in the coming sessions. Don’t Blame Ethereum Or Its Leaders For ETH’s Underperformance Taking to X, one analyst thinks ETH is trailing Bitcoin, Solana, and even Tron, not because of how the network is designed or its leadership. In his view, the dismal performance over the past seven months concerns the “uninformed” investors. Related Reading: Is The Cat Season Here? MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH Admittedly, after prices peaked in March, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have been offloading their stash. According to Dune, the foundation has been transferring coins regularly. On September 6, they moved 1,000 ETH when the coin changed hands at $2,300. Most of these coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Although Buterin sells ETH from time to time, the co-founder has been selling meme coins heavily and donating to various charities across the globe. Usually, whenever a senior executive or foundation sells, it is bearish. However, pointing to the analyst’s assessment, their actions, including many others centered on network improvement, aren’t a big concern. ETH To Be A Better Store Of Value Than Bitcoin For Growth? The analyst on X thinks ETH is falling because investors lack knowledge about the project’s fundamental strengths. Most importantly, the argument is that ETH can be a better store of value than gold. The observer insists that Ethereum and Bitcoin compete, and claiming otherwise is a mistake. Both of these networks want to dominate the market eventually. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here’s What DOGE ‘Risk Indicator’ Says About Rally So far, Bitcoin is the most valuable. On the other hand, Ethereum is the most active smart contracts platform, offering more versatility and is “richer” than the first blockchain. For ETH to grow in strength, it must establish itself as a superior store of value, better than Bitcoin. This will require the network to have strong supply dynamics and a greater focus on finance as a primary use case. Once this happens, ETH will be more attractive not only to investors but also to developers. For now, Ethereum is growing in strength, looking at ETH net deflation since EIP-1559, looking at UltraSound Money. At the same time, its roll-up ecosystem is booming, scaling the mainnet. Altogether, the coin could benefit in the long-term, pushing valuation higher.

Analyst Explains Why",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-100000-by-february-2025-analyst-explains-why/,"The current trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) prices could push it to the $100,000 mark within the next 90 days, regardless of the results of the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin At $100,000 By February 2025? Crypto analyst Timothy Peterson suggests that BTC’s current price movement is not substantially different from previous trends, raising questions about the “diminishing marginal returns” theory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing From an investor’s perspective, Bitcoin’s diminishing marginal returns theory implies that each halving cycle leads to smaller successive price gains, as the digital asset’s total market cap matures and its supply shocks have a reduced impact on driving up demand. This suggests that while BTC may continue to grow, the extraordinary returns seen in early cycles could decrease over time. However, Peterson’s assessment appears to dismiss this theory. To recall, BTC made its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 in March 2024. Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has been consolidating for almost eight months in a wide price range, reaching as low as $54,000. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $67,998, about 10% lower than its ATH. Peterson argues that BTC’s movement just above the red trendline would put the digital asset at $100,000 within 90 days. The analyst added that such a move will be “completely within reason.” He added: A conservative scenario puts bitcoin at $100k around February. I think this happens regardless of the US election outcome. Furthermore, the analyst suggested that according to other data-driven metrics he’s monitoring, BTC is not overpriced at its current market valuation, and the probability of a drop below $60,000 is increasingly unlikely. Focus On BTC Year-End Price Predictions While Peterson envisions BTC nearing $100,000 within three months, other analysts and industry insiders have varying expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Peak Around $200,000 In Next 18 Months: CleanSpark CEO Tells Why For instance, options market traders expect BTC to break through its previous ATH by November end, no matter who becomes the next US president. Similarly, in a recent client memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan outlined several factors that could force BTC to “melt-up” to $80,000 in Q4 2024. These factors include the potential victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump, additional interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), and an extended period free of major negative developments in the crypto sector. Besides the aforementioned factors, the optimism toward a year-end BTC rally is also fueled by rising retail demand for the premier digital asset. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant highlighted that Bitcoin transactions worth less than $10,000 are on an uptrend, indicating renewed retail demand as the market gradually pivots from risk-off to risk-on mode. BTC trades at $67,998 on the daily chart at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

According to a recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst, the behind the scenes of this price struggle for ETH has been quite interesting, with the asset seeing a significant shift in its netflow. This shift in Ethereum’s netflow could have significant implications for ETH, potentially influencing the market’s reaction positively or negatively. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Verge’ Upgrade To Simplify Running Nodes On Phones And Wearables Dissecting The Ethereum Netflow The CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha revealed in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that Ethereum has recently experienced a spike in netflows, with approximately 96,000 ETH moving into derivative exchanges. According to Taha, this influx could indicate that traders are positioning for potential price shifts, as large transfers to derivatives platforms have historically preceded periods of increased volatility or even corrections. Taha’s analysis, backed by previous spikes in May and early July, suggests that Ethereum’s current activity might foreshadow a heightened period of market movement. The analyst wrote: The latest spike in netflow could signal another period of heightened market activity, potentially a price correction or a sharp move based on trader positioning. Market Sentiment Drawn From Bitcoin In addition to Ethereum’s netflows, Taha delved into Bitcoin’s Futures Sentiment Index, observing that this metric shows peaks in sentiment that may serve as indicators of broader market behavior. He pointed out three instances where the sentiment index spiked, marked by red-circled peaks (in the chart above), each time coinciding with a local market top. This trend implies that, following peaks in trader sentiment, Bitcoin’s price typically experiences a decline. The sentiment index, thus, can serve as a “contrarian indicator”—when optimism peaks, price corrections often follow. These sentiment patterns may signal that investors should brace for potential volatility for Ethereum, which is highly correlated with Bitcoin.

So far, the asset has registered a correction in the past week, dropping by 3.1%. However, the past day performance is attempting to be more positive. Over this period, Ethereum has seen a slight increase of 0.9%, rising to as high as $2,559 earlier today before now trading for $2,541, at the time of writing. Despite the notable fluctuation the asset has seen in the past week alone, rising to above $2,700 and dropping below $2,500, Ethereum daily trading volume seems to have maintained composure. Data from Coingecko shows that this metric has remained between $15 billion and $19 billion in the past week with no major spike or decline.

This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bull-run-not-ratio-has-just-golden-cross/,"Data shows the ratio between two Bitcoin on-chain metrics has recently formed a pattern that has historically been bullish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin LTH/STH SOPR Ratio Has Crossed Above Its 90-Day MA Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the recent trend in the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling at a profit or loss. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder is making BTC transactions at a net profit. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies loss-taking is dominant on the network. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here’s What DOGE ‘Risk Indicator’ Says About Rally The SOPR Ratio, the actual metric of interest here, keeps track of the ratio between the version of the SOPR specifically for short-term holders and that for long-term holders. Short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) are the two main divisions of the Bitcoin userbase made on the basis of holding time. The cutoff between these cohorts is 155 days, with investors who hold past this mark moving from the STHs to the LTHs. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio and its 90-day moving average (MA) over the history of the cryptocurrency: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio has seen a surge recently, which suggests the LTHs have been ramping up their profit-taking compared to the STHs. This trend is something that has historically been witnessed during bullish periods, since the LTHs are resolute entities who tend to amass large profits by the time the bull run hits in full swing. The STHs are by definition the holders who bought within the past five months, meaning that their cost basis lies somewhere around the prices that BTC was trading at inside this window. Thus, their profits are never as big as the LTHs, who often have their cost basis close to bear market lows. This is why the ratio blows up toward the LTHs in bullish periods. With the latest increase, the SOPR Ratio has reached a value of 1.8 and has surpassed its 90-day MA. In the chart, the CryptoQuant author has highlighted the past instances of this crossover. It would appear that this pattern has generally proven to be bullish for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Is It Too Late To Accumulate Bitcoin? What This Indicator Says Naturally, the profit-taking from the LTHs can be a concern, but as is apparent from the graph, the cycle has usually only been at risk of topping out when the ratio has broken above a value of 7. Thus, there could still be plenty of room to run for Bitcoin, with demand potentially absorbing the LTH profit-taking until the same extreme levels as the past cycles. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,200, up more than 1% over the last 24 hours.

This increase in active addresses comes amid the asset’s continuous struggle to register any significant rally in price. Instead, the altcoin has steadily decline now down by over 10% in its 30-day performance. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces Ongoing Struggles: Will a Turnaround Happen? XRP Active Addresses Hits 6-Month Peak According to a CryptoQuant analyst known as “maartunn,” the daily active sending addresses on XRP’s blockchain have reached a six-month high, with roughly 12,230 number of addresses transacting daily. maartunn highlighted that this resurgence in active addresses indicates a potential return of investor interest in XRP and possibly in the broader cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the increase in activity is seen as a positive development for the XRP blockchain. The CryptoQuant analyst suggested that rising user participation not only boosts XRP’s value as a blockchain asset but also enhances its appeal to investors. XRP: Active Sending Addresses reaches a 6-month high “The number of Active Sending Addresses on XRP reaches 12,230 on a daily basis… The increase signals that activity is returning to the XRP Blockchain.” – By @JA_Maartun Link 👇https://t.co/8ejsxFt5wO pic.twitter.com/VnYPrHXjJb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 25, 2024 The analyst also noted that active usage of a blockchain is essential for its long-term viability, adding that an uptick in transaction activity typically reflects increasing interest. However, despite all these positivity the increase in active addresses indicates, the CryptoQuant analyst cautioned that it remains to be seen whether this recent momentum in active addresses can be maintained. Against The Backdrop Of Legal Developments The surge in active sending addresses comes at a time when the altcoin is seeing some notable developments in its ongoing legal battles. Recently, XRP scored a significant legal victory when a court filing confirmed that XRP is not considered a security. This ruling marked a major turning point in the long-standing legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For years, Ripple has been embroiled in a case with the SEC, which argued that XRP should be classified as a security and therefore be subject to specific regulatory requirements. The recent decision has provided a new level of clarity for the altcoin, boosting confidence in the asset among market participants.

The filing challenges a recent SEC ruling, aiming to establish a legal foundation that could prevent future regulatory conflicts over XRP’s classification. Today, Ripple filed a Form C – listing the issues we plan to raise on our cross appeal. A few things to keep in mind as we move forward: The case is not about whether XRP, in and of itself, is a security.

If there is any fundamental value in DOGE beyond the meme, it's when transaction fees spike on the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Blockchain. Which appears to be starting to happen once again. Historically, daily active addresses on Dogecoin lead price higher. We're seeing active addresses start to move up. I don't currently have an active DOGE position on. But it's not something that I'm ruling out in the instance of a deeper pullback to the coin's 50 day MA. My history with Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) on Seeking Alpha is not one of admiration. In December 2023, I was highly bearish the coin and called DOGE my top crypto bear pick for 2023. More recently, I upgraded the coin to 'hold' and noted that despite what I view to be a somewhat pointless coin, the power of the meme was no longer something I felt made sense to fade. Data by YCharts That turned out to be a well-timed pivot as DOGE rallied more than 100% shortly after the upgrade. Currently, we find DOGE well off those highs from March of this year but ahead of the August lows of 8 cents. In this update, we'll take a look at key metrics from the network and the technical setup that can be currently viewed in the price. Network Metrics Two of the primary ways we analyzed DOGE in my late-February piece was through active address data and fee data. Fees are important because they show network usage through ledger validation revenue and daily active addresses are important because they show the closest thing we have to users. On that latter point, daily active addresses are not - and should not be viewed as - a viable 'unique users' comparison because one person can operate several different addresses. Regardless, to be bullish the broader Dogecoin network, DOGE holders would theoretically want to see active addresses and fees both increase in tandem. Dogecoin Fees vs FD Cap (Token Terminal) The chart above shows the full history of Dogecoin network fees on a monthly basis. When I last covered Dogecoin, monthly fees were on the rise. In February, fees eclipsed $462k for the month. This is still well below what could reasonably be considered a robust fee market compared to other public blockchain networks. But the main takeaway is that early 2024 fees were a flash in the pan. The network has been averaging about $70k in monthly fees between August and October. This is off the highs from the spring but actually well ahead of the 2023 averages. Switching gears to daily actives, I've added the coin price to the chart and below and we're looking at both price and daily active address count through a 30 day average: 30 Day Average Price vs DAAs (CoinMetrics) What I find interesting about this chart is over the last 5 years we've generally seen starts and peaks in active addresses lead price. In early 2021 active address growth lead coin price between March and May. It happened again between November 2023 and March 2024. The same appears to be happening again with Dogecoin active addresses grinding higher by about 20% starting at the beginning of September. The question is do we have a viable catalyst for a larger sustained move in daily active addresses on Dogecoin? Frankly, I think it comes down to the network usability of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). BTC Median TX Fee (30 Day average) (CoinMetrics) In the past, we've generally needed large fee spikes on Bitcoin to get big moves higher in daily active addresses on smaller proof-of-work blockchains. In the chart above, we can see the median transaction fee on Bitcoin started to move higher at the beginning of October. I'm certainly not going to try to predict that this will be the time the Bitcoin fee market grows sustainably, but I suppose anything is possible. Technical Opinion The most straight forward way to look at altcoin charts is to examine the dollar-denominated price levels against moving averages. My assessment of DOGE in this manner is actually somewhat bullish: DOGE Daily Chart (TrendSpider) The daily chart above shows a a coin that has battled trend line resistance from spring of this year, broken that trend, back-tested it, and achieved a subsequent new high since August. Furthermore, the 200 day moving average has been taken out as well. Such analysis is fine but it doesn't always make the case that longing an altcoin is a good idea if it can't realistically be expected that the coin in question will outperform Bitcoin. Below I'm showing peaks the DOGE/BTC ratio over the last five years: DOGE/BTC Ratio (TrendSpider) The number of the ratio itself is a bit dubious to even share as it has so many zeroes following the decimal. The better way to measure it is to do so in Satoshis, or ""sats."" Currently, it takes about 200 sats to buy 1 DOGE. On the chart above, I've drawn a trend line from the long term high of 1,287 sats in May 2021 down to today. This line has served as resistance on each subsequent pop in the price of DOGE. That changed in September when the ratio moved above trend. We now find the ratio battling to take out the 50 week MA at 208 sats. In a broader crypto rally, I could very easily see a pop to 253 sats - which previously served as support before breaking down. But again, as is the case with transaction fees on Bitcoin, we're guessing. Closing Thoughts When it comes to crypto, I've tried to look for fundamental reasons to be bullish a network, coin, or token. As is often the case, the fundamental thesis for DOGE is not all that straight forward. The coin has survived far longer than I believed it could as little more than a ""meme."" We could argue that the joke seems to be increasingly less funny as the years go on. Regardless, where I think DOGE does have some fundamental value is in an environment where fees on Bitcoin make the network unusable for most holders. This has proven to lead to surges in usage for other PoW networks and Dogecoin is one of them. Those Bitcoin fees appear to be spiking again. And we know that daily active address increases typically lead price with DOGE. It's a gamble and guess, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a 25% pop in the DOGE/BTC ratio. That would take DOGE from 200 sats to 250 sats. At a BTC price of $67k, we get a 250 sat price of nearly $0.17 for DOGE. It's not a terrible trade if one chooses to put it on. I don't currently have an active DOGE position on. But it's not something that I'm ruling out in the instance of a deeper pullback to the 50 day MA.",DOGE-USD,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-26 13:00:00

However, some market watchers shared their worries about the recent retraces, suggesting the cryptocurrency could face another correction ahead of the US Presidential election. Related Reading: Is The Cat Season Here? MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH Bitcoin To Face Another Shakeout Soon This ‘Uptober,’ Bitcoin has recorded a 12% surge from its opening price, jumping from the $60,000 support level and reclaiming key resistance zones. In the last two weeks, BTC recovered 14% from the early October shakeouts, nearing a retest of the long-awaited $70,000 mark. The cryptocurrency faced major resistance after surging above the $69,000 zone, a level not seen since late July. After the unsuccessful retest, Bitcoin’s price faced a 5.3% pullback toward the $65,000-$66,000 range, failing to reclaim the $67,000 mark until Thursday. Based on BTC’s recent performance, some analysts consider that the flagship crypto is poised to face another correction in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa revealed he is unsure about where Bitcoin’s “extremely chippy conditions” are headed in the short term. Sherpa shared that the cryptocurrency could see one last shakeout “sometime in November.” He suggested BTC could face another pullback toward the $62,000-$64,000 price range around the time of the US Presidential elections, scheduled for November 5. However, the analyst believes that Bitcoin will continue its bullish rally after the shakeout. Another market watcher also forecasted another correction for BTC’s near future. Analyst Crypto King stated that BTC is set to close above $70,000 this week before facing rejection from the key level. Following the rejection, Bitcoin would retrace 8% toward $64,000-$65,000, which could propel altcoins to “start moving 5-6x from the current position,” according to the analyst. Is BTC Set For A Green Weekly Close? Despite the rainy forecast, other investors remain bullish on the flagship crypto. Crypto analyst Moustache set the $67,000-$68,000 range as “insanely important support levels.” To the analyst, if BTC’s price holds its support there, it will hit $70,000 soon. After Bitcoin jumped above the $68,000 resistance on Friday morning, Crypto Yapper noted that BTC broke out of a weekly bull flag and was “ready for an exponential move.” The analyst also asserted that the next horizontal level to break before the $70,000 test is $69,000.

Similarly, Rekt Capital pointed out that BTC’s old downtrend line is supporting, which serves as post-breakout confirmation. Per the post, the cryptocurrency would record a bullish weekly close above the $66,300 mark. The analyst also highlighted that if BTC closes above the $67,900 zone, It will register a “very bullish weekly close” ahead of October’s last week. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,737, a mild 0.3% increase in the daily timeframe.
