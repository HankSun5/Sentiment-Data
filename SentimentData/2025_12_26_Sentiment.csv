Is Loopring a good investment Loopring (LRC) could be a promising investment for those interested in Layer 2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, particularly due to its focus on zk-Rollups for fast and low-cost transactions. Its decentralized exchange (DEX) technology and commitment to security and efficiency make it a strong contender in the DeFi space. However, its success depends on broader Ethereum adoption, competition from other Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, and overall market trends. While Loopring has potential, investors should consider its volatility, ecosystem development, and market conditions before investing. Always conduct thorough research and risk assessment before making any investment decisions. Why is LRC up? The LRC/USD crypto pair price has spiked today as the buying influx has abruptly taken over the market, surging the price to $0.0570. The bulls are targeting the resistance of $0.0587 next, as overall, the coin’s value has increased significantly over the past week. Will LRC reach $0.5? According to the long-term predictions, LRC is projected to reach up to $0.44 by 2031. Will LRC reach $1? No, LRC may not reach $1 in the near future. By the year 2030, the highest price prediction is $0.44255, suggesting that LRC lacks the potential to achieve this milestone at the moment. Does LRC have a good long-term future? Loopring (LRC) has long-term potential as a Layer 2 solution using zk-Rollups for fast, low-cost Ethereum transactions. Its DEX technology supports the shift toward decentralized trading. However, strong competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet poses challenges. Success depends on adoption, partnerships, and innovation. While promising, risks like market volatility and regulatory changes should be considered before investing.

Loopring Price History Loopring price history Based on historical data, the Loopring token LRC suffered a significant knock in 2018. Prices fell in April after reaching a high of $1.4522 in January 2018, falling to an all-time low of $0.01986 in December 2019. By early 2020, the coin price had corrected to $0.0225. However, following the DEX’s beta debut, values started to rise significantly, and the LRC coin traded for $0.087895 at the start of June 2020, up almost 300 percent during the first half of 2020. LRC skyrocketed, breaking above $3 in December 2021, as the Crypto market capitalization increased. Loopring caught investors’ attention when it broke above $1 in October 2021. It continued to register its all-time high at $3.83 in November 2021. The reversal was swift in 2022, losing over 90% of its value. In 2023, it faced stiff resistance at the $0.25 mark. LRC continued its downward trend, staying within the $0.10-$0.50 range in the year 2023. LRC settled around $0.11-$0.12, maintaining a stable but low in December 2024 In January 2025, LRC traded around $0.11, showing little change from the previous months. As of early March 2025, LRC continues to trade around $0.11, showing a stable but weak trend. The altcoin showed high volatility in April and May, touching a bottom price of $0.0759 and a high of $0.1282. In June 2025, LRC observed a further low of $0.659, followed by a period of recovery, when the altcoin recovered back to $0.1030 in July and $0.1076 in September. LRC remained in decline till the start of December, observing the year’s lowest price of $0.0482, and has since slightly recovered to $0.0571 by the end of the year.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LRC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:00:00

The so called “coin of the cycle” is stuck in a boring range, and sentiment around it is at some of the lowest levels we have seen in a while. SOL ETFs still recorded about $1.4M in inflows on December 24, which is one of the few positive signs right now, but it has not been enough to change the bigger picture. Solana (SOL) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Looking ahead to 2026, analysts like Umair Crypto point out that the core problem is still on the chart. Price has failed to flip the $127 level into support. Every attempt to break and hold above that area has been cleanly rejected, forcing SOL to roll over and search for lower support. At the time of writing, Solana is holding around $123, which is now the key level bulls need to defend. Solana Price Prediction: What Is The Next Move For SOL Price? Source: JamesEaston There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI , which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. One big thing that is missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is still pretty weak, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully committing to this move yet. Without a clear spike in volume, any push above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What really changes the picture is a clean break above the $144 level with strong volume coming in. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Bitcoin Hyper Is Quietly Building While Solana Stalls While Solana chops sideways and sentiment keeps sinking, Bitcoin Hyper is moving in the opposite direction, quietly stacking momentum while most traders are distracted. This is usually how early cycle winners start, low noise, steady inflows, and no need for hype candles yet. Bitcoin Hyper is designed to capitalize on exactly this kind of market environment. When majors stall and confidence drops, capital slowly rotates into projects with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost always happens before the charts make it obvious. The project has already raised over $29.8M, showing serious conviction from early backers even while the broader market hesitates. On top of that, the 39% APY staking rewards incentivize holders to stay put rather than flip for short term moves, which helps build real supply pressure over time. While traders wait for Solana to finally flip resistance, Bitcoin Hyper is building its base. And when momentum returns to the market, the projects that were accumulated quietly during boredom phases are usually the ones that move first and hardest.

The pullback comes even as on-chain metrics point to easing sell pressure and a record build-up of stablecoin capital, leaving traders split between caution and the risk of sudden price swings. ETF Outflows and Holiday Liquidity Weigh on Prices XWIN Finance’s Trend Index, published on December 25, placed the market firmly in a “mild downtrend” with a score of 34 out of 100, citing persistent ETF withdrawals and U.S.-session selling as the main drags. It saw Bitcoin briefly dipping below $87,000 before bouncing, though repeated attempts to reclaim the $88,000 to $89,000 area have stalled, a zone XWIN described as heavy resistance shaped by options positioning. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see net withdrawals, with roughly 2,900 BTC, worth some $251 million, leaving funds in the latest session. That weakness lines up with figures reported by CryptoPotato on December 24, which showed cumulative BTC ETF inflows shrinking by nearly $6 billion since their October peak. Ethereum funds followed a similar pattern, remaining net negative on a weekly basis despite a small daily bounce. By contrast, diversification flows are visible elsewhere. For example, Solana products posted steady inflows, while XRP-related ETFs added about $8 million in the most recent session, extending a streak that has made XRP funds an outlier among crypto ETFs. Bitcoin’s price action reflects this uneasy balance, with the asset trading just under $88,000 at the time of writing, up about 1% on the day and week, but still nearly 20% lower over three months. Volatility has stayed compressed, with a 24-hour range between $87,000 and $88,000, while the past week saw swings between $85,000 and just over $90,000. Relative to the broader market, Bitcoin’s moves have been muted, with liquidity-driven wicks outweighing trend-following flows. On-Chain Signals Hint at Exhaustion, Not Panic Beneath the weak sentiment, on-chain data paints a more nuanced picture. XWIN noted that whale exchange inflows over the past 30 days sit near cycle lows, while Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is still falling, a sign that long-term holders are slowing their selling. At the same time, there appears to be a fair amount of caution, with spending from very old Bitcoin cohorts ticking higher, a pattern sometimes seen near major turning points. Network activity also remains soft, suggesting demand has not yet returned in force. According to the XWIN assessment, the current market tension is being reflected in sentiment gauges, particularly the Fear and Greed Index, which is in “Extreme Fear” at 24, while DeFi borrowing has dropped sharply since August, pointing to reduced leverage. Nonetheless, stablecoin supply has climbed to a record near $310 billion, signaling large pools of sidelined capital. With equities and gold both at record highs and January rate expectations tilted toward a pause, macro conditions are not overtly hostile. For crypto, however, XWIN suggested that the next move still hinges on ETF flows and post-expiry options dynamics. Until those shifts, the market may stay fragile, even as signs of seller fatigue quietly build beneath the surface.

Why Price Could Crash To $80,000",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-christmas-rally-80000/,"It’s the holiday season, and Bitcoin (BTC) is trading downwards after plunging toward the $87,000 region. Although the cryptocurrency has struggled for months, failing to reclaim key resistance levels, a crypto analyst believes Bitcoin could still stage a major Christmas rally . As the analyst outlines a potential roadmap for this projected upswing, he cautions that a further price crash to $80,000, or even lower, remains a strong possibility. Bitcoin Risks Crash To $80,000 Crypto analyst RBswingtrader shared a Bitcoin market outlook on X the day before Christmas, outlining multiple scenarios that could determine whether the cryptocurrency resumes an upward trend or faces further downside . The analyst noted that smart money is currently buying Bitcoin in a new zone and also cautioned that a final price crash, potentially driven by market manipulation , could occur before a trend reversal. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could still decline to a fresh local low around $80,000 before strong buyers enter the market. The analyst stressed the importance of patience, viewing this potential dip as part of a broader accumulation strategy. He shared a chart highlighting BTC trading under a declining orange Moving Average (MA) after a sharp selloff from the $108,519 resistance zone. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency’s price had previously failed at the upper range and rolled over into a strong downtrend that has persisted for weeks . RBswingtrader further pinpointed a clear Elliott Wave structure on the BTC chart, with waves labeled from one through five, followed by an ABC corrective pattern . Wave 3 accelerated Bitcoin’s selloff, while Wave 5 appears to be developing, with downside targets still open. Multiple key support levels were also highlighted, including $87,106, $86,169, and $83,986. The analyst warned that a deeper breakdown from these support levels could open the door to a potential crash toward $80,427, with an extended lower target near $74,185 if Bitcoin’s selling pressure intensifies. He also plotted multiple Fibonacci retracement levels that align with the lower support zones for the BTC price. Notably, the volume data at the bottom of the chart indicates a large accumulation trend through December. Increased trading activity supports the view that large players are taking advantage of dips and building positions despite Bitcoin’s weak price action. Is A Christmas Rally Still Possible For BTC? In RBswingtrader’s chart, a potential Christmas rally for Bitcoin was illustrated with an upward projection targeting the $108,519 region if the price recovers from its current lows. The chart indicated that growing accumulation volume this December and the Bullish Divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) could support upward momentum. RBswingtrader also noted that reclaiming key technical levels, including the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement near $96,690-$96,836, could support Bitcoin’s potential upward move.

As we go into the year, new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): Could Be Looking At Very Positive Year XRP ETFs have seen impressive inflows despite the “dead” price action in the market. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs recorded $1.13B in net inflows, with steady demand over the past 33 days. These funds have outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, holding positive momentum even while broader market conditions remain volatile. Add in the constant ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically strong chart, and 2026 could be shaping up to be a very interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Dogecoin And Shiba Inu: Memecoins Potential Revival? I know memecoins look mostly dead right now and hope feels pretty thin across the board. But for Shiba specifically, there is something big on the horizon. The team is planning a major network upgrade that would add privacy to the chain. That is a big deal, especially with privacy becoming one of the hottest topics in crypto right now. Source: SHIBUSD / TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling to build momentum as Christmas approaches, with market sentiment looking increasingly indecisive. The memecoin is down about 1.7% over the last 24 hours, trading in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of price action points to a dull, low-energy market, with SHIB currently sitting near the lower end of that range. For this bounce to mean anything, price needs to break above $0.00000800 and hold it to confirm a bullish shift. If it fails to do so, SHIB could slide back toward a new low, marked by the red projection, which is the same area where buyers stepped in last time. Dogecoin is in a similar spot, and there still looks like there is room for more downside before the next real move higher kicks in. Price just lost the $0.13 support, and that opens the door for a drop toward the $0.09 area. That would mean roughly a 31% downside move from here in the short term. The RSI is not helping the bull case either. It has been stuck below the 14-day moving average and the midline for weeks now, which is a clear sign that bearish momentum is still in control and sellers are dictating the price action. Bitcoin Hyper Is Building While Alts Chop Sideways While most altcoins are stuck grinding lower and sentiment feels drained, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite. This is usually how early cycle winners start forming, not during euphoric rallies, but during boredom, doubt, and sideways markets. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself for the next phase of the market, where capital rotates out of lagging majors and into projects with clear narratives and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost never waits for perfect charts, it happens while most traders are still distracted by short term weakness in names like XRP, DOGE, and SHIB. The project has already raised more than $29M, showing strong conviction from early participants even while the broader market struggles to find direction. On top of that, staking rewards hovering around 39% APY give holders a reason to sit tight and accumulate rather than chase quick flips. Historically, the biggest breakouts come from projects that were built quietly during consolidation phases like this. While the crowd waits for confirmation candles on altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper is laying its foundation. If 2026 really does shape up to be a bullish year, the projects accumulated during this low-interest phase are often the ones that move first and hardest.

Tech companies say these tools could transform how games get made. Leading research teams at Google DeepMind and a billion-dollar startup called World Labs, started by AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, are developing what they call “world models.” These are AI systems that can understand and recreate physical spaces, and experts think they’ll shake up the gaming business. Shlomi Fruchter helps lead DeepMind’s Genie 3 project , which builds these world models. He said game-making is going through major changes. “Creating software and games in particular is changing a lot, and I expect it to change, maybe entirely, over the next few years,” Fruchter explained to the Financial Times. He thinks the technology will help people who make games work faster and better, opening up new possibilities that don’t exist right now. But he doesn’t expect it to completely take over current methods. Other AI companies like Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia are testing these world models for robots and self-driving cars. However, the gaming world offers quicker opportunities for profit. Research firm Newzoo expects the gaming sector to bring in close to $190 billion this year. AI is already changing how studios work Game makers already use AI tools to design backgrounds and create characters. Back in May, Epic Games and Disney added an AI-powered Darth Vader to the game Fortnite. They built this Star Wars character using technology from Google and ElevenLabs, making him an interactive character that players could engage with. Alexander Vaschenko runs Game Gears studio, where AI has sped up work on titles like Aliens vs Zombies: Invasion by four times. “Based on my professional experience, I firmly believe that both the video game and film industries will soon be unable to function without AI,” Vaschenko said. AI firms believe newer, stronger world models will push more game companies to adopt this technology. These models can build 3D interactive spaces just from written descriptions. World Labs released a model called Marble last month. Another company, Runway, which partners with game studios, put out its first world model in December. Li said this technology will affect major game engines like Unity and Epic’s Unreal. “This is all up for disruption,” she stated, adding that simulation gaming engines need upgrades. Looking ahead, AI experts say regular players will be able to design their own game worlds. Developers won’t need pricey software or special training to make content. Eric Xing, who leads the Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi, explained the impact. “Now a gamer in front of this world model can put themselves into a virtual world,” Xing said. “That makes the game industry very different from today, because producing a personalised game is now a straightforward process.” Workers raise concerns about job security Not everyone sees this as progress. Critics worry AI will cost jobs for developers and artists, and flood games with cheap, low-quality content that people call “slop.” Six video game worker unions across Europe spoke out against AI use in their field this month. They said companies are forcing these tools on workers even though they make working conditions worse. Those who support AI use say it could lower costs, boost creativity, and prevent worker exhaustion. This matters in an industry where top games, called triple-A titles, can take multiple years and more than $1 billion to finish. Alexandre Moufarek at DeepMind used to work as an associate producer at French game company Ubisoft. He hopes world models will give developers room to “find the fun” and “try new ideas and take risks again.” “Often, that’s the time that’s missing at the end of the production. Christmas is coming, and you need to release the game, and you just don’t have time to polish the things that you wanted [or] debug things correctly,” Moufarek said. “The more we put those models in the hands of creatives, I’m sure we are going to discover new ways of working that we haven’t even anticipated yet.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|DeepMind,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:35:00

A Critical 1% Allocation Threshold Is Near for This $0.035 Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-for-q1-2026-a-critical-1-allocation-threshold-is-near-for-this-0-035-altcoin/,"In any market cycle there comes that short time, when positioning is more important than headlines. News Breaks do not necessarily cause price movements. They tend to shift once expectations change silently as a result of tightening of supply. This is normally when long term narratives emerge, long before the broader interest comes. Currently, numerous traders looking in crypto news and wondering what crypto to purchase are keeping an eye on one particular DeFi crypto. This is not due to hype but structural threshold is actually being met. After this has been closed, the set up changes. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto bank that is involved in lending and borrowing. In its simplest form, the protocol will enable users to deposit assets and get yield, and borrowers receive liquidity through collateral locking. This results in a usage cycle which can be multiplied with the increase in demand. As an illustration, a user is able to input stable assets in the protocol and receive mtTokens in their turn. These mtTokens are the position provided and the growth of value as the interests of the borrowers are earned. In this design, rather than using short term trading, the longer holding is used as a reward of actual activity. Borrowing side In the borrowing side, the user is able to get access to liquidity by pledging their assets based on specified rules. The interest rates and collateral requirements are designed in such a way that there is lesser uncertainty. It is this kind of system that renders the lending protocols relevant in the long run. The next V1 launch is an important event. V1 is where development is changed to live use. This is the point of transition between preparation and execution of the protocol, according to the official updates. Investor Base and Funding Growth The participation has increased and it is one of the most evident messages in the enquiry of Mutuum Finance. It has already raised more than $19.4M and has more than 18,500 holders in its portfolio. The fact that these figures came into being did not occur instantly. The steady growth has not been abrupt. This tends to single out accumulation and not speculation in the short term. Several of them have remained during various stages and this implies that they have faith in the roadmap and do not change direction. The token was initiated at a very low level on initial stages and is currently priced at $0.035. This is about an increment of 250% of the initial price. This increase did not happen in a single instance. It was preceded by a demand and diminishing supply. Supply and Distribution Signals and Access Signals The maximum supply of MUTM is 4B of tokens. 1.82B tokens or 45.5% of total MUTM supply is distributed through the presale phases. Quite a considerable part of such tokens has already been sold, and what remains is very scarce indeed. Behavior usually shifts when, at this point, there is tightening of supply. Customers will make decisions at a quicker pace and price increments will increase. This is the reason why the current stage is under strict monitoring. There is the 24 hour leaderboard that is an additional revelation. It also follows regular attendance rather than sporadic attendance. This is mostly indicative of persistent interest and not single purchases. Demand is increased with support of card payment as well. The more accessible it is, the more participation tends to occur, particularly among the users coming in and not via one of the traditional crypto channels. Security Reviews Any DeFi crypto will be primarily concerned with security. Mutuum Finance has already passed a CertiK scan with a score of 90/100. This is a critical background check that most investors, when dealing with a new cryptocurrency, would want to check. Besides CertiK, the protocol was being reviewed by Halborn Security . There is an active program of a $50K bug bounty program which allows outsourcing and testing to be done and issues found before full scale use. In addition to security, the roadmap contains intentions of a protocol supported stablecoin. Non-specialized assets will be able to add to the daily use and will decrease volatility in lending systems. Integrations with oracle are also scheduled and it helps in ensuring that collateral and interest are calculated accurately. These aspects are not short term characteristics. They provide long term supporting infrastructure layers. The reason Why Phase 6 Is Generating Urgency Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. This implies that only a very low percentage will be left at the prevailing price. Recent action Boasts of a $100k whale allocation that is frequent when institutional players can expect a transitional spot. Once a phase is closed, prices tend to come up. That is why the existing threshold is important. It is the last window before the circumstances transform. This step can be the determining element to individuals seeking the potential best crypto to purchase today. When the access is over, the market situation becomes not one of access, but scarcity. By Q1 2026, Mutuum Finance is going towards a stage where supply is constrained, infrastructure is prepared and usage is near. Such a combination is what is making it gain momentum as the best crypto to watch in the next cycle.

This is a big moment for our team and the WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started,” the company wrote. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., created USD1 earlier this year after Trump took back the White House, saying simply that “this one is for the retail users.” USD1 market cap has surpassed $3B. This is a big moment for our team and WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started. 🦅☝️📈 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) December 25, 2025 The so-called stable token first broke past the $1 billion mark in April, less than a month after it went live. From the beginning, the project called itself a tool for real-time crypto payments, pushing to build strong relationships with retail users and major U.S. exchanges. WLFI partnered with Coinbase and FalconX, setting up distribution channels to get USD1 into more wallets. It’s also trying to take over Solana’s stablecoin turf by teaming up with meme coin project Bonk and Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium. WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said , “This is just the beginning, we are building the future of finance driven by real world adoption of USD1.” Binance connects USD1 to its trading ecosystem The sudden jump in value followed Binance introducing a Booster Program tied to USD1. Users who hold the stablecoin on the exchange now get up to 20% APR through flexible earn products. Binance also confirmed it would swap all collateral backing its Binance-peg BUSD (B-Token) into USD1, at a 1:1 rate. This move embeds USD1 deeper into the exchange’s collateral system, effectively replacing BUSD in some areas. That’s not all. The stablecoin is also tied to bigger financial deals. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based MGX used USD1 to complete a $2 billion investment in Binance. This payment came just before President Trump granted a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, who co-founded Binance. At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported speculation that CZ may have used his influence to boost WLFI ahead of the pardon. Binance U.S. denied any coordination and claimed its listings of WLFI and USD1 were just “purely business decisions.” Despite that, Trump’s involvement and the WLFI-Binance link drew fire from Democrats. Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed to this connection while fighting against the GENIUS Act, which was later passed into law. Bitcoin flash crash reveals issues with USD1 trading pair Meanwhile, earlier this morning, the BTC/USD1 trading pair on Binance experienced a flash crash, briefly dragging Bitcoin down to $24,000 for a few seconds. The price then bounced above $87,000 before stabilizing, according to data gotten from the world’s largest exchange. Other pairs like BTC/USDT weren’t affected, but the incident exposed how fragile newer trading pairs can be when liquidity dries up. The crash came from a microstructure failure. There weren’t enough buy or sell orders near the current market price. On thin pairs, one aggressive order or a missing bid can wipe through the order book and cause a sharp drop. Once new bids enter or the order clears, the price jumps back up. Binance confirmed it was limited to the BTC/USD1 spot pair only. This kind of thing happens when a trading pair lacks depth. A shallow book means even one big trade can move prices way off course, even if just for a moment. USD1 may be scaling fast, but its liquidity structure still has holes that need to be watched.

56363569,https://cryptonews.com/?p=467844,1766700201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56363569.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana, Cardano by the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-cardano-by-the-end-of-2026/,"Chinese AI model DeepSeek, often called a serious rival to ChatGPT, just dropped a fresh set of price predictions for XRP, Cardano, and Solana as 2025 heads into its final week. According to the model, all three coins are entering a high-volatility window, with the potential for sharp moves in either direction before the year wraps up. The outlook is based on a mix of macro conditions, fundamentals, and technical signals. Below is a breakdown of DeepSeek AI two possible scenarios, showing both the bullish and bearish price paths it sees for each asset through the end of December. Ripple (XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts A Run Toward $6 Going Into The New Year DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Ripple’s XRP going into 2026 targets $4.50 to $6.00. The bullish case assumes a few big things go right: clear regulation after the SEC case, wider adoption of Ripple’s ODL for cross-border payments, and deeper involvement in CBDC projects. If all that lines up, DeepSeek thinks XRP could jump more than 80% and push into the $3 to $5 range. On the flip side, the bearish scenario is pretty rough. DeepSeek warns that if selling pressure ramps up and sentiment turns ugly, XRP could slide hard from around $1.86 down toward $1.00. That would be a massive drop and shows just how volatile things could get if the market flips negative. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. The recent launch of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. could bring in a new wave of institutional money, even during the slower holiday period. We have seen this playbook before with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where demand built quietly before bigger moves followed. With more ETF approvals likely in the coming months, the odds are rising that 2026 turns into a breakout year for XRP. For investors accumulating at current levels, the risk-reward could end up looking very attractive. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek Expects Solana Is Ready For 300% Jump DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 targets $275 to $350. Solana remains the coin of the cycle. DeepSeek AI predicts Solana could supercharge and lead scalable consumer applications, with ecosystem growth and rising institutional adoption potentially driving a 300% breakout by early 2026. If that fails, the bear case is not much worse than current conditions, with DeepSeek projecting a drop toward the $80-$95 support zone. There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI, which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. Cardano (ADA): Deepseek Says Its Finally Going Back Above The Dollar Mark? DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Cardano ADA going into 2026 targets $0.85 to $1.20. This hinges on Cardano actually delivering. A smooth rollout of the Chang hard fork would unlock on-chain governance and the community treasury, while real-world utility projects would finally prove the peer-reviewed approach works at scale. But if those pieces stall or disappoint, sentiment could flip fast and send the price back toward the $0.25–$0.28 bear case zone. To confirm a bullish rebound, ADA needs to break and hold above the $0.36 level in the short term. If it does, the next clear resistance sits at $0.38, where price has already failed twice over the past week. A move down toward the $0.30 zone is still possible if this level fails to break. The RSI is around 40 and not yet oversold, which leaves room for that scenario to play out. As long as the previous low near $0.27 is not broken, the bullish setup remains possible heading into the new year. Deepseek Best Choice Could Quietly Be Maxi Doge While DeepSeek is laying out extreme bull and bear cases for XRP, Solana, and Cardano, some traders are skipping the predictions altogether and focusing on where momentum is already quietly building. That is exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a pure high-beta memecoin play for the next cycle, built for the kind of volatility DeepSeek is warning about. When majors chop and sentiment stays divided, capital often rotates into aggressive meme narratives that do not need perfect macro conditions to move. The project has already raised over $4.28M, which is a strong signal considering how cautious the market has been lately. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting at a massive 71% APY , giving early holders a real incentive to lock in and wait rather than chase short-term price swings. While AI models argue whether SOL goes to $300 or XRP drops to $1, Maxi Doge is doing what early memecoin winners usually do, building quietly, attracting committed capital, and setting the stage before the broader market wakes up. If 2026 really does turn into the high-volatility year many expect, the tokens with strong communities, simple narratives, and aggressive tokenomics tend to outperform everything else. Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one of those plays. Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The change applies to platinum contracts PT2606, PT2608, PT2610, PT2612 and palladium contracts PD2606, PD2608, PD2610, PD2612, according to the exchange. Platinum prices hit an all-time high last week at $2,377.50 before pulling back, then later traded 2.4% lower at $2,220.44. Palladium fell even harder, dropping more than 9% to $1,683.58 after touching its highest level in three years earlier in the session. Both metals remain sharply higher on the year. Platinum is up about 145%, while palladium has gained more than 85%. Chinese spot and futures markets for precious metals have also traded at persistent premiums compared with London and COMEX prices, which have held even as global prices rallied. Silver surge and fund losses are the basis of China’s current market stress The GFEX decision landed as silver trading in China turned chaotic. Shanghai silver prices hit a record $80 per ounce, pushing year-to-date gains above 150%. Traders have pointed to a shortage of physical silver inside China. Globally, spot silver hovered near $72 per ounce, extending a rally that has lifted prices more than 120% in 2025. On Wednesday, spot silver reached $72.70, putting it on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Gold has surged by 60% year-to-date . China’s only pure-play silver fund, the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF, dropped by its maximum daily limit of 10% on Thursday. The fall ended a rapid rally that had triggered repeated warnings from the fund manager. The fund had risen nearly 220% this year, far outpacing the roughly 128% gain in Shanghai silver futures. By Wednesday, the premium over the fund’s underlying silver contracts stood at nearly 62%, up from 7% at the start of the month. After three straight days of hitting its 10% daily upside limit, the firm cut Class C subscription limits to 100 yuan from 500 yuan, effective December 26.

This came as the analyst also suggested that the altcoin may be forming a bottom in preparation for the next leg to the upside. Analyst Shares Why This Chart Is Interesting For The XRP Price In an X post, Steph highlighted the 3-week XRP price chart, stating that it was “interesting” for one reason. He revealed that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 0.00 on the 3-week timeframe, which is extremely rare and has only happened once before, which was the 2022 bear market bottom. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why This Changes Everything For XRP In The Long Term Steph further explained that on such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted, which is a positive for the XRP price. The analyst added that this means that momentum to the downside has dried up, although he warned that this doesn’t mean that price must instantly reverse. Steph noted that the last time this signal appeared, the XRP price entered a long accumulation phase before the next major move higher. As such, the analyst claimed that this again suggests that the downside risk is structurally limited and that long-term holders are absorbing supply rather than distributing. He further remarked that these signals tend to mark cycle lows rather than short-term trades. The XRP ETFs also mark a positive for the XRP price as these funds maintain their inflows streak. These funds have recorded daily inflows since the Canary’s fund launched on November 13. As a result, they now boast net assets of over $1.1 billion, even as XRP continues to see significant demand from institutional investors. XRP Remains Below Key Levels In an X post, CryptoXLarge stated that on the weekly chart, the XRP price remains below the descending trendline around the 8 to 21 EMA levels. He further remarked that this week, the price is attempting to break below the key support zone around $1.95, which aligns with the Fib 0.5 level and the 89-week EMA, which is a support that has held throughout the year. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing CryptoXLarge stated that a weekly close below this level could increase the probability of a move toward the $1.60 support, which is the Fib 0.618. Meanwhile, a weekly close above $1.95 may boost buying interest, which could trigger a relief XRP price rally toward $2.30 and then $2.70. Crypto analyst Crypto King also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that a reclaim of $1.98 could eventually send the altcoin to as high as $3.66. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.87, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

56365429,648586,1766703627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56365429.jpeg,"XRP Is At Its Best Potential Recovery Level Since 2022, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-best-potential-recovery-level/,"A crypto analyst has raised concerns about XRP’s underperformance , citing the cryptocurrency’s prolonged consolidation at lower price levels and its failure to reclaim former highs. Despite these struggles, the analyst notes that the altcoin is still positioned around its best potential recovery level since 2022. He suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a price rally , potentially paving the way for a recovery to new levels. XRP Approaches Strongest Recovery Zone Since 2022 Skipper, a crypto market expert on X, has released a new XRP update outlining the cryptocurrency’s potential recovery . He stated that the token has struggled in recent weeks, remaining stuck in a prolonged slump, marked by low trading activity and minimal price movement. Despite this sluggish performance, the analyst highlighted that the altcoin is now near its best potential recovery level since 2022. Skipper explained that the most significant factor supporting this recovery potential is the decline in bubble risk . According to his chart analysis, XRP’s bubble risk is now at one of its lowest points in years, indicating that excessive speculation and risky bets have largely been removed from the market. He stated that this cleanup makes a sudden price crash far less likely and establishes a more stable foundation for a recovery. The analyst made it clear that a low bubble risk does not guarantee an immediate price rally for XRP. Instead, he explained that this low-risk environment often creates the ideal conditions for a market bottom to form. Skipper also commented on its current dynamics, highlighting that conditions currently favor buyers waiting on the sidelines, as sellers are not aggressively driving prices lower. The analyst referenced historical performance, noting that the altcoin has often delivered stronger returns following extended periods of quiet price action. Another key point highlighted by the analyst is that when fewer traders are actively committed to XRP, price action becomes more responsive to positive developments. Under such conditions, factors such as improved liquidity or heightened network usage can exert a stronger influence on XRP, increasing its potential for a recovery. The analyst further stressed that a low bubble risk should not be confused with a promise of short-term gains. He stated that a surge should not be expected tomorrow or next week. However, he highlighted that the cryptocurrency is no longer sitting in a danger zone. Analyst Sets XRP Next Upside Target At $2.58 In another XRP update, market analyst Crypto King has stated that the cryptocurrency is holding firm above a critical support area around $1.85. He emphasized that a strong bounce at this support and a reclaim of the $1.98 level would signal a momentum shift for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks above this level, Crypto King predicts its next upside target is $2.58, which aligns with the Resistance 1 level on the price chart. Should bullish momentum persist, the analyst believes this could open the door to a powerful rally toward $3.18 at Resistance 2, followed by $3.66 at Resistance 3.",XRP|Altcoin|Crypto King|ripple|Skipper|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 23:00:27

They emerge through regulation, infrastructure, and the people capable of translating law into functional markets. As the United States moves closer to defining its long-awaited digital asset framework, one personnel move is drawing growing attention for its potential to reshape how capital enters and moves through crypto—particularly XRP. That move centers on Caroline Pham. A High-Impact Transition at a Critical Moment As highlighted by X Finance Bull, Caroline Pham, former Acting Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , has joined MoonPay as Chief Legal Officer. The timing is significant. WHAT @CarolineDPham DOES NEXT COULD SHIFT $XRP AND CRYPTO FLOWS FOREVER She helped save hundreds of millions in compliance costs. Now she’s in the driver’s seat of a platform @moonpay that moves $XRP and $RLUSD Repost if you trust her move pic.twitter.com/IQcGGY8xaE — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 25, 2025 Pham spent years inside the regulatory engine , most notably leading efforts to unwind layers of duplicative and costly rules left behind by early Dodd-Frank implementation. She has publicly estimated that these reforms saved market participants hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs. Her transition from regulator to infrastructure executive places that hard-earned expertise directly inside one of crypto’s most important access points. MoonPay’s Expanding Role in XRP and Stablecoins MoonPay is not a passive player in the digital asset ecosystem. As a leading fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, it enables direct access to assets like XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , which launched in December 2024. On-ramps increasingly define market behavior, especially as institutions demand compliant, low-friction entry into digital assets. With Pham guiding legal and regulatory strategy, MoonPay is positioned to anticipate regulatory expectations rather than react to them. That matters as capital flows become more selective and compliance-driven. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Structure, Rulemaking, and the 2026 Window In a video clip shared by X Finance Bull, Pham addressed the urgency surrounding U.S. market structure legislation, noting that 2026 is a decisive period. She emphasized that while Congress passes laws, agencies ultimately shape markets through rulemaking. Drawing from her experience at the CFTC, Pham warned that poorly designed rules can take decades to correct. She also stressed the importance of technical expertise within regulatory bodies, pointing out that writing durable rules requires hands-on legal precision, not political shortcuts. Her perspective reflects why implementation—not just legislation—will determine whether crypto innovation accelerates or stalls. Why XRP Is Uniquely Positioned XRP has long been designed for regulated financial environments, prioritizing liquidity efficiency and cross-border settlement. As regulatory clarity improves and compliant access points strengthen, assets aligned with institutional workflows stand to benefit disproportionately. Pham’s role at MoonPay does not guarantee policy outcomes, but it meaningfully improves the alignment between regulation and infrastructure—precisely where XRP operates best. A Structural Shift, Not a Headline Moment This development is not about short-term speculation. It is about financial plumbing. When regulatory architects move into transaction infrastructure, capital flows adjust quietly before transforming markets at scale. If executed well, this convergence could redefine how XRP—and crypto more broadly—moves through the global financial system for years to come.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $86,960.68. This movement has caught the attention of traders and investors worldwide, prompting questions about market stability and future trends. What Caused the Bitcoin Price Decline? Several factors typically influence cryptocurrency valuations. The recent Bitcoin price drop may relate to broader market corrections, regulatory news, or shifts in investor sentiment. Market analysts often point to these common triggers when explaining sudden movements in the Bitcoin price . Understanding these factors helps investors make informed decisions. However, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and prices can change rapidly based on global economic conditions and technological developments. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, consider these approaches: Review your investment strategy – Ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance Diversify your portfolio – Don’t put all your funds into one asset Stay informed – Follow reliable market analysis and news sources Avoid panic selling – Emotional decisions often lead to losses Remember that cryptocurrency investments require careful consideration and research. The current Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder of market unpredictability. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. When the Bitcoin price declines significantly, other digital assets frequently follow similar patterns. This correlation means that Bitcoin’s performance can impact entire market sectors. However, each cryptocurrency has unique fundamentals. Some may demonstrate resilience during Bitcoin downturns, while others might experience more pronounced effects. Market participants should analyze individual projects rather than making blanket assumptions based solely on the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The recent Bitcoin price movement below $87,000 highlights several important considerations for market participants. First, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, with prices capable of significant swings in short periods. Second, having a clear investment strategy becomes crucial during periods of price uncertainty. Finally, maintaining perspective helps navigate market fluctuations. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its existence, yet it has demonstrated remarkable resilience over longer timeframes. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin fall below $87,000? Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate due to various factors including market sentiment, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and trading volume changes. The specific combination influencing this particular Bitcoin price movement requires ongoing analysis. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Price drops can present buying opportunities, but they also indicate market uncertainty. Consult with financial advisors before making significant investment decisions. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels remains challenging even for experienced analysts. Cryptocurrency markets involve substantial uncertainty, and prices can move in unexpected directions based on unfolding developments. Will other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin’s decline? Historically, many cryptocurrencies have shown correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. However, individual projects may demonstrate different patterns based on their specific developments and market positions. How long do Bitcoin price corrections typically last? Correction durations vary significantly. Some last days, while others extend for weeks or months. Market conditions, news developments, and investor sentiment all influence how long price adjustments persist. Where can I track real-time Bitcoin prices? Numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and financial data platforms provide real-time price information. Always verify you’re using reputable sources for market data and analysis.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has just dropped to a worrying score of 20, firmly placing investor sentiment in the ‘extreme fear’ territory. This critical gauge, which many traders use to gauge market psychology, suggests that pessimism is currently dominating the digital asset space. But what does this extreme reading actually mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your investments? Let’s break it down. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Compiled by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents maximum fear and panic, while 100 signals unbridled greed and euphoria. The current reading of 20 is a clear warning sign that fear is the dominant force. This index matters because extreme emotions often signal potential turning points. Historically, periods of ‘extreme fear’ have sometimes preceded market recoveries, while ‘extreme greed’ has often marked market tops. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes six key market factors to generate its daily score: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume. Declining volume can indicate apathy or fear. Social Media (15%): Scans platforms like Twitter and Reddit for sentiment. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search volume for crypto-related terms. This multi-source approach helps paint a more accurate picture than any single metric could. What Does a Score of ‘Extreme Fear’ Signal for Traders? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 is a powerful contrarian indicator. For savvy investors, extreme fear can present opportunity. When the crowd is panicking and selling, asset prices often fall below their intrinsic value. However, this does not guarantee an immediate bounce. The market can remain fearful for extended periods. Therefore, this index should not be used in isolation. It is best combined with fundamental analysis (e.g., project health, adoption rates) and technical analysis (e.g., chart patterns, support levels) to make informed decisions. The key takeaway is to avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on prevailing sentiment. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market with the Fear & Greed Index How can you use this information? First, recognize that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Here are some practical steps: Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Extreme fear periods can be good times to systematically accumulate assets at lower prices. Re-evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation still matches your personal risk appetite during volatile times. Avoid Panic Selling: Selling into extreme fear often locks in losses. Review your investment thesis instead. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Monitor the index as part of a balanced news diet, but don’t let hourly fluctuations dictate your strategy. Remember, the goal is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful—a principle famously echoed by Warren Buffett. Conclusion: Beyond the Fear and Greed Cycle The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 20 is a stark reminder of the market’s cyclical nature. While it highlights significant short-term anxiety, long-term cryptocurrency adoption continues on its own trajectory. For investors, this moment underscores the importance of discipline, research, and a strategy that can withstand emotional extremes. By understanding the sentiment behind the numbers, you can make more rational decisions regardless of whether the index screams fear or whispers greed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? You can view the live index and its historical data on the website Alternative.me. Many popular cryptocurrency news and data platforms also feature it. Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index been accurate in the past? It has been a reliable contrarian indicator at major market extremes. For example, it showed extreme greed near the all-time highs in late 2021 and extreme fear during major sell-offs like in 2018 and March 2020. However, it is not a perfect timing tool. Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? Not necessarily. Extreme fear can indicate a potential buying zone, but it is not a standalone ‘buy’ signal. Always conduct your own research on the asset’s fundamentals and the overall market structure before investing. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily. The data is compiled once per day, usually in the morning (UTC). Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While the index’s components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin (through dominance and volatility), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Can the index remain in ‘extreme fear’ for a long time? Yes. Sentiment can be stuck in fear or greed for weeks or even months, as seen in prolonged bear markets or bull runs. The index measures current sentiment, not future price direction. Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

Today marks a historic moment as a staggering $23.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire. This unprecedented volume, reported by Deribit, shatters previous records and places immense focus on potential price volatility. For every trader and investor, understanding the mechanics and implications of this event is crucial. What Does This Record-Breaking Bitcoin Options Expiry Mean? To grasp the scale, this $23.347 billion expiry dwarfs last year’s peak of $14.3 billion. Essentially, a massive number of contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price are reaching their deadline. This convergence creates a focal point for market forces, often leading to increased trading activity and price discovery around the expiry time. Concurrently, $3.7 billion in Ethereum options will also expire. However, the spotlight remains firmly on the Bitcoin options market due to its sheer size. The key metrics to watch are the put/call ratio and the max pain price, which offer clues about market sentiment and potential price pressure points. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain Let’s break down the complex jargon into simple terms. The current data reveals two critical numbers: Put/Call Ratio (0.35 for BTC): This measures the volume of put options (bets on price dropping) versus call options (bets on price rising). A ratio below 1, like 0.35, indicates far more call options exist. This suggests a bullish bias among options traders leading into this expiry. Max Pain Price ($95,000 for BTC): This is the price at which the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, causing the most financial ‘pain’ to options buyers. It often acts as a theoretical magnet for the spot price as expiry approaches. How Could This Impact the Bitcoin Price? The immediate question for every investor is: will this cause a pump or a dump? The low put/call ratio implies many traders hold calls betting on higher prices. If Bitcoin’s price is below their strike prices at expiry, those calls become worthless. This dynamic can lead to increased selling pressure from market makers who hedged their positions. However, the high max pain price of $95,000 sits significantly above current levels. This creates a complex tug-of-war. While the bullish options bias is clear, the path of least resistance for maximum financial impact on options holders might pull the price. Therefore, traders should brace for potential volatility as large positions are closed or rolled over. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating such events requires a strategy. Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on expiry data. Consider these points: Monitor Liquidity: Watch for unusual volume spikes around the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiry time on Deribit and other major exchanges. Context is Key: This Bitcoin options expiry occurs within broader market trends. Assess overall sentiment, ETF flows, and macroeconomic factors. Risk Management First: Ensure your positions are protected with stop-losses. Expiry events can amplify normal market movements. In conclusion, today’s record Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While the bullish skew in options positioning is evident, the high max pain price introduces uncertainty. The ultimate outcome will depend on the interplay between these derivatives and the underlying spot market forces. Staying informed and disciplined is your best defense against unexpected volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin options? A1: Bitcoin options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. Q2: Why is a $23.3B options expiry significant? A2: It represents the largest single expiry of Bitcoin options in history. This massive volume can influence market maker hedging activity, liquidity, and short-term price volatility as positions are settled. Q3: What is a put/call ratio of 0.35? A3: A ratio of 0.35 means there are only 35 put contracts for every 100 call contracts. This indicates a strong majority of options traders are positioned for a price increase, reflecting bullish sentiment. Q4: What happens at the ‘max pain price’? A4: The max pain price ($95,000) is where the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized. It’s a theoretical level, but price often gravitates towards it near expiry due to the hedging actions of large institutions. Q5: Should I change my investment strategy because of this? A5: Not necessarily. While it’s critical to be aware of such events, long-term investors should focus on fundamentals. Short-term traders, however, should be prepared for potential volatility and manage risk accordingly. Found this analysis of the record Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

Net outflows on Christmas Eve reached a little over $175 million. That was part of a string of weak sessions: total net outflows for the prior five trading days added close to $826 million. Since December 15, every trading day closed with net selling except December 17, which drew inflows of $457 million. Institutional Outflows Market participants pointed to routine year-end moves as a major factor. Reports have disclosed that tax-loss harvesting — where traders sell positions to realize losses for tax purposes — has been heavy this month. One trader on X, using the name Alek, said most selling is tied to tax reasons and may fade within a week. Traders also flagged a record options expiry on Friday as a force that can sap appetite for risk ahead of large settlements. Pressure In US Trading Hours Data showed downside was strongest during US trading sessions. The Coinbase Premium — a measure comparing Coinbase’s BTC/USD price to Binance’s BTC/USDT — spent much of December below zero, signaling weaker buying in the US market. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows summed up the flow pattern, saying the US had become the biggest seller while Asia played the role of the main buyer. That split can limit how high Bitcoin holds during rallies if US demand doesn’t return. Liquidity Inactive Other traders contend that negative ETF flow numbers don’t mean the cycle is over. Based on reports shared on social channels, the path back usually goes price first, flows then. Price finds a base and then flows flatten, before fresh inflows appear. In this view, current liquidity looks inactive rather than broken. That leaves room for a bounce once seasonal selling subsides. Since early November, the 30-day moving average of US spot ETF net flows has stayed negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means that, on average, more capital has been leaving these ETFs than entering them for several weeks in a row. This is important because ETFs are… pic.twitter.com/qR1bMQNqxe — BitBull (@AkaBull_) December 24, 2025 On-Chain Signals On-chain metrics offer some comfort. Long-term holders are not rushing to sell at once. Realized gains show some profit-taking, but not the kind of extreme that marks a terminal peak. That pattern fits the idea that selling is being absorbed by other hands. If selling is near exhaustion, larger buyers could step in when ETFs turn neutral or positive. Outlook For The Coming Months Investors will watch ETF flows closely after the holidays. If flows move toward neutral, price could stabilize and then climb without needing huge new demand. The mix of tax selling and options-related positioning suggests some of the current weakness may be temporary. Still, traders should expect choppy moves while US buyers remain sidelined.

This collaboration aims to provide sophisticated asset management services, merging traditional financial expertise with digital asset innovation. For investors watching the crypto space, this partnership is a clear indicator of the maturing landscape in South Korea and beyond. What Does the Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU Mean? The core of this agreement is a strategic alliance. Korea Investment & Securities, a major traditional financial player, will join forces with Bithumb, a powerhouse in the Korean crypto market. Their goal is to develop and offer customized asset management solutions. This means clients could soon access hybrid portfolios that seamlessly blend conventional stocks and bonds with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This partnership is significant because it directly addresses a key demand: professional management of crypto assets. Many investors are interested in digital currencies but lack the time or expertise to manage them actively. Through this MOU, the two firms plan to create structured products and advisory services that bridge this gap. Why Is This Collaboration a Game-Changer? This partnership is more than just a business deal; it’s a validation of the crypto asset class. When a established securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities enters the arena, it brings legitimacy, rigorous risk management frameworks, and a vast client network. For Bithumb, it provides deeper access to traditional investors who have been cautious about entering the crypto market directly. The benefits for potential clients are substantial: Professional Guidance: Access to managed portfolios that combine traditional and digital assets. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the compliance and custodial expertise of a major securities firm. Simplified Access: A one-stop-shop for diversified investment strategies. Regulatory Confidence: Collaboration may help navigate the evolving regulatory environment more effectively. What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? Despite the exciting potential, the road ahead isn’t without hurdles. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea remains complex and is subject to change. Integrating the fast-paced, innovative world of crypto with the slower, highly regulated processes of traditional finance will require careful navigation. Furthermore, they must build products that truly meet client needs. This involves educating a traditionally conservative investor base about the risks and opportunities of crypto assets. Success will depend on their ability to create transparent, trustworthy, and high-performing solutions that stand out in a competitive market. What’s the Future of Such Institutional Partnerships? The Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU is likely a precursor to more collaborations. As cryptocurrency becomes an unavoidable part of the global financial system, traditional institutions are seeking safe and compliant entry points. We can expect to see more securities firms, banks, and asset managers forming similar alliances with regulated crypto exchanges. This trend points toward a future where digital assets are fully integrated into mainstream finance. For the everyday investor, it means more options, better protection, and professional management for their crypto holdings. It’s a crucial step in moving the market from speculative trading to long-term, strategic asset allocation. Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward The partnership between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb is a powerful signal of institutional adoption. It demonstrates a clear shift from viewing cryptocurrencies as a niche novelty to recognizing them as a legitimate component of a modern investment portfolio. This MOU has the potential to unlock new capital, improve market stability, and offer investors a safer, more guided path into the digital asset ecosystem. The collaboration’s success will be closely watched as a blueprint for future integration between traditional and decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the MOU between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb? A1: The primary goal is to collaborate on developing and providing customized asset management services that include both traditional financial products and cryptocurrencies. Q2: How will this partnership benefit average investors? A2: Investors may gain access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios that include crypto assets, along with the security and expertise of a major traditional securities firm. Q3: Does this mean Korea Investment & Securities is launching a crypto exchange? A3: No. The firm is partnering with the existing exchange, Bithumb, to create asset management products and services, not to operate its own trading platform. Q4: Is my money safer if I invest through this new service? A4: While any investment carries risk, the involvement of a regulated securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities suggests a strong focus on compliance, custody, and risk management frameworks that may enhance security compared to using an exchange alone. Q5: When will these new asset management services be available? A5: The announcement is for an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), which is an agreement to collaborate. Specific products and their launch dates have not yet been disclosed and will likely follow further development and regulatory review. Q6: Could this partnership influence crypto regulations in South Korea? A6: Potentially, yes. High-profile collaborations between traditional finance and crypto entities can encourage clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks by demonstrating serious, compliant business models.

The Altcoin Season Index has dipped to a mere 16, down from 17 just yesterday. This crucial metric suggests we are firmly in the grip of a Bitcoin-dominated market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Understanding this index is vital for navigating the volatile crypto seas. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? Simply put, the Altcoin Season Index is a thermometer for the crypto market’s risk appetite. Created by CoinMarketCap, it measures whether conditions favor altcoins or Bitcoin. The index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin’s performance. A score closer to 100 signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where most altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Conversely, a low score like 16 indicates a strong ‘Bitcoin season.’ Why Has the Altcoin Season Index Crashed to 16? The current low reading of the Altcoin Season Index is a clear symptom of broader market dynamics. Typically, when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising, and macroeconomic uncertainty is high, capital flows into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. This often comes at the expense of smaller altcoins. Several factors contribute to this trend: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors are prioritizing assets seen as less risky. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market share often increases during cautious periods. Liquidity Preference: Traders exit smaller altcoins for the easier entry and exit of Bitcoin. Therefore, the index acts as a confirmation tool, showing that the current environment is challenging for altcoin growth relative to the market leader. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? This isn’t just a number to glance at; it’s a strategic tool. A low Altcoin Season Index score suggests a specific market phase. Here’s how savvy investors might interpret it: For Accumulation: A low index can signal a potential buying opportunity for strong altcoin projects at discounted prices, though timing is crucial. For Portfolio Balance: It may be a reminder to ensure your portfolio isn’t overexposed to high-risk altcoins during a Bitcoin season. For Patience: It sets realistic expectations, indicating that broad altcoin rallies may not be imminent until the index trends upward. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator based on 90-day performance. It confirms a trend; it doesn’t predict an immediate reversal. When Will the Next Altcoin Season Begin? The million-dollar question. Historically, an altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, pushing the Altcoin Season Index above 75. For a sustained shift, we often need: A period of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Positive developments in blockchain technology and adoption. Improved overall investor sentiment and risk appetite. Watching for a consistent rise in the Altcoin Season Index from these lows can be one of the first signs that capital is rotating back into altcoins. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Tide The Altcoin Season Index at 16 delivers a clear, data-driven message: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For investors, this isn’t necessarily a time for panic but for perspective and preparation. By understanding what this metric reveals about market structure and sentiment, you can make more informed decisions—whether that means fortifying your core holdings or strategically planning your next altcoin entry. Keep a close watch on this index; its climb back up will be the early whisper of the next altcoin awakening. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that scores from 1 to 100. It measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score above 75 suggests an ‘altcoin season.’ Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to review your portfolio’s risk, consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects, and ensure you have a balanced strategy. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q4: Can the index predict the exact start of an altcoin season? A4: No, it is a lagging indicator. It confirms a trend that is already in place. A sustained move above 75 confirms an altcoin season has been occurring, but it doesn’t forecast the exact day it will begin. Q5: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A5: You can find the Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website, usually within their market research or data tools sections. Q6: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A6: It uses the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization but excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to focus on volatile, independent assets.

This New Altcoin Has Already Surged 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cheap-crypto-for-q1-2025-this-new-altcoin-has-already-surged-250/,"Each market cycle has an element of tokens that move very silently and most people are not aware of this until they realize. Price action can be first triggered many years before the general market takes action. Whenever a trend gains visibility, a considerable portion of the initial growth is lost. That is why most investors, who follow the news in the crypto-market and ask themselves, what crypto to buy now, have to be more concerned with the assets that are new. A good example of a new crypto that is following this trend is making recent headlines following a powerful move that took place in the absence of significant hype. Whether this stage is too early is the question many are asking; it is not why it moved. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is being built Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto that is being developed based on lending and borrowing. The protocol has two fundamental market structures that can cater to various user requirements. In the P2C market, assets are provided by the users into distribution pools. They, in their turn, are rewarded with mtTokens. These mtTokens increase due to repayment of interest by borrowers. As an illustration, a user providing stable assets has the opportunity to hold mtTokens and observe their increase in value with time. The model promotes long term possession or utilization rather than rapid trading. The P2P market involves borrowing that is made directly between users. Borrowers are able to select between fixed and variable rates, according to the situation in the market. There are strict LTV regulations on collateral. In case of collateral value that becomes lower than the requirement, liquidations become automatic. This puts the system on board and minimizes risk on the spur of the moment. Over $19M are already collected and the number of the holders has increased to over 18,500. These figures are important since its growth has been consistent. This is a good indication that there is aggregation as opposed to short term speculation. The next important step is V1, when the protocol can pass to live usage. Phase Progression and MUTM Price The price of MUTM at present is $0.035 and this is in presale Phase 6. The maximum supply is 4B tokens. Out of this value, it was assigned to early distribution and this corresponds to 45.5% and accounts to approximately 1.82B tokens. A great portion of these tokens already has been sold. The token has risen by up to 250% of the initial phase because of demand. It was not a single move toward this increase. It was gradual in phase by phase development. Phase 1 participants early on would yield a growth of about 500% the amount they entered at the official launch price of $0.06. The price of each token will go up, and the succeeding phase will see MUTM go up by almost 20%. This is why timing matters. Phases become more costly to access as their level increases, and the supply narrows. This is a structure of interest to people who seek the most advantageous cheap crypto to purchase. There are price steps built in the system rather than being arbitrary. Reviews and Risk Controls Any DeFi crypto and, in particular, lending protocols require security. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit which assists in verifying the token structure and contract logic. Moreover, Halborn Security has conducted the protocol design and risk structure. There is also a bug bounty program of $50K. This will open up the system to external researchers to test and report as pre preliminary adoption. Such layers diminish doubt and will contribute to the creation of trust in the participants having a long period of involvement. Definite collateral requirements, liquidations, and security review of third parties and so on will provide a more solid base. The Reason Why Investor Urgency is on The Increase There is heightened activity among the investors because of tightening of the allocation. The 24 hour leaderboard follows regular engagement as opposed to a single time purchase. This is usually an indication of increased user interest which intends to remain active. Being an Ethereum based protocol, Mutuum Finance is setting itself ahead of Q1 2026 with infrastructure, security, and usage skewed. To most observers of leading cryptocurrencies and those engaged in a question of which crypto one should invest in, this stage defines more of positioning and less speculation. It is this increasing price supply ratio and an imminent V1 launch that makes MUTM more and more popular as a next-big cryptocurrency that should be looked at.

While headlines scream about market corrections, seasoned analysts point to underlying metrics that tell a different, more reassuring story. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be a temporary adjustment rather than the start of a major downturn, according to key on-chain data. Let’s explore why long-term investor behavior suggests strength, not weakness, in the market’s foundation. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About This Bitcoin Correction? Crypto analyst Arab Chain, in a recent CryptoQuant contribution, provides crucial insight. The analyst highlights that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—which tracks the movement of older, long-held coins—remains at moderate levels. This is a vital signal. Why? Because during genuine market tops, we typically see this metric spike as veteran investors cash out en masse. The current data shows no such aggressive selling from long-term holders. Furthermore, the Supply-Adjusted CDD is stable and far from the extreme levels witnessed at past bull market peaks. This combination strongly indicates that the recent Bitcoin correction was not triggered by a mass exodus of the most committed investors. Their coins are staying put, reflecting enduring confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. If Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling, What’s Causing the Dip? So, what’s behind the price pullback if the foundational holders are steadfast? The analysis points to two primary, short-term factors: Slowing Momentum: After a strong rally, markets often need to consolidate. This breather allows overheated conditions to cool and builds a healthier base for the next move. Weakening Liquidity: Shifts in macro liquidity or temporary outflows from short-term speculative traders can create downward pressure without altering the core bullish thesis. In essence, this looks like a routine market cleanse. It shakes out weak hands and resets leverage, all while the most significant cohort—the long-term believers—holds firm. This creates a potentially powerful setup for patient investors. Why Should You See This Bitcoin Correction as an Opportunity? History shows that periods of stability among long-term holders during price dips have often preceded strong rebounds. Their inactivity is a vote of confidence. When the ‘smart money’ isn’t fleeing, it suggests the asset’s fundamental story remains intact. For investors, this environment offers distinct advantages: Reduced Emotional Noise: Understanding the metric-driven reality helps avoid panic-driven decisions. Strategic Entry Points: Temporary corrections can provide better valuation opportunities compared to buying at peak FOMO. Market Health Check: Stable holder metrics act as a diagnostic tool, separating healthy pullbacks from unhealthy breakdowns. Therefore, viewing this phase through the lens of holder behavior transforms it from a threat into a potential strategic window. The current Bitcoin correction is more about market mechanics than a loss of faith. What’s the Bottom Line for Investors? The compelling takeaway is that on-chain data provides a deeper narrative than price charts alone. While volatility is inherent to crypto, the behavior of long-term holders serves as a critical anchor. Their current stability suggests this Bitcoin correction is a temporary phenomenon within a larger, ongoing cycle. For those with a long-term perspective, these moments test conviction but also reward it. In conclusion, the market’s foundation appears solid despite the surface-level turbulence. The dip, driven by momentum and liquidity shifts rather than core investor capitulation, may represent a moment of clarity. By focusing on holder metrics over headlines, investors can navigate volatility with greater confidence and purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) and why is it important? A: Coin Days Destroyed measures the movement of coins that have been held for a long time. A high CDD suggests long-term holders are selling, which can signal a market top. A moderate CDD, like now, suggests they are holding, indicating underlying strength. Q: How long might this Bitcoin correction last? A> Corrections are difficult to time precisely. However, if the cause is short-term liquidity and momentum issues—as the data suggests—it could be resolved relatively quickly compared to corrections driven by fundamental breakdowns. Q: Should I buy Bitcoin during a correction? A> This is a personal investment decision. The data suggests the sell-off is not driven by long-term holders, which is a positive sign. However, always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: What other metrics should I watch besides CDD? A> Key metrics include Exchange Net Flow (to see if coins are moving to sell), Miner Reserves, and the MVRV Ratio. Together, they provide a fuller picture of market sentiment and potential pressure points. Q: Could this analysis be wrong and the correction deepen? A> All market analysis involves probability, not certainty. While on-chain data is a powerful tool, external macro shocks or unforeseen events can always impact prices. The data suggests a temporary dip is more likely, but risk always exists. Found this analysis helpful in cutting through the market noise?

MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le recently made a compelling case for a fundamental shift in perspective. Instead of obsessing over every market dip and surge, he urges investors to focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value . This isn’t just advice from any executive; it’s the guiding principle of a company that has bet billions on this very belief. Let’s explore why this mindset is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape. Why Should You Ignore Bitcoin’s Daily Drama? Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast, Phong Le offered a refreshingly calm take. He stated he is “not concerned” with Bitcoin’s short-term price movements. This stance comes from a place of deep conviction. Le describes Bitcoin as an asset with inherently unpredictable short-term action. Therefore, trying to time the market is often a futile exercise. Instead, he advocates for a “systematic and mathematical approach.” This means judging the asset by its fundamental properties and potential over years and decades, not by its performance over days and weeks. The daily charts are just noise; the true signal is in the long-term trajectory. The Bullish Case for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value So, what builds this long-term conviction? Le highlights two transformative shifts creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s future. Government Sentiment is Warming: Le emphasized that the U.S. government is “more favorable toward BTC than ever before.” This evolving regulatory clarity, though gradual, reduces uncertainty and paves the way for broader integration. Institutional Floodgates Are Opening: Perhaps the most significant signal is the competitive entry of traditional financial giants. When banks and asset managers start offering Bitcoin products, it validates the asset class and unlocks trillions in institutional capital. These factors aren’t about tomorrow’s price. They are structural changes that reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term value as a decentralized, scarce digital asset entering the mainstream financial system. How Can You Adopt a Long-Term Bitcoin Strategy? Shifting your mindset is the first step. Here are actionable insights to build a strategy that mirrors this philosophy. Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This systematic approach involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. It automates the process and removes emotional, short-term decision-making. Secure Your Holdings: Long-term holding, or “HODLing,” requires robust security. Use hardware wallets for significant amounts and enable all available security features on exchanges. Educate Yourself on Fundamentals: Understand the core value propositions—decentralization, fixed supply, security, and growing network adoption. This knowledge will anchor you during volatile periods. The goal is to transition from a trader’s mentality to that of an investor. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption curve, not the fleeting sentiment on social media. What Are the Real Challenges of a Long-Term View? Adopting this perspective is simple in theory but challenging in practice. Volatility tests even the strongest convictions. Media narratives often amplify fear during downturns and greed during rallies, pushing investors toward reactive decisions. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the crypto space requires continuous learning to separate genuine innovation from hype. The key is to build a plan based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, then stick to it. Let the multi-year trend be your guide, not the hourly chart. Conclusion: Your Compass in the Crypto Storm Phong Le’s message is a vital reminder in a speculative market. The relentless focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value over short-term noise is what separates strategic investors from reactive speculators. With increasing institutional adoption and evolving regulatory landscapes, the foundational case for Bitcoin grows stronger. By adopting a disciplined, patient approach, you align yourself with these powerful macro trends. Remember, the most significant wealth in crypto has been built by those who understood the assignment: think in years, not minutes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did MicroStrategy’s CEO say about Bitcoin? MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le said investors should not be concerned with short-term Bitcoin price moves. He argues we should judge it by its long-term value and adopt a systematic investment approach. Why is a long-term view important for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile in the short term. A long-term view allows investors to focus on fundamental drivers like adoption, scarcity, and technological utility, which are better indicators of its potential value. What signals suggest a strong future for Bitcoin? Key signals include warming regulatory sentiment from governments like the U.S. and the competitive entry of major traditional financial institutions (banks, asset managers) into the cryptocurrency space. How can I practice a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy? Consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to invest consistently, use secure storage methods like hardware wallets, and continuously educate yourself on Bitcoin’s core technology and use cases. What is the biggest challenge of holding Bitcoin long-term? The primary challenge is psychological: resisting the urge to sell during sharp price drops (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or buy excessively during rapid rallies (FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out). Discipline is key. Did this perspective on Bitcoin’s long-term value help clarify your investment strategy?

On a typical afternoon, science and engineering students crowd the grounds. Badminton games run near the east gate. Inside the Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence, teams work quietly with whiteboards full of formulas and freshly painted walls while studying how the human brain processes thought. The rise of DeepSeek, an AI startup founded by alumni, gave students confidence that Chinese teams could compete directly with the world’s strongest labs. “DeepSeek showed that a Chinese team could lead in the LLM race,” said Yuyang Zhang, a PhD student in computational biology at Tsinghua. Government backing turns campus research into national priority The growing attention around Tsinghua is tied closely to Beijing’s technology (and specifically AI) agenda. President Xi Jinping, a graduate of the university, has urged private companies to help develop key technologies, with artificial intelligence at the top of that list. The government followed with tax breaks, subsidies, and policy support. Founders like Liang Wenfeng of DeepSeek raised large sums of venture capital and saw their images run alongside Xi’s in state media. Graduates from Tsinghua also hold senior AI roles at major companies such as Alibaba and ByteDance, and inside the university’s labs, researchers built an AI chip called Accel to compete with products from Nvidia. Same guys also created DrugCLIP, a system designed to speed drug discovery, and a training method known as Absolute Zero Reasoner, which allows AI models to train without human-provided data. Between 2005 and the end of 2024, Tsinghua filed 4,986 AI and machine learning patents, including more than 900 in 2024 alone, according to data from LexisNexis. The school holds more AI research papers among the 100 most cited globally than any other university.China now represents more than half of all active AI patent families worldwide. “This is a staggering shift in innovation in less than a decade, and it reflects China’s concerted drive to become an AI superpower,” said Marco Richter, senior director of IP analytics and strategy at LexisNexis. Students build new models as China widens the talent pipeline China’s AI instruction now starts in elementary schools alongside math and language, a pipeline feeds a large workforce. China produced 3.57 million STEM graduates in 2020, compared with 820,000 in the United States, based on figures from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. State media later reported that the annual number of STEM graduates reached five million. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, China’s only Turing Award winner, returned after years at Princeton, Stanford, and MIT to teach at Tsinghua. In 2023, undergraduates Guan Wang and William Chen created an AI model inspired by layered human reasoning, and it model outperformed larger systems from OpenAI and Anthropic on reasoning tests and complex Sudoku puzzles in early 2025. AI tools now appear across the Tsinghua campus, as research in many fields relies on AI models. Student competitions to build specialized agents run regularly and in September, the school launched a subsidized AI computing platform for all students, according to Bloomberg’s claims . The United States still leads in influential patents and top-performing models. Harvard and MIT rank higher on patent impact, and American institutions produced 40 notable AI models in 2024, compared with 15 from China, based on the Stanford AI Index Report.

According to on-chain analytics, an address linked to Strong withdrew over $32 million in CBBTC and Ethereum from Aave and funneled it directly into Coinbase. This substantial Winslow Strong deposits event raises immediate questions about market sentiment and the strategies of influential players. What Does the $32.6M Winslow Strong Deposit Signal? The transaction, spotted by Lookonchain, is undeniably significant. It involved moving 307 CBBTC (worth approximately $27.03 million) and 1,900 ETH (worth around $5.6 million). Such a large-scale movement from a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to a major centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase is a classic action that analysts watch closely. Therefore, it often precedes a potential sale or a strategic repositioning of assets for liquidity. Breaking Down the Crypto Transfer: From Aave to Coinbase To understand the impact, let’s unpack the mechanics. First, the assets were withdrawn from Aave, a leading lending and borrowing protocol. This means Strong was likely earning yield on these holdings. The subsequent deposit to Coinbase, a platform designed for easy trading and fiat conversions, suggests a shift in intent. Key details of the move include: Asset Composition: A mix of Bitcoin (via CBBTC, a wrapped version) and Ethereum. Timing: The transaction occurred just eight hours before reporting, making it a very recent market event. Scale: A $32.6 million transfer is large enough to potentially influence short-term market liquidity and perception. Why Do Major Deposits Like This Matter for Crypto Markets? Movements by known entities, often called “smart money” or “whales,” serve as important barometers. When a figure with a research background like Winslow Strong makes a move, the market takes note. This specific Winslow Strong deposits action could be interpreted in several ways. It might indicate a decision to take profits, a need for fiat currency, or simply a rebalancing of a portfolio. However, it also removes assets from the DeFi ecosystem, slightly reducing the liquidity available for lending and borrowing activities there. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers While you should never blindly follow any single transaction, you can use this event to refine your own market analysis. Here’s how: Monitor Exchange Flows: Large inflows to exchanges can sometimes signal selling pressure, while outflows to private wallets suggest accumulation. Context is Key: Consider broader market conditions. Is this part of a larger trend of whales moving to exchanges? Research the Actor: Understanding Winslow Strong’s historical patterns could provide clues, though past performance is no guarantee. The Final Takeaway on This Major Crypto Movement Ultimately, the Winslow Strong deposits of $32.6M into Coinbase is a powerful reminder of the transparent yet complex nature of blockchain markets. It highlights the continuous strategic maneuvering of major holders. For the average investor, it underscores the importance of staying informed through reliable on-chain data sources and maintaining a long-term strategy that isn’t swayed by any single transaction, no matter how large. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Winslow Strong? Winslow Strong is the former head of Qualia Research, a cryptocurrency research firm. He is a known figure in the crypto analytics and investment space. What is CBBTC? CBBTC is a wrapped Bitcoin token. It represents Bitcoin on other blockchains (like Ethereum), allowing it to be used in DeFi protocols such as Aave. Why move funds from Aave to Coinbase? Moving funds from Aave (DeFi) to Coinbase (a CEX) typically makes them more readily available for trading, selling for fiat, or simply holding in a custodial wallet. It often suggests a change from an earning strategy to a liquidity or exit strategy. Does this mean Winslow Strong is selling his crypto? Not necessarily. A deposit to an exchange makes selling easier, but it doesn’t confirm a sale has occurred. He could be preparing to trade, secure the assets differently, or even use other Coinbase services. How can I track transactions like this? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Etherscan allow users to track large wallet movements and identify trends from smart money wallets. Should I be worried about this large deposit? One transaction should not dictate your investment strategy. It is a single data point. Always consider it within the wider context of market news, technical analysis, and your own financial goals. Found this analysis of the Winslow Strong deposits insightful?

Bitcoin Correlation To Nasdaq & Gold Has Changed Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Correlation that Bitcoin has to the Nasdaq and Gold . The “ Correlation ” here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about how tied together the prices of any two given assets are. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the price of one asset is responding to movements in the other by moving in the same direction. The closer the value is to 1, the stronger this relationship is. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests a negative correlation exists between the assets. That is, the two are going in the opposite directions. The extreme level for this region lies at -1. A third case also exists for the metric, where its value becomes exactly equal to zero. When this happens, the prices don’t hold any relationship with each other whatsoever. In statistics, the variables are said to be “independent” under this condition. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Correlation to Nasdaq and Gold over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Correlation indicator was at notable positive levels for both Nasdaq and Gold in mid-2025, implying the cryptocurrency was strongly bound to traditional markets. As the year went on, however, a shift began to take shape, with the indicator declining for both assets. Today, the metric is sitting at a nearly neutral level for Nasdaq, a sign that Bitcoin is now trading independently from the US stock market. The story is a bit different when it comes to Gold, however, as the Correlation has actually plummeted into the negative territory. With an indicator value of about -0.5, BTC can be considered to have a significant inverse relationship to Gold. Bitcoin is popularly thought of as the digital analogue to Gold’s “safe haven,” but given the latest Correlation, the cryptocurrency doesn’t appear to be behaving like one right now. “BTC is no longer trading like a tech stock or a safe haven,” noted the analyst. “It’s carving out its own market regime.” It now remains to be seen whether the new Correlation behavior will maintain or if the cryptocurrency will face another shift soon. BTC Price Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways since its decline at the start of the week as its price is still trading around $87,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin gold|Bitcoin Stocks|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 02:00:48

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,092.68 on the Binance USDT market. This powerful move has captured the attention of traders and investors worldwide, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. But what’s fueling this impressive rally, and is it sustainable? Let’s dive into the details behind Bitcoin’s latest price action. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? Several key factors are converging to push the BTC price to new heights. First, increased institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not only holding Bitcoin but are actively integrating it into their investment products. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are driving investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in major economies are reducing uncertainty and building confidence in the asset class. Finally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate of new supply, is creating a sense of scarcity that historically precedes major price increases. How Significant is the $88,000 BTC Price Level? Breaking above $88,000 is more than just a number; it’s a critical psychological threshold for the market. This level often acts as a key resistance point, and surpassing it can trigger a wave of automated buying from algorithmic traders. For long-term holders, it reinforces the bullish narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s digital gold thesis. However, it’s crucial to understand the market dynamics at play. The current BTC price reflects a complex interplay of: Spot Market Demand: Real buying from investors seeking to own the asset. Derivatives Activity: Futures and options trading that can amplify price movements. On-Chain Metrics: Data showing accumulation by large holders, known as whales. Global Liquidity: The overall availability of capital in the financial system. What Should Investors Consider at This BTC Price? While the surge is exhilarating, a prudent approach is essential. The volatility inherent to cryptocurrency markets means the BTC price can experience sharp corrections. Therefore, investors should base decisions on their individual risk tolerance and investment horizon, not just short-term momentum. Key considerations include portfolio diversification and having a clear strategy for both potential gains and downturns. Remember, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and the market can change direction quickly based on news or macroeconomic shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bullish BTC Price Trend Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $88,000 marks a pivotal moment, showcasing its resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. The current BTC price rally is supported by a mix of institutional interest, macroeconomic trends, and positive market structure. For the informed participant, this environment presents opportunities but also demands caution. Staying updated with reliable analysis and understanding the underlying fundamentals will be key to navigating the next phase of the market. The journey for Bitcoin continues to be a fascinating one, blending technology, finance, and a new vision for value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does BTC price mean? The BTC price refers to the current market value of one Bitcoin, quoted against a fiat currency like the US Dollar (USD) or a stablecoin like USDT. It is determined by supply and demand on global cryptocurrency exchanges. Why did the BTC price jump above $88,000? The price increase is likely due to a combination of factors including positive institutional inflows, anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving, and broader macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment timing depends entirely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. While the trend is positive, Bitcoin remains volatile. It’s generally advised to research thoroughly, consider dollar-cost averaging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Could the BTC price fall after this surge? Yes, price corrections are a normal part of any financial market, especially cryptocurrencies. Profit-taking by traders after a strong rally can lead to short-term pullbacks. Where can I track the live BTC price? You can track the live price on major cryptocurrency data websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, as well as directly on exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. How does the BTC price on Binance USDT market work? The Binance USDT market pairs Bitcoin (BTC) with Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The price shown is how much USDT is needed to buy one BTC, providing a stable quote against dollar value. Found this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

According to Bitcoin World market data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,043.34 on the Binance USDT market. This rally marks a significant milestone, capturing the attention of traders and investors worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive ascent? Let’s dive into the dynamics behind Bitcoin’s latest price action. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s powerful breakout. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to build a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their offerings, providing a layer of legitimacy and attracting new capital. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value like Bitcoin. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in key markets has also created a sustained inflow of institutional money, applying consistent upward pressure on the BTC price . Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking through the $89,000 resistance is a technically bullish signal. Traders often watch these round-number levels closely. Therefore, a sustained hold above this point could pave the way for a test of even higher thresholds. Market sentiment, as measured by various fear and greed indices, has shifted notably toward optimism. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While the trend is positive, prudent investors monitor key support levels in case of a pullback. For active traders and long-term holders alike, understanding these levels is vital: New Resistance: The $90,000 and $92,000 levels are the next major hurdles for the BTC price . Key Support: A fall below $87,000 might indicate a short-term consolidation phase. Trading Volume: High volume accompanying the rise confirms strong buyer conviction. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? This rally presents both opportunities and reminders. For investors, it reinforces the importance of having a clear strategy. Are you a day trader looking to capitalize on volatility, or a long-term believer in Bitcoin’s underlying technology? Your approach should dictate your actions. Moreover, a rising BTC price often has a ‘halo effect,’ lifting the broader altcoin market. This can create opportunities in other cryptocurrencies, but due diligence is always required. Navigating the Challenges of a Volatile Market Excitement must be tempered with caution. The very volatility that creates profit potential also carries risk. Prices can reverse quickly based on regulatory news, macroeconomic data, or shifts in global liquidity. The key is not to let fear of missing out (FOMO) drive impulsive decisions. Instead, consider dollar-cost averaging or setting clear profit-taking and stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively around the fluctuating BTC price . Conclusion: A Milestone in Bitcoin’s Journey Bitcoin’s climb above $89,000 is more than just a number; it’s a testament to its growing maturity and adoption within the global financial landscape. While short-term fluctuations are guaranteed, this milestone highlights the enduring interest and confidence in the world’s premier cryptocurrency. The journey ahead will likely see both breakthroughs and corrections, but for now, the market is celebrating a decisive victory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the BTC price jump above $89,000? A: The rally is likely driven by a combination of sustained institutional investment via ETFs, positive macroeconomic sentiment, and breaking key technical resistance levels, which triggered further buying. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at this price? A: “Too late” is subjective in crypto markets. While buying at a local high carries risk, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest regularly regardless of price, mitigating timing risk over the long term. Q3: Could the BTC price fall back down quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Profit-taking at new highs is common, which can lead to pullbacks. It’s essential to invest only what you can afford to lose and have a risk management plan. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A strong rising BTC price generally boosts investor confidence and capital inflow into the sector, benefiting many altcoins. Q5: Where can I safely track the live BTC price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price charts and market data. Q6: What’s the next major target if Bitcoin holds above $89,000? A> The next significant psychological and technical resistance levels are at $90,000 and then the all-time high region. A clean break above $89,000 with strong volume is the first step toward testing those levels. Did you find this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

A woman in her 30s now faces prison time after being convicted of laundering over 269 billion won through cryptocurrency transactions. This case highlights the growing challenges regulators face in tracking illicit crypto flows across borders and platforms. What Exactly Happened in This Cryptocurrency Laundering Case? The appeals court delivered a decisive verdict against a South Korean woman accused of orchestrating one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency laundering operations. According to News1 reports, she sold more than 260 billion won worth of cryptocurrency that authorities suspect originated from criminal activities. The scale of this operation demonstrates how cryptocurrency laundering has evolved into sophisticated, high-value criminal enterprises. The defendant reportedly connected with the cryptocurrency source through a group chat, where she was promised substantial commissions for her services. This digital meeting point shows how criminals increasingly use encrypted communication channels to arrange cryptocurrency laundering schemes away from traditional banking oversight. How Did the Cryptocurrency Laundering Operation Work? The mechanics of this cryptocurrency laundering scheme followed a pattern common in digital asset crimes but on an unprecedented scale. After acquiring the suspicious cryptocurrency, the woman executed a multi-layered laundering strategy: Initial Conversion : She sold the cryptocurrency for traditional currency Fragmentation Strategy : The funds were divided into smaller amounts Distribution Network : Money moved to hundreds of different accounts Obfuscation Layer : Multiple transactions masked the money trail This approach to cryptocurrency laundering creates significant challenges for investigators trying to follow the digital paper trail across numerous transactions and accounts. Why Is This Cryptocurrency Laundering Case Significant? This cryptocurrency laundering conviction sends a powerful message about South Korea’s commitment to fighting financial crime in the digital age. The case represents several important developments: First, it demonstrates that authorities are developing the technical expertise to trace complex cryptocurrency laundering operations. Second, the prison sentence establishes that courts take cryptocurrency crimes seriously. Third, the international community watches such cases closely as they set precedents for global cryptocurrency regulation. The sheer volume—269 billion won—makes this one of Asia’s most substantial cryptocurrency laundering cases to reach conviction. This scale indicates that criminal organizations view cryptocurrency as a viable channel for moving enormous sums while attempting to avoid detection. What Challenges Does Cryptocurrency Laundering Present? Cryptocurrency laundering presents unique obstacles for law enforcement and regulators. Unlike traditional banking systems with centralized oversight, cryptocurrency transactions can span multiple jurisdictions and platforms. The pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrency transactions further complicates investigation efforts. However, this case proves that cryptocurrency laundering leaves traces. Blockchain analysis tools have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing investigators to follow transaction patterns despite attempts at obfuscation. The conviction resulted from combining traditional financial investigation techniques with cutting-edge cryptocurrency tracking technology. How Are Governments Responding to Cryptocurrency Laundering? South Korea has implemented stringent cryptocurrency regulations in recent years, including: Real-name verification for cryptocurrency exchanges Enhanced reporting requirements for suspicious transactions International cooperation on cryptocurrency crime investigations Specialized training for financial crime units These measures aim to prevent cryptocurrency laundering while supporting legitimate innovation in the digital asset space. The successful prosecution in this cryptocurrency laundering case validates the effectiveness of these regulatory approaches. What Can We Learn From This Cryptocurrency Laundering Conviction? This cryptocurrency laundering case offers crucial insights for investors, regulators, and the general public. It underscores that cryptocurrency markets, while innovative, are not immune to criminal exploitation. The conviction demonstrates that legal systems worldwide are adapting to address cryptocurrency crimes with appropriate seriousness. For legitimate cryptocurrency users, this case highlights the importance of: Understanding regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction Using reputable, compliant cryptocurrency exchanges Maintaining proper transaction records Reporting suspicious cryptocurrency activities The prison sentence delivers a clear warning that cryptocurrency laundering carries severe consequences, regardless of the technological sophistication employed. Frequently Asked Questions What was the sentence for the cryptocurrency laundering? The appeals court sentenced the South Korean woman to prison, though the specific length wasn’t detailed in initial reports. The conviction itself represents a significant legal outcome in cryptocurrency crime prosecution. How was the cryptocurrency laundering discovered? Authorities likely detected the scheme through financial monitoring systems that flag unusual transaction patterns, combined with blockchain analysis tools that trace cryptocurrency movements across wallets and exchanges. Why is cryptocurrency attractive for money laundering? Cryptocurrency can facilitate cross-border transfers with relative speed and pseudonymity. However, as this case shows, cryptocurrency laundering leaves investigatable trails on public blockchains. What measures prevent cryptocurrency laundering? Preventive measures include Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, transaction monitoring systems, international regulatory cooperation, and blockchain surveillance tools that identify suspicious patterns. How common is cryptocurrency laundering? While exact statistics vary, cryptocurrency represents a small but growing portion of money laundering cases globally. High-profile convictions like this one demonstrate increasing enforcement effectiveness. Can cryptocurrency be completely anonymous? Most cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous rather than anonymous. While wallet addresses don’t directly identify individuals, sophisticated analysis can often connect transactions to real-world identities, especially when funds move to regulated exchanges.

This single transaction, worth a quarter of a billion dollars, is more than just a number on a screen. It represents a significant injection of liquidity and a powerful signal from within the digital asset ecosystem. But what does it actually mean when such a vast amount of stablecoin is created? Let’s dive into the implications of this whale-sized event. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC minted , we refer to the creation of new USDC stablecoin tokens. Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens when demand increases. This typically happens when individuals or institutions deposit US dollars into Circle’s reserve accounts. In return, they receive an equivalent amount of USDC on the blockchain. Therefore, a minting event of this scale strongly suggests that a substantial amount of traditional capital—$250 million worth—is being prepared to enter the crypto markets. Why Would Someone Mint 250 Million USDC? The sheer size points to institutional activity. Retail users don’t move quarters of billions. This USDC minted event likely serves one of several strategic purposes: Providing Liquidity for Trading: Exchanges or large trading firms often mint USDC to ensure sufficient stablecoin liquidity for high-volume trading pairs, facilitating smoother large trades. Preparing for Investment: A venture capital fund or institution may mint USDC to have dry powder ready for deploying into various crypto projects, token purchases, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions: Corporations use stablecoins like USDC for fast, global settlements. This mint could back a major international trade or treasury operation. Ultimately, it signals confidence and an expectation of activity. Someone is positioning a significant war chest within the crypto economy. The Ripple Effect: How a Large USDC Mint Impacts the Market Such a substantial USDC minted transaction doesn’t occur in a vacuum. It creates subtle but important ripples across the ecosystem. Primarily, it increases the overall supply of a key stablecoin, which is the lifeblood of crypto trading. More available USDC can lead to increased buying pressure on other assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum if that capital is deployed. Furthermore, it reinforces USDC’s position as a leading dollar-backed stablecoin, showcasing robust demand and institutional trust in its underlying reserves and regulatory compliance. Should Retail Investors Care About USDC Minting? You might wonder if this technical treasury activity matters to the average investor. The answer is yes, but indirectly. While you don’t need to track every mint, large-scale events like this 250 million USDC minted serve as a vital market health indicator. They are a pulse check on institutional sentiment. A flurry of minting activity can precede bullish market movements, as it shows money is poised to enter. Conversely, large-scale redemptions (burning USDC) can signal capital exiting. Therefore, understanding these flows provides context for broader market trends. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The report of 250 million USDC minted is a powerful piece of on-chain intelligence. It cuts through speculation and shows real, measurable action. This event underscores the growing maturity of crypto markets, where institutional players execute sophisticated treasury management strategies using stablecoins. For the observant investor, it’s a reminder to watch not just price charts but also the fundamental flows of capital on the blockchain. These flows often tell the story before the headlines do. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who can mint USDC? A> Only the issuer, Circle, can mint new USDC tokens. They do so upon receiving equivalent U.S. dollar deposits from verified customers into their reserve accounts. Q: Does minting USDC affect its price? A> No. USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Minting new tokens based on dollar deposits ensures the peg remains stable by fully backing the new supply. Q: Is a large USDC mint always bullish for crypto prices? A> Not always, but it is generally seen as a positive signal. It indicates capital is being positioned within the crypto ecosystem, which can lead to increased buying activity for other assets. Q: How can I track USDC minting and burning events? A> You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDC or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which report large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A> Minting is the primary creation of new tokens by the issuer. Buying is acquiring existing USDC tokens from someone else on the secondary market, like an exchange. Found this breakdown of the major USDC minted event helpful?

56373725,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884191,1766717839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56373725.jpeg,Takaichi's cabinet approves ¥112 trillion fiscal package,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-stocks-bright-year-ahead/,"Japan’s equity market is heading into 2026 with investors betting on another round of strong gains, thanks to Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae’s aggressive government spending and strict approach to AI industry oversight. The Topix index is finishing 2025 with a 23% rally, despite taking hits from trade tariffs, two Bank of Japan rate hikes, and a full change in political leadership. This year’s rally has already pushed Japan past the S&P 500 in relative performance for the first time since 2022. Takaichi’s administration is funneling trillions of yen into domestic programs, with traders eyeing upside in infrastructure, construction, and energy names. Robot manufacturers are also getting attention, as the tech spotlight turns away from virtual AI toward robotics and hardware. Banks, which already had a strong 2025 due to higher interest rates, are expected to build on their gains. Takaichi’s cabinet approves ¥112 trillion fiscal package Takaichi’s fiscal package, unveiled in November, includes ¥18 trillion, or about $115 billion, in additional stimulus focused on 17 government-backed sectors, such as nuclear fusion and quantum computing. On top of the stimulus, the government approved a record ¥112 trillion ($785 billion) budget for the next fiscal year. While that’s expected to help hold up consumer spending, it also increases the strain on the country’s massive public debt. But the focus in the markets is on the cash hitting the real economy. Japan’s policymakers are using this funding to try and take the lead in technologies that are still up for grabs globally. Inflation numbers coming out of Tokyo are giving the BOJ more cover to tighten policy. The core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food, rose 2.3% in December. That’s down from 2.8% in November and also lower than economists expected. A second inflation gauge, the one the BOJ tracks most closely, removing both fuel and food, showed a 2.6% increase in December. That also eased from the prior month. The BOJ’s next policy meeting is scheduled for January 22–23, where members will update their growth and inflation projections. Just last week, the bank raised its main interest rate to 0.75%, the highest in 30 years. Ueda Kazuo, the bank’s governor, told reporters on Thursday that they are seeing “steady progress” in trying to meet the 2% inflation goal, with wage growth now backing that effort. “We’re making steady progress in durably achieving our price target,” Ueda said. Weaker yen benefits exporters while risks build at the edge The yen is finishing 2025 much weaker than predicted, giving a big lift to exporters like car companies and commodity traders. As of December 25, the yen has only climbed less than 1% against the dollar year-to-date. This is giving companies that sell abroad higher profits when their dollars come back home. Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust, said the yen is likely to stay around the 150–160 range in 2026. “The BOJ’s hikes don’t really impact the yen, as the market has already priced in two hikes a year,” he said. That view has been widely echoed among large-cap investors, who expect export-heavy sectors to keep beating the broader market next year. But not everyone is optimistic. Rie Nishihara, a strategist at JPMorgan , warned that if the yen slips too far, the boost turns into a threat. “Excessive yen depreciation” could hurt real income growth, she said, adding that 165 per dollar is the red line where it starts causing damage.

Osaka Prefecture has launched a public-private consortium that will experiment with AI Agents designed to provide clerical support and multilingual services. The prefecture will pool expertise from a consortium, which includes Google Cloud Japan, telecom provider NTT West, Microsoft Japan, and Osaka Metropolitan University. The trial will assess whether AI can streamline administrative processes accurately and independently under predefined rules. Osaka governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said the initiative moves to create “a society that is more convenient and prosperous.” In Silicon Valley AI agents are a technology to be scaled, but in Japan, the main concern is minimizing chaos through standardization. Japan’s AI agent boom Osaka prefecture’s new consortium follows a host of major household companies that are starting to embrace AI agents. Itochu Corporation, one of Japan’s largest food and drink manufacturers, and automaker Mazda are testing AI agents in autonomous payments, internal audits, as well as customer service. Japanese software testing firm SHIFT and data analytics firm TDSE are also exploring a payment ecosystem powered by autonomous AI agents. TDSE said its proof of concept seeks to initiate transactions, verify requirements, and coordinate with other systems to execute settlement without direct human intervention. In fact, a recent industry survey found that 35% of Japanese companies have already adopted AI agents in some form and 44% plan to adopt them. Japan’s corporate ambitions to develop AI agents is a largely reactionary and ‘defensive’ measure. It represents an economic acceptance of autonomous AI as a productivity tool amid a labor shortage, rural depopulation, and waning tolerance towards foreigners. Innovation hotbed? Think again. Japan isn’t trying to win a race for the biggest AI agent models. It’s taking a slower, deliberate, and more risk averse path. Tokyo-based provider of accounting software, Rakus isn’t convinced that AI can be left to do everything. Chatbots have emerged as the latest sales and customer facing tools in big tech and fintech. But the current capabilities of back-end chatbots hasn’t made life easier, according to Shinichiro Motomatsu, the company’s director and chief AI officer. “If you were to try and handle expense reimbursements entirely through a chatbot workflow it would probably turn into a hellish experience,” said Motomatsu. Their main worry is adopting a system that increases operational burdens on teams which are already at capacity. Accountability grey zone Japan wants to implement AI agents safely inside real organizations. The focus is on minimizing mistakes so as not to undermine trust. According to Rakus’s chief AI office, Japan’s approach is not a failure of imagination but a deliberate response to how organizations really work. “At each stage you need to evaluate whether the technology is genuinely helping users. If it isn’t, we shouldn’t hesitate to pull back,’” said Motomatsu. Motomatsu said that AI agents should be treated as goal driven tools as opposed to a stand alone technological goal. He believes it’s far more realistic for AI agents to serve as partially autonomous actors since accountability is a major grey area. “If something goes wrong, you can’t just simply explain that AI decided it,” said Motomatsu. “Someone in the organization must be able to take responsibility for the outcome.” Human-centric AI agents Rakus’s chief AI officer stresses that AI doesn’t eliminate the need for well designed workflows as well as checks and balances. He argues their real value lies in playing a supporting role, rather than replacing structures that make organizations function. “AI agents are not magic. They won’t eliminate the need for rules, processes, or human judgement,” said Motomatsu. Osaka prefecture’s push to adopt AI agents reflects a governance first approach taking roots across corporate Japan. It plans to formulate practical guidelines that can be replicated by local governments across Japan by the end of fiscal 2026. The prefecture aims to produce a framework that outlines clear rules regarding what AI agents are allowed to do, how their actions are monitored, and when human intervention is needed. There are also gains beyond efficiency. Hitachi’s chief AI transformation officer, Jun Yoshida suggests that AI agents can take over repetitive tasks making way for cognitive space. “If AI simply allows us to do even more work at a faster pace, that’s not necessarily progress,” he said. “What matters is how people use the space that opens up.” He describes this as “white space” which he argues can become a source of innovation, reflection and decision making. Japan is designing AI agents that address corporate problems, not showcase technological development. In a business culture that traditionally prioritize control and standardization, companies are wary of systems that obscure human judgment in mission-critical processes.

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a significant injection of liquidity that signals major activity in the digital asset space. For anyone tracking market sentiment and capital flows, understanding why this happens is crucial. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC was minted , it means new USDC stablecoin tokens were created and issued into circulation. Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens when there is sufficient demand, typically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars held in reserve. Therefore, a mint of this scale—250 million dollars’ worth—points directly to substantial incoming capital or anticipated demand within the crypto ecosystem. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? Such a large-scale mint doesn’t happen without reason. It often precedes major moves by institutional players or large trading firms, commonly called ‘whales.’ Here are the most likely scenarios behind this event: Institutional Entry: A large entity is preparing to move significant capital into cryptocurrencies. USDC offers a stable on-ramp before purchasing assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. DeFi and Trading Activity: The capital could be destined for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, yield farming, or providing liquidity, which often requires stablecoins. Market Making and Liquidity: Exchanges or market makers may need to bolster their USDC reserves to ensure smooth trading pairs and sufficient liquidity for users. Essentially, this mint acts as a precursor to action. It shows confidence and preparation for significant financial activity on the blockchain. How Does a USDC Mint Impact the Broader Market? The immediate effect of 250 million USDC being minted is an increase in available stablecoin liquidity. However, the real impact depends on what happens next. If this capital flows into Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can create buying pressure and potentially influence prices. Conversely, if it remains parked in stablecoins or moves into DeFi, it signals a focus on yield and ecosystem growth rather than direct speculation. For everyday investors, monitoring these mints provides a valuable, real-time indicator of institutional sentiment. A surge in minting can suggest that sophisticated players are gearing up for a bullish move or securing positions in a volatile market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Don’t just watch the event; understand its context. Track where the funds go using blockchain explorers. Is the USDC that was minted moving to a central exchange like Coinbase? Is it being deposited into a Compound or Aave smart contract? This follow-through data is more telling than the mint itself. Remember, while a large mint is notable, it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Always combine this data with broader market trends, news, and technical analysis before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The minting of 250 million USDC is a powerful signal of institutional movement and liquidity preparation within crypto markets. It underscores the growing role of stablecoins like USDC as the essential plumbing for the digital economy. By paying attention to these on-chain events, you gain a clearer window into the strategies of major market participants, allowing you to make more informed decisions in your own crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who exactly mints USDC? A1: USDC is minted by Circle, the regulated financial company that issues the stablecoin, through its USDC Treasury. The process is permissioned and requires compliance with financial regulations. Q2: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? A2: No, it does not cause monetary inflation. Each new USDC token is supposed to be backed 1:1 by a corresponding US dollar held in reserve, making it a fully collateralized stablecoin. Q3: How can I track where the minted USDC goes? A3: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan. By looking up the transaction hash from the Whale Alert report or the treasury address, you can follow subsequent transfers to exchanges or DeFi protocols. Q4: Is a large USDC mint always a bullish sign? A4: Not always. While it often indicates incoming capital, it can also be for risk management or to meet redemption demands. The key is to observe the subsequent flow of the funds. Q5: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A5: “Minting” refers to the creation of new tokens by the issuer. “Buying” USDC is what users do on an exchange after those tokens are in circulation. A large mint supplies the tokens that are then bought. Q6: Can anyone mint USDC? A6: No. Only Circle and its licensed partners can mint and redeem USDC directly, following strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.

Daily trading volume is looking pretty strong at $24.3 billion and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency is still sitting pretty at top spot in market capitalisation, valued at roughly $1.78 trillion. There’s 19.97 million Bitcoin in circulation out of a total supply of 21 million. Despite the bounce, overall market mood is still pretty cautious. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is stuck at 27, firmly in ‘fear’ territory, and the Altcoin Season Index is down to 16, which means Bitcoin Season is well and truly in the driving seat. It’s clear that everyone is playing it safe, focusing on just a few choice assets and keeping a tight rein on risk. Market Sentiment is all About Bitcoin Over Altcoins The overall crypto market cap is sitting at $2.99 trillion and daily volume is around $73 billion. Ethereum (ETH) is trading round $2,970, while Solana (SOL) is just nudging over $123 – not exactly a glowing endorsement of the altcoins. It looks like everyone’s still spooked by Bitcoin’s relative strength. Just a few key indicators show how the market is feeling: Bitcoin’s dominance is still pretty high because loads of people are avoiding the high-risk assets. Historically, when investors are feeling genuinely fearful it’s a great chance to start buying up some stocks. Institutional investors and all those fancy ETFs remain convinced that the smart money should be on BTC. That explains why, at the moment, Bitcoin is just cruising along while the altcoins are really struggling to get any momentum. Bitcoin Technical Chart is Sort of Looking The Business On the 4 hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction has stabilised at around $89,200 after bouncing back from that mid-December low of $83,800. The price action is currently playing out within a pretty well-defined descending channel from the $94,600 peak, but you can see that momentum is definitely starting to come back. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin has also reclaimed the $88,000 to $88,600 pivot zone, where the 50-EMA is at $88,000 and the 100-EMA is at $88,600 – and now that zone is actually helping to prop the price up. That’s a nice technical sign. The recent candle patterns are looking pretty solid, with solid green closes followed by a bit of a consolidation afterwards – that suggests people are genuinely interested in buying, not just panicking out of a short squeeze. That makes the chart start to look a bit like a descending triangle – there are higher intraday lows and the RSI is back up at about 60. And, you know, there’s no obvious bearish divergence to upset the applecart. Overall momentum is coming back without getting too carried away, and there’s no obvious bearish divergences to knock that recovery. Key Levels and What’s Next If we look at TradingView’s predictions, a confirmed break above $90,500 would suddenly open up some very promising prospects: $92,650 as the next major resistance Even a retest of $94,600 might be in the cards, where the sellers last took control But if you do get a failure to hold $88,000, that could trigger a bit of a pullback towards $86,300, with another opportunity to buy in again near $83,800. Right now, the technical outlook is suggesting that it could be a good time to buy – let’s keep our eye out for a clean break above $88,000 – that would really give the crypto market a bit of a confidence boost. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.39 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012112 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

With market sentiment shifting and new projects emerging, timing and early access are becoming critical for strategic investors. In the evolving landscape of digital assets, established names like Litecoin and Tron show resilience and utility, while projects like APEMARS present rare early‑stage entry points investors can’t ignore. Litecoin and Tron have captured attention with robust networks and steady adoption, even amid market pressures. But for those seeking explosive upside with structured early access, the best altcoin picks include not just established tokens but also emerging opportunities like APEMARS ($APRZ). Its live whitelist presents a chance to secure allocation before wider exposure, combining community growth with powerful reward mechanics. APEMARS: Claim Early Access Before the Next Altcoin Breakout APEMARS ($APRZ) represents one of the most compelling opportunities for early‑stage participation in the altcoin space. Designed to reward long‑term engagement, it blends utility and community focus with a strategic upcoming crypto presale structure. Whitelist access is the key entry point. With the whitelist now live, early participants can position themselves for Stage 1 access, the lowest-price window of the entire presale, and Stage 1 only lasts one week before the price steps up and token allocation per dollar shrinks. For anyone aiming to capture the earliest upside runway, the whitelist is where that positioning begins. Two standout features distinguish APEMARS from typical token launches: 63% APY staking, which enables investors to earn significant passive yield on held tokens, and an integrated referral system that rewards community growth by incentivizing participants who introduce new holders. This combination doesn’t just add perks; it creates dynamic participation pathways that turn simple token holding into an interactive, growth‑driven experience. The staking mechanism allows early supporters to compound rewards, while the referral program effectively multiplies network effects, rewarding both referrers and referees as APEMARS grows. With the whitelist live, you’re getting insider access to strong utility before public market pricing locks in. 3000x Gains Potential: APEMARS Stage 1 Investment Scenario APEMARS launched Stage 1 tokens at $0.00001699 with a projected listing price of $0.0055, a price that implies up to 32,269% ROI if the project follows through on roadmap expectations. That means potential 3000x‑plus gains for early entry participants. If you invest $1,500 at Stage 1, you would receive approximately 88.3 million $APRZ tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.0055, that position could surge to approximately $485,000, not including staking rewards or referral bonuses, potentially transforming early faith into extraordinary returns. With the APEMARS whitelist open for a limited time and presale stages coming soon (and often closing early), acting now ensures access to the most favorable entry point before prices rise further.

Simply visit the official APEMARS website, head to the “Whitelist Now” section, enter your email, and submit. You’ll receive a confirmation email; verify it to secure your Stage 1 allocation.

Litecoin: Steady Network Strength Meets Ongoing Development Legacy in Motion: Litecoin’s Position in a Changing Market ATH: $413 | ATL: $1.15 Litecoin remains one of the enduring names in the altcoin world. Built as a lighter, faster alternative to Bitcoin, it has attracted steady adoption over time. According to recent market coverage, sentiment around Litecoin continues to evolve as developers focus on broader ecosystem integration and user‑friendly enhancements. This resilience through market cycles highlights why Litecoin is considered among the best altcoin picks for diversified, long‑term portfolios. While Litecoin doesn’t offer a presale gap like APEMARS, its proven track record and ongoing development efforts offer context for why early access opportunities, like APEMARS’s live whitelist, are so compelling. Participants in the APEMARS upcoming presale can capture a structured, early‑stage position while traditional altcoins like Litecoin continue to demonstrate utility and stability. Tron: Resilient Network with DeFi and Stablecoin Momentum Tron Continues to Impress with Activity and DeFi Integration ATH: $0.17 | ATL: $0.001 According to the best crypto to buy now , Tron has maintained strong on‑chain activity, driven by stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance integrations. Recent market reports highlight that Tron’s network remains a hub for stablecoin transfers, DApps, and cross‑chain engagement, underscoring its role as a practical altcoin in heavy use. Such sustained network engagement reinforces Tron’s utility and relevance despite broader market volatility. For investors weighing the best altcoin picks, Tron exemplifies a project with mature use cases and ecosystem depth. Yet, even as Tron delivers on real‑world utility, upcoming presales like APEMARS offer an additional dimension, structured access with growth incentives that traditional networks don’t typically provide. Conclusion: Finding the best altcoin picks in a Dynamic Market APEMARS, Litecoin, and Tron each offer unique perspectives on what investors consider worthwhile in the altcoin space. Litecoin brings a legacy of performance and adoption; Tron showcases ecosystem resilience and utility; APEMARS delivers structured early‑stage access with a live whitelist and growth mechanics designed for participation and reward.

56374206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254337,1766718911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive BTC Short Squeeze Obliterates $116M in Crypto Futures,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-short-squeeze-futures-liquidations/,"BitcoinWorld Explosive BTC Short Squeeze Obliterates $116M in Crypto Futures The cryptocurrency market just experienced a classic and powerful squeeze play. A fierce BTC short squeeze erupted over a 24-hour period, violently reversing bearish bets and triggering a staggering $116 million in forced liquidations across perpetual futures markets. This event serves as a stark reminder of the high-stakes, leveraged nature of crypto trading. What Exactly Was This BTC Short Squeeze? Simply put, a short squeeze occurs when an asset’s price rises rapidly. Traders who had borrowed and sold Bitcoin, betting its price would fall (short sellers), are forced to buy it back to close their positions and limit losses. This wave of buying fuels further price increases, creating a feedback loop that squeezes more short sellers out of the market. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price acted as the catalyst for this domino effect. The $116M Liquidation Breakdown: Who Got Hit? The data reveals a clear narrative of pain concentrated on specific assets and trade directions. Let’s break down the numbers: Bitcoin (BTC): The epicenter. A massive $75.68 million was liquidated, with a overwhelming 75.95% coming from short positions. This confirms the BTC short squeeze was the primary driver. Ethereum (ETH): Saw $29.66 million in liquidations. Interestingly, here long positions (bets on price increases) made up 52.48% of the losses, suggesting a mixed or corrective move for ETH. Solana (SOL): Experienced $10.75 million in liquidations, with a crushing 82.5% from long positions. This indicates SOL’s price movement may have disappointed bullish traders during this period. Why Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Matter? Forced liquidations are not just numbers on a screen; they have real market impacts. Firstly, they can amplify price volatility. The cascade of automatic sell orders from long liquidations (or buy orders from short liquidations) can push prices further in their current direction. Secondly, they represent significant capital being wiped from the market, which can affect trader sentiment and liquidity. Understanding these events is crucial for assessing market health and risk. How Can Traders Navigate Such Volatility? While squeezes and liquidations are inherent risks, traders can adopt strategies to manage exposure. Using sensible leverage, setting stop-loss orders (while being aware of potential slippage), and diversifying beyond highly correlated assets are fundamental practices. Moreover, monitoring aggregate liquidation levels across exchanges can provide early warning signs of excessive leverage building up in the market, potentially foreshadowing a sharp move. The Bottom Line on the Market Shakeout The recent BTC short squeeze and its accompanying liquidation wave delivered a brutal lesson in market mechanics. It highlighted the dangers of over-leverage, especially during periods of low liquidity or ahead of major price catalysts. For the broader market, such events can help reset excessive speculation, creating a healthier foundation. However, they also underscore the need for robust risk management for every participant, from retail traders to institutions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What causes a short squeeze in crypto? A: A short squeeze is caused by a rapid price increase in an asset. This forces traders who bet on a price drop (short sellers) to buy back the asset to close their losing positions, which drives the price up even further. Q: Are liquidations bad for the crypto market? A: They have mixed effects. While they cause losses for specific traders and increase short-term volatility, liquidations can also flush out excessive leverage and over-speculation, which may lead to a more stable market afterward. Q: How can I avoid getting liquidated? A> To avoid liquidation, use lower leverage, fund your margin account sufficiently, set prudent stop-loss orders, and avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged trade. Q: Did this event only affect Bitcoin? A: No. While the BTC short squeeze was the main event, it caused ripples across the market. Major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also saw significant liquidations, though the bias (long vs. short) differed based on their individual price action. Q: Where can I track futures liquidation data? A> Several crypto analytics websites like Coinglass, Bybit, and Binance provide real-time and historical data on futures market liquidations across various exchanges. Q: Is a short squeeze always followed by a price drop? A> Not necessarily. While a squeeze can exhaust buying pressure and lead to a pullback, the subsequent price direction depends on broader market fundamentals, sentiment, and new catalysts. It doesn’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Found this breakdown of the explosive BTC short squeeze helpful?

With several Asia Pacific exchanges shut for the holiday, investors took cues from the last full session, when MSCI’s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.35%. Crypto traders framed the quieter tape as a liquidity story as much as a macro one. Gabriel Selby, head of research at CF Benchmarks, said Bitcoin remained pinned under a key level as markets drift into the seasonal lull. “Bitcoin has struggled to break above the $90k level during a busy schedule of macroeconomic data releases, and price action appears to be forming a bearish wedge with downside risk,” he said. “As we head into the holiday period, trading volumes are following their usual seasonal lull, which typically reinforces the choppy, high-resistance environment currently observed.” Market snapshot Bitcoin : $89,127, up 1.5% Ether : $2,965, up 0.6% XRP : $1.87, up 0.00% Total crypto market cap: $3.07 trillion, up 0.9% Wall Street Records Fuel Year-End Risk Appetite Wall Street’s late-week run kept the mood constructive. The Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record highs on Wednesday in a holiday-shortened session, with the Dow up 0.60% and the S&P 500 up 0.32%. Silver rose to a record and gold traded near an all-time high https://t.co/3PXxMDYg4W — Bloomberg (@business) December 25, 2025 That same rally fed the seasonal narrative traders keep calling the Santa Claus rally, a window that often draws positioning flows into the final sessions of the year. In commodities, silver continued to shine after pushing deeper into uncharted territory earlier in the week. Spot silver rose to an all-time high of $74.89 on Friday, driven by strong industrial demand and a supply deficit that has left the market tighter than traders expected. Defensive Trades Boost Gold And Silver Analysts tied the move to heavy usage in solar panels, electric vehicles and data centres, while mine supply struggled to keep up, and the metal also drew fresh safe haven demand as geopolitical risks flared. Gold tracked the same flight to hedges, trading around $4,480 an ounce after setting a record above $4,500, with traders still pricing in a friendlier rate outlook next year. Geopolitics kept the backdrop tense, with Washington’s pressure on Venezuelan oil flows feeding a wider bid for defensive assets.
