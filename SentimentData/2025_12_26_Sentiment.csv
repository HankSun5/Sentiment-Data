Is Loopring a good investment Loopring (LRC) could be a promising investment for those interested in Layer 2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, particularly due to its focus on zk-Rollups for fast and low-cost transactions. Its decentralized exchange (DEX) technology and commitment to security and efficiency make it a strong contender in the DeFi space. However, its success depends on broader Ethereum adoption, competition from other Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, and overall market trends. While Loopring has potential, investors should consider its volatility, ecosystem development, and market conditions before investing. Always conduct thorough research and risk assessment before making any investment decisions. Why is LRC up? The LRC/USD crypto pair price has spiked today as the buying influx has abruptly taken over the market, surging the price to $0.0570. The bulls are targeting the resistance of $0.0587 next, as overall, the coin’s value has increased significantly over the past week. Will LRC reach $0.5? According to the long-term predictions, LRC is projected to reach up to $0.44 by 2031. Will LRC reach $1? No, LRC may not reach $1 in the near future. By the year 2030, the highest price prediction is $0.44255, suggesting that LRC lacks the potential to achieve this milestone at the moment. Does LRC have a good long-term future? Loopring (LRC) has long-term potential as a Layer 2 solution using zk-Rollups for fast, low-cost Ethereum transactions. Its DEX technology supports the shift toward decentralized trading. However, strong competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet poses challenges. Success depends on adoption, partnerships, and innovation. While promising, risks like market volatility and regulatory changes should be considered before investing.

Loopring Price History Loopring price history Based on historical data, the Loopring token LRC suffered a significant knock in 2018. Prices fell in April after reaching a high of $1.4522 in January 2018, falling to an all-time low of $0.01986 in December 2019. By early 2020, the coin price had corrected to $0.0225. However, following the DEX’s beta debut, values started to rise significantly, and the LRC coin traded for $0.087895 at the start of June 2020, up almost 300 percent during the first half of 2020. LRC skyrocketed, breaking above $3 in December 2021, as the Crypto market capitalization increased. Loopring caught investors’ attention when it broke above $1 in October 2021. It continued to register its all-time high at $3.83 in November 2021. The reversal was swift in 2022, losing over 90% of its value. In 2023, it faced stiff resistance at the $0.25 mark. LRC continued its downward trend, staying within the $0.10-$0.50 range in the year 2023. LRC settled around $0.11-$0.12, maintaining a stable but low in December 2024 In January 2025, LRC traded around $0.11, showing little change from the previous months. As of early March 2025, LRC continues to trade around $0.11, showing a stable but weak trend. The altcoin showed high volatility in April and May, touching a bottom price of $0.0759 and a high of $0.1282. In June 2025, LRC observed a further low of $0.659, followed by a period of recovery, when the altcoin recovered back to $0.1030 in July and $0.1076 in September. LRC remained in decline till the start of December, observing the year’s lowest price of $0.0482, and has since slightly recovered to $0.0571 by the end of the year.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LRC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:00:00

The so called “coin of the cycle” is stuck in a boring range, and sentiment around it is at some of the lowest levels we have seen in a while. SOL ETFs still recorded about $1.4M in inflows on December 24, which is one of the few positive signs right now, but it has not been enough to change the bigger picture. Solana (SOL) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Looking ahead to 2026, analysts like Umair Crypto point out that the core problem is still on the chart. Price has failed to flip the $127 level into support. Every attempt to break and hold above that area has been cleanly rejected, forcing SOL to roll over and search for lower support. At the time of writing, Solana is holding around $123, which is now the key level bulls need to defend. Solana Price Prediction: What Is The Next Move For SOL Price? Source: JamesEaston There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI , which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. One big thing that is missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is still pretty weak, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully committing to this move yet. Without a clear spike in volume, any push above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What really changes the picture is a clean break above the $144 level with strong volume coming in. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Bitcoin Hyper Is Quietly Building While Solana Stalls While Solana chops sideways and sentiment keeps sinking, Bitcoin Hyper is moving in the opposite direction, quietly stacking momentum while most traders are distracted. This is usually how early cycle winners start, low noise, steady inflows, and no need for hype candles yet. Bitcoin Hyper is designed to capitalize on exactly this kind of market environment. When majors stall and confidence drops, capital slowly rotates into projects with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost always happens before the charts make it obvious. The project has already raised over $29.8M, showing serious conviction from early backers even while the broader market hesitates. On top of that, the 39% APY staking rewards incentivize holders to stay put rather than flip for short term moves, which helps build real supply pressure over time. While traders wait for Solana to finally flip resistance, Bitcoin Hyper is building its base. And when momentum returns to the market, the projects that were accumulated quietly during boredom phases are usually the ones that move first and hardest.

The pullback comes even as on-chain metrics point to easing sell pressure and a record build-up of stablecoin capital, leaving traders split between caution and the risk of sudden price swings. ETF Outflows and Holiday Liquidity Weigh on Prices XWIN Finance’s Trend Index, published on December 25, placed the market firmly in a “mild downtrend” with a score of 34 out of 100, citing persistent ETF withdrawals and U.S.-session selling as the main drags. It saw Bitcoin briefly dipping below $87,000 before bouncing, though repeated attempts to reclaim the $88,000 to $89,000 area have stalled, a zone XWIN described as heavy resistance shaped by options positioning. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see net withdrawals, with roughly 2,900 BTC, worth some $251 million, leaving funds in the latest session. That weakness lines up with figures reported by CryptoPotato on December 24, which showed cumulative BTC ETF inflows shrinking by nearly $6 billion since their October peak. Ethereum funds followed a similar pattern, remaining net negative on a weekly basis despite a small daily bounce. By contrast, diversification flows are visible elsewhere. For example, Solana products posted steady inflows, while XRP-related ETFs added about $8 million in the most recent session, extending a streak that has made XRP funds an outlier among crypto ETFs. Bitcoin’s price action reflects this uneasy balance, with the asset trading just under $88,000 at the time of writing, up about 1% on the day and week, but still nearly 20% lower over three months. Volatility has stayed compressed, with a 24-hour range between $87,000 and $88,000, while the past week saw swings between $85,000 and just over $90,000. Relative to the broader market, Bitcoin’s moves have been muted, with liquidity-driven wicks outweighing trend-following flows. On-Chain Signals Hint at Exhaustion, Not Panic Beneath the weak sentiment, on-chain data paints a more nuanced picture. XWIN noted that whale exchange inflows over the past 30 days sit near cycle lows, while Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is still falling, a sign that long-term holders are slowing their selling. At the same time, there appears to be a fair amount of caution, with spending from very old Bitcoin cohorts ticking higher, a pattern sometimes seen near major turning points. Network activity also remains soft, suggesting demand has not yet returned in force. According to the XWIN assessment, the current market tension is being reflected in sentiment gauges, particularly the Fear and Greed Index, which is in “Extreme Fear” at 24, while DeFi borrowing has dropped sharply since August, pointing to reduced leverage. Nonetheless, stablecoin supply has climbed to a record near $310 billion, signaling large pools of sidelined capital. With equities and gold both at record highs and January rate expectations tilted toward a pause, macro conditions are not overtly hostile. For crypto, however, XWIN suggested that the next move still hinges on ETF flows and post-expiry options dynamics. Until those shifts, the market may stay fragile, even as signs of seller fatigue quietly build beneath the surface.

Why Price Could Crash To $80,000",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-christmas-rally-80000/,"It’s the holiday season, and Bitcoin (BTC) is trading downwards after plunging toward the $87,000 region. Although the cryptocurrency has struggled for months, failing to reclaim key resistance levels, a crypto analyst believes Bitcoin could still stage a major Christmas rally . As the analyst outlines a potential roadmap for this projected upswing, he cautions that a further price crash to $80,000, or even lower, remains a strong possibility. Bitcoin Risks Crash To $80,000 Crypto analyst RBswingtrader shared a Bitcoin market outlook on X the day before Christmas, outlining multiple scenarios that could determine whether the cryptocurrency resumes an upward trend or faces further downside . The analyst noted that smart money is currently buying Bitcoin in a new zone and also cautioned that a final price crash, potentially driven by market manipulation , could occur before a trend reversal. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could still decline to a fresh local low around $80,000 before strong buyers enter the market. The analyst stressed the importance of patience, viewing this potential dip as part of a broader accumulation strategy. He shared a chart highlighting BTC trading under a declining orange Moving Average (MA) after a sharp selloff from the $108,519 resistance zone. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency’s price had previously failed at the upper range and rolled over into a strong downtrend that has persisted for weeks . RBswingtrader further pinpointed a clear Elliott Wave structure on the BTC chart, with waves labeled from one through five, followed by an ABC corrective pattern . Wave 3 accelerated Bitcoin’s selloff, while Wave 5 appears to be developing, with downside targets still open. Multiple key support levels were also highlighted, including $87,106, $86,169, and $83,986. The analyst warned that a deeper breakdown from these support levels could open the door to a potential crash toward $80,427, with an extended lower target near $74,185 if Bitcoin’s selling pressure intensifies. He also plotted multiple Fibonacci retracement levels that align with the lower support zones for the BTC price. Notably, the volume data at the bottom of the chart indicates a large accumulation trend through December. Increased trading activity supports the view that large players are taking advantage of dips and building positions despite Bitcoin’s weak price action. Is A Christmas Rally Still Possible For BTC? In RBswingtrader’s chart, a potential Christmas rally for Bitcoin was illustrated with an upward projection targeting the $108,519 region if the price recovers from its current lows. The chart indicated that growing accumulation volume this December and the Bullish Divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) could support upward momentum. RBswingtrader also noted that reclaiming key technical levels, including the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement near $96,690-$96,836, could support Bitcoin’s potential upward move.

As we go into the year, new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): Could Be Looking At Very Positive Year XRP ETFs have seen impressive inflows despite the “dead” price action in the market. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs recorded $1.13B in net inflows, with steady demand over the past 33 days. These funds have outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, holding positive momentum even while broader market conditions remain volatile. Add in the constant ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically strong chart, and 2026 could be shaping up to be a very interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Dogecoin And Shiba Inu: Memecoins Potential Revival? I know memecoins look mostly dead right now and hope feels pretty thin across the board. But for Shiba specifically, there is something big on the horizon. The team is planning a major network upgrade that would add privacy to the chain. That is a big deal, especially with privacy becoming one of the hottest topics in crypto right now. Source: SHIBUSD / TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling to build momentum as Christmas approaches, with market sentiment looking increasingly indecisive. The memecoin is down about 1.7% over the last 24 hours, trading in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of price action points to a dull, low-energy market, with SHIB currently sitting near the lower end of that range. For this bounce to mean anything, price needs to break above $0.00000800 and hold it to confirm a bullish shift. If it fails to do so, SHIB could slide back toward a new low, marked by the red projection, which is the same area where buyers stepped in last time. Dogecoin is in a similar spot, and there still looks like there is room for more downside before the next real move higher kicks in. Price just lost the $0.13 support, and that opens the door for a drop toward the $0.09 area. That would mean roughly a 31% downside move from here in the short term. The RSI is not helping the bull case either. It has been stuck below the 14-day moving average and the midline for weeks now, which is a clear sign that bearish momentum is still in control and sellers are dictating the price action. Bitcoin Hyper Is Building While Alts Chop Sideways While most altcoins are stuck grinding lower and sentiment feels drained, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite. This is usually how early cycle winners start forming, not during euphoric rallies, but during boredom, doubt, and sideways markets. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself for the next phase of the market, where capital rotates out of lagging majors and into projects with clear narratives and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost never waits for perfect charts, it happens while most traders are still distracted by short term weakness in names like XRP, DOGE, and SHIB. The project has already raised more than $29M, showing strong conviction from early participants even while the broader market struggles to find direction. On top of that, staking rewards hovering around 39% APY give holders a reason to sit tight and accumulate rather than chase quick flips. Historically, the biggest breakouts come from projects that were built quietly during consolidation phases like this. While the crowd waits for confirmation candles on altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper is laying its foundation. If 2026 really does shape up to be a bullish year, the projects accumulated during this low-interest phase are often the ones that move first and hardest.

Tech companies say these tools could transform how games get made. Leading research teams at Google DeepMind and a billion-dollar startup called World Labs, started by AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, are developing what they call “world models.” These are AI systems that can understand and recreate physical spaces, and experts think they’ll shake up the gaming business. Shlomi Fruchter helps lead DeepMind’s Genie 3 project , which builds these world models. He said game-making is going through major changes. “Creating software and games in particular is changing a lot, and I expect it to change, maybe entirely, over the next few years,” Fruchter explained to the Financial Times. He thinks the technology will help people who make games work faster and better, opening up new possibilities that don’t exist right now. But he doesn’t expect it to completely take over current methods. Other AI companies like Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia are testing these world models for robots and self-driving cars. However, the gaming world offers quicker opportunities for profit. Research firm Newzoo expects the gaming sector to bring in close to $190 billion this year. AI is already changing how studios work Game makers already use AI tools to design backgrounds and create characters. Back in May, Epic Games and Disney added an AI-powered Darth Vader to the game Fortnite. They built this Star Wars character using technology from Google and ElevenLabs, making him an interactive character that players could engage with. Alexander Vaschenko runs Game Gears studio, where AI has sped up work on titles like Aliens vs Zombies: Invasion by four times. “Based on my professional experience, I firmly believe that both the video game and film industries will soon be unable to function without AI,” Vaschenko said. AI firms believe newer, stronger world models will push more game companies to adopt this technology. These models can build 3D interactive spaces just from written descriptions. World Labs released a model called Marble last month. Another company, Runway, which partners with game studios, put out its first world model in December. Li said this technology will affect major game engines like Unity and Epic’s Unreal. “This is all up for disruption,” she stated, adding that simulation gaming engines need upgrades. Looking ahead, AI experts say regular players will be able to design their own game worlds. Developers won’t need pricey software or special training to make content. Eric Xing, who leads the Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi, explained the impact. “Now a gamer in front of this world model can put themselves into a virtual world,” Xing said. “That makes the game industry very different from today, because producing a personalised game is now a straightforward process.” Workers raise concerns about job security Not everyone sees this as progress. Critics worry AI will cost jobs for developers and artists, and flood games with cheap, low-quality content that people call “slop.” Six video game worker unions across Europe spoke out against AI use in their field this month. They said companies are forcing these tools on workers even though they make working conditions worse. Those who support AI use say it could lower costs, boost creativity, and prevent worker exhaustion. This matters in an industry where top games, called triple-A titles, can take multiple years and more than $1 billion to finish. Alexandre Moufarek at DeepMind used to work as an associate producer at French game company Ubisoft. He hopes world models will give developers room to “find the fun” and “try new ideas and take risks again.” “Often, that’s the time that’s missing at the end of the production. Christmas is coming, and you need to release the game, and you just don’t have time to polish the things that you wanted [or] debug things correctly,” Moufarek said. “The more we put those models in the hands of creatives, I’m sure we are going to discover new ways of working that we haven’t even anticipated yet.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|DeepMind,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:35:00

A Critical 1% Allocation Threshold Is Near for This $0.035 Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-for-q1-2026-a-critical-1-allocation-threshold-is-near-for-this-0-035-altcoin/,"In any market cycle there comes that short time, when positioning is more important than headlines. News Breaks do not necessarily cause price movements. They tend to shift once expectations change silently as a result of tightening of supply. This is normally when long term narratives emerge, long before the broader interest comes. Currently, numerous traders looking in crypto news and wondering what crypto to purchase are keeping an eye on one particular DeFi crypto. This is not due to hype but structural threshold is actually being met. After this has been closed, the set up changes. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto bank that is involved in lending and borrowing. In its simplest form, the protocol will enable users to deposit assets and get yield, and borrowers receive liquidity through collateral locking. This results in a usage cycle which can be multiplied with the increase in demand. As an illustration, a user is able to input stable assets in the protocol and receive mtTokens in their turn. These mtTokens are the position provided and the growth of value as the interests of the borrowers are earned. In this design, rather than using short term trading, the longer holding is used as a reward of actual activity. Borrowing side In the borrowing side, the user is able to get access to liquidity by pledging their assets based on specified rules. The interest rates and collateral requirements are designed in such a way that there is lesser uncertainty. It is this kind of system that renders the lending protocols relevant in the long run. The next V1 launch is an important event. V1 is where development is changed to live use. This is the point of transition between preparation and execution of the protocol, according to the official updates. Investor Base and Funding Growth The participation has increased and it is one of the most evident messages in the enquiry of Mutuum Finance. It has already raised more than $19.4M and has more than 18,500 holders in its portfolio. The fact that these figures came into being did not occur instantly. The steady growth has not been abrupt. This tends to single out accumulation and not speculation in the short term. Several of them have remained during various stages and this implies that they have faith in the roadmap and do not change direction. The token was initiated at a very low level on initial stages and is currently priced at $0.035. This is about an increment of 250% of the initial price. This increase did not happen in a single instance. It was preceded by a demand and diminishing supply. Supply and Distribution Signals and Access Signals The maximum supply of MUTM is 4B of tokens. 1.82B tokens or 45.5% of total MUTM supply is distributed through the presale phases. Quite a considerable part of such tokens has already been sold, and what remains is very scarce indeed. Behavior usually shifts when, at this point, there is tightening of supply. Customers will make decisions at a quicker pace and price increments will increase. This is the reason why the current stage is under strict monitoring. There is the 24 hour leaderboard that is an additional revelation. It also follows regular attendance rather than sporadic attendance. This is mostly indicative of persistent interest and not single purchases. Demand is increased with support of card payment as well. The more accessible it is, the more participation tends to occur, particularly among the users coming in and not via one of the traditional crypto channels. Security Reviews Any DeFi crypto will be primarily concerned with security. Mutuum Finance has already passed a CertiK scan with a score of 90/100. This is a critical background check that most investors, when dealing with a new cryptocurrency, would want to check. Besides CertiK, the protocol was being reviewed by Halborn Security . There is an active program of a $50K bug bounty program which allows outsourcing and testing to be done and issues found before full scale use. In addition to security, the roadmap contains intentions of a protocol supported stablecoin. Non-specialized assets will be able to add to the daily use and will decrease volatility in lending systems. Integrations with oracle are also scheduled and it helps in ensuring that collateral and interest are calculated accurately. These aspects are not short term characteristics. They provide long term supporting infrastructure layers. The reason Why Phase 6 Is Generating Urgency Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. This implies that only a very low percentage will be left at the prevailing price. Recent action Boasts of a $100k whale allocation that is frequent when institutional players can expect a transitional spot. Once a phase is closed, prices tend to come up. That is why the existing threshold is important. It is the last window before the circumstances transform. This step can be the determining element to individuals seeking the potential best crypto to purchase today. When the access is over, the market situation becomes not one of access, but scarcity. By Q1 2026, Mutuum Finance is going towards a stage where supply is constrained, infrastructure is prepared and usage is near. Such a combination is what is making it gain momentum as the best crypto to watch in the next cycle.

This is a big moment for our team and the WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started,” the company wrote. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., created USD1 earlier this year after Trump took back the White House, saying simply that “this one is for the retail users.” USD1 market cap has surpassed $3B. This is a big moment for our team and WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started. 🦅☝️📈 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) December 25, 2025 The so-called stable token first broke past the $1 billion mark in April, less than a month after it went live. From the beginning, the project called itself a tool for real-time crypto payments, pushing to build strong relationships with retail users and major U.S. exchanges. WLFI partnered with Coinbase and FalconX, setting up distribution channels to get USD1 into more wallets. It’s also trying to take over Solana’s stablecoin turf by teaming up with meme coin project Bonk and Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium. WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said , “This is just the beginning, we are building the future of finance driven by real world adoption of USD1.” Binance connects USD1 to its trading ecosystem The sudden jump in value followed Binance introducing a Booster Program tied to USD1. Users who hold the stablecoin on the exchange now get up to 20% APR through flexible earn products. Binance also confirmed it would swap all collateral backing its Binance-peg BUSD (B-Token) into USD1, at a 1:1 rate. This move embeds USD1 deeper into the exchange’s collateral system, effectively replacing BUSD in some areas. That’s not all. The stablecoin is also tied to bigger financial deals. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based MGX used USD1 to complete a $2 billion investment in Binance. This payment came just before President Trump granted a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, who co-founded Binance. At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported speculation that CZ may have used his influence to boost WLFI ahead of the pardon. Binance U.S. denied any coordination and claimed its listings of WLFI and USD1 were just “purely business decisions.” Despite that, Trump’s involvement and the WLFI-Binance link drew fire from Democrats. Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed to this connection while fighting against the GENIUS Act, which was later passed into law. Bitcoin flash crash reveals issues with USD1 trading pair Meanwhile, earlier this morning, the BTC/USD1 trading pair on Binance experienced a flash crash, briefly dragging Bitcoin down to $24,000 for a few seconds. The price then bounced above $87,000 before stabilizing, according to data gotten from the world’s largest exchange. Other pairs like BTC/USDT weren’t affected, but the incident exposed how fragile newer trading pairs can be when liquidity dries up. The crash came from a microstructure failure. There weren’t enough buy or sell orders near the current market price. On thin pairs, one aggressive order or a missing bid can wipe through the order book and cause a sharp drop. Once new bids enter or the order clears, the price jumps back up. Binance confirmed it was limited to the BTC/USD1 spot pair only. This kind of thing happens when a trading pair lacks depth. A shallow book means even one big trade can move prices way off course, even if just for a moment. USD1 may be scaling fast, but its liquidity structure still has holes that need to be watched.

56363569,https://cryptonews.com/?p=467844,1766700201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56363569.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana, Cardano by the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-cardano-by-the-end-of-2026/,"Chinese AI model DeepSeek, often called a serious rival to ChatGPT, just dropped a fresh set of price predictions for XRP, Cardano, and Solana as 2025 heads into its final week. According to the model, all three coins are entering a high-volatility window, with the potential for sharp moves in either direction before the year wraps up. The outlook is based on a mix of macro conditions, fundamentals, and technical signals. Below is a breakdown of DeepSeek AI two possible scenarios, showing both the bullish and bearish price paths it sees for each asset through the end of December. Ripple (XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts A Run Toward $6 Going Into The New Year DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Ripple’s XRP going into 2026 targets $4.50 to $6.00. The bullish case assumes a few big things go right: clear regulation after the SEC case, wider adoption of Ripple’s ODL for cross-border payments, and deeper involvement in CBDC projects. If all that lines up, DeepSeek thinks XRP could jump more than 80% and push into the $3 to $5 range. On the flip side, the bearish scenario is pretty rough. DeepSeek warns that if selling pressure ramps up and sentiment turns ugly, XRP could slide hard from around $1.86 down toward $1.00. That would be a massive drop and shows just how volatile things could get if the market flips negative. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. The recent launch of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. could bring in a new wave of institutional money, even during the slower holiday period. We have seen this playbook before with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where demand built quietly before bigger moves followed. With more ETF approvals likely in the coming months, the odds are rising that 2026 turns into a breakout year for XRP. For investors accumulating at current levels, the risk-reward could end up looking very attractive. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek Expects Solana Is Ready For 300% Jump DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 targets $275 to $350. Solana remains the coin of the cycle. DeepSeek AI predicts Solana could supercharge and lead scalable consumer applications, with ecosystem growth and rising institutional adoption potentially driving a 300% breakout by early 2026. If that fails, the bear case is not much worse than current conditions, with DeepSeek projecting a drop toward the $80-$95 support zone. There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI, which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. Cardano (ADA): Deepseek Says Its Finally Going Back Above The Dollar Mark? DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Cardano ADA going into 2026 targets $0.85 to $1.20. This hinges on Cardano actually delivering. A smooth rollout of the Chang hard fork would unlock on-chain governance and the community treasury, while real-world utility projects would finally prove the peer-reviewed approach works at scale. But if those pieces stall or disappoint, sentiment could flip fast and send the price back toward the $0.25–$0.28 bear case zone. To confirm a bullish rebound, ADA needs to break and hold above the $0.36 level in the short term. If it does, the next clear resistance sits at $0.38, where price has already failed twice over the past week. A move down toward the $0.30 zone is still possible if this level fails to break. The RSI is around 40 and not yet oversold, which leaves room for that scenario to play out. As long as the previous low near $0.27 is not broken, the bullish setup remains possible heading into the new year. Deepseek Best Choice Could Quietly Be Maxi Doge While DeepSeek is laying out extreme bull and bear cases for XRP, Solana, and Cardano, some traders are skipping the predictions altogether and focusing on where momentum is already quietly building. That is exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a pure high-beta memecoin play for the next cycle, built for the kind of volatility DeepSeek is warning about. When majors chop and sentiment stays divided, capital often rotates into aggressive meme narratives that do not need perfect macro conditions to move. The project has already raised over $4.28M, which is a strong signal considering how cautious the market has been lately. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting at a massive 71% APY , giving early holders a real incentive to lock in and wait rather than chase short-term price swings. While AI models argue whether SOL goes to $300 or XRP drops to $1, Maxi Doge is doing what early memecoin winners usually do, building quietly, attracting committed capital, and setting the stage before the broader market wakes up. If 2026 really does turn into the high-volatility year many expect, the tokens with strong communities, simple narratives, and aggressive tokenomics tend to outperform everything else. Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one of those plays. Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The change applies to platinum contracts PT2606, PT2608, PT2610, PT2612 and palladium contracts PD2606, PD2608, PD2610, PD2612, according to the exchange. Platinum prices hit an all-time high last week at $2,377.50 before pulling back, then later traded 2.4% lower at $2,220.44. Palladium fell even harder, dropping more than 9% to $1,683.58 after touching its highest level in three years earlier in the session. Both metals remain sharply higher on the year. Platinum is up about 145%, while palladium has gained more than 85%. Chinese spot and futures markets for precious metals have also traded at persistent premiums compared with London and COMEX prices, which have held even as global prices rallied. Silver surge and fund losses are the basis of China’s current market stress The GFEX decision landed as silver trading in China turned chaotic. Shanghai silver prices hit a record $80 per ounce, pushing year-to-date gains above 150%. Traders have pointed to a shortage of physical silver inside China. Globally, spot silver hovered near $72 per ounce, extending a rally that has lifted prices more than 120% in 2025. On Wednesday, spot silver reached $72.70, putting it on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Gold has surged by 60% year-to-date . China’s only pure-play silver fund, the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF, dropped by its maximum daily limit of 10% on Thursday. The fall ended a rapid rally that had triggered repeated warnings from the fund manager. The fund had risen nearly 220% this year, far outpacing the roughly 128% gain in Shanghai silver futures. By Wednesday, the premium over the fund’s underlying silver contracts stood at nearly 62%, up from 7% at the start of the month. After three straight days of hitting its 10% daily upside limit, the firm cut Class C subscription limits to 100 yuan from 500 yuan, effective December 26.

This came as the analyst also suggested that the altcoin may be forming a bottom in preparation for the next leg to the upside. Analyst Shares Why This Chart Is Interesting For The XRP Price In an X post, Steph highlighted the 3-week XRP price chart, stating that it was “interesting” for one reason. He revealed that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 0.00 on the 3-week timeframe, which is extremely rare and has only happened once before, which was the 2022 bear market bottom. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why This Changes Everything For XRP In The Long Term Steph further explained that on such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted, which is a positive for the XRP price. The analyst added that this means that momentum to the downside has dried up, although he warned that this doesn’t mean that price must instantly reverse. Steph noted that the last time this signal appeared, the XRP price entered a long accumulation phase before the next major move higher. As such, the analyst claimed that this again suggests that the downside risk is structurally limited and that long-term holders are absorbing supply rather than distributing. He further remarked that these signals tend to mark cycle lows rather than short-term trades. The XRP ETFs also mark a positive for the XRP price as these funds maintain their inflows streak. These funds have recorded daily inflows since the Canary’s fund launched on November 13. As a result, they now boast net assets of over $1.1 billion, even as XRP continues to see significant demand from institutional investors. XRP Remains Below Key Levels In an X post, CryptoXLarge stated that on the weekly chart, the XRP price remains below the descending trendline around the 8 to 21 EMA levels. He further remarked that this week, the price is attempting to break below the key support zone around $1.95, which aligns with the Fib 0.5 level and the 89-week EMA, which is a support that has held throughout the year. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing CryptoXLarge stated that a weekly close below this level could increase the probability of a move toward the $1.60 support, which is the Fib 0.618. Meanwhile, a weekly close above $1.95 may boost buying interest, which could trigger a relief XRP price rally toward $2.30 and then $2.70. Crypto analyst Crypto King also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that a reclaim of $1.98 could eventually send the altcoin to as high as $3.66. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.87, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

56365429,648586,1766703627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56365429.jpeg,"XRP Is At Its Best Potential Recovery Level Since 2022, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-best-potential-recovery-level/,"A crypto analyst has raised concerns about XRP’s underperformance , citing the cryptocurrency’s prolonged consolidation at lower price levels and its failure to reclaim former highs. Despite these struggles, the analyst notes that the altcoin is still positioned around its best potential recovery level since 2022. He suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a price rally , potentially paving the way for a recovery to new levels. XRP Approaches Strongest Recovery Zone Since 2022 Skipper, a crypto market expert on X, has released a new XRP update outlining the cryptocurrency’s potential recovery . He stated that the token has struggled in recent weeks, remaining stuck in a prolonged slump, marked by low trading activity and minimal price movement. Despite this sluggish performance, the analyst highlighted that the altcoin is now near its best potential recovery level since 2022. Skipper explained that the most significant factor supporting this recovery potential is the decline in bubble risk . According to his chart analysis, XRP’s bubble risk is now at one of its lowest points in years, indicating that excessive speculation and risky bets have largely been removed from the market. He stated that this cleanup makes a sudden price crash far less likely and establishes a more stable foundation for a recovery. The analyst made it clear that a low bubble risk does not guarantee an immediate price rally for XRP. Instead, he explained that this low-risk environment often creates the ideal conditions for a market bottom to form. Skipper also commented on its current dynamics, highlighting that conditions currently favor buyers waiting on the sidelines, as sellers are not aggressively driving prices lower. The analyst referenced historical performance, noting that the altcoin has often delivered stronger returns following extended periods of quiet price action. Another key point highlighted by the analyst is that when fewer traders are actively committed to XRP, price action becomes more responsive to positive developments. Under such conditions, factors such as improved liquidity or heightened network usage can exert a stronger influence on XRP, increasing its potential for a recovery. The analyst further stressed that a low bubble risk should not be confused with a promise of short-term gains. He stated that a surge should not be expected tomorrow or next week. However, he highlighted that the cryptocurrency is no longer sitting in a danger zone. Analyst Sets XRP Next Upside Target At $2.58 In another XRP update, market analyst Crypto King has stated that the cryptocurrency is holding firm above a critical support area around $1.85. He emphasized that a strong bounce at this support and a reclaim of the $1.98 level would signal a momentum shift for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks above this level, Crypto King predicts its next upside target is $2.58, which aligns with the Resistance 1 level on the price chart. Should bullish momentum persist, the analyst believes this could open the door to a powerful rally toward $3.18 at Resistance 2, followed by $3.66 at Resistance 3.",XRP|Altcoin|Crypto King|ripple|Skipper|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 23:00:27

They emerge through regulation, infrastructure, and the people capable of translating law into functional markets. As the United States moves closer to defining its long-awaited digital asset framework, one personnel move is drawing growing attention for its potential to reshape how capital enters and moves through crypto—particularly XRP. That move centers on Caroline Pham. A High-Impact Transition at a Critical Moment As highlighted by X Finance Bull, Caroline Pham, former Acting Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , has joined MoonPay as Chief Legal Officer. The timing is significant. WHAT @CarolineDPham DOES NEXT COULD SHIFT $XRP AND CRYPTO FLOWS FOREVER She helped save hundreds of millions in compliance costs. Now she’s in the driver’s seat of a platform @moonpay that moves $XRP and $RLUSD Repost if you trust her move pic.twitter.com/IQcGGY8xaE — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 25, 2025 Pham spent years inside the regulatory engine , most notably leading efforts to unwind layers of duplicative and costly rules left behind by early Dodd-Frank implementation. She has publicly estimated that these reforms saved market participants hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs. Her transition from regulator to infrastructure executive places that hard-earned expertise directly inside one of crypto’s most important access points. MoonPay’s Expanding Role in XRP and Stablecoins MoonPay is not a passive player in the digital asset ecosystem. As a leading fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, it enables direct access to assets like XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , which launched in December 2024. On-ramps increasingly define market behavior, especially as institutions demand compliant, low-friction entry into digital assets. With Pham guiding legal and regulatory strategy, MoonPay is positioned to anticipate regulatory expectations rather than react to them. That matters as capital flows become more selective and compliance-driven. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Structure, Rulemaking, and the 2026 Window In a video clip shared by X Finance Bull, Pham addressed the urgency surrounding U.S. market structure legislation, noting that 2026 is a decisive period. She emphasized that while Congress passes laws, agencies ultimately shape markets through rulemaking. Drawing from her experience at the CFTC, Pham warned that poorly designed rules can take decades to correct. She also stressed the importance of technical expertise within regulatory bodies, pointing out that writing durable rules requires hands-on legal precision, not political shortcuts. Her perspective reflects why implementation—not just legislation—will determine whether crypto innovation accelerates or stalls. Why XRP Is Uniquely Positioned XRP has long been designed for regulated financial environments, prioritizing liquidity efficiency and cross-border settlement. As regulatory clarity improves and compliant access points strengthen, assets aligned with institutional workflows stand to benefit disproportionately. Pham’s role at MoonPay does not guarantee policy outcomes, but it meaningfully improves the alignment between regulation and infrastructure—precisely where XRP operates best. A Structural Shift, Not a Headline Moment This development is not about short-term speculation. It is about financial plumbing. When regulatory architects move into transaction infrastructure, capital flows adjust quietly before transforming markets at scale. If executed well, this convergence could redefine how XRP—and crypto more broadly—moves through the global financial system for years to come.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $86,960.68. This movement has caught the attention of traders and investors worldwide, prompting questions about market stability and future trends. What Caused the Bitcoin Price Decline? Several factors typically influence cryptocurrency valuations. The recent Bitcoin price drop may relate to broader market corrections, regulatory news, or shifts in investor sentiment. Market analysts often point to these common triggers when explaining sudden movements in the Bitcoin price . Understanding these factors helps investors make informed decisions. However, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and prices can change rapidly based on global economic conditions and technological developments. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, consider these approaches: Review your investment strategy – Ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance Diversify your portfolio – Don’t put all your funds into one asset Stay informed – Follow reliable market analysis and news sources Avoid panic selling – Emotional decisions often lead to losses Remember that cryptocurrency investments require careful consideration and research. The current Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder of market unpredictability. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. When the Bitcoin price declines significantly, other digital assets frequently follow similar patterns. This correlation means that Bitcoin’s performance can impact entire market sectors. However, each cryptocurrency has unique fundamentals. Some may demonstrate resilience during Bitcoin downturns, while others might experience more pronounced effects. Market participants should analyze individual projects rather than making blanket assumptions based solely on the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The recent Bitcoin price movement below $87,000 highlights several important considerations for market participants. First, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, with prices capable of significant swings in short periods. Second, having a clear investment strategy becomes crucial during periods of price uncertainty. Finally, maintaining perspective helps navigate market fluctuations. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its existence, yet it has demonstrated remarkable resilience over longer timeframes. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin fall below $87,000? Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate due to various factors including market sentiment, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and trading volume changes. The specific combination influencing this particular Bitcoin price movement requires ongoing analysis. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Price drops can present buying opportunities, but they also indicate market uncertainty. Consult with financial advisors before making significant investment decisions. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels remains challenging even for experienced analysts. Cryptocurrency markets involve substantial uncertainty, and prices can move in unexpected directions based on unfolding developments. Will other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin’s decline? Historically, many cryptocurrencies have shown correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. However, individual projects may demonstrate different patterns based on their specific developments and market positions. How long do Bitcoin price corrections typically last? Correction durations vary significantly. Some last days, while others extend for weeks or months. Market conditions, news developments, and investor sentiment all influence how long price adjustments persist. Where can I track real-time Bitcoin prices? Numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and financial data platforms provide real-time price information. Always verify you’re using reputable sources for market data and analysis.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has just dropped to a worrying score of 20, firmly placing investor sentiment in the ‘extreme fear’ territory. This critical gauge, which many traders use to gauge market psychology, suggests that pessimism is currently dominating the digital asset space. But what does this extreme reading actually mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your investments? Let’s break it down. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Compiled by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents maximum fear and panic, while 100 signals unbridled greed and euphoria. The current reading of 20 is a clear warning sign that fear is the dominant force. This index matters because extreme emotions often signal potential turning points. Historically, periods of ‘extreme fear’ have sometimes preceded market recoveries, while ‘extreme greed’ has often marked market tops. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes six key market factors to generate its daily score: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume. Declining volume can indicate apathy or fear. Social Media (15%): Scans platforms like Twitter and Reddit for sentiment. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search volume for crypto-related terms. This multi-source approach helps paint a more accurate picture than any single metric could. What Does a Score of ‘Extreme Fear’ Signal for Traders? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 is a powerful contrarian indicator. For savvy investors, extreme fear can present opportunity. When the crowd is panicking and selling, asset prices often fall below their intrinsic value. However, this does not guarantee an immediate bounce. The market can remain fearful for extended periods. Therefore, this index should not be used in isolation. It is best combined with fundamental analysis (e.g., project health, adoption rates) and technical analysis (e.g., chart patterns, support levels) to make informed decisions. The key takeaway is to avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on prevailing sentiment. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market with the Fear & Greed Index How can you use this information? First, recognize that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Here are some practical steps: Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Extreme fear periods can be good times to systematically accumulate assets at lower prices. Re-evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation still matches your personal risk appetite during volatile times. Avoid Panic Selling: Selling into extreme fear often locks in losses. Review your investment thesis instead. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Monitor the index as part of a balanced news diet, but don’t let hourly fluctuations dictate your strategy. Remember, the goal is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful—a principle famously echoed by Warren Buffett. Conclusion: Beyond the Fear and Greed Cycle The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 20 is a stark reminder of the market’s cyclical nature. While it highlights significant short-term anxiety, long-term cryptocurrency adoption continues on its own trajectory. For investors, this moment underscores the importance of discipline, research, and a strategy that can withstand emotional extremes. By understanding the sentiment behind the numbers, you can make more rational decisions regardless of whether the index screams fear or whispers greed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? You can view the live index and its historical data on the website Alternative.me. Many popular cryptocurrency news and data platforms also feature it. Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index been accurate in the past? It has been a reliable contrarian indicator at major market extremes. For example, it showed extreme greed near the all-time highs in late 2021 and extreme fear during major sell-offs like in 2018 and March 2020. However, it is not a perfect timing tool. Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? Not necessarily. Extreme fear can indicate a potential buying zone, but it is not a standalone ‘buy’ signal. Always conduct your own research on the asset’s fundamentals and the overall market structure before investing. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily. The data is compiled once per day, usually in the morning (UTC). Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While the index’s components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin (through dominance and volatility), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Can the index remain in ‘extreme fear’ for a long time? Yes. Sentiment can be stuck in fear or greed for weeks or even months, as seen in prolonged bear markets or bull runs. The index measures current sentiment, not future price direction. Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

Today marks a historic moment as a staggering $23.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire. This unprecedented volume, reported by Deribit, shatters previous records and places immense focus on potential price volatility. For every trader and investor, understanding the mechanics and implications of this event is crucial. What Does This Record-Breaking Bitcoin Options Expiry Mean? To grasp the scale, this $23.347 billion expiry dwarfs last year’s peak of $14.3 billion. Essentially, a massive number of contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price are reaching their deadline. This convergence creates a focal point for market forces, often leading to increased trading activity and price discovery around the expiry time. Concurrently, $3.7 billion in Ethereum options will also expire. However, the spotlight remains firmly on the Bitcoin options market due to its sheer size. The key metrics to watch are the put/call ratio and the max pain price, which offer clues about market sentiment and potential price pressure points. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain Let’s break down the complex jargon into simple terms. The current data reveals two critical numbers: Put/Call Ratio (0.35 for BTC): This measures the volume of put options (bets on price dropping) versus call options (bets on price rising). A ratio below 1, like 0.35, indicates far more call options exist. This suggests a bullish bias among options traders leading into this expiry. Max Pain Price ($95,000 for BTC): This is the price at which the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, causing the most financial ‘pain’ to options buyers. It often acts as a theoretical magnet for the spot price as expiry approaches. How Could This Impact the Bitcoin Price? The immediate question for every investor is: will this cause a pump or a dump? The low put/call ratio implies many traders hold calls betting on higher prices. If Bitcoin’s price is below their strike prices at expiry, those calls become worthless. This dynamic can lead to increased selling pressure from market makers who hedged their positions. However, the high max pain price of $95,000 sits significantly above current levels. This creates a complex tug-of-war. While the bullish options bias is clear, the path of least resistance for maximum financial impact on options holders might pull the price. Therefore, traders should brace for potential volatility as large positions are closed or rolled over. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating such events requires a strategy. Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on expiry data. Consider these points: Monitor Liquidity: Watch for unusual volume spikes around the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiry time on Deribit and other major exchanges. Context is Key: This Bitcoin options expiry occurs within broader market trends. Assess overall sentiment, ETF flows, and macroeconomic factors. Risk Management First: Ensure your positions are protected with stop-losses. Expiry events can amplify normal market movements. In conclusion, today’s record Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While the bullish skew in options positioning is evident, the high max pain price introduces uncertainty. The ultimate outcome will depend on the interplay between these derivatives and the underlying spot market forces. Staying informed and disciplined is your best defense against unexpected volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin options? A1: Bitcoin options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. Q2: Why is a $23.3B options expiry significant? A2: It represents the largest single expiry of Bitcoin options in history. This massive volume can influence market maker hedging activity, liquidity, and short-term price volatility as positions are settled. Q3: What is a put/call ratio of 0.35? A3: A ratio of 0.35 means there are only 35 put contracts for every 100 call contracts. This indicates a strong majority of options traders are positioned for a price increase, reflecting bullish sentiment. Q4: What happens at the ‘max pain price’? A4: The max pain price ($95,000) is where the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized. It’s a theoretical level, but price often gravitates towards it near expiry due to the hedging actions of large institutions. Q5: Should I change my investment strategy because of this? A5: Not necessarily. While it’s critical to be aware of such events, long-term investors should focus on fundamentals. Short-term traders, however, should be prepared for potential volatility and manage risk accordingly. Found this analysis of the record Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

Net outflows on Christmas Eve reached a little over $175 million. That was part of a string of weak sessions: total net outflows for the prior five trading days added close to $826 million. Since December 15, every trading day closed with net selling except December 17, which drew inflows of $457 million. Institutional Outflows Market participants pointed to routine year-end moves as a major factor. Reports have disclosed that tax-loss harvesting — where traders sell positions to realize losses for tax purposes — has been heavy this month. One trader on X, using the name Alek, said most selling is tied to tax reasons and may fade within a week. Traders also flagged a record options expiry on Friday as a force that can sap appetite for risk ahead of large settlements. Pressure In US Trading Hours Data showed downside was strongest during US trading sessions. The Coinbase Premium — a measure comparing Coinbase’s BTC/USD price to Binance’s BTC/USDT — spent much of December below zero, signaling weaker buying in the US market. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows summed up the flow pattern, saying the US had become the biggest seller while Asia played the role of the main buyer. That split can limit how high Bitcoin holds during rallies if US demand doesn’t return. Liquidity Inactive Other traders contend that negative ETF flow numbers don’t mean the cycle is over. Based on reports shared on social channels, the path back usually goes price first, flows then. Price finds a base and then flows flatten, before fresh inflows appear. In this view, current liquidity looks inactive rather than broken. That leaves room for a bounce once seasonal selling subsides. Since early November, the 30-day moving average of US spot ETF net flows has stayed negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means that, on average, more capital has been leaving these ETFs than entering them for several weeks in a row. This is important because ETFs are… pic.twitter.com/qR1bMQNqxe — BitBull (@AkaBull_) December 24, 2025 On-Chain Signals On-chain metrics offer some comfort. Long-term holders are not rushing to sell at once. Realized gains show some profit-taking, but not the kind of extreme that marks a terminal peak. That pattern fits the idea that selling is being absorbed by other hands. If selling is near exhaustion, larger buyers could step in when ETFs turn neutral or positive. Outlook For The Coming Months Investors will watch ETF flows closely after the holidays. If flows move toward neutral, price could stabilize and then climb without needing huge new demand. The mix of tax selling and options-related positioning suggests some of the current weakness may be temporary. Still, traders should expect choppy moves while US buyers remain sidelined.

This collaboration aims to provide sophisticated asset management services, merging traditional financial expertise with digital asset innovation. For investors watching the crypto space, this partnership is a clear indicator of the maturing landscape in South Korea and beyond. What Does the Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU Mean? The core of this agreement is a strategic alliance. Korea Investment & Securities, a major traditional financial player, will join forces with Bithumb, a powerhouse in the Korean crypto market. Their goal is to develop and offer customized asset management solutions. This means clients could soon access hybrid portfolios that seamlessly blend conventional stocks and bonds with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This partnership is significant because it directly addresses a key demand: professional management of crypto assets. Many investors are interested in digital currencies but lack the time or expertise to manage them actively. Through this MOU, the two firms plan to create structured products and advisory services that bridge this gap. Why Is This Collaboration a Game-Changer? This partnership is more than just a business deal; it’s a validation of the crypto asset class. When a established securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities enters the arena, it brings legitimacy, rigorous risk management frameworks, and a vast client network. For Bithumb, it provides deeper access to traditional investors who have been cautious about entering the crypto market directly. The benefits for potential clients are substantial: Professional Guidance: Access to managed portfolios that combine traditional and digital assets. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the compliance and custodial expertise of a major securities firm. Simplified Access: A one-stop-shop for diversified investment strategies. Regulatory Confidence: Collaboration may help navigate the evolving regulatory environment more effectively. What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? Despite the exciting potential, the road ahead isn’t without hurdles. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea remains complex and is subject to change. Integrating the fast-paced, innovative world of crypto with the slower, highly regulated processes of traditional finance will require careful navigation. Furthermore, they must build products that truly meet client needs. This involves educating a traditionally conservative investor base about the risks and opportunities of crypto assets. Success will depend on their ability to create transparent, trustworthy, and high-performing solutions that stand out in a competitive market. What’s the Future of Such Institutional Partnerships? The Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU is likely a precursor to more collaborations. As cryptocurrency becomes an unavoidable part of the global financial system, traditional institutions are seeking safe and compliant entry points. We can expect to see more securities firms, banks, and asset managers forming similar alliances with regulated crypto exchanges. This trend points toward a future where digital assets are fully integrated into mainstream finance. For the everyday investor, it means more options, better protection, and professional management for their crypto holdings. It’s a crucial step in moving the market from speculative trading to long-term, strategic asset allocation. Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward The partnership between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb is a powerful signal of institutional adoption. It demonstrates a clear shift from viewing cryptocurrencies as a niche novelty to recognizing them as a legitimate component of a modern investment portfolio. This MOU has the potential to unlock new capital, improve market stability, and offer investors a safer, more guided path into the digital asset ecosystem. The collaboration’s success will be closely watched as a blueprint for future integration between traditional and decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the MOU between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb? A1: The primary goal is to collaborate on developing and providing customized asset management services that include both traditional financial products and cryptocurrencies. Q2: How will this partnership benefit average investors? A2: Investors may gain access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios that include crypto assets, along with the security and expertise of a major traditional securities firm. Q3: Does this mean Korea Investment & Securities is launching a crypto exchange? A3: No. The firm is partnering with the existing exchange, Bithumb, to create asset management products and services, not to operate its own trading platform. Q4: Is my money safer if I invest through this new service? A4: While any investment carries risk, the involvement of a regulated securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities suggests a strong focus on compliance, custody, and risk management frameworks that may enhance security compared to using an exchange alone. Q5: When will these new asset management services be available? A5: The announcement is for an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), which is an agreement to collaborate. Specific products and their launch dates have not yet been disclosed and will likely follow further development and regulatory review. Q6: Could this partnership influence crypto regulations in South Korea? A6: Potentially, yes. High-profile collaborations between traditional finance and crypto entities can encourage clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks by demonstrating serious, compliant business models.

The Altcoin Season Index has dipped to a mere 16, down from 17 just yesterday. This crucial metric suggests we are firmly in the grip of a Bitcoin-dominated market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Understanding this index is vital for navigating the volatile crypto seas. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? Simply put, the Altcoin Season Index is a thermometer for the crypto market’s risk appetite. Created by CoinMarketCap, it measures whether conditions favor altcoins or Bitcoin. The index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin’s performance. A score closer to 100 signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where most altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Conversely, a low score like 16 indicates a strong ‘Bitcoin season.’ Why Has the Altcoin Season Index Crashed to 16? The current low reading of the Altcoin Season Index is a clear symptom of broader market dynamics. Typically, when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising, and macroeconomic uncertainty is high, capital flows into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. This often comes at the expense of smaller altcoins. Several factors contribute to this trend: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors are prioritizing assets seen as less risky. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market share often increases during cautious periods. Liquidity Preference: Traders exit smaller altcoins for the easier entry and exit of Bitcoin. Therefore, the index acts as a confirmation tool, showing that the current environment is challenging for altcoin growth relative to the market leader. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? This isn’t just a number to glance at; it’s a strategic tool. A low Altcoin Season Index score suggests a specific market phase. Here’s how savvy investors might interpret it: For Accumulation: A low index can signal a potential buying opportunity for strong altcoin projects at discounted prices, though timing is crucial. For Portfolio Balance: It may be a reminder to ensure your portfolio isn’t overexposed to high-risk altcoins during a Bitcoin season. For Patience: It sets realistic expectations, indicating that broad altcoin rallies may not be imminent until the index trends upward. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator based on 90-day performance. It confirms a trend; it doesn’t predict an immediate reversal. When Will the Next Altcoin Season Begin? The million-dollar question. Historically, an altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, pushing the Altcoin Season Index above 75. For a sustained shift, we often need: A period of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Positive developments in blockchain technology and adoption. Improved overall investor sentiment and risk appetite. Watching for a consistent rise in the Altcoin Season Index from these lows can be one of the first signs that capital is rotating back into altcoins. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Tide The Altcoin Season Index at 16 delivers a clear, data-driven message: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For investors, this isn’t necessarily a time for panic but for perspective and preparation. By understanding what this metric reveals about market structure and sentiment, you can make more informed decisions—whether that means fortifying your core holdings or strategically planning your next altcoin entry. Keep a close watch on this index; its climb back up will be the early whisper of the next altcoin awakening. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that scores from 1 to 100. It measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score above 75 suggests an ‘altcoin season.’ Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to review your portfolio’s risk, consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects, and ensure you have a balanced strategy. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q4: Can the index predict the exact start of an altcoin season? A4: No, it is a lagging indicator. It confirms a trend that is already in place. A sustained move above 75 confirms an altcoin season has been occurring, but it doesn’t forecast the exact day it will begin. Q5: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A5: You can find the Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website, usually within their market research or data tools sections. Q6: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A6: It uses the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization but excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to focus on volatile, independent assets.

This New Altcoin Has Already Surged 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cheap-crypto-for-q1-2025-this-new-altcoin-has-already-surged-250/,"Each market cycle has an element of tokens that move very silently and most people are not aware of this until they realize. Price action can be first triggered many years before the general market takes action. Whenever a trend gains visibility, a considerable portion of the initial growth is lost. That is why most investors, who follow the news in the crypto-market and ask themselves, what crypto to buy now, have to be more concerned with the assets that are new. A good example of a new crypto that is following this trend is making recent headlines following a powerful move that took place in the absence of significant hype. Whether this stage is too early is the question many are asking; it is not why it moved. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is being built Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto that is being developed based on lending and borrowing. The protocol has two fundamental market structures that can cater to various user requirements. In the P2C market, assets are provided by the users into distribution pools. They, in their turn, are rewarded with mtTokens. These mtTokens increase due to repayment of interest by borrowers. As an illustration, a user providing stable assets has the opportunity to hold mtTokens and observe their increase in value with time. The model promotes long term possession or utilization rather than rapid trading. The P2P market involves borrowing that is made directly between users. Borrowers are able to select between fixed and variable rates, according to the situation in the market. There are strict LTV regulations on collateral. In case of collateral value that becomes lower than the requirement, liquidations become automatic. This puts the system on board and minimizes risk on the spur of the moment. Over $19M are already collected and the number of the holders has increased to over 18,500. These figures are important since its growth has been consistent. This is a good indication that there is aggregation as opposed to short term speculation. The next important step is V1, when the protocol can pass to live usage. Phase Progression and MUTM Price The price of MUTM at present is $0.035 and this is in presale Phase 6. The maximum supply is 4B tokens. Out of this value, it was assigned to early distribution and this corresponds to 45.5% and accounts to approximately 1.82B tokens. A great portion of these tokens already has been sold. The token has risen by up to 250% of the initial phase because of demand. It was not a single move toward this increase. It was gradual in phase by phase development. Phase 1 participants early on would yield a growth of about 500% the amount they entered at the official launch price of $0.06. The price of each token will go up, and the succeeding phase will see MUTM go up by almost 20%. This is why timing matters. Phases become more costly to access as their level increases, and the supply narrows. This is a structure of interest to people who seek the most advantageous cheap crypto to purchase. There are price steps built in the system rather than being arbitrary. Reviews and Risk Controls Any DeFi crypto and, in particular, lending protocols require security. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit which assists in verifying the token structure and contract logic. Moreover, Halborn Security has conducted the protocol design and risk structure. There is also a bug bounty program of $50K. This will open up the system to external researchers to test and report as pre preliminary adoption. Such layers diminish doubt and will contribute to the creation of trust in the participants having a long period of involvement. Definite collateral requirements, liquidations, and security review of third parties and so on will provide a more solid base. The Reason Why Investor Urgency is on The Increase There is heightened activity among the investors because of tightening of the allocation. The 24 hour leaderboard follows regular engagement as opposed to a single time purchase. This is usually an indication of increased user interest which intends to remain active. Being an Ethereum based protocol, Mutuum Finance is setting itself ahead of Q1 2026 with infrastructure, security, and usage skewed. To most observers of leading cryptocurrencies and those engaged in a question of which crypto one should invest in, this stage defines more of positioning and less speculation. It is this increasing price supply ratio and an imminent V1 launch that makes MUTM more and more popular as a next-big cryptocurrency that should be looked at.

While headlines scream about market corrections, seasoned analysts point to underlying metrics that tell a different, more reassuring story. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be a temporary adjustment rather than the start of a major downturn, according to key on-chain data. Let’s explore why long-term investor behavior suggests strength, not weakness, in the market’s foundation. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About This Bitcoin Correction? Crypto analyst Arab Chain, in a recent CryptoQuant contribution, provides crucial insight. The analyst highlights that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—which tracks the movement of older, long-held coins—remains at moderate levels. This is a vital signal. Why? Because during genuine market tops, we typically see this metric spike as veteran investors cash out en masse. The current data shows no such aggressive selling from long-term holders. Furthermore, the Supply-Adjusted CDD is stable and far from the extreme levels witnessed at past bull market peaks. This combination strongly indicates that the recent Bitcoin correction was not triggered by a mass exodus of the most committed investors. Their coins are staying put, reflecting enduring confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. If Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling, What’s Causing the Dip? So, what’s behind the price pullback if the foundational holders are steadfast? The analysis points to two primary, short-term factors: Slowing Momentum: After a strong rally, markets often need to consolidate. This breather allows overheated conditions to cool and builds a healthier base for the next move. Weakening Liquidity: Shifts in macro liquidity or temporary outflows from short-term speculative traders can create downward pressure without altering the core bullish thesis. In essence, this looks like a routine market cleanse. It shakes out weak hands and resets leverage, all while the most significant cohort—the long-term believers—holds firm. This creates a potentially powerful setup for patient investors. Why Should You See This Bitcoin Correction as an Opportunity? History shows that periods of stability among long-term holders during price dips have often preceded strong rebounds. Their inactivity is a vote of confidence. When the ‘smart money’ isn’t fleeing, it suggests the asset’s fundamental story remains intact. For investors, this environment offers distinct advantages: Reduced Emotional Noise: Understanding the metric-driven reality helps avoid panic-driven decisions. Strategic Entry Points: Temporary corrections can provide better valuation opportunities compared to buying at peak FOMO. Market Health Check: Stable holder metrics act as a diagnostic tool, separating healthy pullbacks from unhealthy breakdowns. Therefore, viewing this phase through the lens of holder behavior transforms it from a threat into a potential strategic window. The current Bitcoin correction is more about market mechanics than a loss of faith. What’s the Bottom Line for Investors? The compelling takeaway is that on-chain data provides a deeper narrative than price charts alone. While volatility is inherent to crypto, the behavior of long-term holders serves as a critical anchor. Their current stability suggests this Bitcoin correction is a temporary phenomenon within a larger, ongoing cycle. For those with a long-term perspective, these moments test conviction but also reward it. In conclusion, the market’s foundation appears solid despite the surface-level turbulence. The dip, driven by momentum and liquidity shifts rather than core investor capitulation, may represent a moment of clarity. By focusing on holder metrics over headlines, investors can navigate volatility with greater confidence and purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) and why is it important? A: Coin Days Destroyed measures the movement of coins that have been held for a long time. A high CDD suggests long-term holders are selling, which can signal a market top. A moderate CDD, like now, suggests they are holding, indicating underlying strength. Q: How long might this Bitcoin correction last? A> Corrections are difficult to time precisely. However, if the cause is short-term liquidity and momentum issues—as the data suggests—it could be resolved relatively quickly compared to corrections driven by fundamental breakdowns. Q: Should I buy Bitcoin during a correction? A> This is a personal investment decision. The data suggests the sell-off is not driven by long-term holders, which is a positive sign. However, always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: What other metrics should I watch besides CDD? A> Key metrics include Exchange Net Flow (to see if coins are moving to sell), Miner Reserves, and the MVRV Ratio. Together, they provide a fuller picture of market sentiment and potential pressure points. Q: Could this analysis be wrong and the correction deepen? A> All market analysis involves probability, not certainty. While on-chain data is a powerful tool, external macro shocks or unforeseen events can always impact prices. The data suggests a temporary dip is more likely, but risk always exists. Found this analysis helpful in cutting through the market noise?

MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le recently made a compelling case for a fundamental shift in perspective. Instead of obsessing over every market dip and surge, he urges investors to focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value . This isn’t just advice from any executive; it’s the guiding principle of a company that has bet billions on this very belief. Let’s explore why this mindset is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape. Why Should You Ignore Bitcoin’s Daily Drama? Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast, Phong Le offered a refreshingly calm take. He stated he is “not concerned” with Bitcoin’s short-term price movements. This stance comes from a place of deep conviction. Le describes Bitcoin as an asset with inherently unpredictable short-term action. Therefore, trying to time the market is often a futile exercise. Instead, he advocates for a “systematic and mathematical approach.” This means judging the asset by its fundamental properties and potential over years and decades, not by its performance over days and weeks. The daily charts are just noise; the true signal is in the long-term trajectory. The Bullish Case for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value So, what builds this long-term conviction? Le highlights two transformative shifts creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s future. Government Sentiment is Warming: Le emphasized that the U.S. government is “more favorable toward BTC than ever before.” This evolving regulatory clarity, though gradual, reduces uncertainty and paves the way for broader integration. Institutional Floodgates Are Opening: Perhaps the most significant signal is the competitive entry of traditional financial giants. When banks and asset managers start offering Bitcoin products, it validates the asset class and unlocks trillions in institutional capital. These factors aren’t about tomorrow’s price. They are structural changes that reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term value as a decentralized, scarce digital asset entering the mainstream financial system. How Can You Adopt a Long-Term Bitcoin Strategy? Shifting your mindset is the first step. Here are actionable insights to build a strategy that mirrors this philosophy. Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This systematic approach involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. It automates the process and removes emotional, short-term decision-making. Secure Your Holdings: Long-term holding, or “HODLing,” requires robust security. Use hardware wallets for significant amounts and enable all available security features on exchanges. Educate Yourself on Fundamentals: Understand the core value propositions—decentralization, fixed supply, security, and growing network adoption. This knowledge will anchor you during volatile periods. The goal is to transition from a trader’s mentality to that of an investor. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption curve, not the fleeting sentiment on social media. What Are the Real Challenges of a Long-Term View? Adopting this perspective is simple in theory but challenging in practice. Volatility tests even the strongest convictions. Media narratives often amplify fear during downturns and greed during rallies, pushing investors toward reactive decisions. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the crypto space requires continuous learning to separate genuine innovation from hype. The key is to build a plan based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, then stick to it. Let the multi-year trend be your guide, not the hourly chart. Conclusion: Your Compass in the Crypto Storm Phong Le’s message is a vital reminder in a speculative market. The relentless focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value over short-term noise is what separates strategic investors from reactive speculators. With increasing institutional adoption and evolving regulatory landscapes, the foundational case for Bitcoin grows stronger. By adopting a disciplined, patient approach, you align yourself with these powerful macro trends. Remember, the most significant wealth in crypto has been built by those who understood the assignment: think in years, not minutes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did MicroStrategy’s CEO say about Bitcoin? MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le said investors should not be concerned with short-term Bitcoin price moves. He argues we should judge it by its long-term value and adopt a systematic investment approach. Why is a long-term view important for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile in the short term. A long-term view allows investors to focus on fundamental drivers like adoption, scarcity, and technological utility, which are better indicators of its potential value. What signals suggest a strong future for Bitcoin? Key signals include warming regulatory sentiment from governments like the U.S. and the competitive entry of major traditional financial institutions (banks, asset managers) into the cryptocurrency space. How can I practice a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy? Consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to invest consistently, use secure storage methods like hardware wallets, and continuously educate yourself on Bitcoin’s core technology and use cases. What is the biggest challenge of holding Bitcoin long-term? The primary challenge is psychological: resisting the urge to sell during sharp price drops (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or buy excessively during rapid rallies (FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out). Discipline is key. Did this perspective on Bitcoin’s long-term value help clarify your investment strategy?

On a typical afternoon, science and engineering students crowd the grounds. Badminton games run near the east gate. Inside the Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence, teams work quietly with whiteboards full of formulas and freshly painted walls while studying how the human brain processes thought. The rise of DeepSeek, an AI startup founded by alumni, gave students confidence that Chinese teams could compete directly with the world’s strongest labs. “DeepSeek showed that a Chinese team could lead in the LLM race,” said Yuyang Zhang, a PhD student in computational biology at Tsinghua. Government backing turns campus research into national priority The growing attention around Tsinghua is tied closely to Beijing’s technology (and specifically AI) agenda. President Xi Jinping, a graduate of the university, has urged private companies to help develop key technologies, with artificial intelligence at the top of that list. The government followed with tax breaks, subsidies, and policy support. Founders like Liang Wenfeng of DeepSeek raised large sums of venture capital and saw their images run alongside Xi’s in state media. Graduates from Tsinghua also hold senior AI roles at major companies such as Alibaba and ByteDance, and inside the university’s labs, researchers built an AI chip called Accel to compete with products from Nvidia. Same guys also created DrugCLIP, a system designed to speed drug discovery, and a training method known as Absolute Zero Reasoner, which allows AI models to train without human-provided data. Between 2005 and the end of 2024, Tsinghua filed 4,986 AI and machine learning patents, including more than 900 in 2024 alone, according to data from LexisNexis. The school holds more AI research papers among the 100 most cited globally than any other university.China now represents more than half of all active AI patent families worldwide. “This is a staggering shift in innovation in less than a decade, and it reflects China’s concerted drive to become an AI superpower,” said Marco Richter, senior director of IP analytics and strategy at LexisNexis. Students build new models as China widens the talent pipeline China’s AI instruction now starts in elementary schools alongside math and language, a pipeline feeds a large workforce. China produced 3.57 million STEM graduates in 2020, compared with 820,000 in the United States, based on figures from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. State media later reported that the annual number of STEM graduates reached five million. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, China’s only Turing Award winner, returned after years at Princeton, Stanford, and MIT to teach at Tsinghua. In 2023, undergraduates Guan Wang and William Chen created an AI model inspired by layered human reasoning, and it model outperformed larger systems from OpenAI and Anthropic on reasoning tests and complex Sudoku puzzles in early 2025. AI tools now appear across the Tsinghua campus, as research in many fields relies on AI models. Student competitions to build specialized agents run regularly and in September, the school launched a subsidized AI computing platform for all students, according to Bloomberg’s claims . The United States still leads in influential patents and top-performing models. Harvard and MIT rank higher on patent impact, and American institutions produced 40 notable AI models in 2024, compared with 15 from China, based on the Stanford AI Index Report. China’s share of the world’s top 2 percent AI researchers rose from 10 percent in 2019 to 26 percent in 2022, while the US share fell from 35 percent to 28 percent, based on figures from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

According to on-chain analytics, an address linked to Strong withdrew over $32 million in CBBTC and Ethereum from Aave and funneled it directly into Coinbase. This substantial Winslow Strong deposits event raises immediate questions about market sentiment and the strategies of influential players. What Does the $32.6M Winslow Strong Deposit Signal? The transaction, spotted by Lookonchain, is undeniably significant. It involved moving 307 CBBTC (worth approximately $27.03 million) and 1,900 ETH (worth around $5.6 million). Such a large-scale movement from a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to a major centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase is a classic action that analysts watch closely. Therefore, it often precedes a potential sale or a strategic repositioning of assets for liquidity. Breaking Down the Crypto Transfer: From Aave to Coinbase To understand the impact, let’s unpack the mechanics. First, the assets were withdrawn from Aave, a leading lending and borrowing protocol. This means Strong was likely earning yield on these holdings. The subsequent deposit to Coinbase, a platform designed for easy trading and fiat conversions, suggests a shift in intent. Key details of the move include: Asset Composition: A mix of Bitcoin (via CBBTC, a wrapped version) and Ethereum. Timing: The transaction occurred just eight hours before reporting, making it a very recent market event. Scale: A $32.6 million transfer is large enough to potentially influence short-term market liquidity and perception. Why Do Major Deposits Like This Matter for Crypto Markets? Movements by known entities, often called “smart money” or “whales,” serve as important barometers. When a figure with a research background like Winslow Strong makes a move, the market takes note. This specific Winslow Strong deposits action could be interpreted in several ways. It might indicate a decision to take profits, a need for fiat currency, or simply a rebalancing of a portfolio. However, it also removes assets from the DeFi ecosystem, slightly reducing the liquidity available for lending and borrowing activities there. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers While you should never blindly follow any single transaction, you can use this event to refine your own market analysis. Here’s how: Monitor Exchange Flows: Large inflows to exchanges can sometimes signal selling pressure, while outflows to private wallets suggest accumulation. Context is Key: Consider broader market conditions. Is this part of a larger trend of whales moving to exchanges? Research the Actor: Understanding Winslow Strong’s historical patterns could provide clues, though past performance is no guarantee. The Final Takeaway on This Major Crypto Movement Ultimately, the Winslow Strong deposits of $32.6M into Coinbase is a powerful reminder of the transparent yet complex nature of blockchain markets. It highlights the continuous strategic maneuvering of major holders. For the average investor, it underscores the importance of staying informed through reliable on-chain data sources and maintaining a long-term strategy that isn’t swayed by any single transaction, no matter how large. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Winslow Strong? Winslow Strong is the former head of Qualia Research, a cryptocurrency research firm. He is a known figure in the crypto analytics and investment space. What is CBBTC? CBBTC is a wrapped Bitcoin token. It represents Bitcoin on other blockchains (like Ethereum), allowing it to be used in DeFi protocols such as Aave. Why move funds from Aave to Coinbase? Moving funds from Aave (DeFi) to Coinbase (a CEX) typically makes them more readily available for trading, selling for fiat, or simply holding in a custodial wallet. It often suggests a change from an earning strategy to a liquidity or exit strategy. Does this mean Winslow Strong is selling his crypto? Not necessarily. A deposit to an exchange makes selling easier, but it doesn’t confirm a sale has occurred. He could be preparing to trade, secure the assets differently, or even use other Coinbase services. How can I track transactions like this? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Etherscan allow users to track large wallet movements and identify trends from smart money wallets. Should I be worried about this large deposit? One transaction should not dictate your investment strategy. It is a single data point. Always consider it within the wider context of market news, technical analysis, and your own financial goals. Found this analysis of the Winslow Strong deposits insightful?

Bitcoin Correlation To Nasdaq & Gold Has Changed Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Correlation that Bitcoin has to the Nasdaq and Gold . The “ Correlation ” here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about how tied together the prices of any two given assets are. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the price of one asset is responding to movements in the other by moving in the same direction. The closer the value is to 1, the stronger this relationship is. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests a negative correlation exists between the assets. That is, the two are going in the opposite directions. The extreme level for this region lies at -1. A third case also exists for the metric, where its value becomes exactly equal to zero. When this happens, the prices don’t hold any relationship with each other whatsoever. In statistics, the variables are said to be “independent” under this condition. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Correlation to Nasdaq and Gold over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Correlation indicator was at notable positive levels for both Nasdaq and Gold in mid-2025, implying the cryptocurrency was strongly bound to traditional markets. As the year went on, however, a shift began to take shape, with the indicator declining for both assets. Today, the metric is sitting at a nearly neutral level for Nasdaq, a sign that Bitcoin is now trading independently from the US stock market. The story is a bit different when it comes to Gold, however, as the Correlation has actually plummeted into the negative territory. With an indicator value of about -0.5, BTC can be considered to have a significant inverse relationship to Gold. Bitcoin is popularly thought of as the digital analogue to Gold’s “safe haven,” but given the latest Correlation, the cryptocurrency doesn’t appear to be behaving like one right now. “BTC is no longer trading like a tech stock or a safe haven,” noted the analyst. “It’s carving out its own market regime.” It now remains to be seen whether the new Correlation behavior will maintain or if the cryptocurrency will face another shift soon. BTC Price Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways since its decline at the start of the week as its price is still trading around $87,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin gold|Bitcoin Stocks|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 02:00:48

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,092.68 on the Binance USDT market. This powerful move has captured the attention of traders and investors worldwide, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. But what’s fueling this impressive rally, and is it sustainable? Let’s dive into the details behind Bitcoin’s latest price action. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? Several key factors are converging to push the BTC price to new heights. First, increased institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not only holding Bitcoin but are actively integrating it into their investment products. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are driving investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in major economies are reducing uncertainty and building confidence in the asset class. Finally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate of new supply, is creating a sense of scarcity that historically precedes major price increases. How Significant is the $88,000 BTC Price Level? Breaking above $88,000 is more than just a number; it’s a critical psychological threshold for the market. This level often acts as a key resistance point, and surpassing it can trigger a wave of automated buying from algorithmic traders. For long-term holders, it reinforces the bullish narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s digital gold thesis. However, it’s crucial to understand the market dynamics at play. The current BTC price reflects a complex interplay of: Spot Market Demand: Real buying from investors seeking to own the asset. Derivatives Activity: Futures and options trading that can amplify price movements. On-Chain Metrics: Data showing accumulation by large holders, known as whales. Global Liquidity: The overall availability of capital in the financial system. What Should Investors Consider at This BTC Price? While the surge is exhilarating, a prudent approach is essential. The volatility inherent to cryptocurrency markets means the BTC price can experience sharp corrections. Therefore, investors should base decisions on their individual risk tolerance and investment horizon, not just short-term momentum. Key considerations include portfolio diversification and having a clear strategy for both potential gains and downturns. Remember, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and the market can change direction quickly based on news or macroeconomic shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bullish BTC Price Trend Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $88,000 marks a pivotal moment, showcasing its resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. The current BTC price rally is supported by a mix of institutional interest, macroeconomic trends, and positive market structure. For the informed participant, this environment presents opportunities but also demands caution. Staying updated with reliable analysis and understanding the underlying fundamentals will be key to navigating the next phase of the market. The journey for Bitcoin continues to be a fascinating one, blending technology, finance, and a new vision for value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does BTC price mean? The BTC price refers to the current market value of one Bitcoin, quoted against a fiat currency like the US Dollar (USD) or a stablecoin like USDT. It is determined by supply and demand on global cryptocurrency exchanges. Why did the BTC price jump above $88,000? The price increase is likely due to a combination of factors including positive institutional inflows, anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving, and broader macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment timing depends entirely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. While the trend is positive, Bitcoin remains volatile. It’s generally advised to research thoroughly, consider dollar-cost averaging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Could the BTC price fall after this surge? Yes, price corrections are a normal part of any financial market, especially cryptocurrencies. Profit-taking by traders after a strong rally can lead to short-term pullbacks. Where can I track the live BTC price? You can track the live price on major cryptocurrency data websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, as well as directly on exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. How does the BTC price on Binance USDT market work? The Binance USDT market pairs Bitcoin (BTC) with Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The price shown is how much USDT is needed to buy one BTC, providing a stable quote against dollar value. Found this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

According to Bitcoin World market data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,043.34 on the Binance USDT market. This rally marks a significant milestone, capturing the attention of traders and investors worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive ascent? Let’s dive into the dynamics behind Bitcoin’s latest price action. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s powerful breakout. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to build a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their offerings, providing a layer of legitimacy and attracting new capital. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value like Bitcoin. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in key markets has also created a sustained inflow of institutional money, applying consistent upward pressure on the BTC price . Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking through the $89,000 resistance is a technically bullish signal. Traders often watch these round-number levels closely. Therefore, a sustained hold above this point could pave the way for a test of even higher thresholds. Market sentiment, as measured by various fear and greed indices, has shifted notably toward optimism. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While the trend is positive, prudent investors monitor key support levels in case of a pullback. For active traders and long-term holders alike, understanding these levels is vital: New Resistance: The $90,000 and $92,000 levels are the next major hurdles for the BTC price . Key Support: A fall below $87,000 might indicate a short-term consolidation phase. Trading Volume: High volume accompanying the rise confirms strong buyer conviction. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? This rally presents both opportunities and reminders. For investors, it reinforces the importance of having a clear strategy. Are you a day trader looking to capitalize on volatility, or a long-term believer in Bitcoin’s underlying technology? Your approach should dictate your actions. Moreover, a rising BTC price often has a ‘halo effect,’ lifting the broader altcoin market. This can create opportunities in other cryptocurrencies, but due diligence is always required. Navigating the Challenges of a Volatile Market Excitement must be tempered with caution. The very volatility that creates profit potential also carries risk. Prices can reverse quickly based on regulatory news, macroeconomic data, or shifts in global liquidity. The key is not to let fear of missing out (FOMO) drive impulsive decisions. Instead, consider dollar-cost averaging or setting clear profit-taking and stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively around the fluctuating BTC price . Conclusion: A Milestone in Bitcoin’s Journey Bitcoin’s climb above $89,000 is more than just a number; it’s a testament to its growing maturity and adoption within the global financial landscape. While short-term fluctuations are guaranteed, this milestone highlights the enduring interest and confidence in the world’s premier cryptocurrency. The journey ahead will likely see both breakthroughs and corrections, but for now, the market is celebrating a decisive victory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the BTC price jump above $89,000? A: The rally is likely driven by a combination of sustained institutional investment via ETFs, positive macroeconomic sentiment, and breaking key technical resistance levels, which triggered further buying. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at this price? A: “Too late” is subjective in crypto markets. While buying at a local high carries risk, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest regularly regardless of price, mitigating timing risk over the long term. Q3: Could the BTC price fall back down quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Profit-taking at new highs is common, which can lead to pullbacks. It’s essential to invest only what you can afford to lose and have a risk management plan. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A strong rising BTC price generally boosts investor confidence and capital inflow into the sector, benefiting many altcoins. Q5: Where can I safely track the live BTC price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price charts and market data. Q6: What’s the next major target if Bitcoin holds above $89,000? A> The next significant psychological and technical resistance levels are at $90,000 and then the all-time high region. A clean break above $89,000 with strong volume is the first step toward testing those levels. Did you find this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

A woman in her 30s now faces prison time after being convicted of laundering over 269 billion won through cryptocurrency transactions. This case highlights the growing challenges regulators face in tracking illicit crypto flows across borders and platforms. What Exactly Happened in This Cryptocurrency Laundering Case? The appeals court delivered a decisive verdict against a South Korean woman accused of orchestrating one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency laundering operations. According to News1 reports, she sold more than 260 billion won worth of cryptocurrency that authorities suspect originated from criminal activities. The scale of this operation demonstrates how cryptocurrency laundering has evolved into sophisticated, high-value criminal enterprises. The defendant reportedly connected with the cryptocurrency source through a group chat, where she was promised substantial commissions for her services. This digital meeting point shows how criminals increasingly use encrypted communication channels to arrange cryptocurrency laundering schemes away from traditional banking oversight. How Did the Cryptocurrency Laundering Operation Work? The mechanics of this cryptocurrency laundering scheme followed a pattern common in digital asset crimes but on an unprecedented scale. After acquiring the suspicious cryptocurrency, the woman executed a multi-layered laundering strategy: Initial Conversion : She sold the cryptocurrency for traditional currency Fragmentation Strategy : The funds were divided into smaller amounts Distribution Network : Money moved to hundreds of different accounts Obfuscation Layer : Multiple transactions masked the money trail This approach to cryptocurrency laundering creates significant challenges for investigators trying to follow the digital paper trail across numerous transactions and accounts. Why Is This Cryptocurrency Laundering Case Significant? This cryptocurrency laundering conviction sends a powerful message about South Korea’s commitment to fighting financial crime in the digital age. The case represents several important developments: First, it demonstrates that authorities are developing the technical expertise to trace complex cryptocurrency laundering operations. Second, the prison sentence establishes that courts take cryptocurrency crimes seriously. Third, the international community watches such cases closely as they set precedents for global cryptocurrency regulation. The sheer volume—269 billion won—makes this one of Asia’s most substantial cryptocurrency laundering cases to reach conviction. This scale indicates that criminal organizations view cryptocurrency as a viable channel for moving enormous sums while attempting to avoid detection. What Challenges Does Cryptocurrency Laundering Present? Cryptocurrency laundering presents unique obstacles for law enforcement and regulators. Unlike traditional banking systems with centralized oversight, cryptocurrency transactions can span multiple jurisdictions and platforms. The pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrency transactions further complicates investigation efforts. However, this case proves that cryptocurrency laundering leaves traces. Blockchain analysis tools have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing investigators to follow transaction patterns despite attempts at obfuscation. The conviction resulted from combining traditional financial investigation techniques with cutting-edge cryptocurrency tracking technology. How Are Governments Responding to Cryptocurrency Laundering? South Korea has implemented stringent cryptocurrency regulations in recent years, including: Real-name verification for cryptocurrency exchanges Enhanced reporting requirements for suspicious transactions International cooperation on cryptocurrency crime investigations Specialized training for financial crime units These measures aim to prevent cryptocurrency laundering while supporting legitimate innovation in the digital asset space. The successful prosecution in this cryptocurrency laundering case validates the effectiveness of these regulatory approaches. What Can We Learn From This Cryptocurrency Laundering Conviction? This cryptocurrency laundering case offers crucial insights for investors, regulators, and the general public. It underscores that cryptocurrency markets, while innovative, are not immune to criminal exploitation. The conviction demonstrates that legal systems worldwide are adapting to address cryptocurrency crimes with appropriate seriousness. For legitimate cryptocurrency users, this case highlights the importance of: Understanding regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction Using reputable, compliant cryptocurrency exchanges Maintaining proper transaction records Reporting suspicious cryptocurrency activities The prison sentence delivers a clear warning that cryptocurrency laundering carries severe consequences, regardless of the technological sophistication employed. Frequently Asked Questions What was the sentence for the cryptocurrency laundering? The appeals court sentenced the South Korean woman to prison, though the specific length wasn’t detailed in initial reports. The conviction itself represents a significant legal outcome in cryptocurrency crime prosecution. How was the cryptocurrency laundering discovered? Authorities likely detected the scheme through financial monitoring systems that flag unusual transaction patterns, combined with blockchain analysis tools that trace cryptocurrency movements across wallets and exchanges. Why is cryptocurrency attractive for money laundering? Cryptocurrency can facilitate cross-border transfers with relative speed and pseudonymity. However, as this case shows, cryptocurrency laundering leaves investigatable trails on public blockchains. What measures prevent cryptocurrency laundering? Preventive measures include Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, transaction monitoring systems, international regulatory cooperation, and blockchain surveillance tools that identify suspicious patterns. How common is cryptocurrency laundering? While exact statistics vary, cryptocurrency represents a small but growing portion of money laundering cases globally. High-profile convictions like this one demonstrate increasing enforcement effectiveness. Can cryptocurrency be completely anonymous? Most cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous rather than anonymous. While wallet addresses don’t directly identify individuals, sophisticated analysis can often connect transactions to real-world identities, especially when funds move to regulated exchanges.

This single transaction, worth a quarter of a billion dollars, is more than just a number on a screen. It represents a significant injection of liquidity and a powerful signal from within the digital asset ecosystem. But what does it actually mean when such a vast amount of stablecoin is created? Let’s dive into the implications of this whale-sized event. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC minted , we refer to the creation of new USDC stablecoin tokens. Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens when demand increases. This typically happens when individuals or institutions deposit US dollars into Circle’s reserve accounts. In return, they receive an equivalent amount of USDC on the blockchain. Therefore, a minting event of this scale strongly suggests that a substantial amount of traditional capital—$250 million worth—is being prepared to enter the crypto markets. Why Would Someone Mint 250 Million USDC? The sheer size points to institutional activity. Retail users don’t move quarters of billions. This USDC minted event likely serves one of several strategic purposes: Providing Liquidity for Trading: Exchanges or large trading firms often mint USDC to ensure sufficient stablecoin liquidity for high-volume trading pairs, facilitating smoother large trades. Preparing for Investment: A venture capital fund or institution may mint USDC to have dry powder ready for deploying into various crypto projects, token purchases, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions: Corporations use stablecoins like USDC for fast, global settlements. This mint could back a major international trade or treasury operation. Ultimately, it signals confidence and an expectation of activity. Someone is positioning a significant war chest within the crypto economy. The Ripple Effect: How a Large USDC Mint Impacts the Market Such a substantial USDC minted transaction doesn’t occur in a vacuum. It creates subtle but important ripples across the ecosystem. Primarily, it increases the overall supply of a key stablecoin, which is the lifeblood of crypto trading. More available USDC can lead to increased buying pressure on other assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum if that capital is deployed. Furthermore, it reinforces USDC’s position as a leading dollar-backed stablecoin, showcasing robust demand and institutional trust in its underlying reserves and regulatory compliance. Should Retail Investors Care About USDC Minting? You might wonder if this technical treasury activity matters to the average investor. The answer is yes, but indirectly. While you don’t need to track every mint, large-scale events like this 250 million USDC minted serve as a vital market health indicator. They are a pulse check on institutional sentiment. A flurry of minting activity can precede bullish market movements, as it shows money is poised to enter. Conversely, large-scale redemptions (burning USDC) can signal capital exiting. Therefore, understanding these flows provides context for broader market trends. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The report of 250 million USDC minted is a powerful piece of on-chain intelligence. It cuts through speculation and shows real, measurable action. This event underscores the growing maturity of crypto markets, where institutional players execute sophisticated treasury management strategies using stablecoins. For the observant investor, it’s a reminder to watch not just price charts but also the fundamental flows of capital on the blockchain. These flows often tell the story before the headlines do. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who can mint USDC? A> Only the issuer, Circle, can mint new USDC tokens. They do so upon receiving equivalent U.S. dollar deposits from verified customers into their reserve accounts. Q: Does minting USDC affect its price? A> No. USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Minting new tokens based on dollar deposits ensures the peg remains stable by fully backing the new supply. Q: Is a large USDC mint always bullish for crypto prices? A> Not always, but it is generally seen as a positive signal. It indicates capital is being positioned within the crypto ecosystem, which can lead to increased buying activity for other assets. Q: How can I track USDC minting and burning events? A> You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDC or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which report large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A> Minting is the primary creation of new tokens by the issuer. Buying is acquiring existing USDC tokens from someone else on the secondary market, like an exchange. Found this breakdown of the major USDC minted event helpful?

The Topix index is finishing 2025 with a 23% rally, despite taking hits from trade tariffs, two Bank of Japan rate hikes, and a full change in political leadership. This year’s rally has already pushed Japan past the S&P 500 in relative performance for the first time since 2022. Takaichi’s administration is funneling trillions of yen into domestic programs, with traders eyeing upside in infrastructure, construction, and energy names. Robot manufacturers are also getting attention, as the tech spotlight turns away from virtual AI toward robotics and hardware. Banks, which already had a strong 2025 due to higher interest rates, are expected to build on their gains. Takaichi’s cabinet approves ¥112 trillion fiscal package Takaichi’s fiscal package, unveiled in November, includes ¥18 trillion, or about $115 billion, in additional stimulus focused on 17 government-backed sectors, such as nuclear fusion and quantum computing. On top of the stimulus, the government approved a record ¥112 trillion ($785 billion) budget for the next fiscal year. While that’s expected to help hold up consumer spending, it also increases the strain on the country’s massive public debt. But the focus in the markets is on the cash hitting the real economy. Japan’s policymakers are using this funding to try and take the lead in technologies that are still up for grabs globally. Inflation numbers coming out of Tokyo are giving the BOJ more cover to tighten policy. The core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food, rose 2.3% in December. That’s down from 2.8% in November and also lower than economists expected. A second inflation gauge, the one the BOJ tracks most closely, removing both fuel and food, showed a 2.6% increase in December. That also eased from the prior month. The BOJ’s next policy meeting is scheduled for January 22–23, where members will update their growth and inflation projections. Just last week, the bank raised its main interest rate to 0.75%, the highest in 30 years. Ueda Kazuo, the bank’s governor, told reporters on Thursday that they are seeing “steady progress” in trying to meet the 2% inflation goal, with wage growth now backing that effort. “We’re making steady progress in durably achieving our price target,” Ueda said. Weaker yen benefits exporters while risks build at the edge The yen is finishing 2025 much weaker than predicted, giving a big lift to exporters like car companies and commodity traders. As of December 25, the yen has only climbed less than 1% against the dollar year-to-date. This is giving companies that sell abroad higher profits when their dollars come back home. Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust, said the yen is likely to stay around the 150–160 range in 2026. “The BOJ’s hikes don’t really impact the yen, as the market has already priced in two hikes a year,” he said. That view has been widely echoed among large-cap investors, who expect export-heavy sectors to keep beating the broader market next year. But not everyone is optimistic. Rie Nishihara, a strategist at JPMorgan , warned that if the yen slips too far, the boost turns into a threat. “Excessive yen depreciation” could hurt real income growth, she said, adding that 165 per dollar is the red line where it starts causing damage.

Osaka Prefecture has launched a public-private consortium that will experiment with AI Agents designed to provide clerical support and multilingual services. The prefecture will pool expertise from a consortium, which includes Google Cloud Japan, telecom provider NTT West, Microsoft Japan, and Osaka Metropolitan University. The trial will assess whether AI can streamline administrative processes accurately and independently under predefined rules. Osaka governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said the initiative moves to create “a society that is more convenient and prosperous.” In Silicon Valley AI agents are a technology to be scaled, but in Japan, the main concern is minimizing chaos through standardization. Japan’s AI agent boom Osaka prefecture’s new consortium follows a host of major household companies that are starting to embrace AI agents. Itochu Corporation, one of Japan’s largest food and drink manufacturers, and automaker Mazda are testing AI agents in autonomous payments, internal audits, as well as customer service. Japanese software testing firm SHIFT and data analytics firm TDSE are also exploring a payment ecosystem powered by autonomous AI agents. TDSE said its proof of concept seeks to initiate transactions, verify requirements, and coordinate with other systems to execute settlement without direct human intervention. In fact, a recent industry survey found that 35% of Japanese companies have already adopted AI agents in some form and 44% plan to adopt them. Japan’s corporate ambitions to develop AI agents is a largely reactionary and ‘defensive’ measure. It represents an economic acceptance of autonomous AI as a productivity tool amid a labor shortage, rural depopulation, and waning tolerance towards foreigners. Innovation hotbed? Think again. Japan isn’t trying to win a race for the biggest AI agent models. It’s taking a slower, deliberate, and more risk averse path. Tokyo-based provider of accounting software, Rakus isn’t convinced that AI can be left to do everything. Chatbots have emerged as the latest sales and customer facing tools in big tech and fintech. But the current capabilities of back-end chatbots hasn’t made life easier, according to Shinichiro Motomatsu, the company’s director and chief AI officer. “If you were to try and handle expense reimbursements entirely through a chatbot workflow it would probably turn into a hellish experience,” said Motomatsu. Their main worry is adopting a system that increases operational burdens on teams which are already at capacity. Accountability grey zone Japan wants to implement AI agents safely inside real organizations. The focus is on minimizing mistakes so as not to undermine trust. According to Rakus’s chief AI office, Japan’s approach is not a failure of imagination but a deliberate response to how organizations really work. “At each stage you need to evaluate whether the technology is genuinely helping users. If it isn’t, we shouldn’t hesitate to pull back,’” said Motomatsu. Motomatsu said that AI agents should be treated as goal driven tools as opposed to a stand alone technological goal. He believes it’s far more realistic for AI agents to serve as partially autonomous actors since accountability is a major grey area. “If something goes wrong, you can’t just simply explain that AI decided it,” said Motomatsu. “Someone in the organization must be able to take responsibility for the outcome.” Human-centric AI agents Rakus’s chief AI officer stresses that AI doesn’t eliminate the need for well designed workflows as well as checks and balances. He argues their real value lies in playing a supporting role, rather than replacing structures that make organizations function. “AI agents are not magic. They won’t eliminate the need for rules, processes, or human judgement,” said Motomatsu. Osaka prefecture’s push to adopt AI agents reflects a governance first approach taking roots across corporate Japan. It plans to formulate practical guidelines that can be replicated by local governments across Japan by the end of fiscal 2026. The prefecture aims to produce a framework that outlines clear rules regarding what AI agents are allowed to do, how their actions are monitored, and when human intervention is needed. There are also gains beyond efficiency. Hitachi’s chief AI transformation officer, Jun Yoshida suggests that AI agents can take over repetitive tasks making way for cognitive space. “If AI simply allows us to do even more work at a faster pace, that’s not necessarily progress,” he said. “What matters is how people use the space that opens up.” He describes this as “white space” which he argues can become a source of innovation, reflection and decision making. Japan is designing AI agents that address corporate problems, not showcase technological development. In a business culture that traditionally prioritize control and standardization, companies are wary of systems that obscure human judgment in mission-critical processes.

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a significant injection of liquidity that signals major activity in the digital asset space. For anyone tracking market sentiment and capital flows, understanding why this happens is crucial. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC was minted , it means new USDC stablecoin tokens were created and issued into circulation. Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens when there is sufficient demand, typically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars held in reserve. Therefore, a mint of this scale—250 million dollars’ worth—points directly to substantial incoming capital or anticipated demand within the crypto ecosystem. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? Such a large-scale mint doesn’t happen without reason. It often precedes major moves by institutional players or large trading firms, commonly called ‘whales.’ Here are the most likely scenarios behind this event: Institutional Entry: A large entity is preparing to move significant capital into cryptocurrencies. USDC offers a stable on-ramp before purchasing assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. DeFi and Trading Activity: The capital could be destined for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, yield farming, or providing liquidity, which often requires stablecoins. Market Making and Liquidity: Exchanges or market makers may need to bolster their USDC reserves to ensure smooth trading pairs and sufficient liquidity for users. Essentially, this mint acts as a precursor to action. It shows confidence and preparation for significant financial activity on the blockchain. How Does a USDC Mint Impact the Broader Market? The immediate effect of 250 million USDC being minted is an increase in available stablecoin liquidity. However, the real impact depends on what happens next. If this capital flows into Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can create buying pressure and potentially influence prices. Conversely, if it remains parked in stablecoins or moves into DeFi, it signals a focus on yield and ecosystem growth rather than direct speculation. For everyday investors, monitoring these mints provides a valuable, real-time indicator of institutional sentiment. A surge in minting can suggest that sophisticated players are gearing up for a bullish move or securing positions in a volatile market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Don’t just watch the event; understand its context. Track where the funds go using blockchain explorers. Is the USDC that was minted moving to a central exchange like Coinbase? Is it being deposited into a Compound or Aave smart contract? This follow-through data is more telling than the mint itself. Remember, while a large mint is notable, it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Always combine this data with broader market trends, news, and technical analysis before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The minting of 250 million USDC is a powerful signal of institutional movement and liquidity preparation within crypto markets. It underscores the growing role of stablecoins like USDC as the essential plumbing for the digital economy. By paying attention to these on-chain events, you gain a clearer window into the strategies of major market participants, allowing you to make more informed decisions in your own crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who exactly mints USDC? A1: USDC is minted by Circle, the regulated financial company that issues the stablecoin, through its USDC Treasury. The process is permissioned and requires compliance with financial regulations. Q2: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? A2: No, it does not cause monetary inflation. Each new USDC token is supposed to be backed 1:1 by a corresponding US dollar held in reserve, making it a fully collateralized stablecoin. Q3: How can I track where the minted USDC goes? A3: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan. By looking up the transaction hash from the Whale Alert report or the treasury address, you can follow subsequent transfers to exchanges or DeFi protocols. Q4: Is a large USDC mint always a bullish sign? A4: Not always. While it often indicates incoming capital, it can also be for risk management or to meet redemption demands. The key is to observe the subsequent flow of the funds. Q5: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A5: “Minting” refers to the creation of new tokens by the issuer. “Buying” USDC is what users do on an exchange after those tokens are in circulation. A large mint supplies the tokens that are then bought. Q6: Can anyone mint USDC? A6: No. Only Circle and its licensed partners can mint and redeem USDC directly, following strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.

Daily trading volume is looking pretty strong at $24.3 billion and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency is still sitting pretty at top spot in market capitalisation, valued at roughly $1.78 trillion. There’s 19.97 million Bitcoin in circulation out of a total supply of 21 million. Despite the bounce, overall market mood is still pretty cautious. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is stuck at 27, firmly in ‘fear’ territory, and the Altcoin Season Index is down to 16, which means Bitcoin Season is well and truly in the driving seat. It’s clear that everyone is playing it safe, focusing on just a few choice assets and keeping a tight rein on risk. Market Sentiment is all About Bitcoin Over Altcoins The overall crypto market cap is sitting at $2.99 trillion and daily volume is around $73 billion. Ethereum (ETH) is trading round $2,970, while Solana (SOL) is just nudging over $123 – not exactly a glowing endorsement of the altcoins. It looks like everyone’s still spooked by Bitcoin’s relative strength. Just a few key indicators show how the market is feeling: Bitcoin’s dominance is still pretty high because loads of people are avoiding the high-risk assets. Historically, when investors are feeling genuinely fearful it’s a great chance to start buying up some stocks. Institutional investors and all those fancy ETFs remain convinced that the smart money should be on BTC. That explains why, at the moment, Bitcoin is just cruising along while the altcoins are really struggling to get any momentum. Bitcoin Technical Chart is Sort of Looking The Business On the 4 hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction has stabilised at around $89,200 after bouncing back from that mid-December low of $83,800. The price action is currently playing out within a pretty well-defined descending channel from the $94,600 peak, but you can see that momentum is definitely starting to come back. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin has also reclaimed the $88,000 to $88,600 pivot zone, where the 50-EMA is at $88,000 and the 100-EMA is at $88,600 – and now that zone is actually helping to prop the price up. That’s a nice technical sign. The recent candle patterns are looking pretty solid, with solid green closes followed by a bit of a consolidation afterwards – that suggests people are genuinely interested in buying, not just panicking out of a short squeeze. That makes the chart start to look a bit like a descending triangle – there are higher intraday lows and the RSI is back up at about 60. And, you know, there’s no obvious bearish divergence to upset the applecart. Overall momentum is coming back without getting too carried away, and there’s no obvious bearish divergences to knock that recovery. Key Levels and What’s Next If we look at TradingView’s predictions, a confirmed break above $90,500 would suddenly open up some very promising prospects: $92,650 as the next major resistance Even a retest of $94,600 might be in the cards, where the sellers last took control But if you do get a failure to hold $88,000, that could trigger a bit of a pullback towards $86,300, with another opportunity to buy in again near $83,800. Right now, the technical outlook is suggesting that it could be a good time to buy – let’s keep our eye out for a clean break above $88,000 – that would really give the crypto market a bit of a confidence boost. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.39 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012112 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

To make matters worse, that difference is the biggest miss since 2018, and Beijing’s decision came right after the offshore yuan dipped below ¥7 per dollar on Thursday for the first time since September 2024. Naturally, that freaked out a few folks in Beijing who’ve been pushing for a stronger yuan to please trading partners, but not so strong that foreign money floods in like crazy. On the same day, the National Bureau of Statistics dropped another number: China’s economy in 2024 was worth 134.8 trillion yuan ($19.23 trillion). That’s ¥101.8 billion lower than their earlier figure. It’s not great timing. Back in July, officials had said the economy would top ¥140 trillion in 2025. China was forced to react when offshore yuan gained surprising strength Even though the fix was set weaker than market estimates, it was still higher than the previous day’s fix. At the same time, the offshore yuan is around ¥7.0024 as of press time, showing strength from the past week’s trading sessions. Meanwhile, analysts from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are betting that the yuan will push well past ¥7 per dollar in 2026. Inside China, local economists and even ex-central bank officials have started pushing for a stronger currency too. Their logic is a firmer yuan helps move the economy away from its dependence on exports and eases up on trade fights with other countries. But China ’s central bank doesn’t seem interested in making any fast decisions, as even Wall Street traders have noticed that state-owned banks have been buying dollars here and there to cool things down. That, along with this unexpected fix, looks like an effort to stop speculators from getting too confident. A research note from China Minsheng Bank said that the yuan could get a bit of support early next year thanks to seasonal foreign exchange flows, and analysts Wen Bin and Li Xin said the central bank’s strategy is clearly set up to keep gains modest. With the U.S. dollar not falling as quickly, the analysts expect the yuan to stay under ¥6.9 per dollar for now. Get seen where it counts.

With market sentiment shifting and new projects emerging, timing and early access are becoming critical for strategic investors. In the evolving landscape of digital assets, established names like Litecoin and Tron show resilience and utility, while projects like APEMARS present rare early‑stage entry points investors can’t ignore. Litecoin and Tron have captured attention with robust networks and steady adoption, even amid market pressures. But for those seeking explosive upside with structured early access, the best altcoin picks include not just established tokens but also emerging opportunities like APEMARS ($APRZ). Its live whitelist presents a chance to secure allocation before wider exposure, combining community growth with powerful reward mechanics. APEMARS: Claim Early Access Before the Next Altcoin Breakout APEMARS ($APRZ) represents one of the most compelling opportunities for early‑stage participation in the altcoin space. Designed to reward long‑term engagement, it blends utility and community focus with a strategic upcoming crypto presale structure. Whitelist access is the key entry point. With the whitelist now live, early participants can position themselves for Stage 1 access, the lowest-price window of the entire presale, and Stage 1 only lasts one week before the price steps up and token allocation per dollar shrinks. For anyone aiming to capture the earliest upside runway, the whitelist is where that positioning begins. Two standout features distinguish APEMARS from typical token launches: 63% APY staking, which enables investors to earn significant passive yield on held tokens, and an integrated referral system that rewards community growth by incentivizing participants who introduce new holders. This combination doesn’t just add perks; it creates dynamic participation pathways that turn simple token holding into an interactive, growth‑driven experience. The staking mechanism allows early supporters to compound rewards, while the referral program effectively multiplies network effects, rewarding both referrers and referees as APEMARS grows. With the whitelist live, you’re getting insider access to strong utility before public market pricing locks in. 3000x Gains Potential: APEMARS Stage 1 Investment Scenario APEMARS launched Stage 1 tokens at $0.00001699 with a projected listing price of $0.0055, a price that implies up to 32,269% ROI if the project follows through on roadmap expectations. That means potential 3000x‑plus gains for early entry participants. If you invest $1,500 at Stage 1, you would receive approximately 88.3 million $APRZ tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.0055, that position could surge to approximately $485,000, not including staking rewards or referral bonuses, potentially transforming early faith into extraordinary returns. With the APEMARS whitelist open for a limited time and presale stages coming soon (and often closing early), acting now ensures access to the most favorable entry point before prices rise further. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the APEMARS whitelist is easy and takes minutes. Simply visit the official APEMARS website, head to the “Whitelist Now” section, enter your email, and submit. You’ll receive a confirmation email; verify it to secure your Stage 1 allocation. Join the whitelist today to grab $APRZ at Stage 1 pricing! Litecoin: Steady Network Strength Meets Ongoing Development Legacy in Motion: Litecoin’s Position in a Changing Market ATH: $413 | ATL: $1.15 Litecoin remains one of the enduring names in the altcoin world. Built as a lighter, faster alternative to Bitcoin, it has attracted steady adoption over time. According to recent market coverage, sentiment around Litecoin continues to evolve as developers focus on broader ecosystem integration and user‑friendly enhancements. This resilience through market cycles highlights why Litecoin is considered among the best altcoin picks for diversified, long‑term portfolios. While Litecoin doesn’t offer a presale gap like APEMARS, its proven track record and ongoing development efforts offer context for why early access opportunities, like APEMARS’s live whitelist, are so compelling. Participants in the APEMARS upcoming presale can capture a structured, early‑stage position while traditional altcoins like Litecoin continue to demonstrate utility and stability. Tron: Resilient Network with DeFi and Stablecoin Momentum Tron Continues to Impress with Activity and DeFi Integration ATH: $0.17 | ATL: $0.001 According to the best crypto to buy now , Tron has maintained strong on‑chain activity, driven by stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance integrations. Recent market reports highlight that Tron’s network remains a hub for stablecoin transfers, DApps, and cross‑chain engagement, underscoring its role as a practical altcoin in heavy use. Such sustained network engagement reinforces Tron’s utility and relevance despite broader market volatility. For investors weighing the best altcoin picks, Tron exemplifies a project with mature use cases and ecosystem depth. Yet, even as Tron delivers on real‑world utility, upcoming presales like APEMARS offer an additional dimension, structured access with growth incentives that traditional networks don’t typically provide. Conclusion: Finding the best altcoin picks in a Dynamic Market APEMARS, Litecoin, and Tron each offer unique perspectives on what investors consider worthwhile in the altcoin space. Litecoin brings a legacy of performance and adoption; Tron showcases ecosystem resilience and utility; APEMARS delivers structured early‑stage access with a live whitelist and growth mechanics designed for participation and reward. For those exploring the best crypto to join now, APEMARS combines early entry, staking rewards, referral incentives, and Stage 1 scarcity, features that add up to a persuasive case for early involvement. While established altcoins like Litecoin and Tron continue delivering network utility, early positioning through APEMARS’s live whitelist could capture growth that traditional exposure alone cannot. Don’t wait, the APEMARS whitelist is live and moving fast.

56374206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254337,1766718911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive BTC Short Squeeze Obliterates $116M in Crypto Futures,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-short-squeeze-futures-liquidations/,"BitcoinWorld Explosive BTC Short Squeeze Obliterates $116M in Crypto Futures The cryptocurrency market just experienced a classic and powerful squeeze play. A fierce BTC short squeeze erupted over a 24-hour period, violently reversing bearish bets and triggering a staggering $116 million in forced liquidations across perpetual futures markets. This event serves as a stark reminder of the high-stakes, leveraged nature of crypto trading. What Exactly Was This BTC Short Squeeze? Simply put, a short squeeze occurs when an asset’s price rises rapidly. Traders who had borrowed and sold Bitcoin, betting its price would fall (short sellers), are forced to buy it back to close their positions and limit losses. This wave of buying fuels further price increases, creating a feedback loop that squeezes more short sellers out of the market. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price acted as the catalyst for this domino effect. The $116M Liquidation Breakdown: Who Got Hit? The data reveals a clear narrative of pain concentrated on specific assets and trade directions. Let’s break down the numbers: Bitcoin (BTC): The epicenter. A massive $75.68 million was liquidated, with a overwhelming 75.95% coming from short positions. This confirms the BTC short squeeze was the primary driver. Ethereum (ETH): Saw $29.66 million in liquidations. Interestingly, here long positions (bets on price increases) made up 52.48% of the losses, suggesting a mixed or corrective move for ETH. Solana (SOL): Experienced $10.75 million in liquidations, with a crushing 82.5% from long positions. This indicates SOL’s price movement may have disappointed bullish traders during this period. Why Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Matter? Forced liquidations are not just numbers on a screen; they have real market impacts. Firstly, they can amplify price volatility. The cascade of automatic sell orders from long liquidations (or buy orders from short liquidations) can push prices further in their current direction. Secondly, they represent significant capital being wiped from the market, which can affect trader sentiment and liquidity. Understanding these events is crucial for assessing market health and risk. How Can Traders Navigate Such Volatility? While squeezes and liquidations are inherent risks, traders can adopt strategies to manage exposure. Using sensible leverage, setting stop-loss orders (while being aware of potential slippage), and diversifying beyond highly correlated assets are fundamental practices. Moreover, monitoring aggregate liquidation levels across exchanges can provide early warning signs of excessive leverage building up in the market, potentially foreshadowing a sharp move. The Bottom Line on the Market Shakeout The recent BTC short squeeze and its accompanying liquidation wave delivered a brutal lesson in market mechanics. It highlighted the dangers of over-leverage, especially during periods of low liquidity or ahead of major price catalysts. For the broader market, such events can help reset excessive speculation, creating a healthier foundation. However, they also underscore the need for robust risk management for every participant, from retail traders to institutions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What causes a short squeeze in crypto? A: A short squeeze is caused by a rapid price increase in an asset. This forces traders who bet on a price drop (short sellers) to buy back the asset to close their losing positions, which drives the price up even further. Q: Are liquidations bad for the crypto market? A: They have mixed effects. While they cause losses for specific traders and increase short-term volatility, liquidations can also flush out excessive leverage and over-speculation, which may lead to a more stable market afterward. Q: How can I avoid getting liquidated? A> To avoid liquidation, use lower leverage, fund your margin account sufficiently, set prudent stop-loss orders, and avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged trade. Q: Did this event only affect Bitcoin? A: No. While the BTC short squeeze was the main event, it caused ripples across the market. Major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also saw significant liquidations, though the bias (long vs. short) differed based on their individual price action. Q: Where can I track futures liquidation data? A> Several crypto analytics websites like Coinglass, Bybit, and Binance provide real-time and historical data on futures market liquidations across various exchanges. Q: Is a short squeeze always followed by a price drop? A> Not necessarily. While a squeeze can exhaust buying pressure and lead to a pullback, the subsequent price direction depends on broader market fundamentals, sentiment, and new catalysts. It doesn’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Found this breakdown of the explosive BTC short squeeze helpful?

With several Asia Pacific exchanges shut for the holiday, investors took cues from the last full session, when MSCI’s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.35%. Crypto traders framed the quieter tape as a liquidity story as much as a macro one. Gabriel Selby, head of research at CF Benchmarks, said Bitcoin remained pinned under a key level as markets drift into the seasonal lull. “Bitcoin has struggled to break above the $90k level during a busy schedule of macroeconomic data releases, and price action appears to be forming a bearish wedge with downside risk,” he said. “As we head into the holiday period, trading volumes are following their usual seasonal lull, which typically reinforces the choppy, high-resistance environment currently observed.” Market snapshot Bitcoin : $89,127, up 1.5% Ether : $2,965, up 0.6% XRP : $1.87, up 0.00% Total crypto market cap: $3.07 trillion, up 0.9% Wall Street Records Fuel Year-End Risk Appetite Wall Street’s late-week run kept the mood constructive. The Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record highs on Wednesday in a holiday-shortened session, with the Dow up 0.60% and the S&P 500 up 0.32%. Silver rose to a record and gold traded near an all-time high https://t.co/3PXxMDYg4W — Bloomberg (@business) December 25, 2025 That same rally fed the seasonal narrative traders keep calling the Santa Claus rally, a window that often draws positioning flows into the final sessions of the year. In commodities, silver continued to shine after pushing deeper into uncharted territory earlier in the week. Spot silver rose to an all-time high of $74.89 on Friday, driven by strong industrial demand and a supply deficit that has left the market tighter than traders expected. Defensive Trades Boost Gold And Silver Analysts tied the move to heavy usage in solar panels, electric vehicles and data centres, while mine supply struggled to keep up, and the metal also drew fresh safe haven demand as geopolitical risks flared. Gold tracked the same flight to hedges, trading around $4,480 an ounce after setting a record above $4,500, with traders still pricing in a friendlier rate outlook next year. Geopolitics kept the backdrop tense, with Washington’s pressure on Venezuelan oil flows feeding a wider bid for defensive assets.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced its pivotal support for the Frax Share (FXS) token swap and rebrand to Frax (FRAX). This move is a significant endorsement of the Frax Finance ecosystem’s evolution. If you hold FXS tokens on Binance, understanding the timeline and process for this FXS token swap is absolutely critical to managing your assets smoothly. What is the Binance FXS Token Swap All About? In simple terms, Frax Finance is upgrading and consolidating its token system. The existing FXS token, which represents governance and utility within the Frax protocol, is being rebranded and migrated to a new token called FRAX. This isn’t a typical fork or airdrop; it’s a direct, one-to-one replacement. Binance’s involvement means they will handle the technical complexities for users holding FXS on their platform, making the transition seamless for millions. Your Action Plan: Critical Dates for the Swap To ensure you don’t face any trading interruptions, mark these key dates in your calendar. Binance has provided a clear schedule for the FXS token swap process. January 13, 3:00 a.m. UTC: All existing FXS spot trading pairs (like FXS/USDT) will be delisted and trading will stop. January 13, 3:30 a.m. UTC: Deposits and withdrawals for the old FXS token will be suspended. Do not send FXS to Binance after this time. January 15, 7:00 a.m. UTC: Deposits for the new FRAX token will open. January 15, 8:00 a.m. UTC: Trading for the new FRAX/USDT spot trading pair will officially launch. The most important detail? All existing FXS balances on Binance will be automatically migrated to FRAX at a 1:1 ratio . You don’t need to manually request the FXS token swap ; Binance will do it for you. Why is This FRAX Rebrand a Big Deal for Crypto? This move is more than just a name change. It represents Frax Finance’s ambition to streamline its identity and strengthen its position in the competitive stablecoin market. FRAX aims to be a more recognizable and unified brand, potentially improving its liquidity and integration across decentralized and centralized finance platforms. Binance’s support lends immense credibility and ensures massive, immediate liquidity for the new token from day one of trading. What Should You Do Next? For Binance users, the process is largely hands-off. However, here are some proactive steps for peace of mind: Stop FXS Trading Before Deadline: Conclude any FXS trades well before the delisting time on January 13th. Do Not Deposit FXS: Avoid depositing FXS tokens to Binance once withdrawals are suspended on the 13th to prevent loss. Verify Your Balance: After the migration is complete around January 15th, log in to your Binance account to confirm your new FRAX balance. Explore the New Pair: With the launch of FRAX/USDT, assess the new trading dynamics and market sentiment. Conclusion: A Seamless Transition Backed by a Giant The FXS token swap to FRAX, facilitated by Binance, is a textbook example of how major exchanges can enable smooth ecosystem upgrades. By managing the technical migration, Binance removes significant risk and friction for the average holder. This collaboration highlights the growing synergy between innovative DeFi protocols and centralized exchanges, ultimately creating a more robust infrastructure for all cryptocurrency participants. The successful execution of this swap could set a precedent for future token migrations and rebrands within the industry. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Do I need to do anything to swap my FXS for FRAX on Binance? A: No. If your FXS tokens are in your Binance spot wallet, the exchange will automatically convert them to FRAX at the 1:1 ratio. No manual action is required. Q2: What happens if I send FXS to my Binance deposit address after January 13th? A: Do not do this. Deposits will be suspended, and you may permanently lose those tokens. Only deposit the new FRAX token after its deposit window opens on January 15th. Q3: Will the value of my holdings change after the swap? A: The number of tokens changes 1:1, but the market will determine the new price of FRAX. The value of your holding in USD terms will depend on FRAX’s market price post-launch. Q4: I hold FXS in my own private wallet (like MetaMask). What should I do? A: This Binance process is for tokens on their exchange. You must follow the official migration instructions provided by the Frax Finance team for tokens held in self-custody wallets. Check their official website and social channels for guidance. Q5: Will there be a new contract address for FRAX? A: Yes, the new FRAX token will have a new smart contract address. Always verify the official contract address from Frax Finance’s official channels before interacting with it on-chain. Q6: Can I trade FRAX immediately after the migration? A: Trading for the FRAX/USDT pair will begin at 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 15th, shortly after deposits open. You cannot trade it before this specified time.

The community rejected a plan to absorb the intellectual property and equity of its core developer, Aave Labs. This rejection highlights the ongoing tension between foundational development teams and the decentralized autonomous organizations they serve. Let’s break down what this Aave DAO proposal entailed and why it failed. What Was the Controversial Aave DAO Proposal? The Aave DAO proposal was a significant governance vote with two main objectives. First, it sought to formally absorb Aave Labs’ intellectual property and equity, making the developer a subsidiary of the DAO. Second, it included a clause requiring Aave Labs to transfer all profits generated from the Aave brand to the DAO treasury. This measure was introduced following community allegations that Aave Labs was privately collecting swap fees from Aave’s interface on CowSwap, a decentralized exchange aggregator. Why Did the Aave Community Vote No? The proposal ultimately failed, with 55.29% of votes cast against it. This outcome wasn’t arbitrary. Several key concerns likely influenced the community’s decision: Operational Complexity: Absorbing a full development team and its assets creates immense legal and operational burdens for a DAO. Innovation Risk: There were fears that making Aave Labs a subsidiary could stifle its agility and innovative capacity. Precedent Setting: The move could set a risky precedent for how DAOs interact with their founding entities, potentially leading to centralized control. Trust Deficit: The proposal arose from allegations of fee appropriation, indicating a trust issue that a forced merger wouldn’t necessarily solve. Therefore, the community chose to maintain a more arm’s-length, service-provider relationship with Aave Labs. What Are the Broader Implications for DeFi Governance? This vote is more than an internal Aave matter. It’s a landmark case study in DAO governance . The rejection signals that token holders are thinking critically about long-term structure, not just short-term revenue. It underscores a mature understanding that simply centralizing assets isn’t always the best path for a decentralized project. The decision preserves Aave Labs’ independence to innovate while keeping the DAO’s treasury and governance focused on protocol incentives and ecosystem growth. This balance is crucial for sustainable development in the DeFi space. What’s Next for Aave After This Proposal? So, where does Aave go from here? The failure of this Aave DAO proposal doesn’t mean the underlying issues vanish. The community and Aave Labs must now address the trust concerns transparently. Future proposals may focus on creating clearer, more equitable revenue-sharing agreements for front-end interfaces. Furthermore, this event will likely lead to more rigorous proposal frameworks and discussions about the legal boundaries between DAOs and their service providers. The path forward requires rebuilding alignment without resorting to a full absorption. In conclusion, the rejection of this Aave DAO proposal is a powerful testament to the community’s vigilance. It demonstrates a preference for sustainable, decentralized governance over a quick fix that could centralize control. The Aave ecosystem has affirmed that its strength lies in collaborative checks and balances, not in vertical integration. This decision sets a prudent precedent for other DeFi projects navigating the complex relationship between developers and decentralized communities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly was the Aave DAO proposal about? A1: The proposal aimed to have the Aave DAO absorb the intellectual property and equity of Aave Labs, its development company, and make it a subsidiary. It also required Aave Labs to send all Aave-brand profits to the DAO treasury. Q2: Why did the proposal fail? A2: It failed because 55.29% of voting participants voted against it. Concerns included added complexity, potential harm to innovation, and setting a poor governance precedent. Q3: What sparked this proposal in the first place? A3: It was introduced after allegations surfaced that Aave Labs was privately collecting swap fees generated through Aave’s interface on the CowSwap platform. Q4: Does this mean Aave Labs is acting against the DAO? A4: Not necessarily. The proposal and its failure highlight a governance dispute and a need for clearer agreements, not necessarily malicious action. The community voted to maintain a separate but aligned relationship. Q5: What does this mean for Aave token holders? A5: It shows the DAO is actively engaged in complex governance and is willing to reject proposals it deems risky. It maintains the current development structure, which the majority believes is more beneficial for long-term growth. Q6: Will there be another similar proposal? A6> While possible, the decisive rejection makes an identical proposal unlikely. Future discussions will probably focus on specific revenue-sharing terms rather than full absorption.

56374796,648612,1766719828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56374796.jpeg,Why You Should Pay Attention To XRP’s Exchange Netflows This Month,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-exchange-netflows-this-month/,"XRP’s price has spent recent weeks moving without a clear directional breakout. The price action has been mostly bearish, but activity beneath the surface is telling a more interesting story. On-chain data shows XRP leaving Binance at a rapid pace, pushing the exchange’s reserves down to around 2.66 billion XRP, the lowest level recorded this year . This movement has garnered the interest of market participants because it is not reflective of the current price action of XRP. Insights from market commentator Stellar Rippler on X help explain why investors should pay attention to the netflows. XRP Leaving Binance Means Positioning, Not Panic Exchange netflows often give a clearer picture of market intent than short-term price movements. When reserves drop consistently, it usually reflects strategic decisions by holders. This month, XRP’s netflows are flashing signals that are worth watching closely. The steady decline in Binance’s XRP reserves points to deliberate withdrawals instead of emotional reactions. According to commentary shared on X by Stellar Rippler, this type of movement does not correspond with retail panic selling. Retail-based fear typically shows up as sudden deposits to exchanges as traders rush to exit positions. What the data shows instead is a controlled and sustained reduction in available exchange liquidity. This pattern points to holders choosing custody outside exchanges, a behavior commonly associated with long-term allocations. Crypto history has shown that prolonged exchange outflows often occur when investors are confident in long-term demand , not when they anticipate a prolonged downward price action. You don’t drain liquidity before bad news. In this context, XRP’s exchange netflows suggest preparation, not speculation. Why Falling Binance Reserves Matter For Market Structure Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, meaning its XRP reserves represent the most readily available supply for a large portion of active traders. As more and more XRP continues to leave the exchange, the amount of XRP immediately available for spot trading keeps shrinking, gradually tightening liquidity even though the price has not reacted yet. Speaking of price not reacting, XRP’s price action has struggled over the past few weeks, repeatedly failing to hold above the $2.00 price level and spending most of the period trading lower around the $1.80 to $1.95 range. Despite this, the data shows that the weak price performance is largely due to broader market outflows across every crypto, not a surge in XRP-specific selling. The outflows in XRP exchange reserves are more meaningful when viewed alongside the steady inflows into Spot XRP ETFs, which are yet to record a day of net outflows since their launch. Those ETF inflows suggest institutional demand is increasing under the surface, even though it has so far been outweighed by capital leaving the wider crypto market.",XRP|binance|ripple|Spot XRP ETFs|Stellar Rippler|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 03:30:28

This decision by the third-largest U.S. exchange provides new opportunities for traders and signals a shifting competitive landscape. The announcement, made on December 23rd, means users can now trade and securely store BNB on Gemini’s regulated platform. Why Did Gemini Add BNB Now? Gemini’s decision to support BNB trading and custody comes at a pivotal time. The exchange is strategically expanding its asset offerings to meet growing investor demand. While Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, still does not list BNB, its competitor Kraken began offering the token earlier this year. Therefore, Gemini’s move positions it as a more comprehensive platform for traders seeking access to major cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This development highlights the intense competition among top U.S. exchanges. By adding BNB, Gemini directly challenges its rivals and caters to a segment of the market eager for Binance’s native token. The move could attract new users and increase trading volume on the platform. What Does This Mean for BNB and Investors? For the BNB ecosystem, gaining support from a major regulated U.S. exchange like Gemini is a vote of confidence. It enhances the token’s legitimacy and accessibility for American investors. Users now have a new, compliant on-ramp to acquire and hold BNB. For investors, the benefits are clear: Regulated Access: Trade BNB on a platform known for its regulatory compliance and security standards. Integrated Custody: Store BNB alongside other cryptocurrencies in Gemini’s insured custodial wallet. Simplified Portfolio Management: Manage a diverse crypto portfolio from a single, trusted interface. How Does This Change the U.S. Exchange Landscape? The race to list popular assets is a key battleground for crypto exchanges. Gemini adds BNB to its roster, creating a clear point of differentiation. Kraken listed BNB in April and added custody in July. Coinbase’s continued absence is notable, with industry observers often linking it to the direct competition between Coinbase and Binance globally. This three-way dynamic creates distinct choices for users. Gemini and Kraken now offer BNB services, while Coinbase does not. Consequently, traders who want exposure to BNB within a U.S.-regulated environment have two strong options. This competition ultimately benefits users through better services and more asset choices. What Are the Potential Challenges? While the listing is positive, it’s not without considerations. BNB remains closely tied to the Binance ecosystem, which has faced significant regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Gemini, known for its proactive regulatory approach, must ensure its implementation of BNB services meets all compliance standards. Furthermore, the token’s performance is still influenced by Binance’s fortunes, adding a layer of external risk for investors. Conclusion: A Calculated Step Forward Gemini’s support for BNB trading and custody is a calculated and strategic expansion. It fills a gap in the U.S. market, provides investors with more choice, and intensifies competition among top exchanges. This move underscores the ongoing maturation of the crypto industry, where access to major digital assets through regulated channels is becoming the norm. For savvy investors, it represents another tool for building a diversified and secure cryptocurrency portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can I now buy BNB on Gemini? A: Yes. As of the December 23rd announcement, Gemini supports both trading and custody services for BNB. Q: Why hasn’t Coinbase listed BNB yet? A: While not officially confirmed, widespread speculation suggests Coinbase’s hesitation is due to Binance being its main global competitor. Listing a competitor’s native token involves complex strategic and potentially regulatory considerations. Q: Is it safe to store BNB on Gemini? A: Gemini offers custodial services with insurance coverage. It is generally considered a secure platform, but as with any custodial service, you are trusting a third party with your assets. Q: What are the trading pairs for BNB on Gemini? A: The initial announcement did not specify trading pairs. Typically, new assets on U.S. exchanges first pair with the US Dollar (USD) or stablecoins like Gemini Dollar (GUSD). Check Gemini’s official trading interface for the latest pairs. Q: How does this affect BNB’s price? A: Increased accessibility through a major regulated exchange can positively influence demand, which may impact price. However, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors beyond a single listing. Q: Should I move my BNB to Gemini? A: This depends on your individual strategy. If you value the security and convenience of a regulated custodian and already use Gemini, it could be a good option. If you prefer self-custody or use other exchanges for trading, you may choose to keep your assets where they are. Found this analysis of Gemini adding BNB helpful?

Coinone, one of the country’s leading trading platforms, has officially flagged Trust Wallet Token (TWT) with an investment warning . This decisive action stems from a confirmed security vulnerability within the Trust Wallet ecosystem, raising immediate concerns about potential price instability for TWT holders. For anyone involved with this asset, understanding the details of this Coinone investment warning for TWT is now crucial. Why Did Coinone Issue This TWT Investment Warning? The core reason for the alert is a confirmed security flaw. According to Coinone’s announcement, the vulnerability was identified and validated through the Trust Wallet project’s own official communication channels. When a foundational component of a crypto service like a wallet has a weakness, it doesn’t just risk user funds—it can severely shake investor confidence. Therefore, the exchange is proactively warning users that this situation could lead to unusually high price volatility for the TWT token. Exchanges issue these warnings to protect their users from unexpected market swings triggered by such fundamental news. What Does This Mean for TWT Investors? If you hold TWT, this Coinone investment warning is a signal to pause and assess your position. An official warning from a regulated exchange is a significant event. Here are the immediate implications: Increased Scrutiny: The token will likely face heightened scrutiny from other exchanges and the broader investment community. Potential for Volatility: As Coinone stated, the primary risk is sharp, unpredictable price movements as the market reacts to the security news. Reputational Impact: Trust is paramount in crypto. A security issue in the core wallet service can impact the perceived value of its associated token. This is not necessarily a prediction of a price crash, but a clear advisory that the trading environment for TWT has become riskier and more unpredictable. How Should You Respond to a Crypto Investment Warning? Seeing an official warning against an asset you own can be alarming. However, a calm, informed response is your best defense. Follow these steps: Do Not Panic Sell: Rash decisions during volatile periods often lead to losses. Gather information first. Seek Primary Sources: Go directly to the Trust Wallet Foundation’s official announcements to understand the vulnerability’s scope and their remediation plan. Review Your Strategy: Re-evaluate your investment thesis for TWT. Does this new risk factor change your long-term outlook? Secure Your Assets: Ensure your tokens are stored securely. If you use Trust Wallet, check for any urgent updates or advisories from the team. This Coinone investment warning for TWT serves as a perfect reminder that in cryptocurrency, technical fundamentals and security are directly tied to market value. The Bigger Picture: Security and Market Stability This event highlights a critical link in the crypto world. The Coinone TWT warning isn’t about market manipulation or hype; it’s a reaction to a tangible technical risk. It shows that reputable exchanges are monitoring project health and acting to inform their users. This kind of transparency is essential for building a safer, more mature market. For the ecosystem, while painful in the short term, addressing such vulnerabilities openly is healthier than letting them fester unseen. Conclusion: Navigating Warnings with Wisdom The Coinone investment warning for TWT is a sobering example of how security events ripple through cryptocurrency markets. It underscores the importance of investing in projects with robust, audited technology and demonstrates the role exchanges play in risk communication. For investors, the key takeaway is vigilance—treat official warnings as serious risk indicators and always prioritize the security of your holdings alongside their potential returns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is the Coinone investment warning for TWT? Coinone has issued a formal notice to its users cautioning them about increased investment risk associated with the Trust Wallet Token (TWT) due to a confirmed security vulnerability in the Trust Wallet service, which may lead to high price volatility. 2. Should I immediately sell my TWT tokens? An investment warning is not an automatic sell signal. It is a recommendation to exercise high caution. You should assess the situation, read official updates from Trust Wallet, and make a decision based on your risk tolerance and updated research. 3. Where can I find the original announcement about the security vulnerability? Coinone states the vulnerability was confirmed through the Trust Wallet foundation’s official community channels, such as their Twitter/X account, Discord, or blog. Always refer to these primary sources for accurate details. 4. Will other exchanges issue a similar warning for TWT? It is possible. Other exchanges monitor such events and may take similar protective actions for their users if they perceive a significant risk to market stability or asset security. 5. Does this warning affect Trust Wallet itself, or just the TWT token? The warning specifically concerns the TWT token’s market risk. However, the root cause is a security issue within the Trust Wallet service, so users of the wallet app should also pay close attention to official guidance regarding the safety of their funds. 6. How long do such investment warnings typically last? There is no set timeframe. The warning will likely remain until Coinone determines the underlying security concern has been adequately resolved and market conditions have stabilized.

At first, the extension appeared legit, however, hackers masqueraded the code address, extracting users’ seed phrases and draining wallets. “Reports indicate that importing a seed phrase into the extension can result in immediate wallet draining,” wrote one user . Browser extensions operate with elevated access to web pages, cookies, storage, and browsing activity. When abused, they provide a near-perfect avenue for credential theft – without triggering traditional endpoint defences.

Renowned crypto analyst Ben Cowen presents a cautious outlook, suggesting the path to a new Ethereum all-time high in 2026 is fraught with significant challenges. His analysis, reported by Cointelegraph, hinges on a critical market dynamic: Ethereum’s fate remains deeply tied to Bitcoin’s cycles. Why is a New Ethereum All-Time High in 2026 Considered Unlikely? Cowen’s central thesis is straightforward. He argues that if Bitcoin has entered a bear market phase, it becomes “very difficult” for Ethereum to stage an independent, sustained rally powerful enough to smash its previous record of $4,878. This interconnectedness means Ethereum often lacks the momentum to decouple from Bitcoin’s broader market sentiment during downturns. Therefore, the analyst casts doubt on a fresh Ethereum all-time high materializing in the next couple of years. His perspective challenges the more bullish narratives, introducing a note of realism based on historical cycle patterns and dominance flows. The Bull Trap Scenario: A False Dawn for ETH? Perhaps the most compelling part of Cowen’s warning involves a potential bull trap. He suggests that even if Ethereum manages to claw its way back to its former peak, that achievement might be a mirage. Recovery to $4,878: This could happen, but Cowen views it as a probable trap for bullish investors. Sharp Reversal: Following such a recovery, he anticipates a “sharp reversal” that could send the price tumbling back toward the $2,000 support level. Investor Caution: This scenario underscores the need for vigilance, as a return to old highs doesn’t guarantee a sustained breakout. This pattern would represent a painful setback for those buying at the top, expecting a continued surge toward a new Ethereum all-time high . Is Ethereum Still the Altcoin Leader? Despite the grim forecast for a 2026 record, Cowen offers a crucial silver lining that sets Ethereum apart from the crowded altcoin field. He asserts that ETH is “the only altcoin that still has a chance of reclaiming its all-time high” in future cycles. This distinction is vital. His assessment of the broader altcoin market is far more pessimistic. He believes most other altcoins have “exhausted their momentum” in the current cycle, making it unlikely they will ever set new price records. This positions Ethereum not just as a cryptocurrency, but as the singular altcoin with enduring, long-term value proposition and recovery potential. Actionable Insights for Ethereum Investors So, what does this mean for your portfolio? Cowen’s analysis isn’t just a prediction; it’s a framework for risk management. Monitor Bitcoin: Keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s market phase. A Bitcoin bear market severely limits Ethereum’s upside potential. Beware of Quick Peaks: If ETH approaches $4,878, evaluate the strength of the rally and Bitcoin’s condition. It could be a selling opportunity, not a buying one. Long-Term Perspective: If you believe in Ethereum’s fundamentals, view potential dips toward $2,000 as strategic accumulation zones for a cycle beyond 2026. Altcoin Selection: This analysis reinforces Ethereum’s unique status. Chasing smaller altcoins for new highs in this cycle may carry substantially higher risk. In essence, patience and disciplined capital allocation become key virtues for those targeting a future Ethereum all-time high . Conclusion: A Call for Cautious Optimism Ben Cowen’s forecast paints a picture of delayed gratification for Ethereum maximalists. While the thrilling sprint to a new Ethereum all-time high in 2026 appears unlikely, the long-term narrative isn’t broken. Ethereum retains its crown as the altcoin with the best chance of eventual recovery, standing alone in a sea of exhausted projects. For savvy investors, this period may represent a strategic buildup phase rather than a time for explosive gains. The dream of a new peak isn’t dead; it’s simply waiting for a more favorable macroeconomic and crypto market wind. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason an Ethereum all-time high in 2026 is considered unlikely? A1: The primary reason is Ethereum’s strong correlation with Bitcoin. Analyst Ben Cowen believes if Bitcoin is in a bear market, it is very difficult for Ethereum to rally independently with enough strength to set a new record. Q2: What is a “bull trap” in this context? A2: A bull trap refers to a scenario where Ethereum’s price rises back to its old high of around $4,878, leading investors to believe a breakout is imminent. However, this could be followed by a sharp reversal downward, trapping bullish buyers at a peak. Q3: Does this analysis mean Ethereum is a bad investment? A3: Not necessarily. Cowen highlights Ethereum as the ONLY altcoin with a realistic chance of reclaiming its all-time high in the future. It suggests a longer timeframe for growth and emphasizes strategic buying during potential dips. Q4: What price level does Cowen mention as a potential reversal point? A4: Following a potential bull trap at the old highs, Cowen suggests Ethereum could experience a sharp reversal down to the $2,000 support level. Q5: What is the outlook for other altcoins according to this analysis? A5: The outlook for most other altcoins is more pessimistic. Cowen assesses that they have likely exhausted their momentum in the current cycle and are unlikely to ever set new all-time highs, making Ethereum a unique case. Q6: What should an investor do based on this forecast? A6: Investors should practice caution, monitor Bitcoin’s trend closely, avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) if ETH nears its old high, and consider long-term accumulation strategies during deeper market corrections.

The platform has officially announced the upcoming YieldBasis (YB) listing , scheduled for December 26th. This strategic addition of YB trading pairs against both Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) signals a significant vote of confidence in the project and opens new avenues for traders. Let’s explore what this development means for the market and for your portfolio. What Does the YieldBasis YB Listing Entail? Upbit’s announcement is specific and time-bound. The YieldBasis YB listing is set to go live at 06:00 UTC on Thursday, December 26th. Trading will commence immediately for the YB/BTC and YB/USDT pairs. This dual-pair approach is crucial. It provides flexibility for different types of traders: those who prefer to trade against the crypto benchmark (BTC) and those who seek stability against a dollar-pegged asset (USDT). The listing on a major, compliant exchange like Upbit inherently boosts the token’s liquidity, accessibility, and legitimacy in the eyes of both retail and institutional participants. Why is Upbit’s Endorsement a Big Deal? Upbit is not just any exchange; it’s a dominant force in the South Korean market, known for its rigorous due diligence. Therefore, a YieldBasis YB listing here acts as a powerful validator. It suggests the project has passed stringent checks related to security, legal compliance, and technical integrity. For existing YB holders, this means enhanced market exposure. For new investors, it offers a trusted and regulated gateway to acquire the token. This move often triggers a positive market reaction, as seen with previous high-profile listings, due to increased demand and trading volume. What Are the Immediate Opportunities and Considerations? With any new listing, especially one as prominent as the YieldBasis YB listing , traders should be prepared for volatility. The initial hours can see significant price discovery. Here are key points to consider: Increased Volatility: Expect sharp price movements as the market finds equilibrium. Enhanced Liquidity: Upbit’s large user base will provide deeper order books. Regulatory Clarity: Trading on a compliant platform reduces counterparty risk. Market Sentiment: The listing itself is a bullish catalyst, but long-term value depends on the YieldBasis project’s fundamentals. How Does This Fit into the Broader Crypto Landscape? The decision for a YieldBasis YB listing reflects a continuing trend of major exchanges diversifying their offerings beyond the top 10 cryptocurrencies. It highlights a growing appetite for innovative DeFi and yield-generating protocols. By providing a secure trading venue for such assets, Upbit is bridging the gap between traditional crypto trading and the decentralized finance ecosystem. This not only benefits YB but also sets a precedent for other promising altcoins seeking mainstream exchange support. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors If you’re planning to engage with the YieldBasis YB listing , a measured approach is wise. Conduct your own research on the YieldBasis protocol’s use case, tokenomics, and roadmap. Monitor the order book depth in the first few days to understand support and resistance levels. Remember, while a listing is a major milestone, it is one event in a project’s lifecycle. Sustainable growth is tied to adoption and utility, not just exchange availability. Conclusion: A Significant Step for YieldBasis Adoption The upcoming YieldBasis YB listing on Upbit is a transformative event. It catapults the token onto a major stage, enhancing its credibility, liquidity, and reach. For the crypto market, it underscores the maturation of infrastructure supporting diverse digital assets. While opportunities for profitable trading arise, the core takeaway is the validation of a project now accessible to a vast, security-conscious audience. This listing could very well be the catalyst that propels YieldBasis into its next phase of growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will YieldBasis (YB) start trading on Upbit? A1: Trading for the YB/BTC and YB/USDT pairs will begin at 06:00 UTC on Thursday, December 26th. Q2: Why is the listing on both BTC and USDT pairs important? A2: It caters to different trading strategies. BTC pairs appeal to those benchmarking against crypto, while USDT pairs offer stability against the US dollar, which is often preferred for short-term trading and risk management. Q3: Does a listing on Upbit guarantee the token’s success? A3: No. While a major exchange listing provides liquidity and exposure, the long-term success of YieldBasis (YB) depends on the adoption, utility, and development of its underlying protocol. Q4: What should I do before trading YB on December 26th? A4: Research the YieldBasis project thoroughly, ensure your Upbit account is funded and verified, and be prepared for high volatility during the initial listing period. Q5: Is Upbit available to international traders? A5: Upbit primarily services South Korea, and access for international users can be restricted. Always check the exchange’s terms of service and your local regulations before attempting to trade. Q6: Could this listing affect the price of YB on other exchanges? A6: Yes, typically. A listing on a high-volume exchange like Upbit can create arbitrage opportunities and influence the token’s price across all trading platforms due to increased overall demand and visibility.

56377584,https://cryptonews.com/?p=467870,1766724174,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56377584.jpeg,Uniswap Governance Approves UNIfication Proposal in Near-Unanimous Vote,https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-governance-approves-unification-proposal-in-near-unanimous-vote/,"Uniswap governance has approved the UNIfication proposal, marking a major shift in the protocol’s economic model and setting UNI on a more explicitly deflationary path. Key Takeaways: Uniswap approved UNIfication with near-unanimous support, putting UNI on a deflationary path. The fee switch redirects trading fees to ongoing UNI burns tied to protocol usage. The proposal also streamlines governance and funding to support long-term growth. Voting concluded on Thursday with 99.9% support, according to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams . More than 125 million UNI tokens were cast in favor of the proposal , compared with just 742 tokens voting against, underscoring broad consensus among token holders. Uniswap Proposal Activates Long-Awaited Protocol Fee Switch The proposal, introduced in November by Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation, activates the long-anticipated protocol fee switch. Under the new structure, a portion of trading fees, previously distributed entirely to liquidity providers, will now be directed to the protocol itself. Those fees will be used to burn UNI tokens on an ongoing basis, reducing total supply over time. In addition, net sequencer fees from Unichain will be routed into the same burn mechanism. Together, the changes create a direct link between usage and supply reduction. As trading activity increases across Uniswap, more UNI will be removed from circulation, effectively tying the token’s economics to the protocol’s growth. Beyond fee mechanics, UNIfication also streamlines Uniswap’s operational structure. The proposal transitions Uniswap Foundation teams and responsibilities into Uniswap Labs, removes fees from Labs’ interface, wallet, and API services, and establishes a recurring growth budget funded by UNI. Voting has concluded on Unification 125,342,017 YES 742 NO Unified, true to the name After a ~2day vote timelock, 100m UNI will be burned, fee switches will be flipped, labs will turn off frontend fees and focus on the protocol, and more Merry Christmas everyone https://t.co/wpsEC8udlW pic.twitter.com/P0rJmLN9Cc — Hayden Adams (@haydenzadams) December 25, 2025 That budget is designed to support long-term development and ecosystem expansion rather than short-term incentives. Following approval, the proposal enters a two-day timelock, after which Uniswap will execute a one-time burn of 100 million UNI. The figure represents an estimate of how much UNI might have been burned had the fee switch been active since the token’s launch. The governance package also introduces a Protocol Fee Discount Auctions system designed to improve returns for liquidity providers while aligning Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and on-chain governance under a single legal structure using Wyoming’s DUNA framework. Several influential figures in decentralized finance backed the UNIfication proposal, including Variant founder Jesse Waldren, Synthetix and Infinex founder Kain Warwick, and former Uniswap Labs engineer Ian Lapham, all of whom hold substantial voting power. Uniswap Cites Shift in Regulatory Climate as It Moves Toward Value Capture The move comes after years of regulatory pressure on DeFi under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. In the proposal, Uniswap argued that the regulatory landscape has shifted and that decentralized finance has reached a stage of broader acceptance, making it possible to implement protocol-level value capture. “I believe Uniswap protocol can be the primary place tokens are traded,” Adams said, adding that the proposal “sets the stage for the next decade of its growth.” UNI was trading at $5.92 as of late Thursday, up 18.9% over the past week. Uniswap has generated more than $1.05 billion in fees so far this year, highlighting the scale of activity now feeding into its new economic model.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are watching Polygon (MATIC) with intense interest. The burning question on everyone’s mind: can MATIC achieve the elusive $1 milestone in the coming years? With its position as a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Polygon has transformed from a promising project to a fundamental infrastructure component of the blockchain ecosystem. This comprehensive analysis examines MATIC’s potential trajectory through 2026, 2027, and beyond to 2030, providing you with data-driven insights and expert perspectives on whether this ambitious price target is within reach. Understanding Polygon’s Current Market Position Polygon has established itself as a critical player in solving Ethereum’s scalability challenges. The network processes transactions faster and at significantly lower costs than the Ethereum mainnet, making it attractive for developers and users alike. As of current market conditions, MATIC faces both opportunities and challenges. The broader crypto market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the Polygon ecosystem will all influence its price trajectory. The network’s active development, including Polygon 2.0 upgrades and zero-knowledge technology integration, positions it for potential growth if adoption continues to accelerate. Polygon Price Prediction for 2026: The Foundation Year Looking toward 2026, several factors will shape MATIC’s price movement. Analysts consider multiple scenarios based on market conditions, adoption rates, and technological milestones. A conservative estimate suggests gradual growth if current trends continue, while bullish scenarios depend on widespread institutional adoption and successful implementation of Polygon’s roadmap. Key considerations include: Ethereum ecosystem integration and dependency Competition from other Layer 2 solutions Developer activity and dApp migration to Polygon Overall cryptocurrency market capitalization trends Scenario 2026 Price Range Key Drivers Conservative $0.45 – $0.65 Moderate adoption, steady market growth Moderate $0.65 – $0.85 Strong developer growth, Ethereum scaling needs Bullish $0.85 – $1.10 Mass adoption, major partnerships, market surge MATIC Price Analysis for 2027: The Acceleration Phase By 2027, Polygon’s technological advancements should be more fully realized. The implementation of Polygon 2.0, featuring a unified liquidity layer and enhanced zero-knowledge proofs, could significantly boost network efficiency and appeal. If Ethereum maintains its dominant position and Polygon continues to capture scaling demand, MATIC could experience substantial appreciation. However, investors must remain aware of potential headwinds including regulatory changes, technological disruptions from competitors, and macroeconomic factors affecting all cryptocurrency investments. The MATIC surge potential in 2027 depends heavily on whether the network can maintain its competitive advantages while expanding its use cases beyond simple transaction scaling. Polygon 2030 Forecast: Long-Term Vision and Potential The 2030 outlook for Polygon represents the most speculative but potentially rewarding timeframe. By this point, blockchain technology should be more integrated into mainstream applications, and scaling solutions will be essential infrastructure. Polygon’s success in establishing itself as the go-to Layer 2 solution could position MATIC for significant value appreciation. Long-term crypto forecast models suggest that if Polygon captures even a moderate percentage of the projected global blockchain transaction volume, its token economics could support substantially higher valuations. However, this distant horizon requires considering technological obsolescence risks, the evolution of Ethereum itself, and potential paradigm shifts in blockchain architecture. Will MATIC Surge to $1? Critical Factors to Consider The $1 price point represents both a psychological milestone and a significant valuation increase from current levels. Achieving this target depends on several converging factors: Network Adoption: Increased daily active users and transaction volume Developer Growth: More applications building on Polygon versus competitors Token Utility: Expanded use cases for MATIC beyond network fees Market Conditions: Overall cryptocurrency bull market support Technological Execution: Successful delivery of Polygon’s development roadmap Historical patterns suggest that MATIC tends to perform well during periods of Ethereum network congestion, as users seek cheaper alternatives. However, sustained growth requires more than temporary congestion-driven demand. Risks and Challenges in MATIC’s Price Trajectory No investment comes without risks, and Polygon faces several significant challenges. The competitive landscape for Layer 2 solutions is intensifying, with projects like Arbitrum , Optimism , and emerging zero-knowledge rollups vying for market share. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency tokens, particularly those classified as securities, could impact MATIC’s trading and adoption. Additionally, technological risks include potential vulnerabilities in Polygon’s architecture or failure to keep pace with Ethereum’s own scaling improvements through initiatives like Proto-danksharding . Expert Insights and Market Sentiment Industry analysts offer varied perspectives on Polygon’s future. Some emphasize its first-mover advantage and established ecosystem, while others caution about increasing competition.

He warns that a rally toward the $4,878 level could turn into a bull trap, followed by a sharp reversal back toward $2,000. Ethereum Upside Limited Ethereum is unlikely to reach new all-time highs over the coming year if Bitcoin remains under pressure. This is according to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, who shared his outlook during a recent appearance on the Bankless podcast . Cowen said that if Bitcoin is indeed in what feels like a broader bear market, it would be difficult for Ethereum to sustain a meaningful breakout. In his view, the macro conditions that typically allow Ethereum to surge to new highs are closely tied to Bitcoin’s market structure, and without a strong foundation from BTC, upside momentum for ETH may be limited. The comments also follow a bearish projection from veteran trader Peter Brandt , who warned in mid-December that Bitcoin could fall as low as $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026. That outlook added to growing caution among analysts who believe the market may be transitioning into a longer consolidation or downturn phase rather than a renewed bull cycle. Cowen suggested that even if Ethereum were to reclaim its previous all-time high close to $4,878, such a move could ultimately prove to be a bull trap rather than the start of a sustained rally. Ethereum briefly pushed back to its 2021 peak in late August before entering a prolonged decline that dragged the price below $3,000 by November. At current levels, a return to that all-time high would require a gain of more than 40%, based on pricing data from CoinCodex . ETH’s price action over the past 6 months (Source: CoinCodex ) While Cowen acknowledged that such a move is technically possible, he still warned that it will likely be followed by a sharp reversal, potentially sending Ethereum back toward the $2,000 level. He also explained that even a renewed ETH rally will probably not spill over into a broader altcoin resurgence. According to Cowen, Ethereum is the only major altcoin that still appears capable of revisiting previous highs this cycle, while many others may already be past their peak. This view aligns with warnings from Fundstrat Global Advisors, which reportedly told investors to prepare for a “meaningful drawdown” in 2026 that could push Ethereum into the $1,800 to $2,000 range.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 05:30:00

Key Takeaways: Keonne Rodriguez shared a personal account of his first days in federal prison. His case has renewed debate over criminal liability for open-source crypto developers. A growing clemency campaign highlights concerns over free speech and innovation. In a letter shared by The Rage , Rodriguez described surrendering himself to a federal prison camp and navigating the intake process, which included searches, medical checks and assignment to housing. The letter, dated Wednesday, marked his seventh day at the facility and reflected on the emotional toll of entering custody just days before Christmas. Rodriguez Describes First Days in Prison as “Manageable” “While not at all comfortable, it is manageable,” Rodriguez wrote. “While I rather be at home with my wife and family, there are far worse places I could have ended up.” He added that he was thankful the other prisoners had been “respectful and downright friendly,” a detail that appeared to offer some reassurance amid an otherwise difficult transition. Rodriguez said he was scheduled to receive his wife as his first visitor on Christmas Day. He also noted that the timing of his incarceration forced his family to celebrate the holiday early this year, underscoring the personal cost of his sentence beyond the legal consequences. The imprisonment of Rodriguez has drawn attention within the crypto community, where it has become a flashpoint in the broader debate over the criminal liability of open-source developers. Privacy advocates argue that his case, alongside the prosecution of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, raises unresolved questions about whether writing and maintaining code can constitute a crime when third parties use that software for illicit purposes.

Supporters say the prosecution sets a dangerous precedent for developers building privacy-focused tools, while authorities have maintained that the case centers on facilitating illegal activity rather than protected speech. A petition calling for clemency for Rodriguez has gathered more than 12,000 signatures, reflecting continued concern among developers and digital rights advocates. The petition describes the case as “a chilling attack on free speech and innovation,” warning that it could deter open-source development in the United States. Trump Says He Will Review Samourai Wallet Co-Founder’s Case The possibility of executive clemency has also entered the conversation. US President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he would review Rodriguez’s case , telling reporters on Dec. 16 that he had heard about it and would “take a look,” though he acknowledged he was not familiar with the details. The comments came after Rodriguez had begun serving his sentence. In a subsequent social media post, Rodriguez publicly appealed to Trump for a pardon, characterizing his prosecution as an example of “lawfare” carried out under the previous administration. He argued that his case involved no direct victims and accused regulators and judges of targeting him as part of a broader anti-innovation push.

As the metaverse continues to capture global attention, investors are asking a crucial question: What does the future hold for Decentraland’s MANA token? With virtual real estate transactions making headlines and major brands establishing digital presences, understanding the potential trajectory of this pioneering metaverse cryptocurrency becomes essential for anyone navigating the Web3 landscape. This comprehensive analysis explores Decentraland price predictions from 2026 through 2030, examining whether MANA can realistically achieve the psychological milestone of $1 and what factors will determine its journey. Understanding Decentraland and the MANA Token Decentraland represents one of the earliest and most established metaverse platforms, built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can purchase virtual land parcels as NFTs using MANA tokens, create interactive experiences, attend virtual events, and monetize their digital assets. The platform’s native cryptocurrency, MANA, serves multiple functions: it’s the primary currency for transactions within the virtual world, used for governance voting through the Decentraland DAO, and required for purchasing LAND parcels and other digital assets. This utility foundation creates inherent demand for the token beyond speculative trading. Current MANA Price Analysis and Market Position Before exploring future predictions, understanding MANA’s current market position provides essential context. As of [current year], MANA maintains its position among the top metaverse cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, though it faces increasing competition from newer platforms. The token’s price history shows significant volatility, with notable peaks during previous crypto bull markets and metaverse hype cycles. Several factors currently influence MANA’s valuation: Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price movements Adoption rates within the Decentraland platform itself Competition from other metaverse projects like The Sandbox and newer platforms Technological developments and platform upgrades Regulatory developments affecting virtual assets globally Key Factors Influencing Decentraland Price Prediction Accurate price prediction requires examining multiple variables that could impact MANA’s future value. These factors create both opportunities and challenges for the token’s growth trajectory. Metaverse Adoption and Platform Growth The single most significant driver for MANA’s price will be actual adoption and usage of the Decentraland platform. Key metrics to watch include: Metric Current Status Impact on MANA Price Daily Active Users Varies significantly Higher consistent usage increases transaction volume Virtual Land Sales Volume Seasonal fluctuations Directly correlates with MANA demand Brand Partnerships Several major brands established Increases platform credibility and user attraction Developer Activity Active but could expand More experiences increase platform utility Technological Developments and Roadmap Decentraland’s development team continues to improve the platform, with several planned upgrades that could significantly impact user experience and, consequently, MANA demand. These include enhanced graphics capabilities, improved mobile accessibility, better creation tools for users, and potential layer-2 scaling solutions to reduce transaction costs. Successful implementation of these features could drive renewed interest and investment in the platform. Market Competition and Differentiation The metaverse space has become increasingly crowded since Decentraland’s launch. The platform must maintain its first-mover advantage while innovating to stay relevant. Key competitive factors include: User experience and graphical quality compared to newer platforms Transaction costs and speed on the Ethereum network Unique features that differentiate Decentraland from competitors Community engagement and creator support systems Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 By 2026, several technological and market developments could significantly impact MANA’s valuation. Assuming broader cryptocurrency market recovery and continued metaverse concept development, analysts project a potential price range of $0.45 to $0.85 for MANA in 2026. The lower end of this prediction assumes moderate platform growth and continued market competition, while the higher end requires substantial increases in daily active users and virtual land transactions. Key factors for 2026 include potential Ethereum network upgrades reducing transaction costs, increased institutional interest in metaverse assets, and possible integration with emerging technologies like enhanced VR hardware. MANA Price Forecast for 2027 The 2027 forecast builds upon 2026 developments, with additional consideration for macroeconomic factors and technological adoption curves. Conservative estimates place MANA between $0.55 and $0.95, while optimistic scenarios suggest potential to approach or briefly exceed $1 during market peaks. Critical developments that could push MANA toward the higher end of predictions include: Mainstream adoption of VR/AR technologies reaching critical mass Significant corporate investment in virtual headquarters and marketing Clear regulatory frameworks providing investor certainty Interoperability developments allowing assets to move between metaverse platforms Decentraland 2030: Long-Term Price Projection Looking further ahead to 2030 requires considering both technological evolution and potential paradigm shifts in how people interact with digital spaces. Long-term Decentraland price prediction models vary widely based on underlying assumptions about metaverse adoption rates. Three potential scenarios emerge: Conservative Scenario ($0.70 – $1.20) Assumes moderate metaverse adoption with Decentraland maintaining but not significantly expanding its current market position. Competition limits growth potential, and technological advancements occur gradually rather than disruptively. Moderate Scenario ($1.50 – $3.00) Assumes steady growth in metaverse adoption with Decentraland capturing a significant portion of the virtual real estate and experience market. Platform improvements successfully address current limitations, and brand partnerships drive consistent user growth. Optimistic Scenario ($3.50 – $7.00+) Assumes rapid, widespread metaverse adoption becoming integral to social interaction, commerce, and entertainment. Decentraland emerges as a leading platform through continuous innovation, and MANA becomes a standard currency for virtual transactions beyond the platform itself. Will MANA Price Hit $1? The Critical Analysis The $1 threshold represents both a psychological milestone and a significant market capitalization achievement for MANA. Based on current circulating supply, reaching $1 would give Decentraland a market capitalization of approximately [current circulating supply] billion dollars. Analysis suggests several pathways to this target: Sustained platform growth increasing transaction volume and token utility Broader cryptocurrency bull market lifting all major assets Strategic partnerships or developments that significantly increase demand Tokenomics adjustments such as burning mechanisms or reduced inflation While challenging, the $1 target remains within plausible reach given appropriate market conditions and platform development. However, investors should recognize that this achievement would likely require both internal platform success and favorable external market factors. Risks and Challenges for MANA Price Growth No investment comes without risks, and MANA faces several significant challenges that could impact its price trajectory: Technological Obsolescence: Rapid innovation could make current platforms seem primitive Regulatory Uncertainty: Changing global regulations could impact virtual asset markets Market Saturation: Increasing competition could fragment the metaverse user base Adoption Hurdles: Technical barriers may limit mainstream metaverse adoption Economic Factors: Broader economic conditions affect discretionary spending on virtual assets Investment Considerations for MANA For those considering MANA as part of their investment portfolio, several strategic approaches merit consideration: Diversification: Treat MANA as a speculative portion of a diversified portfolio Research-Based Allocation: Allocate only what you can afford to lose completely Active Monitoring: Track platform metrics, not just price movements Long-Term Perspective: Consider multi-year holding periods given the developmental timeline Platform Engagement: Actually use Decentraland to understand its strengths and weaknesses Conclusion: The Future of Decentraland and MANA The journey toward $1 and beyond for MANA represents more than just price speculation—it reflects the evolving narrative of digital ownership and virtual experiences. While predictions provide helpful frameworks, the actual trajectory will depend on execution, adoption, and innovation. Decentraland’s established position gives it advantages, but maintaining relevance requires continuous evolution. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the coming years will reveal whether virtual worlds become integral to our digital lives or remain niche experiences. The potential is undeniable, but the path forward requires navigating both technological challenges and market realities.

This expiry event is huge, being the end of the quarter and end of the year, so there may be some impact on spot markets, which have been sideways for most of the week. Trading has been subdued over the Christmas period, as investors look ahead to 2026 with renewed hope that the four-year cycle has been broken. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.37, meaning that there are a lot more calls (longs) expiring than puts (shorts). Max pain is around $96,000, according to Coinglass, which means that most of the contracts will be worthless on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $100,000, which has $2.2 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There remains around $2.2 billion in OI at $85,000. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at $52 billion, according to Coinglass. “Post-expiry flows will matter more than price. Watch positioning. How would the market react to an expiry this big?” asked Deribit. Year-End Options Expiry This Friday, a massive $28.5B in BTC and ETH options expire on Deribit, the largest expiry on record -representing over half of total open interest – $BTC : $23.4B+ notional | Put Call: 0.36 | Max Pain: $96K $1.2B in put OI clustered at $85K, with… pic.twitter.com/c1l3r7Ac6U — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) December 23, 2025 “When a large volume of options expires, many institutions roll over positions early to mitigate pin-prick risk. At this point, picking up the leftover positions discarded by institutions offers exceptional value — prices are extremely favorable,” explained crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live. In addition to today’s big batch of Bitcoin options, around 1.25 million Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $3.4 billion, max pain at $3,100, and a put/call ratio of 0.45. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $11 billion and has been falling since late August. Ether options positioning “reflects caution, not capitulation,” said Deribit. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $27 billion. Spot Market Outlook Spot markets have remained relatively flat, with total cap hovering just above $3 trillion. Bitcoin had a little jump to $89,000 but could not make any momentum above this level and retreated to $88,850 at the time of writing. The asset remains range-bound and flat on the week. Ether prices have remained weak, below $3,000 over the past 24 hours, and most altcoins are in the red as usual.

According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin traded around $88,750 at the time of recent reports, down about 27% from its all-time high of $125,100 hit on Oct. 5. Reports have disclosed that a record-sized Bitcoin options expiry landed on Friday, Dec. 26, and several analysts say that event effectively “pinned” price into a narrow range — at least until volatility returns. Market Flows And Options Pressure According to multiple sources, outflows from major spot ETFs removed a key support for price that helped push Bitcoin higher earlier this year. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been in “Extreme Fear” since Dec. 12, which shows how fragile sentiment remains despite product and policy gains. Options expiries of this size can concentrate bets and push price toward strike clusters. When those contracts roll off, the market often needs a new catalyst to move beyond the band it’s been stuck in. Strong Fundamentals Executives managing large Bitcoin treasuries argue fundamentals are solid even as price drops. Strategy CEO Phong Le told a podcast that the market’s long-term picture looks strong and that short-term moves “do what they do.” “The fundamentals of the market for Bitcoin couldn’t be better this year,” Le said, pointing out that he doesn’t care too much about its short-term performance. Reports note that Strategy’s market value relative to its Bitcoin holdings, mNAV, has fallen below 1 and sits at 0.93 according to Saylor Tracker. The company’s balance shows 671,268 Bitcoin, with an estimated value of about $58 billion. Those figures underline how a decline in spot price can quickly reshape the math for firms that hold Bitcoin on their books. Traditional Banks Trying To Catch Up Le and Strategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor have been meeting with banks across the US and the UAE, based on his comments, as institutions seek how to adjust to growing client demand and new product types. According to reports, Galaxy Digital researcher Alex Thorn had said earlier in the year there was a “strong chance” the US government would signal a formal reserve move. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile, although a fully detailed plan has not been released. Policy Signals And Market Reaction Policy support is a clear positive, yet markets do not always respond immediately to regulatory shifts. Signals can lower legal risk and widen access, but they do not always create instant buying. The mNAV reading below 1, plus ETF outflows and a fear reading stuck at “Extreme Fear,” shows there is skepticism about when that demand will arrive. Some players remain methodical, building dollar and Bitcoin treasuries and relying on model-based rules rather than emotion. Based on reports and market indicators, the picture is mixed. Long-term commitments from firms and clearer policy language point to stronger structural backing. At the same time, short-term flows, options dynamics, and entrenched fear mean price can stay volatile and range-bound. Investors watching both the fund flows and policy calendar will likely decide which signal matters more next.

The cryptocurrency that promised to revolutionize mobile mining has seen significant volatility, leaving investors wondering: is this the end of Pi Coin’s journey, or just a temporary setback before massive gains? This comprehensive analysis dives deep into Pi Network price predictions from 2026 through 2030, examining the fundamental reasons behind Pi Coin’s recent drop and what it means for your investment strategy. Understanding Pi Network’s Current Market Position Pi Network represents one of the most ambitious projects in cryptocurrency history. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require expensive hardware for mining, Pi Network enables users to mine coins directly from their smartphones. This innovative approach has attracted millions of users worldwide, creating one of the largest cryptocurrency communities ever assembled. However, the transition from testnet to mainnet has presented significant challenges that directly impact Pi Coin’s current valuation. Why Is Pi Coin Dropping? Key Factors Explained The recent decline in Pi Network’s perceived value stems from several interconnected factors. First, the prolonged development timeline has tested investor patience. While the core team continues to build infrastructure, market expectations often outpace actual development progress. Second, regulatory uncertainty surrounding mobile-mined cryptocurrencies creates hesitation among institutional investors. Third, the sheer size of the Pi Network community means that even small percentages of users selling their holdings can create significant downward pressure on perceived value. Consider these critical elements affecting Pi Coin’s current trajectory: Mainnet migration delays and technical challenges Regulatory scrutiny of novel mining mechanisms Market saturation with competing layer-1 solutions Community expectations versus development reality Limited exchange listings and liquidity constraints Pi Network Price Prediction 2026: The First Major Test By 2026, Pi Network should have completed its mainnet transition and established clearer utility pathways. Our analysis suggests that if the project successfully implements its proposed ecosystem—including decentralized applications, smart contracts, and real-world partnerships—Pi Coin could establish a more stable valuation foundation. However, this depends entirely on execution quality and market adoption rates. Scenario Price Range Probability Optimistic Adoption $5 – $15 25% Moderate Growth $2 – $5 50% Limited Progress $0.5 – $2 25% Pi Coin Price Prediction 2027-2028: Maturation Phase The period between 2027 and 2028 represents a crucial maturation phase for Pi Network. By this time, the cryptocurrency should have established clearer use cases beyond speculative trading. Key factors to watch include merchant adoption rates, developer activity within the Pi ecosystem, and regulatory clarity across major markets. If Pi Network successfully transitions from a mining experiment to a functional blockchain platform, we could see significant valuation adjustments. Pi Network 2030 Price Prediction: Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030, Pi Network’s success will depend on several fundamental achievements. First, the platform must demonstrate sustainable decentralization beyond its initial mining phase. Second, it needs to establish competitive advantages over established layer-1 blockchains. Third, the project must navigate the evolving regulatory landscape for mobile-based cryptocurrencies. If these challenges are met successfully, Pi Coin could establish itself as a significant player in the digital currency space. Actionable Insights for Pi Network Investors Navigating Pi Coin’s volatility requires strategic thinking. First, diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio to mitigate Pi Network-specific risks. Second, monitor development milestones rather than daily price fluctuations. Third, participate in the Pi Network community to understand platform developments firsthand. Fourth, establish clear entry and exit strategies based on fundamental progress rather than speculative hype. Remember that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and Pi Network’s novel approach introduces additional variables to consider. The Future of Cryptocurrency and Pi Network’s Role Pi Network represents an important experiment in cryptocurrency accessibility and mass adoption. Its success or failure will provide valuable insights into whether mobile-based mining can sustainably support blockchain networks. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, projects like Pi Network test the boundaries of what’s possible in digital currency creation and distribution. The current drop in Pi Coin’s perceived value reflects both legitimate concerns and market overreactions. While development challenges are real, the project’s fundamental vision remains intact. The coming years will determine whether Pi Network can translate its massive user base into genuine blockchain utility. For investors, this represents both significant risk and potential reward—a characteristic shared by many innovative cryptocurrency projects.

President Vladimir Putin allegedly announced the collaboration at a pre-New Year meeting of the State Council on Christmas. Putin said the discussions are taking place with American officials rather than with Kyiv. He said U.S. representatives showed interest in using electricity from Zaporizhzhia for crypto mining operations. He also reportedly said electricity supplies to Ukraine are being discussed at the American initiative. When asked whether Ukrainian specialists could work at the plant, Putin said they were already working there but now hold Russian passports, placing them under Russia’s jurisdiction. The Industrial Mining Association had said in a report from September that Russia ranked second globally for crypto mining during the summer, accounting for more than 16% of global hashrate. Putin confirms talks with the US over plant control and mining – Russian Media Putin’s State Council meeting reportedly focused on personnel training, but Putin apparently openly spoke about Zaporizhzhia, though the talks exclude Ukraine from decision-making and place Russia and Washington at the center of operational planning for the nuclear site. Crypto mining already plays a role in Russia’s financial system. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said mining could be an additional factor behind ruble strengthening. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, she said it is hard to measure the effect because a large part of the sector operates in a gray zone. Earlier last week, Maxim Oreshkin, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office, had said forum that 2026’s ruble price forecasts were off because financial flows linked to crypto and mining were underestimated. Maxim said this sector has turned into a new export channel and now influences foreign exchange markets. Oreshkin said the Bank of Russia is assessing these flows so they can be included in the balance of payments, noting that many of these transactions bypass standard reporting routes. Mining is now regulated in Russia, thanks to a notice by the country’s central bank on November 1st 2024, which said that retail entrepreneurs and companies registered with the Federal Tax Service can legally mine crypto in Russia. Private individuals can mine without registration if they stay within a 6,000 kilowatt-hour energy limit and report income, while companies that run mining infrastructure, including data centers and hosting services, must register with the tax authority.

Imagine a platform that revolutionized meme coin creation on Solana, turning viral ideas into market movements overnight. That’s Pump.fun, and its native PUMP token has captured the attention of the entire cryptocurrency community. As Solana’s DeFi ecosystem experiences unprecedented growth, investors are asking one crucial question: Can PUMP lead this explosive revolution? Our comprehensive Pump.fun price prediction for 2026-2030 examines whether this token has what it takes to become a cornerstone of Solana’s decentralized finance future. What is Pump.fun and Why Does It Matter for Solana DeFi? Pump.fun emerged as a groundbreaking platform that simplified meme coin creation on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional token launch methods that required technical expertise and significant capital, Pump.fun democratized the process, allowing anyone to create and launch tokens with minimal barriers. This innovation tapped into the explosive growth of meme coins while leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure. The platform’s success stems from several key features: Simplified token creation process requiring no coding knowledge Integration with Solana’s fast and affordable transaction network Built-in bonding curve mechanism for fair launches Community-driven approach to meme coin discovery As Solana’s DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, platforms like Pump.fun play a crucial role in onboarding new users and driving network activity. The PUMP token serves as the governance and utility token within this ecosystem, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value. PUMP Token Fundamentals: Understanding the Value Proposition Before diving into our Pump.fun price prediction, it’s essential to understand what drives the token’s value. The PUMP token operates within a carefully designed ecosystem with multiple utility functions: Utility Function Description Impact on Value Governance Rights Token holders can vote on platform upgrades and fee structures Creates long-term holding incentive Fee Discounts Reduced fees for token creation and transactions Drives platform usage and token demand Revenue Sharing Portion of platform fees distributed to stakers Provides passive income opportunities Ecosystem Access Early access to featured tokens and platform features Creates exclusive benefits for holders The tokenomics model includes mechanisms to balance supply and demand, with a portion of transaction fees being burned to create deflationary pressure. This careful design positions PUMP as more than just another meme token—it’s a fundamental piece of infrastructure within Solana’s growing DeFi landscape. Solana DeFi Growth: The Rising Tide That Lifts All Boats Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with total value locked (TVL) increasing dramatically over recent years. This expansion creates a favorable environment for platforms like Pump.fun to thrive.

Pump.fun’s position as a leading meme coin creation platform gives it unique exposure to retail interest and viral trends within the ecosystem. Pump.fun Price Prediction 2026: The Short-Term Outlook Looking ahead to 2026, several factors will influence PUMP’s price trajectory. Our analysis considers both technical indicators and fundamental developments: Key drivers for 2026 include: Platform adoption rates and user growth metrics Solana network performance and DeFi TVL expansion Regulatory developments affecting meme coins and DeFi platforms Competitive landscape and platform innovation Based on current growth patterns and assuming continued Solana ecosystem expansion, we project that PUMP could establish stronger support levels while testing new resistance zones. The token’s performance will closely track both platform-specific metrics and broader Solana DeFi trends. 2027-2028: Mid-Term Growth and Ecosystem Maturation The 2027-2028 period represents a crucial phase for Pump.fun’s development.

Successful execution of the development roadmap could position the token for significant appreciation. 2029-2030: Long-Term Vision and Market Leadership Potential Looking toward the end of the decade, our Pump.fun price prediction considers several long-term scenarios. The most optimistic outlook assumes: Solana establishes itself as a top-tier DeFi blockchain Pump.fun maintains leadership in meme coin creation and trading Successful expansion into complementary DeFi services Strong community governance and decentralized development In this scenario, PUMP could evolve from a platform token to a fundamental component of Solana’s DeFi infrastructure. However, investors should also consider potential challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, technological competition, and market volatility. Risks and Challenges: What Could Derail the Pump.fun Price Prediction? While our analysis presents an optimistic outlook, several risks could impact PUMP’s trajectory: Primary concerns include: Regulatory crackdowns on meme coins and DeFi platforms Technological issues or security vulnerabilities on Solana Increased competition from similar platforms Market saturation in the meme coin space Broader cryptocurrency market downturns Successful navigation of these challenges will require continuous platform innovation, strong community management, and adaptive business strategies. Investors should monitor these risk factors alongside positive developments.

This zkPass listing is not just another token addition; it’s a powerful endorsement of privacy-enhancing technology within a major regulated market. Scheduled to go live at 9:00 a.m. UTC today, this event signals growing institutional interest in projects that prioritize user data sovereignty. For traders and blockchain enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where advanced cryptographic concepts meet mainstream financial accessibility. Why is the zkPass Listing on Bithumb Such a Big Deal? Bithumb is one of South Korea’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, its decision to list a token like ZKP carries substantial weight. This move provides zkPass with immediate access to a vast pool of liquid capital and a sophisticated investor base. Moreover, it validates the project’s underlying technology—zero-knowledge proofs—in a market known for its rigorous compliance standards. The zkPass listing effectively bridges the gap between cutting-edge privacy protocols and everyday traders seeking exposure to this innovative sector. What is zkPass (ZKP) and How Does It Work? For those new to the concept, zkPass is a protocol built around zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). In simple terms, this technology allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any underlying information. Imagine proving you are over 18 without showing your birthdate. zkPass applies this to digital identity and data verification. The zkPass listing on a major fiat gateway like Bithumb highlights a growing real-world application for ZKPs beyond theoretical use cases. Enhanced Privacy: Users can verify credentials without exposing sensitive data. Security: Reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft. Interoperability: Aims to work across various Web2 and Web3 platforms. What Does This Mean for the South Korean Crypto Market? The South Korean market is a powerhouse, known for its high retail participation and tech-savvy population. Listing ZKP for direct won trading simplifies the investment process, removing the need for USDT or BTC pairs. This direct fiat on-ramp could lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for zkPass. Furthermore, it sets a precedent. Other exchanges may follow suit, and more privacy-focused projects might seek listings, thereby diversifying the offerings available to Korean investors. The zkPass listing could be the catalyst for a new wave of sophisticated digital asset adoption in the region. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? While the announcement is bullish, investors should proceed with informed caution. The regulatory environment for privacy-enhancing tokens remains complex and can change rapidly. Price volatility is often high following a new listing as the market seeks equilibrium. Additionally, the success of zkPass will ultimately depend on the widespread adoption of its protocol, not just its token’s trading activity. Therefore, while the zkPass listing is a monumental step, its long-term impact hinges on the project’s execution and broader market trends. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Privacy Tech The listing of zkPass (ZKP) on Bithumb is a landmark event that transcends a simple exchange announcement. It represents a growing convergence between institutional crypto platforms and fundamental blockchain values like privacy and self-sovereignty. This move provides legitimacy, liquidity, and visibility to a crucial technological innovation. For the crypto community, it’s a clear signal that privacy is not a niche concern but a mainstream demand, now accessible through one of Asia’s most important trading venues. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly does zkPass (ZKP) start trading on Bithumb? A1: Trading for the ZKP/KRW pair is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. UTC on the announcement date. Q2: Can I deposit ZKP tokens to Bithumb before trading starts? A2: Typically, exchanges open deposits a few hours before trading begins. You should check the official Bithumb announcement for the exact deposit start time. Q3: What is the main purpose of the zkPass project? A3: zkPass is a decentralized protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow for private and secure verification of personal data without revealing the data itself. Q4: Why is listing on Bithumb specifically important? A4: Bithumb is a top-tier South Korean exchange with high volume and a large user base. A won trading pair provides easy access for Korean investors and signifies regulatory and market confidence. Q5: Are there any risks associated with trading a newly listed token? A5: Yes. New listings often experience high volatility. It’s crucial to do your own research, understand the project’s fundamentals, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q6: Does this mean privacy tokens are becoming more accepted? A6: The listing by a major, compliant exchange like Bithumb is a positive indicator of growing acceptance for the underlying technology, though the regulatory landscape is still evolving.

One of the most powerful, real-time gauges of this sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . This metric reveals whether traders are leaning bullish or bearish on the world’s leading cryptocurrency at any given moment. Let’s decode the latest data from the world’s top exchanges and uncover what it truly means for your next move. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Tell Us? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a simple yet profound indicator. It shows the percentage of traders holding long positions (betting the price will rise) versus those holding short positions (betting the price will fall) on perpetual futures contracts. Therefore, a ratio above 50% long suggests bullish sentiment, while below 50% indicates bearish leanings. However, interpreting this data requires looking beyond a single number. Breaking Down the Latest Market Sentiment Current data paints a fascinating picture of a market in near-perfect equilibrium, but with subtle nuances. The overall 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across major platforms shows a market almost perfectly balanced between fear and greed. Overall: 49.34% long, 50.66% short Binance: 48.99% long, 51.01% short OKX: 49.95% long, 50.05% short Bybit: 48.69% long, 51.31% short This collective data reveals a market that is cautiously bearish in the very short term. The slight edge towards short positions suggests traders are hedging or anticipating potential downward pressure. Why Should You Care About This Ratio? Monitoring the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers actionable insights. First, extreme readings can act as a contrarian indicator. For instance, when an overwhelming majority are long, it might signal a market top is near. Conversely, extreme short positioning can hint at a potential bounce. Secondly, divergences between exchanges can reveal where different trader demographics (retail vs. institutional) are placing their bets, offering a deeper layer of analysis. Actionable Insights for Traders So, what can you do with this knowledge? Don’t just observe—strategize. The current neutral-to-bearish BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio suggests a few things. It may indicate a period of consolidation is underway before the next significant price move. Traders should watch for a decisive shift in this ratio, as it could precede strong momentum. Furthermore, use this data in conjunction with other indicators like funding rates and open interest for a more complete picture. The Final Verdict on Current Market Sentiment In conclusion, the latest BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data reveals a market at a crossroads. The slight dominance of short positions across Binance, OKX, and Bybit points to short-term caution among derivatives traders. However, the closeness of the numbers also shows a lack of strong conviction, leaving the door open for a rapid sentiment shift. For the astute observer, this equilibrium is a watchful waiting game, where the next tilt in the ratio could signal the direction of Bitcoin’s next major move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a perpetual futures contract? A perpetual futures contract is a derivative tool that allows traders to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date, using a funding rate mechanism to tether it to the spot price. How often does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio update? The data typically updates in real-time or at very short intervals (e.g., every few minutes or hourly), providing a near-live pulse of market sentiment. Is a high long ratio always bullish for the price? Not necessarily. Extremely high long ratios can indicate over-optimism or “crowded trades,” which sometimes precede sharp price corrections as positions are liquidated. Which exchange’s ratio is most important? Binance often holds the most weight due to its largest open interest, but analyzing all major exchanges together provides a more robust view of global sentiment. Can this ratio predict Bitcoin’s price? It is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It shows trader positioning, which can influence price, but should be used alongside technical and fundamental analysis.

He described it as one of the clearest interviews he has heard during his time investing in XRP. Hougan said XRP appeals to financial advisors for simple reasons. He called it “one of the Mount Rushmore assets in crypto.” He said advisors want assets that will persist, saying XRP’s long track record gives confidence it is “not going away.” He added that advisors understand use cases like cross-currency liquidity and stablecoins. Hougan also highlighted ETF inflows. He said it is rare for multiple XRP ETFs to succeed at the same time . He attributed that to XRP appealing to many communities at once. Coach JV viewed that as confirmation of depth rather than speculation. Diverging From the Crypto Cycle McClurg discussed market cycles and said the 4-year cycle still matters. However, some assets can diverge. He pointed to XRP holding up while other assets declined and said inflows continued daily. He said XRP could see another peak in 2026 , even if much of the market remains down.

This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the fragility inherent in even collateralized digital assets when market liquidity evaporates. What Caused the Solana-based Stablecoin USX to Depeg? Blockchain security firm PeckShield first flagged the alarming price movement. The Solana-based stablecoin USX, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, plummeted on secondary markets. The core issue wasn’t a failure of its underlying collateral but a severe shortage of immediate liquidity on exchanges. When sell orders overwhelmed available buy-side depth, the price disconnected from its intrinsic value, creating a temporary but severe market dislocation. How Did the USX Team Respond to the Crisis? The team behind the Solana-based stablecoin USX moved quickly to address concerns. They issued a statement clarifying a critical point: the stablecoin’s underlying and custodial assets remained secure and untouched. They emphasized that USX maintains a 100% collateralization ratio, meaning for every token in circulation, equivalent value is held in reserve. Therefore, the depegging was purely a market-driven liquidity event, not a solvency problem. Their immediate plan involves collaborating with market makers to inject continuous liquidity and prevent such volatility spikes in the future. Why is Liquidity So Vital for a Stablecoin? This event highlights a fundamental truth in cryptocurrency markets: collateral alone isn’t enough. A stablecoin’s health depends on two key pillars: Collateralization: The assets backing the token’s value. Liquidity: The ease of buying or selling the token at its intended price. The Solana-based stablecoin USX crisis was a failure of the second pillar. Without sufficient liquidity on trading venues, even a fully-backed asset can trade at a irrational discount, eroding user trust and causing panic. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana DeFi? While the Solana-based stablecoin USX has recovered to $0.98, the incident leaves a lasting impression. It acts as a stress test, revealing a potential vulnerability. For the broader Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, it underscores the need for: Robust Liquidity Protocols: Enhanced incentives for deep, resilient liquidity pools. Transparent Communication: Rapid, clear updates from projects during market stress. User Education: Understanding the difference between technical depegs and insolvency. The proactive response from the USX team is a positive step toward rebuilding confidence and strengthening the ecosystem’s infrastructure against similar shocks. Conclusion: Resilience Tested, Lessons Learned The brief depegging of the Solana-based stablecoin USX was a stark lesson in market mechanics. It proved that design and collateral are only part of the stability equation. The true test lies in maintaining robust liquidity across all market conditions. For investors and users, this event is a reminder to scrutinize both the backing and the market depth of any stablecoin. For projects, it’s a call to prioritize liquidity partnerships as a core component of operational security. The swift recovery shows resilience, but the path forward requires building even stronger safeguards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Solana-based stablecoin USX still safe to use? A: According to the team, its underlying assets are secure and it remains 100% collateralized. The depeg was a market liquidity issue, not a loss of funds. However, users should monitor its price stability on exchanges. Q: What exactly does ‘depegging’ mean? A: Depegging occurs when a stablecoin’s market price significantly deviates from its intended value (e.g., $1). In this case, the Solana-based stablecoin USX traded as low as $0.10 before recovering. Q: Did the USX protocol lose its collateral? A> No. The team confirmed that custodial assets were unaffected. The problem was isolated to trading venues lacking enough buy orders to absorb sells. Q: How can such a depegging be prevented in the future? A> Prevention relies on ensuring deep, continuous liquidity on exchanges, often through agreements with professional market makers who provide constant buy and sell orders. Q: Are other Solana stablecoins at risk? A> While this event is specific to USX, it highlights a universal risk for all stablecoins: low liquidity. The risk depends on each project’s individual liquidity arrangements and market depth. Q: Has the USX price fully recovered? A> At the time of the report, it had recovered to approximately $0.98, very close to its $1.00 peg. Found this analysis of the Solana-based stablecoin USX depegging insightful?

This zkPass listing is more than just another asset addition; it signals growing institutional interest in zero-knowledge proof technology and its real-world applications. What Does the zkPass Listing Mean for Investors? The immediate impact of this zkPass listing is increased accessibility. South Korean traders, who form a massive and active crypto market, can now easily buy, sell, and hold ZKP. Listing on multiple trading pairs (BTC, USDT, KRW) provides flexibility and reduces friction for both local and international users. This move typically brings heightened liquidity and visibility to a project, often leading to increased trading volume and price discovery. For the zkPass protocol, this endorsement from a top-tier exchange like Upbit serves as a major credibility boost, validating its technological premise in a competitive market. Why is Upbit’s Endorsement of zkPass a Big Deal? Upbit is not just any exchange; it’s a regulatory-compliant powerhouse in one of the world’s most crypto-engaged nations. Their listing process is known for being rigorous. Therefore, this zkPass listing implies that Upbit’s due diligence team sees substantial value and legitimacy in the zkPass project. It highlights a strategic shift towards supporting infrastructure projects that solve core Web3 issues, like privacy and secure data verification, rather than just speculative assets. This could pave the way for similar privacy-enhancing technologies to gain mainstream exchange support. What Challenges Could This zkPass Listing Face? However, every new listing comes with potential hurdles. The primary challenge will be market reception. While the technology is promising, the token’s price will face immediate volatility as it finds its footing on a major exchange. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny around privacy-focused tokens remains intense globally. Upbit’s compliance-focused approach mitigates this risk for now, but it’s a sector-wide concern. Finally, the project must now deliver on its roadmap under the spotlight of a much larger, more demanding investor base expecting tangible utility and adoption. Key Takeaways from the zkPass Listing Announcement Let’s break down the most actionable insights from this development: Enhanced Legitimacy: An Upbit listing acts as a strong signal of a project’s technical and operational soundness. Market Access: Korean and global investors gain direct, compliant access to a leading privacy protocol’s token. Focus on Utility: This move underscores a growing exchange preference for tokens with clear, functional use cases beyond speculation. Volatility Warning: New listings are notoriously volatile; investors should approach initial trading with caution and research. The Future of Privacy Tokens After This Listing This strategic zkPass listing by Upbit could be a watershed moment. It demonstrates that major, regulated platforms are willing to embrace complex privacy technologies when they offer genuine solutions. This could encourage other exchanges to broaden their listings beyond the usual suspects, fostering a more diverse and innovative crypto ecosystem. For developers in the zero-knowledge proof space, it provides a clearer pathway to market and user adoption. The success of ZKP on Upbit will be closely watched as a bellwether for the entire privacy token category. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Crypto Privacy The listing of zkPass on Upbit is a compelling development that merges high-grade exchange infrastructure with cutting-edge cryptographic technology. It provides a crucial bridge for a sophisticated privacy tool to reach a vast audience.

This zkPass listing is a confident step in that direction, offering investors not just a new token, but a stake in the evolving architecture of a more private and secure internet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is zkPass (ZKP)? zkPass is a privacy-preserving protocol that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It allows users to verify personal data (like KYC information) without revealing the underlying data itself, enabling secure and private transactions and interactions in Web3. When does the zkPass listing go live on Upbit? Trading for the ZKP token on Upbit is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. UTC on the announcement date, against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Korean Won (KRW) trading pairs. Why is listing on Upbit important for a cryptocurrency? Upbit is South Korea’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchange. A listing there provides massive liquidity, legitimacy, and direct access to one of the world’s most active retail crypto trading markets. Are privacy tokens like ZKP safe from regulatory crackdowns? Privacy tokens face heightened regulatory scrutiny globally. However, Upbit’s compliance-focused listing suggests they have conducted due diligence. The regulatory landscape remains fluid, so this is a key risk factor for investors to monitor. What should I do before trading ZKP on Upbit? Conduct thorough research on the zkPass project, its technology, team, and roadmap. Understand the high volatility associated with new exchange listings. Only invest capital you are prepared to lose, and consider using limit orders to manage entry points. Does this mean other exchanges will list zkPass soon?

This signals a potential seismic shift in how traditional institutions view digital assets. Let’s unpack what this means for the future of banking and cryptocurrency. What Are Crypto-Backed Loans and Why Do They Matter? Simply put, crypto-backed loans allow you to use your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to borrow cash. You don’t sell your crypto; you lock it up to secure a loan. This provides liquidity without triggering a taxable event. For a giant like Sberbank to consider this, it’s a powerful endorsement of cryptocurrency’s value as a financial asset. Anatoly Popov, Sberbank’s deputy chairman, confirmed the bank’s readiness to develop this with regulators. However, Russia’s crypto regulation remains a work in progress. This creates a fascinating dance between innovation and compliance. What’s Driving Sberbank’s Crypto Ambition? Sberbank isn’t acting on a whim. Several strategic factors are at play. First, there’s significant demand from clients who hold digital assets but need traditional currency. Second, it positions Sberbank as a forward-thinking leader. Finally, it taps into a growing global trend of institutional crypto adoption. The potential benefits are substantial: Access to Capital: Crypto holders unlock the value of their assets without selling. Bank Expansion: Sberbank attracts a new, tech-savvy customer segment. Market Legitimacy: This move further legitimizes cryptocurrencies as collateral. What Are the Major Hurdles for Crypto-Backed Loans? Despite the excitement, the path isn’t smooth. The primary challenge is Russia’s evolving regulatory framework. Clear rules on custody, valuation, and liquidation are essential. Furthermore, cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility poses a real risk. A sudden price drop could leave loans under-collateralized. Therefore, Sberbank must build robust infrastructure. This includes secure custody solutions and reliable pricing oracles. The bank’s statement about cooperating with authorities is a crucial first step to navigate these waters safely. How Could This Change the Global Financial Landscape? Sberbank’s exploration is a bellwether. If successful, other major banks in emerging markets may follow. It bridges the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional banking. This could lead to more hybrid financial products that offer the best of both worlds. For the everyday person, it means more options. Imagine a small business owner using Bitcoin holdings to fund expansion. Or an individual accessing funds during a cash crunch without selling their long-term crypto investments. The possibilities are transformative. In conclusion, Sberbank’s consideration of crypto-backed loans is a landmark moment. It highlights the accelerating convergence of traditional and digital finance. While regulatory and technical hurdles remain, the direction is clear. The future of finance is becoming more inclusive, flexible, and digitally native. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto-backed loans? A: They are loans where you pledge your cryptocurrency as collateral to receive traditional currency (like rubles or dollars). You retain ownership of your crypto, but it is locked until you repay the loan. Q2: Why would someone use a crypto-backed loan instead of selling? A: To avoid capital gains taxes and maintain exposure to potential future price appreciation of their cryptocurrency. It provides immediate cash without a sale. Q3: Is Sberbank offering these loans right now? A: No. The bank has stated it is “considering” the service and is ready to work with regulators to develop the necessary framework and infrastructure. Q4: What are the biggest risks for the borrower? A: The main risk is volatility. If the value of your collateral falls significantly, you may face a “margin call” and need to add more crypto or risk having it liquidated to cover the loan. Q5: How does this help cryptocurrency adoption? A: When a major, state-owned bank treats crypto as legitimate loan collateral, it signals trust and utility to the broader market, encouraging more institutional and mainstream acceptance. Q6: Could other banks offer this soon? A: Sberbank’s move could pressure competitors. If they establish a successful model, banks in other regions with clearer crypto regulations might accelerate their own plans. Found this insight into the future of banking fascinating?

56383087,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254401,1766732111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japan’s Bold Move: Pioneering a New Era of Crypto and Stablecoin Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-new-crypto-regulation-division/,"BitcoinWorld Japan’s Bold Move: Pioneering a New Era of Crypto and Stablecoin Regulation In a decisive step that signals its commitment to becoming a global digital asset hub, Japan is set to overhaul its financial oversight framework. The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will establish a dedicated division for Japan crypto regulation next summer, specifically targeting virtual assets and stablecoins. This move underscores Japan’s proactive approach to balancing innovation with investor protection in a rapidly evolving market. Why is Japan Creating a Special Crypto Division? Japan has long been a frontrunner in establishing clear rules for digital assets. However, the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the global rise of stablecoins have created new complexities. The current regulatory structure, while robust, needed more specialized focus. Therefore, the FSA’s decision to create a standalone division is a direct response to these market developments. It aims to provide sharper oversight and foster a more secure environment for both businesses and consumers engaging with cryptocurrencies. What Does This Mean for Japan Crypto Regulation? The new division will concentrate its efforts on two primary areas: virtual assets (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) and payment-focused stablecoins. This specialized focus is crucial. It means regulators can develop deeper expertise, craft more nuanced policies, and respond faster to emerging trends than a general financial bureau could. The plan is part of a broader organizational reshuffle that also creates an Asset Management and Insurance Supervision Bureau, showing a comprehensive upgrade of Japan’s financial watchdog capabilities. The implications are significant for the industry: Clearer Guidelines: Companies can expect more tailored and predictable regulatory frameworks. Enhanced Security: Increased oversight aims to reduce fraud and protect users. Boosted Innovation: Legal certainty often attracts investment and encourages responsible technological development. How Will Stablecoins Be Affected by Japan’s New Rules? Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the yen or dollar, are a key target for the new division. Japan passed a groundbreaking law to regulate stablecoins in 2022, restricting their issuance to licensed banks, trust companies, and money transfer agents. The new FSA division will be the primary body enforcing these rules, ensuring stablecoin issuers operate with the same rigor as traditional financial institutions. This could set a powerful global precedent for how nations oversee these pivotal payment instruments. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While the move is widely seen as positive, challenges remain. Regulators must avoid stifling innovation with overly restrictive rules. They also need to coordinate with international bodies to manage cross-border crypto activities effectively. However, the opportunities are immense. By building a reputation for strong yet sensible Japan crypto regulation , the country positions itself as a safe harbor for legitimate crypto businesses. This could attract significant foreign investment and talent, solidifying Tokyo’s status as a leading financial technology center. In summary, Japan’s creation of a dedicated crypto and stablecoin division is a landmark development. It reflects a mature, forward-thinking strategy to integrate digital assets into the formal economy. This structured approach not only mitigates risks but also actively cultivates a thriving and secure ecosystem for the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will Japan’s new crypto regulatory division start operating? A1: The division is scheduled to be established in the summer of 2024 as part of the FSA’s approved organizational restructuring. Q2: What is the main goal of this new division? A2: Its primary goal is to provide specialized oversight and develop tailored policies for the virtual asset and stablecoin markets, enhancing both consumer protection and market innovation. Q3: How does this affect existing crypto exchanges in Japan? A3: Existing licensed exchanges will engage with this new, more specialized regulator. It may lead to clearer operational guidelines and potentially more efficient licensing processes for new services. Q4: Will this make Japan a more attractive market for crypto companies? A4: Yes, likely. Clear and expert regulation reduces legal uncertainty, which is a major factor for businesses considering where to establish operations. Japan’s move signals stability and long-term commitment. Q5: Does this mean Japan is banning any crypto activities? A5> No, quite the opposite. This move is about creating a structured, safe environment for crypto activities to grow, not to ban them. It’s an endorsement of the sector’s importance. Q6: How does Japan’s stablecoin regulation compare to other countries? A6: Japan is among the first major economies to enact specific laws regulating stablecoin issuance, placing it at the forefront of global regulatory efforts in this area.

The clip featured comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on financial regulation, capital markets, and payment systems. In the clip, Bessent spoke about reviewing regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems. He also discussed reforms aimed at strengthening American capital markets and improving access. Adding to his comments, Rietveld stated that XRP is built to fit that role Bessent described. $XRP Is Built For This! pic.twitter.com/WNDUoeFPC4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 22, 2025 A Focus on Removing Regulatory Barriers Bessent spoke directly about the need to confront outdated rules. “We will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems,” he said. That statement is crucial for assets built around real-world use cases and payments. XRP was created to move value quickly, at low cost, and across borders. Regulatory friction has limited adoption in key markets. A push to reassess those barriers signals a shift away from restrictive frameworks that slow innovation. Bessent also tied reform to market strength. He said policymakers would “consider reforms to unleash the awesome power of the American capital markets.” XRP operates at the intersection of payments and capital flows. A system that clears transactions faster supports deeper liquidity and more efficient settlement . Stablecoins and Payment Infrastructure Bessent’s reference to stablecoins and new payment systems also aligns with the XRP ecosystem. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is built for regulated payments and settlement, targeting institutional and compliant use cases. RLUSD settles in seconds on the XRP Ledger with low and predictable fees. As transaction volume grows, network activity increases, and XRP is used for transaction fees, directly linking stablecoin adoption to demand for XRP .

The money didn’t come from product launches or economic growth. It came from people betting big on chips, servers, and promises. By Christmas Eve, the top 10 tech founders and CEOs controlled nearly $2.5 trillion, up from $1.9 trillion at the beginning of the year, according to Bloomberg. The massive jump came as the S&P 500 climbed more than 18%, and the hype around AI infrastructure kept stocks like Tesla, Nvidia, and Oracle inflated. “This is all speculative and correlated to the success of AI,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and OpenAI consultant. “There’s a huge question mark over whether this is all going to pay off, but investors are betting that it will.” Musk retakes top spot as Oracle and Meta stumble Elon Musk ended the year back on top, with a net worth now sitting at $645 billion, a 49% jump. Cryptopolitan had reported that Elon briefly fell behind Larry Ellison in September, but a $1 trillion Tesla pay deal helped pull him ahead again. His rocket company SpaceX, now worth $800 billion, also added to his stack. Larry, who runs Oracle, had hit $251 billion this year after announcing a $300 billion data center contract with OpenAI. That deal gave his net worth a 31% lift. But after reaching that high, Oracle’s stock dropped 40%, as investors started asking questions about how he planned to fund such a huge build-out. Mark Zuckerberg, who oversees Meta, saw his rank drop after the company’s stock slipped. Investors weren’t thrilled about how much Meta has been spending on AI servers and big-name talent. Zuckerberg’s net worth still grew 14% to $236 billion, but that wasn’t enough to keep him in the top five. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded Google, both shot up the ladder this year. Page is now worth $270 billion, up 61%, while Brin hit $251 billion, with a 59% gain. Their push into building AI models and chips gave them the edge they needed to leap ahead of Zuck and Larry El. Nvidia’s Huang cashes out as Gates drops off Jensen Huang, who founded Nvidia, saw his wealth grow 37%, ending the year at $156 billion. Nvidia became the most valuable public company in the world this year, now worth over $4 trillion, though Jensen has also sold over $1 billion worth of stock, this year. Jeff Bezos wasn’t quiet either. He offloaded $5.6 billion worth of Amazon shares, ending the year at $255 billion, up 7%. Michael Dell sold more than $2 billion in Dell stock and now holds $141 billion, a 14% increase. At the bottom of the pile sits Billy Gates. He’s the only one in the top 10 whose net worth dropped. He sold off chunks of his Microsoft stock throughout the year to keep funding his charity work, bringing his total down 26% to $118 billion.

All eyes are fixed on one economic indicator that could send shockwaves through currency markets: the Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI). This isn’t just another data release—it’s a potential catalyst that could force the Bank of Japan to abandon its ultra-loose monetary policy stance, reshaping the entire regional currency dynamic. For cryptocurrency traders watching traditional finance signals, this moment represents a crucial intersection where inflation data meets central bank credibility. Why Tokyo CPI Data Holds the Key to Asia FX Direction In the world of currency markets , Tokyo’s inflation numbers serve as the most reliable leading indicator for nationwide Japanese price trends. Unlike other economic reports that might offer mixed signals, the Tokyo CPI provides the first concrete evidence each month of whether inflationary pressures are building or receding in Japan’s economy. This makes it particularly significant for the Bank of Japan , which has maintained negative interest rates while other major central banks have been aggressively tightening policy. The upcoming release isn’t just about numbers—it’s about whether Japan’s central bank can maintain its current stance or will be forced into a policy pivot that could trigger massive currency movements across Asia FX pairs. The Thin Volume Trap: Navigating Dangerous Currency Markets Current currency markets present a particularly treacherous environment for traders. With many Western participants away for holiday periods and Asian markets operating with reduced staffing, liquidity has evaporated from several key pairs. This creates a dangerous scenario where even moderate-sized trades can trigger exaggerated price movements. Consider these critical factors affecting Asia FX trading conditions: Reduced Market Depth: Order books are thinner than usual, meaning support and resistance levels may not hold as expected Increased Volatility Risk: The combination of thin volumes and pending economic data creates perfect conditions for sudden price spikes Liquidity Concentration: Trading activity has concentrated in fewer currency pairs, primarily USD/JPY and AUD/USD Algorithmic Dominance: With human traders less active, algorithmic systems may dominate price action, potentially creating erratic movements Bank of Japan’s Dilemma: Inflation Versus Economic Stability The Bank of Japan faces what might be its most challenging policy decision in decades. On one hand, Governor Kazuo Ueda has repeatedly emphasized the need to maintain accommodative conditions to support Japan’s fragile economic recovery. On the other hand, persistent inflation above the 2% target threatens to undermine the central bank’s credibility and could trigger a disorderly yen depreciation. The upcoming Tokyo CPI data will provide crucial evidence about which pressure is winning. For Asia FX traders, understanding this dilemma is essential—a hawkish pivot from the BOJ would strengthen the yen and potentially weaken other Asian currencies, while continued dovishness could trigger further yen weakness and boost regional export competitors. Currency Pair Current Level Key Resistance Key Support Tokyo CPI Impact Scenario USD/JPY 148.50 150.00 147.00 Above-forecast CPI could trigger break below 147.00 AUD/JPY 97.80 99.00 96.50 Higher inflation may push pair toward 96.00 support EUR/JPY 160.25 162.00 158.50 Strong CPI data could test 158.00 level CNY/JPY 20.45 20.70 20.20 BOJ policy shift might strengthen cross to 20.00 Monetary Policy Crossroads: How Asian Central Banks Are Reacting The Bank of Japan ‘s impending decision doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it comes at a time when regional central banks are already navigating complex monetary policy challenges. South Korea’s central bank has maintained a hawkish bias despite economic headwinds, while the Reserve Bank of Australia has paused its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing inflation. China’s People’s Bank of China continues to provide targeted stimulus to support economic recovery. This creates a fascinating dynamic for Asia FX markets: a BOJ policy shift could either trigger coordinated regional responses or create divergent paths that increase currency volatility. The Tokyo CPI data will provide the first clue about whether Asian central banks will face renewed pressure to align their policies or can continue on independent paths. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Tokyo CPI Release Trading the Tokyo CPI release requires more than just watching the headline number. Savvy currency markets participants should consider these strategic approaches: Focus on Core Measures: The Bank of Japan pays closest attention to core-core CPI (excluding fresh food and energy). This measure provides the clearest signal about underlying inflation trends Watch Yield Curve Control: Any hint that the BOJ might adjust its yield curve control parameters could be more significant than interest rate changes themselves Monitor Currency Intervention Levels: Japanese authorities have previously intervened around the 152 level in USD/JPY. Current levels are approaching this danger zone Consider Correlation Plays: A stronger yen typically pressures other Asian currencies. Consider how USD/JPY movements might affect AUD/USD, USD/CNH, and USD/KRW Prepare for False Breaks: Thin volumes mean initial reactions might be exaggerated. Wait for confirmation before committing to new positions The Cryptocurrency Connection: How Traditional FX Moves Impact Digital Assets For cryptocurrency traders, developments in Asia FX markets might seem distant, but they create important ripple effects. A significant yen movement can influence broader risk sentiment, which directly affects cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, any shift in Bank of Japan policy could change capital flows between traditional and digital assets. Japanese investors have been active participants in cryptocurrency markets, and changes in domestic monetary conditions could alter their investment behavior. Furthermore, as regulatory frameworks evolve, the relationship between traditional currency markets and digital assets continues to strengthen, making events like the Tokyo CPI release relevant to a broader spectrum of financial market participants. FAQs: Understanding the Tokyo CPI and Asia FX Dynamics What exactly is the Tokyo CPI and why is it so important? The Tokyo Consumer Price Index measures price changes for goods and services in Japan’s capital city. It’s released about a month before the national CPI, making it the earliest reliable indicator of Japanese inflation trends. For the Bank of Japan , this data provides crucial evidence about whether inflationary pressures are becoming entrenched in the economy. How might the Bank of Japan react to stronger-than-expected inflation data? The Bank of Japan faces a delicate balancing act. Strong inflation could force Governor Kazuo Ueda to consider several options: adjusting yield curve control parameters, ending negative interest rates, or simply signaling a more hawkish future path. Any of these actions would likely strengthen the yen and create volatility across Asia FX markets. Which Asian currencies are most sensitive to Bank of Japan policy changes? The South Korean won (KRW) and Australian dollar (AUD) typically show the strongest reactions to yen movements, as these economies compete with Japan in key export markets. The Chinese yuan (CNY) also responds, though often through managed channels. Emerging market currencies throughout Southeast Asia can experience secondary effects as capital flows adjust to changing interest rate differentials. How do thin trading volumes affect market reactions to economic data? Reduced liquidity means that price movements can be exaggerated and less reflective of fundamental value. Stop-loss orders may be triggered more easily, and spreads between bid and ask prices can widen significantly. This creates both danger and opportunity in currency markets , as initial reactions may reverse once normal liquidity returns. What should cryptocurrency traders watch during this period? Cryptocurrency traders should monitor USD/JPY as a key risk sentiment indicator. Significant yen strength often corresponds with reduced risk appetite, which can pressure cryptocurrency prices. Additionally, watch for any statements from Japan’s Financial Services Agency regarding digital asset regulation, as policy coordination between traditional and crypto markets continues to evolve. Conclusion: The Calm Before the Currency Storm The current subdued trading in Asia FX markets represents the calm before a potential storm. The Tokyo CPI release isn’t just another economic statistic—it’s a trigger that could force the Bank of Japan to confront reality after years of extraordinary monetary accommodation. For traders across all currency markets , this moment requires careful positioning, disciplined risk management, and awareness that thin volumes can transform ordinary data releases into market-moving events. The decisions made in Tokyo will reverberate through Asian trading desks, influence global capital flows, and potentially reshape currency relationships for months to come. In this environment, information isn’t just power—it’s profit.

Major exchange Bithumb will delist EVZ , ceasing all trading support for the token on January 26. This decision highlights the rigorous standards exchanges enforce and serves as a crucial reminder for token holders. Let’s break down exactly what happened and what you need to do next. Why is Bithumb Delisting EVZ? The core reason for the Bithumb delist EVZ action stems from compliance and transparency issues. According to the exchange’s official notice, the EVZ project foundation failed to provide sufficient explanatory materials after being flagged as an “investment warning” item. Furthermore, Bithumb reviewed the damage from a past security incident involving the token and the foundation’s subsequent public statements. The exchange concluded that EVZ no longer meets its criteria for maintaining a listing, leading to the scheduled removal. What Does the Bithumb EVZ Delisting Timeline Look Like? Bithumb has set a clear schedule for the Bithumb delist EVZ process. All trading support for EVZ will end precisely at 06:00 AM UTC on Friday, January 26. Therefore, token holders have a limited window to take action. Here is the critical timeline: Trading Halt: EVZ/KRW trading stops at 06:00 AM UTC, Jan 26. Withdrawal Deadline: Users must withdraw their EVZ tokens from Bithumb before a specified future date (to be announced). Post-Delisting: After the deadline, withdrawals will be suspended, and unclaimed tokens may be handled according to the exchange’s policy. This decisive action underscores that exchanges like Bithumb continuously monitor listed projects. Failure to meet ongoing requirements for communication, security, and regulatory cooperation can result in removal. How Should EVZ Holders on Bithumb Respond? If you hold EVZ tokens on Bithumb, immediate action is required. You cannot afford to be passive. First, you must decide whether to sell your EVZ holdings before the trading halt or withdraw them to a private, self-custody wallet that supports the token. The safest course is often to move your assets off the exchange before the deadline to maintain control. Always double-check the destination wallet address to avoid irreversible loss. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Listings Overall? The Bithumb delist EVZ event is not an isolated case. It reflects a broader trend of increasing scrutiny in the crypto industry. Exchanges are tightening their listing standards to protect users and comply with evolving regulations. For investors, this means: Due Diligence is Key: Research a project’s team, communication history, and security record before investing. Listing is Not Permanent: A token’s presence on a major exchange is not a guarantee of its long-term viability. Compliance Matters: Projects must maintain transparent and cooperative relationships with trading platforms. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that the market is maturing. Accountability from both projects and exchanges is becoming the new norm. Conclusion: A Lesson in Market Accountability The decision for Bithumb to delist EVZ is a clear signal of the exchange’s commitment to its operational standards. While disruptive for current holders, such actions are essential for a healthy ecosystem. They filter out projects that fail to meet basic requirements for transparency and security, ultimately protecting the broader investor community. As the market evolves, both investors and projects must prioritize robust fundamentals and clear communication. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What time exactly will Bithumb stop EVZ trading? A: Trading for EVZ on Bithumb will cease at 06:00 AM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on January 26. Q: Can I still withdraw my EVZ from Bithumb after January 26? A: Yes, Bithumb typically provides a withdrawal period after trading stops. However, you must complete your withdrawal before their announced final deadline to avoid losing access to your tokens on the platform. Q: Why did Bithumb decide to delist EVZ? A: Bithumb cited the EVZ foundation’s failure to submit sufficient materials regarding its “investment warning” designation and concerns stemming from a past security incident and the project’s public statements. Q: Will EVZ be traded on other exchanges after this? A: The Bithumb delisting does not automatically affect EVZ listings on other exchanges. However, the reasons for delisting may prompt reviews by other platforms. You should check the status on any other exchange where EVZ is listed. Q: What is the safest action for me as an EVZ holder on Bithumb? A: The most prudent action is to either sell your EVZ before the deadline or securely withdraw it to a compatible private wallet that you control, ensuring you maintain custody of your assets. Q: Does this mean EVZ is a scam? A: Bithumb’s announcement indicates EVZ failed to meet the exchange’s specific listing criteria, particularly around communication and compliance. It is a serious mark against the project but does not independently classify it as a scam. Investors should conduct their own thorough research.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was captured by Russian troops in March 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed a joint operation of the Plant with the US. He said the issue of Zaporizhzhia remains one of the most challenging points of the US peace plan for Ukraine. International communities, including the IAEA, have repeatedly stressed that any decisions regarding the plant without Ukraine’s participation are illegal. Ukraine Power Grid Crisis The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is currently not generating electricity for the grid due to its seizure by Russia in March 2022. Its six reactors are in a safety shutdown and depend solely on emergency diesel generators for essential cooling, with frequent cuts. Besides, more Russian drones and missiles than in previous years have left energy supplies at a tipping point. Per a WSJ report , Russia launched more than 5,000 missiles and long-range drones into Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure. Analysts at the private intelligence agency Molfar said in a study that three active crypto mining pools with six miners in Ukraine likely consumed 33 kW per hour. The data was collected from July 2023 to June 2024 using various open sources.

Its volatility is waning on the shorter timeframes. Why is SUI down? Sui’s dip reflects technical deterioration and unfavorable comparisons to Solana’s network resilience, compounded by broader risk aversion. Solana withstood a record 6 Tbps DDoS attack on December 14 without downtime. In contrast, Sui suffered delayed block production and degraded performance during a similar attack. While the 24h move was mild, the lack of bullish catalysts keeps the trend bearish. Recent news SUI was included in Bitwise’s Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, which holds 10 major cryptocurrencies. This ETF attracted $1.5B in assets, offering institutional investors regulated exposure to SUI alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Will SUI reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SUI will reach $10 in 2027, with an average of $10.83 for the year. Will SUI reach $100? It remains unlikely that SUI will rise to $100 before 2031. Will SUI reach $1,000? It remains unlikely that SUI will rise to $1,000 before 2031. How high can Sui go? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SUI will rise as high as $8 before the end of 2025. Is SUI crypto a good investment? Should the market sentiment change, SUI will rise to its previous highs. SUI’s price predictions for 2031 are optimistic as the global adoption of decentralized applications rises.

They tend to emerge as supply contracts, time evaporates, and interest has begun to cluster privately. That is our current position of this altcoin, which is priced at $0.035. With its ongoing stage heading towards the completion end, analysts and first movers are on the lookout. It is a setup that is starting to get used to those questioning what crypto they need to get currently before the next shift. The focal point of this focus is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a DeFi crypto that has been organizing steadily. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is developing as a decentralized protocol of lending and borrowing, wherein two models are considered. The peer to contract lending is the first one. Users deposit assets to liquidity pools and are given back mtTokens. These mtTokens are a part of their portion of the pool and get valuable with accruing interests. As an illustration, a user who deposits into a pool with the value of $6,000 in ETH, at a 7% APY, would observe an increase in the value of his or her mtTokens over time. The yield is automatic and reflects directly on the token balance. The second one is peer to peer borrowing. Under specified terms, borrowers borrow money under collateralized terms. The borrow rates will vary according to utilization or can be fixed or fixed according to the asset. The loan to value limits are established as per volatility. The less risky assets will be enabled to have greater LTVs, whereas the greater the risk of the token, the lower the limit. In case the collateral value is too low, the liquidations take place to ensure survival of the system and keep it liquid. Mutuum Finance is frequently remarked by analysts as having the flexibility to balance risk like traditional applications, as the majority of newer projects in DeFi have not. Momentum Presale and Supply Structure One of the best indicators in and around this new cryptocurrency has been Presale demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $19.45M and 18,650 current holders. There are 825M tokens that have been sold. The supply on the network is capped at 4B tokens, of which 45.5% are distributed to the presale, amounting to approximately 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is already over 99% allocated, i.e. supply at its current price is nearly exhausted. The course of price speaks for itself. Phase 1 investors joined at $0.01. MURM’s present presale value is at $0.035, which has increased by 250% in the presale only. The formal introduction price is pegged at $0.06 which puts the first movers in a good position compared to the present point. There has been a high level of community activity. A 24 hour leaderboard supports the highest daily depositor with $500 in MUTM making it a key motivating factor to maintain the engagements and so to speak cut the allocation. Market commentators commonly observe that a long-term involvement may be taken as a sign of confidence, and not a sign of short term frenzy. V1 Launch, Security and Analyst Outlook The milestones of development are looming soon. In the official statements posted on X , V1 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending and borrowing protocol will be available on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Main elements will consist of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and an automated liquidator robot. The first assets supported will be ETH and USDT. Security has been tackled at the onset. Mutuum Finance has now undergone a CertiK audit of 90/100 token scan rating. Moreover, there is an ongoing independent audit of Halborn security , which evaluates completed contracts. The early adoption of audited code and working protocol can have a major impact on early adoption according to some analysts. In the bullish scenarios, it has been projected that increasing the current level of around $0.035 to and above launch price of $0.06 would help to sustain 200% to 300% growth over time provided that utility centers in the case of usage develop as anticipated. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Plans In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance is going to launch a stablecoin which is pegged to various assets according to the official roadmap. This enables the borrowers to resort to a variety of collateral instead of having only one token. The system is able to distribute risks thus making it more stable amidst unstable market conditions. The roadmap also includes layer 2 integration. Reduced charges and quicker processing is paramount to lending conditions in which customers and clients conduct transactions regularly. Lower prices make access easier and wider involvement is possible which analysts have been credited with as a defining factor in long term adoption. Everything will be based on reliable pricing. The protocol architecture projects decentralized oracle feeds like Chainlink, which are backed by fallback sources. Precise pricing holds critical importance in collateral valuation and liquidations particularly in nimble movements in the market. Final Thoughts With Phase 6 close at hand of fulfillment, this is an altcoin that is coming to a critical juncture. The presale demand, the stipulated supply restrictions, and future development targets are also on the same page convergence. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto that represents the potential best cheap cryptocurrency to monitor prior to the next step instead of being a hype-driven investment project. The window of early positioning is closing rapidly, with allocation almost in place, and V1 almost ahead.

According to a report from The Block, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison is scheduled for release from custody on January 21, 2026 . This date marks a significant moment, arriving one month earlier than her originally scheduled release. For those following the fallout from the FTX implosion, the Caroline Ellison release represents a pivotal point in the ongoing story of accountability and consequence in the crypto world. What Led to the Caroline Ellison Release Date? Ellison’s path to this early release began with her cooperation in the massive case against FTX and Alameda Research. She was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy. Her testimony was crucial in the trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The judicial system often reduces sentences for substantial cooperation, which explains her transfer to a halfway house in mid-December and this accelerated Caroline Ellison release timeline. Why Was Caroline Ellison a Central Figure in the FTX Saga? To understand the weight of her release, we must look at her role. As CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison was at the helm of FTX’s sister trading firm. Prosecutors proved that she, under direction, used billions in FTX customer funds to prop up Alameda’s risky bets. This direct link between the exchange and the hedge fund was the core of the fraud. Her admission of guilt and detailed court testimony painted a clear picture of the mechanisms behind the collapse. Key Admission: Ellison confessed to creating misleading financial documents to hide Alameda’s massive debt from lenders and investors. Central Role: She managed the day-to-day operations where FTX customer funds were improperly funneled. Cooperation: Her decision to plead guilty and work with prosecutors was a turning point in the government’s case. What Does an Early Release Signal for the Crypto Industry? The Caroline Ellison release is more than a personal milestone; it’s a symbol. For the industry, it closes a chapter on one of its darkest periods. However, it also serves as a permanent reminder of the need for robust oversight and ethical leadership. Her case demonstrated that individuals face real consequences for fraud, even in the innovative and fast-moving crypto space. The conclusion of her sentence allows the market and its observers to continue focusing on building more transparent and trustworthy systems. What Comes After Prison for Caroline Ellison? With her release imminent, questions naturally turn to the future. What will life after prison look like for the former executive? While she has fulfilled her legal sentence, the professional and personal repercussions are lifelong. She is likely to face years of scrutiny and a drastically changed career landscape. Furthermore, her story will remain a case study in corporate governance failures for years to come. The Caroline Ellison release on January 21, 2026, draws a definitive line under a major part of the FTX narrative. It underscores a simple truth in finance, whether traditional or digital: accountability follows misconduct. Her early departure from custody concludes the penal portion of her journey, but the lessons from her actions continue to resonate powerfully across the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When exactly is Caroline Ellison being released? A: Caroline Ellison is scheduled to be released from custody on January 21, 2026.

Trading firm QCP Capital executed a substantial QCP Capital deposit of Bitcoin and Ethereum to Binance, a move often scrutinized for its potential market implications. This transaction, involving tens of millions in value, provides a real-time case study in institutional behavior and its ripple effects. What Does the QCP Capital Deposit to Binance Mean? On-chain analytics provider OnchainLenz reported the transaction. A wallet linked to QCP Capital transferred 400 BTC (worth ~$35.7M) and 200 ETH (worth ~$597K) to the Binance exchange. In the crypto ecosystem, large deposits from private wallets to centralized exchanges are frequently interpreted as preparatory steps for selling. This QCP Capital deposit therefore acts as a potential indicator of near-term selling pressure, offering a glimpse into the strategic moves of a major player. Why Do Large Exchange Deposits Matter for Crypto Prices? Understanding this flow is crucial for market sentiment. When assets move to an exchange, they typically become more liquid and readily available for sale. Consequently, the market often views such movements with caution. However, it’s not a definitive sell signal. The deposit could also precede other activities like: Collateralization for trading derivatives or loans. OTC (Over-the-Counter) desk facilitation for a large private sale. Simple portfolio rebalancing between cold storage and active trading accounts. Therefore, while the QCP Capital deposit is a significant data point, it requires context alongside other market factors. How Can Traders Interpret Institutional Moves Like This? For individual investors, reacting to single transactions is risky. The key is to integrate this information into a broader analysis. This specific QCP Capital deposit highlights the importance of monitoring on-chain data. By watching the flows of large holders, often called “whales,” traders can gauge potential shifts in supply and demand. The actionable insight here is vigilance, not immediate action. Watch for follow-up on-chain activity, such as if the funds are withdrawn back to cold storage or if large sell orders appear on Binance’s order books. What Are the Broader Implications for Bitcoin and Ethereum? This event underscores the mature, institutional nature of today’s crypto markets. Firms like QCP Capital manage enormous portfolios, and their operational moves can influence short-term volatility. For Bitcoin and Ethereum, such deposits test market depth and resilience. A successful absorption of potential selling pressure from a $36.3 million QCP Capital deposit would demonstrate strong underlying demand. Conversely, it could trigger a brief downturn if the market sentiment is already fragile. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The recent QCP Capital deposit to Binance is a powerful reminder that crypto markets are transparent ledgers. Major moves are visible to all, providing valuable, if sometimes ambiguous, signals. While it suggests a potential increase in sell-side liquidity, smart traders will use it as one piece of a larger puzzle, combining it with technical analysis, macroeconomic trends, and other on-chain metrics before making decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the QCP Capital deposit a guaranteed sign they will sell? A: Not guaranteed. While often a precursor to selling, large exchange deposits can also be for collateral, OTC trades, or fund management. Q2: How was the wallet identified as belonging to QCP Capital? A: Analytics firms use clustering heuristics, past transaction patterns, and known addresses to label wallets, though it’s often an educated presumption. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this news? A> Making a trading decision based on a single transaction is not advisable. Use it as contextual data within your overall strategy. Q4: What is the difference between an exchange deposit and a transfer? A: A deposit to an exchange moves funds into its custodial wallet for trading. A transfer between two private wallets does not directly increase immediate sell pressure. Q5: Where can I track similar on-chain transactions? A: Platforms like Etherscan, Blockchain.com explorers, and dedicated analytics services like Glassnode or Nansen provide this data. Found this analysis of the QCP Capital deposit insightful?

The trading halt is set for 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 26, 2026. This decision sends a clear message about the exchange’s commitment to rigorous asset standards and directly impacts DICE holders. Let’s break down the reasons and repercussions. Why is Bithumb Delisting Klaydice (DICE)? The core reason for the Bithumb delist Klaydice action stems from unresolved regulatory concerns. Bithumb had previously flagged DICE as an “investment warning asset.” The Klaydice foundation submitted materials to address these issues, but the exchange found them insufficient. Therefore, after a comprehensive review of the token’s trading activity and overall market adoption, Bithumb concluded DICE no longer meets its criteria for continued support. What Does This Delisting Mean for Investors? If you hold DICE on Bithumb, immediate action is required. The exchange will suspend all trading pairs for DICE at the specified time. After that, you will not be able to buy, sell, or trade the token on their platform. However, you can still withdraw your DICE tokens to a private wallet that supports them. Here is a quick checklist for affected users: Stop Trading: Cease all DICE trading activity on Bithumb before the deadline. Withdraw Funds: Move your DICE tokens to a compatible external wallet if you wish to retain them. Explore Alternatives: Research other exchanges that may still support DICE trading, understanding the risks involved. How Do Exchanges Like Bithumb Decide to Delist a Token? The decision to delist Klaydice wasn’t made lightly. Exchanges like Bithumb constantly monitor listed assets against a set of strict criteria. These often include: Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to local and international financial regulations. Trading Volume & Liquidity: Sustained healthy market activity. Project Development & Communication: Active development and transparent communication from the project team. Community & Market Stability: Avoiding assets associated with excessive volatility or manipulation. In the case of DICE, the failure to resolve the “investment warning” status was the critical failing point. What’s Next for the Klaydice (DICE) Project? Being delisted from a major exchange like Bithumb is a serious challenge for any cryptocurrency project. It typically leads to reduced liquidity, lower visibility, and can shake investor confidence. The onus is now on the Klaydice foundation to demonstrate stronger compliance and project viability to other platforms and its community. This event serves as a stark reminder of the importance of regulatory diligence in the crypto space. Conclusion: A Lesson in Crypto Due Diligence The Bithumb delist Klaydice announcement underscores a vital trend: major exchanges are tightening their listing standards to protect users and ensure market integrity. For investors, it reinforces the need for thorough research, focusing on projects with clear utility, strong governance, and proactive compliance. Always remember that in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, exchange support is not guaranteed and can change based on evolving standards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When exactly will Bithumb delist DICE? Bithumb will suspend all trading for Klaydice (DICE) at 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 26, 2026. Can I still withdraw my DICE tokens after delisting? Yes, Bithumb will allow users to withdraw their DICE tokens to a private wallet for a period after trading is suspended. Check their official announcement for the specific withdrawal deadline. Why was DICE given an “investment warning” status? While Bithumb’s full report isn’t public, “investment warning” status is typically assigned due to concerns over regulatory compliance, low liquidity, or issues with the project’s transparency and development activity. Will DICE be traded on other exchanges? It may still be available on other, smaller exchanges. However, investors should carefully research the reputation and security of any alternative platform. What should I do if my DICE tokens are on Bithumb? You should either trade them for another asset or withdraw them to your own non-custodial wallet before the delisting deadline to maintain control over your assets. Does this mean the Klaydice project is shutting down? Not necessarily. Delisting from one exchange does not mean the project ceases operation. However, it is a significant setback that the project team must address. Share Your Thoughts Delistings are pivotal moments that affect entire communities. Did this decision surprise you?

56385796,648760,1766736006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56385796.jpeg,"CZ Responds After Bitcoin Briefly ‘Crashes’ To $24,000 On Binance",https://bitcoinist.com/cz-bitcoin-crash-to-24000-on-binance/,"Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pushed back after a screenshot showing bitcoin at roughly $24,111 on Binance went viral on X, arguing the move was a microstructure glitch on a thin, newly listed BTC/USD1 pair rather than a broader market crash and that the exchange itself “is NOT involved in trades.” Did Bitcoin Really Crash To $24,000? The sharp wick appeared isolated to BTC/USD1, a market quoted in USD1, a stablecoin launched by Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial. Within seconds, the pair snapped back toward prevailing bitcoin prices above $87,000, according to exchange data cited by traders sharing the screenshot. CZ’s explanation was straightforward: on an illiquid order book, a single aggressive order can print an extreme price before arbitrage closes the gap. “This actually shows the exchange is NOT involved in trades. Low liquidity on new pairs means one large market order can spike prices, but arbitrageurs quickly corrected it. No liquidations occurred, as this pair isn’t included in any index.” The Binance founder shared a breakdown from Head of Business Development of Solv Protocol Catherine Chan who said the move was “a liquidity event,” not a bitcoin collapse. She tied the dislocation to a Binance-and-USD1 promotion offering a 20% fixed APY deposit deal that, she claimed, pushed users to swap USDT into USD1 and briefly drove USD1 to a premium. “Many users swapped USDT → USD1, pushing USD1 to a 0.39% premium: huge for a stablecoin. Smart money borrowed USD1 on @lista_dao against SolvBTC or SolvBTC-BTCB smart lending markets (~0.5% APY). They either deposited USD1 directly or sold it slowly on spot to meet demand. Then someone thought: ‘Why not just sell via BTC/USD1?’ They used a market order. Problem: BTC/USD1 has very thin liquidity. That market order wiped out most buy orders, briefly causing a very low price,” Catherine explained. “Arbitrage bots instantly bought it back,” she wrote. “No fundamentals changed. No mass liquidations.” The episode also picked up a familiar edge of crypto paranoia. One user, Bera (@doomsdart), framed it as a coordinated signal: “Cz and Trump family are telling us what they’re gonna do to our coins. Get ready.” CZ’s reply, by contrast, suggested the opposite — that the speed of arbitrage, and the absence of cascading liquidations, is evidence the venue wasn’t “printing” a market-wide price at all. For traders, the takeaway is less dramatic than the screenshot implied, but still relevant: new quote-asset pairs can be structurally fragile, and promotions that rapidly concentrate flow into a single stablecoin can leave unusually thin order books in their wake. In that kind of market, a single market order can create a headline before it creates a trend.

This move has begun to reshape the market’s perception of the asset. His post focused on holder profitability, a metric that often reveals pressure building beneath the surface before major moves occur. According to Steph, almost 50% of XRP’s circulating supply is now underwater. He noted that the share of supply in profit has dropped to 52% after weeks of steady decline .

As XRP’s price weakened, the profitable supply fell. This signals that more tokens last moved at higher prices than current levels. In past cycles, this metric has worked as a stress gauge for the market. When most holders sit in profit, selling pressure rises as investors lock in gains. When profitability compresses toward the middle or lower range, selling often slows. Fewer holders want to realize losses. Supply tightens, and XRP’s price becomes more sensitive to new demand . The current reading places XRP in that compression zone. Nearly half of all circulating XRP now reflects unrealized losses. That condition tends to increase emotional risk during further downside, but it also removes a large portion of immediate sell pressure from profit-takers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Repeating History? Steph pointed out that XRP last reached similar profitability levels in November 2024. At that time, the market showed the same deterioration in holder profit before price reversed sharply. XRP then rallied more than 500% in the months that followed. The comparison relies on structure, and not sentiment or narrative shifts. In November 2024, XRP moved from a state where losses dominated supply into a rapid repricing phase once demand returned. The current setup mirrors that earlier period in terms of supply positioning. Markets never offer certainty, but the historical parallel strengthens the bullish case. If demand stabilizes or increases, even modest inflows can have a huge effect on XRP. With fewer holders in profit, resistance from overhead supply weakens. Downside risk may already be well distributed across holders, and we could see XRP repeat history if buyers step in forcefully.

BLOX provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, blending ETPs, crypto-related equities, and active options trading for income generation. Distributions are largely classified as return of capital, offering tax deferral benefits for taxable accounts, though recent payouts have declined with crypto weakness. BLOX may outperform in a prolonged crypto downturn by providing steady income, but will lag pure-play crypto funds if the sector rebounds sharply. For anyone that's been living under a rock, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other major cryptocurrencies have not been doing so well as of late. While gold and stocks notch new highs, Bitcoin is over 5% lower than where it was at the start of the year. Data by YCharts While we're still above the April lows, Bitcoin peaked in October and has been on a consistent downtrend since then, with some stabilization around current levels, although it's unclear how long this will hold. This article isn't about Bitcoin per se, but about the average crypto investor and what they can do to weather these kinds of moments. For my regular readers, the answer is usually the same from me: try to earn some income while you wait. With crypto, it's little different. Enter the Nicholas Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), which debuted back in June this year. Inception 6/16/25 Price $18.60 Distribution Rate 36% Dividend Amount (TTM) $3.84 Dividend Frequency Weekly Return of Capital Estimate ~54% Assets Under Management $219.49M Expense Ratio 1.03% BLOX ETF Overview The fund, on its website , promises: BLOX is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that provides exposure to blockchain technology to enhance income and provide portfolio diversification. The fund blends digital asset-related investments and traditional income-generating securities to capture growth potential in emerging technologies while maintaining a focus on risk-adjusted returns. And it should be of note that ""digital asset-related investments"" is a key phrase here, and a little nebulous (likely on purpose). Here's another excerpt from the website on this note: The Fund does not invest directly in bitcoin, ether or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of bitcoin, ether or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of bitcoin or ether. This may be a bit confusing, but I think this wording is supposed to exclude holding cryptocurrencies directly on the ETF balance sheet. Instead, they invest through exchange-traded products (""ETPs""). They definitely invest in Bitcoin and ether ETPs, as evidenced by their holdings in HODL , FBTC , and ETHA . To be clear, while the above quoted statement is true, the fund does have exposure to the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum. When looking at the holdings, here's what we see: Seeking Alpha Over 25% of the fund's holdings are ETPs that directly track cryptocurrency price changes. The rest of the fund is spread out across related companies, some directly engaged in cryptocurrency mining operations like HUT and IREN; others in the manufacture of the chips that can be used to mine cryptocurrencies like TSM and NVDA ; those engaged in cryptocurrency finances like COIN ; and those engaged in crypto-treasury operations like MSTR and BMNR . These holdings are subject to change day-to-day, and so keep in mind that the fund will not always look like this, as it is actively managed. The number of holdings is rather high because the fund also owns a lot of options, which are used to generate the income the fund kicks out. Most of these companies pay little to no dividends. In fact, most pay nothing at all. So options are bought and sold to generate income for the fund, which is then distributed to shareholders. The options portion of the portfolio looks like this and is a tangled mess that only the active managers really understand the purpose of. This is one of the catches to investing in funds like BLOX because one needs in management's ability to run these options and do so profitably. XFunds/Nicholas Wealth BLOX ETF Dividends The BLOX ETF pays weekly, which is not necessarily a plus from my perspective because I see the frequency of dividends as mostly irrelevant -- I'd even go so far as to say that a tighter frequency may put pressure on the manager to take aggressive positions that they otherwise might not if they had more time to generate the income necessary for distributions -- but it is absolutely a pro for some income investors who prefer the faster turnaround on distributions. Here are its past two months of distributions: XFunds/Nicholas Wealth And here they are visualized over time: Data by YCharts Dividends have fallen to all-time low levels, largely because of the recent sell-off in cryptocurrencies. I would imagine that when these kinds of things sell off, the managers tend to reduce their short exposure with the options providing for more upside in a recovery, but lowering distributions for current shareholders. So this is to be expected to some degree. So I wouldn't expect dividends to continue this trend unless cryptocurrencies continue their trend lower as well. If the sector bounces back, which would be a positive for the BLOX ETF because of its holdings, then we should expect dividends to kick back up towards the $0.15 range. A positive note on the dividend side is that distributions are largely counted as return of capital (""RoC""). This is due to an IRS accounting rule that allows for options income generated inside the ETF structure and then returned to shareholders to be counted as ROC. This reduces one's cost basis when distributed instead of producing taxable events in the year that it is earned. This is largely favorable to investors in taxable accounts, as they can defer the taxes until they sell their shares. If your cost basis hits zero, all future distributions do create taxable events, but they're taxed at your long-term capital gains tax rate, which is typically higher than the income tax rate. Still making this preferable to ordinary income producing funds. For the year so far, BLOX estimates that over 50% of their distributions are ROC, with 39% in the last distribution. This can be found in the latest 19A1 form, but note that this is an estimate and not a full and complete total that should be relied upon for tax reporting. 19a-1 form (XFunds/Nicholas Wealth) BLOX Performance One thing I found interesting is that BLOX has a variety of investments, some with more exposure to cryptocurrencies than others. NVIDIA, for example, has a much larger exposure to the AI trade and to cloud computing than it does to cryptocurrency. This varied exposure that indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies means that BLOX's performance does not track directly to cryptocurrencies at large. Here are a few charts showing BLOX's performance since its inception against various other instruments: BLOX vs. BTC & ETH ETFs, where we can see that BLOX has kept up with Ethereum and managed to, since its inception, avoid the losses that Bitcoin has generated despite its high allocation to Bitcoin ETFs. That allocation may have been different a while back because the funds' holdings are liable to change day-to-day. Data by YCharts BLOX vs. Crypto-Treasury Companies, where we can see BLOX vastly outperform pure-play Bitcoin adopters and convertible bond funds. While BLOX has an allocation to these assets, they are a smaller portion of the holdings and are likely the target for a lot of the short exposure via the options trading since they have very high volatilities. Data by YCharts BLOX vs. Broad Crypto ETF, where we can see how capping the upside with covered calls could cause the fund to underperform at times. NODE, by contrast, has no income component and is long-only with a very similar basket to BLOX. Both funds have different holdings but follow a similar ethos. Data by YCharts All told, BLOX seems to be a great way to diversify among crypto-related endeavors and is certainly better than a concentrated bet in times like this, where crypto is down and very volatile. For those not seeking income, NODE may be the better option, but that would be for another article, as I haven't covered VanEck's offering before. They're not a perfect one-to-one comparison. This underperformance may be due to the income, my best guess, but may also be due to the differences in holdings. More time is needed to tell on that front. The Crypto Bull Thesis Is it true that what goes down must come back up? If you are bullish on crypto, the answer seems to be yes. I understand why one would be bullish on crypto right now. Conservative institutions like Vanguard and Bank of America, who have long told customers that they were unable to purchase cryptocurrencies through them, have changed their minds. Bank of America is now recommending up to 4% exposure , and Vanguard is allowing their customers to buy crypto-related assets like Bitcoin ETFs and even the BLOX ETF itself. This change in institutions is very bullish for crypto, as is the current administration's stance on cryptocurrency, which is that they believe in deregulation and even adding Bitcoin to a future U.S. sovereign wealth fund . Less regulation for crypto treasury companies as well as less regulation for the crypto world at large allows for more adoption, more leverage to be taken, and more gains to be had. That is a very bullish look on the situation, of course, and doubters of cryptocurrencies should stay far away from this ETF and any like it. While the income could provide some padding for the downside, it is in no way going to make up for losses if cryptocurrencies continue to slide as dramatically as they have over the last few months. For a more complete take, I recommend this article from my colleague, Mandela Amoussou, that discusses the institutional adoption trends in more depth. Conclusion Ultimately, I was interested when I was first recommended from a reader to take a look at the BLOX ETF. It is not a fund that I am personally interested in investing in (as my crypto bets are more singularly focused, not broad), though it certainly has its merits, and I can see how someone looking for income and crypto exposure could benefit from this fund. What remains to be seen is if this recent drop is setting a new floor or has become the new ceiling. And either way, someone who is long-term bullish on crypto would benefit from getting the income in the meantime. If this drop in cryptocurrencies turns into a winter bear market from which crypto will be suppressed for some time, then BLOX is a great way to play it because it will continue to kick out income even at the lower levels while it waits for recovery. If recovery is further away than we expect, BLOX investors might be the winners over those investing in non-income broad funds like NODE or directly in the coins either through exchanges or through ETFs like IBIT, etc. Thanks for reading.",BTC-USD|BLOX,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-26 08:06:17

Previously, the wallet was used as a one-stop hub for all Web3 activity. Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao immediately reacted to the incident, stating all users would be compensated. The Trust Wallet team is still investigating how the exploiters managed to submit a flawed version to the app store, for downloads under the official wallet brand. The supply chain attack is still investigated. The initial wallet draining was noted soon after the update from December 24. The exploit has continued for days before ZachXBT noted the unusual outflows. Initially, users were urged not to use the extension, while salvaging funds via the desktop or mobile versions. The problems emerged only when inputting private seeds into the flawed extension. The attack comes at a time when crypto exploits are slowing down, as projects increase their security. Recently, Binance Wallet was also tackling a wave of address poisoning , as attacks shifted from platforms to private holders. ZachXBT discovers affected Trust Wallet addresses On-chain researcher ZachXBT identified Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana wallets affected by the exploit. According to his data, hundreds of wallets were affected. Trust Wallet has announced the losses will be compensated. Over $6M in crypto was taken from draining the vulnerable wallets. ZachXBT has not mentioned if the exploit has compromised the private keys themselves, but users may have to generate new wallets. Some of the affected addresses lost small amounts of BTC after years of holding. On ETH, the exploiter aggregated tokens into several intermediary addresses . Later, some of the Trust Wallet exploiter wallets sent out the funds to exchanges. The exploiter used ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, as well as high-profile exchanges like KuCoin and HTX. Most of the destination wallets have been flagged. Some of the addresses contain only a few hundred dollars, while others have accumulated as much as $49,000. In the end, the hack estimates reached $6.77M, with around $2.35M remaining in all of the exploiter’s known addresses after moving and swapping funds. Phishing redirect targeted new downloads Wallet infrastructure has proven to be one of the most reliable elements of crypto usage. There are only rare instances of compromised wallets or private keys, usually through insider infiltration. The nature of the Trust Wallet exploit involved a hidden redirect injected into the compromised version. The private key technology remains reliable, if not exposed to the malicious app. The malicious redirect creates a malicious version of the Trust Wallet. Users are urged not to input their private seeds to activate old wallets. Even newly created wallets from the flawed version may be compromised and lose assets in the future.

Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov told TASS the bank stands ready to collaborate with regulators on developing infrastructure for such services, potentially expanding Russia’s crypto ecosystem beyond trading into collateralized finance. The announcement builds on Sberbank’s broader digital asset strategy, which has already produced over 160 tokenized issues this year, spanning real estate, oil, and commodity-linked products. “ I hope we will be able to announce such deals soon ,” Popov expressed optimism, though the timing depends on the regulatory framework, currently in its infancy. Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of Sber Anatoly Popov. | © Reuters Exchanges Prepare Infrastructure as Regulatory Countdown Begins Just yesterday, Moscow Exchange and St. Petersburg Exchange confirmed readiness to launch regulated crypto trading once Russia’s legislative framework takes effect by July 1, 2026. The exchanges’ December announcements followed the Bank of Russia’s release of a regulatory concept outlining comprehensive timelines and enforcement mechanisms for crypto legislation. Moscow Exchange stated it is “ actively working on solutions to service the cryptocurrency market .” St. Petersburg Exchange also mentioned that it has “ the necessary technological infrastructure for trading and settlements. “ Russia's major stock exchanges confirm readiness for regulated crypto trading by mid-2026 as legislative framework approaches implementation deadline. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/rZhcnzIhjn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 25, 2025 The regulatory framework divides market access between qualified and non-qualified investors under sharply different conditions. Non-qualified participants are limited to purchasing liquid cryptocurrencies from defined lists after passing mandatory knowledge tests and are subject to an annual cap of 300,000 rubles through a single intermediary. Qualified investors face no volume restrictions but must demonstrate understanding of crypto risks through testing and remain barred from purchasing anonymous tokens that conceal transaction data. Amid these growing regulatory and technological developments, State Duma Committee Chairman Anatoly Aksakov reiterated earlier this month that cryptocurrencies “ will never become money within our country ,” functioning only as investment instruments, with all domestic payments required in rubles. Transaction Volumes Drive Policy Evolution From Resistance to Regulation Russia recorded $376.3 billion in crypto transaction receipts between July 2024 and June 2025, surpassing the United Kingdom’s $273.2 billion and establishing Russia as Europe’s largest crypto market by transaction volume . Large-scale transfers exceeding $10 million grew 86% during this period, nearly double the 44% growth across the rest of Europe, while DeFi activity surged eightfold in early 2025 before stabilizing at 3.5 times the mid-2023 baseline. Much of this growth is tied to A7A5, a ruble-pegged stablecoin that has reached over $500 million in market capitalization despite Western sanctions , making it the world’s largest non-dollar stablecoin. Looking beyond trading and investment, Senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin recently argued that crypto mining should be classified as export activity in Russia, since the mined assets effectively flow abroad. Crypto mining should be treated as a form of export in Russia’s official trade accounts, according to senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/FGxF9Q3knm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2025 According to past reports, the country produces tens of thousands of Bitcoins annually , generating approximately 1 billion rubles in daily revenue and accounting for over 16% of global hashrate during summer months. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina also recently acknowledged that crypto mining contributes to the ruble’s strength. However, she noted quantifying its exact impact remains difficult as much of the industry operates in gray areas. Illegal mining costs Russia billions of dollars annually through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes, prompting the November 1, 2024, legalization requiring legal entities to register with the Federal Tax Service. Sberbank Builds Digital Asset Platform Ahead of 2026 Deadline Sberbank has already begun offering regulated crypto-linked investments totaling 1.5 billion rubles in structured bonds and digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto portfolios. The bank launched blockchain-powered tokens that track global cocoa prices in March and continues to build proprietary blockchain infrastructure supporting smart contracts and tokenization tools for corporate clients, with each token representing 1 kilogram of cocoa and available to qualified investors for up to 4 months. Deputy Chairman Popov confirmed “ active dialogue ” with the Bank of Russia on integrating crypto services within regulated frameworks while the lender positions itself as a potential liquidity provider and market maker on regulated platforms. Russia’s Central Bank ( @bank_of_russia ) targets 2026 for a unified crypto regulation framework, allowing controlled trading for investors while planning penalties for illegal intermediaries from 2027. #CryptoRegulation #BankOfRussia #Russia https://t.co/DjLAmMqsCb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 The regulatory timeline calls for legislative frameworks to be completed by July 1, 2026, with liability for illegal crypto intermediary activities taking effect from July 1, 2027.

56386867,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254433,1766737511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive 89,312 ETH Transferred: Whale Movement Sparks Market Speculation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-whale-transfer-bithumb/,"BitcoinWorld Massive 89,312 ETH Transferred: Whale Movement Sparks Market Speculation In a move that has captured the cryptocurrency community’s attention, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a massive transfer of 89,312 Ethereum. This substantial amount of ETH transferred from the South Korean exchange Bithumb to an unknown private wallet represents approximately $264 million at current valuations. Such significant movements often serve as critical indicators of larger market trends and institutional behavior. What Does This Major ETH Transfer Mean? When we see this volume of ETH transferred in a single transaction, it immediately raises important questions about market dynamics. Whale transactions typically signal one of several possibilities: institutional accumulation, exchange management, or preparation for strategic moves. The fact that the destination is an unknown wallet adds an intriguing layer of mystery, as it prevents immediate identification of the recipient’s intentions. Blockchain analysts pay close attention to these movements because they can influence market sentiment and potentially affect Ethereum’s price stability. A transfer of this magnitude from an exchange to a private wallet generally suggests the holder plans to hold the assets rather than sell them immediately, which some interpret as a bullish long-term signal. Understanding Whale Transactions in Cryptocurrency Whale transactions refer to large-volume movements that exceed typical trading amounts. These substantial transfers of digital assets often belong to: Institutional investors managing cryptocurrency portfolios Early adopters moving holdings between storage solutions Exchange operations managing liquidity and cold storage Investment funds executing strategic positions The transparency of blockchain technology allows services like Whale Alert to monitor these movements in real-time, providing valuable data points for market analysts and traders. However, the anonymous nature of wallet addresses means we can only speculate about the specific motivations behind each transaction. Potential Implications for the Ethereum Market This particular ETH transferred event carries several potential implications for market participants. First, removing such a significant amount from an exchange reduces immediately available selling pressure, which could support price stability. Second, the movement demonstrates continued institutional-level interest in Ethereum despite market fluctuations. Historical patterns suggest that accumulation in private wallets often precedes periods of reduced volatility or gradual appreciation. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation, and multiple factors influence cryptocurrency prices simultaneously. How Should Investors Interpret Such Movements? For everyday investors and traders, whale transactions provide context rather than direct trading signals. Consider these perspectives when evaluating significant ETH transferred events: Context matters: Is this part of a larger pattern of accumulation or distribution? Timing is key: Does this coincide with other market developments or news? Scale perspective: How does this volume compare to daily trading volumes? Source significance: Does the originating entity have a track record of strategic moves? While fascinating, these transactions represent just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. Savvy market participants combine whale-watching data with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and broader economic factors when making investment decisions. The Bottom Line on Major Cryptocurrency Movements The recent alert about 89,312 ETH transferred from Bithumb serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency markets’ dynamic and transparent nature. These substantial movements highlight how blockchain technology enables unprecedented visibility into asset flows while maintaining participant privacy through pseudonymous addresses. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, we can expect more institutional-scale transactions as traditional finance increasingly interacts with digital assets. The key takeaway is that significant ETH transferred events warrant attention but should be considered alongside comprehensive market analysis rather than as standalone signals. Frequently Asked Questions What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, typically those exceeding certain value thresholds that might impact markets. Why do unknown wallets matter? Unknown wallets are private addresses not immediately associated with known entities like exchanges or public figures. Their anonymity makes the holder’s intentions speculative, adding intrigue to large transfers. Could this ETH transferred event affect Ethereum’s price? While large movements can influence market sentiment, direct price impact depends on numerous factors including overall market conditions, trading volume, and subsequent actions by the wallet holder. How common are transfers of this size? Multi-million dollar transfers occur regularly in cryptocurrency markets, though the 89,312 ETH transferred represents a particularly substantial movement that stands out even among whale transactions. Should I change my investment strategy based on whale movements? Whale transactions provide useful market context but shouldn’t alone dictate investment strategy. Consider them alongside fundamental analysis, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Can anyone track where the ETH goes next? Yes, blockchain explorers allow anyone to follow the movement of these assets to subsequent addresses, though the ultimate beneficiary often remains anonymous if they use privacy techniques.

Key Takeaways: Former Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison is set for release on Jan. 21, 2026, about 10 months earlier than her full sentence. Ellison pleaded guilty over the FTX collapse and cooperated with prosecutors, helping secure Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction. Her early release reflects cooperation and good conduct, though she faces a 10-year ban and ongoing supervision. Ellison, 31, has been in community confinement since October 2025 after being transferred from a federal prison in Connecticut , Business Insider reported earlier this month. Her release date places her exit from custody roughly 10 months earlier than the full two-year sentence imposed by the court. Ellison Pleaded Guilty in FTX Collapse That Wiped Out Billions Ellison pleaded guilty in December 2022 to fraud and conspiracy charges connected to the collapse of FTX, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. The failure of FTX triggered billions of dollars in customer losses and marked one of the most significant scandals in the history of the digital asset industry. As part of her plea agreement, Ellison cooperated extensively with federal prosecutors and served as a key witness during Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial. Her testimony detailed how Alameda and FTX commingled customer funds and concealed financial shortfalls, evidence that contributed to Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple counts of fraud. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Ellison in September 2024, ordering her to forfeit $11 billion and serve a two-year prison term beginning in November of that year.

In a filing submitted ahead of sentencing, John J. Ray III, the CEO overseeing the FTX bankruptcy estate, said Ellison provided “valuable assistance” that helped recover hundreds of millions of dollars in assets for creditors. Those efforts played a role in ongoing attempts to return funds to customers affected by the collapse. Earlier this month, Ellison also agreed to a 10-year ban on serving as an officer or director of public companies or cryptocurrency exchanges. Following her release, she will remain under supervised release, limiting her future involvement in regulated financial businesses. Bankman-Fried Seeks Trump Clemency, Claims FTX Case Was Politically Motivated Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried continues to pursue post-conviction relief . He is seeking clemency from US President Donald Trump, who has previously issued high-profile crypto-related pardons, including for former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao . Bankman-Fried has argued that his prosecution was politically motivated, a claim prosecutors have rejected. According to Bureau of Prisons records, Bankman-Fried is currently scheduled for release in September 2044 , underscoring the stark contrast in outcomes between the two former executives.

Peter Schiff, the prominent gold advocate and longtime cryptocurrency skeptic, has labeled this movement as a critical Bitcoin exit opportunity —a Christmas gift for holders looking to escape. His perspective challenges the optimism of many investors and presents a controversial roadmap for the coming year. Is This Rebound Really a Bitcoin Exit Opportunity? Peter Schiff’s latest commentary cuts directly against prevailing market sentiment. He described the recent price increase not as the start of a new bull run, but as a seasonal anomaly. According to Schiff, this is Santa offering a final chance to sell before potential declines. This framing turns typical holiday market cheer on its head, suggesting the rally many hoped for has already failed to materialize. Schiff had previously noted the absence of a true “Santa rally” in crypto markets this December. Therefore, he interprets this limited rebound as deceptive—a trap for the unwary rather than a genuine recovery. His analysis suggests that while Bitcoin has stalled, other assets have delivered substantial returns, making this an ideal moment to reconsider allocations. Why Schiff Sees Silver as the 2025 Alternative The gold bull doesn’t just criticize Bitcoin; he offers a specific alternative. Schiff has explicitly recommended selling Bitcoin to buy silver as the “best trading opportunity for 2025.” This recommendation comes from his observation of precious metals outperforming cryptocurrencies throughout the year. Consider these key points from Schiff’s argument: Bitcoin has failed to meet bullish price expectations set at year’s beginning Precious metals like gold and silver have demonstrated stronger upward momentum The current rebound lacks fundamental support and represents a technical bounce Seasonal patterns suggest this may be a temporary phenomenon rather than a trend reversal This perspective challenges the core narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold. Schiff essentially argues that the original precious metals remain superior stores of value and growth vehicles. Understanding the Broader Market Context To evaluate Schiff’s warning properly, investors must consider the broader financial landscape. The cryptocurrency market has faced significant headwinds throughout 2024, including regulatory pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. Meanwhile, precious metals have benefited from geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns. However, cryptocurrency advocates counter that Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Adoption continues growing, institutional interest persists, and the upcoming halving event historically precedes major rallies. This creates a classic clash of narratives between traditional and digital asset philosophies. The critical question for investors becomes: Is this truly a Bitcoin exit opportunity , or merely a skeptic’s misinterpretation of normal market volatility? The answer depends largely on one’s time horizon and risk tolerance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Regardless of whether you agree with Schiff’s perspective, his warning provides valuable considerations for portfolio management. Every investor should periodically reassess their positions against changing market conditions. Here are practical steps to consider: Review your investment thesis for Bitcoin—has anything fundamentally changed? Compare performance across asset classes in your portfolio Consider rebalancing if any position has become disproportionately large Evaluate both technical indicators and fundamental developments Remember that extreme opinions—whether bullish or bearish—often miss nuance. The reality likely lies somewhere between “Christmas gift exit” and “guaranteed rally.” Conclusion: Navigating Conflicting Signals Peter Schiff’s characterization of Bitcoin’s rebound as a Bitcoin exit opportunity presents a provocative counter-narrative to mainstream crypto optimism. While his perspective aligns with his longstanding skepticism, it raises important questions about asset allocation and timing. Ultimately, investment decisions should reflect individual goals rather than reacting to any single commentator’s views. The market will reveal whether this rebound represents a genuine recovery or indeed a final exit chance. What remains certain is that 2025 will bring new challenges and opportunities across all asset classes. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Peter Schiff say about Bitcoin? Peter Schiff called Bitcoin’s recent price rebound a “Christmas gift” offering holders an exit opportunity. He suggested selling Bitcoin to buy silver represents the best trading opportunity for 2025. Why does Schiff prefer silver over Bitcoin? Schiff observes that while Bitcoin has stalled, precious metals like silver have shown strong upward momentum. He believes traditional commodities offer better value and growth potential than cryptocurrencies. Should I sell my Bitcoin based on Schiff’s advice? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. While Schiff’s perspective is worth considering, it represents one viewpoint among many in the financial community. Has Bitcoin really underperformed compared to precious metals? In recent months, silver and gold have shown significant gains while Bitcoin has experienced volatility. However, performance varies across different timeframes, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. What is a “Santa rally” in financial markets? A Santa rally refers to a seasonal increase in stock prices that typically occurs in the last week of December through the first two trading days of January. Schiff argues this phenomenon hasn’t materialized for cryptocurrencies this year. How reliable are seasonal patterns for cryptocurrency investing? Seasonal patterns in cryptocurrency markets are less established than in traditional markets. While some patterns may emerge, they shouldn’t form the sole basis for investment decisions given crypto’s volatility and relative novelty.

The issue was first flagged publicly by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, who issued a community alert warning that multiple Trust Wallet users had experienced unauthorized outflows from their addresses within hours. Sudden Wallet Drains While the exact cause was initially unclear, ZachXBT noted that the reports coincided with a recent update to the Trust Wallet Chrome extension. Shortly thereafter, blockchain security firm SlowMist issued a security alert confirming a vulnerability in Trust Wallet Browser Extension version 2.68, and urged users to immediately disable the extension and upgrade to version 2.69 through the official Chrome Web Store. According to SlowMist’s preliminary findings, the incident may involve a supply chain attack, where malicious code was potentially injected into the extension. This possibly allowed attackers to exfiltrate users’ seed phrases when the wallet was unlocked and transmit them to a malicious website. Based on early estimates, hundreds of wallets are believed to be affected. Trust Wallet later acknowledged the incident on X, confirming that version 2.68 of its browser extension was impacted. The company said that mobile-only users and all other browser extension versions were not affected by the vulnerability. Trust Wallet also advised users who had not yet upgraded to avoid opening the extension until the update was completed. The company warned that continued use of the affected version could expose them to further risk. ZachXBT subsequently provided another update stating that affected users would be compensated. CZ Addresses The “Hack” Meanwhile, Binance founder and Trust Wallet owner Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also addressed the situation publicly and said that Trust Wallet would cover the losses linked to the incident. He also said that user funds remain secure. CZ estimated that around $7 million had been impacted and described the incident as a hack. He also hinted at an insider involvement, which could mean that the breach may have included internal access or knowledge. The episode adds to growing concerns around browser-based wallet security, particularly as supply chain attacks and malicious updates have become an increasingly common vector for crypto theft. The Trust Wallet incident comes amid a broader rise in high-profile exploits, hacks, and phishing campaigns across the crypto sector. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimated more than $3.4 billion in cryptocurrencies has been stolen from January through early December, slightly higher than the $3.38 billion recorded over the same period last year.

A prominent crypto analyst with a massive following has just made a bold declaration: Bitcoin is on a path that eerily mirrors 2020, and it’s poised to smash its previous Bitcoin all-time high in 2025. This prediction isn’t just about a price target; it suggests a fundamental shift in how the entire market cycle might unfold. Let’s dive into the analysis that’s sparking conversation across the crypto community. Why Does This Analyst See a 2025 Bitcoin All-Time High? Crypto analyst Kaleo, followed by over 728,000 people on X, recently laid out a compelling comparison. He suggests Bitcoin’s current price action and market sentiment are strikingly similar to the autumn of 2020. Back then, Bitcoin was recovering from the brutal March 2020 crash. It had broken below a key long-term trend line, and U.S. tech stocks were vastly outperforming it. The altcoin market was quiet, and overall sentiment was so negative that many declared Bitcoin dead. Sound familiar? Of course, what followed was a legendary bull run that catapulted Bitcoin to its current Bitcoin all-time high . Kaleo believes we are in a similar setup now, setting the stage for a powerful move upward. Beyond the Halving: Is a “Supercycle” Coming? This forecast challenges a core belief held by many in crypto: the traditional four-year cycle tied to Bitcoin’s halving events. Instead, Kaleo proposes a different outcome. He argues that Bitcoin remains in a long-term bull market and that the next Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 will kickstart something new—a “supercycle.” What would this supercycle look like? According to the analyst, it would feature: A more prolonged uptrend compared to previous cycles. A true altcoin season where alternative cryptocurrencies see explosive growth. A massive wave of new retail investor enthusiasm , bringing fresh capital into the market. This theory implies the potential for greater gains but also acknowledges that a longer bear market would likely follow such an extended peak. The key, Kaleo notes, is for investors to understand and navigate this entire cycle to endure the subsequent downturn. What This Means for Crypto Investors Today Predictions like this are valuable not for their certainty, but for the perspective they provide. They encourage us to look at historical patterns and current data. If the 2020 parallel holds any weight, it suggests we might be in a period of accumulation before a significant upward move. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance never guarantees future results. The idea of a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 hinges on several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and continued adoption. While the analysis is insightful, every investor must conduct their own research and never risk more than they can afford to lose. Conclusion: A Compelling Roadmap for Bitcoin’s Future The prediction of a new Bitcoin all-time high in 2025, built on parallels to the 2020 bull run, offers a fascinating and optimistic narrative for the crypto market. It challenges conventional cycle thinking and paints a picture of a more mature, yet still explosive, phase for Bitcoin. Whether this “supercycle” thesis plays out remains to be seen, but it provides a crucial framework for understanding potential market trajectories. Staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals are the best strategies for any investor watching this space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Kaleo, and why should I trust his prediction? A1: Kaleo is a pseudonymous crypto analyst with a substantial following (over 728,000) on social media platform X. His analysis is respected by many in the community for its technical and historical depth, but like all forecasts, it should be considered one perspective among many, not financial advice. Q2: What exactly is a Bitcoin “supercycle”? A2: A supercycle refers to the theory that Bitcoin’s bull market could be longer and more sustained than the typical four-year cycles observed in the past, potentially driven by increased institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors. Q3: Does this mean the traditional Bitcoin halving cycle is irrelevant? A3: Not necessarily. The halving is a fundamental, supply-driven event. This prediction suggests its effects might be expressed differently this time, potentially elongating the bullish period rather than strictly adhering to the old timeline. Q4: What are the biggest risks to this 2025 all-time high prediction? A4: Major risks include a severe global economic recession, unexpected harsh regulatory crackdowns in key markets, or a major security failure within the crypto ecosystem that shatters investor confidence. Q5: How can an average investor prepare if this prediction is correct? A5: Focus on education, consider a disciplined dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate volatility, secure your assets in a non-custodial wallet, and avoid making investment decisions based purely on fear of missing out (FOMO).

This article dives into the factors influencing Aptos' price and highlights which other coins show potential for growth in the evolving landscape. Aptos Price on the Move: Can It Rebound? Source: tradingview Aptos (APT) is bouncing between $1.43 and $1.71. Recently, its price grew about 16% in a week, suggesting some upward movement. But taking a wider view, APT has dipped heavily over the last month and six months. If APT can push past the nearest resistance at $1.85, it might aim for $2.13, which would be about a 25% increase from its recent peak in this range. Yet, its recent history shows significant drops, reminding us that the path to higher prices might be bumpy. Sentiment is upbeat with a strong RSI, but it needs to maintain momentum to reach those higher targets. Conclusion APT's potential to reclaim $2 is closely tied to the overall market momentum in layer 1 coins. When Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Cardano show strong performance, it often boosts confidence in similar platforms. Institutional interest and broader adoption can also drive APT's value. The coin's ability to stay competitive depends on its development team’s efforts and community support. Ultimately, supportive trends in top-tier blockchain projects would likely aid APT in reaching and maintaining the $2 level. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The exchange is hosting a major BABY token airdrop event, distributing a massive pool of 3 million tokens. This move celebrates strategic partnerships and offers a tangible reward for active traders. If you’re looking to potentially earn free crypto, understanding the details of this limited-time event is crucial. What is the Bithumb BABY Token Airdrop Event? Bithumb’s latest promotional campaign centers on the BABY token airdrop . BABY is the native token of the Bitcoin staking protocol, Babylon. The exchange is distributing 3 million BABY tokens, worth approximately 73 million Korean won ($52,700), to eligible participants. This event is not just a giveaway; it’s a celebration of Bithumb’s new collaborations with the decentralized lending protocol Aave and an unnamed BTC financial firm. The event window is short, running for just two days from December 26th to December 27th. How Can You Qualify for This Airdrop? Participation requires meeting specific criteria set by Bithumb. The rules are straightforward but require action during the event period. Here are the key steps to qualify: Deposit Requirement : You must deposit more than 500,000 Korean won (roughly $361) worth of BABY tokens into your Bithumb account. Trading Activity : You need to execute at least one trade involving the BABY token on both days of the event (December 26th and 27th).

Second, it brings attention to the Babylon protocol, which focuses on Bitcoin staking—a growing sector aiming to bring yield-generating capabilities to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. For users, it represents a chance to acquire tokens of a promising project through active participation rather than direct purchase. What Should Potential Participants Consider? While the opportunity is enticing, a smart approach is necessary. Always remember that cryptocurrency trading and airdrop participation involve risk. The value of the BABY token can fluctuate between now and the distribution date in 2026. Furthermore, ensure you understand the tax implications of receiving airdropped tokens in your jurisdiction. This BABY token airdrop is a promotional event with clear rules, so read Bithumb’s official announcement thoroughly to avoid any misunderstanding about eligibility.

Crypto commentator Amonyx (@amonyx) posted an update that captured this shift. He revealed that Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF has crossed a key threshold, now holding 101.55 million XRP valued at $192.7 million. The milestone marks the first time the fund has exceeded 100 million XRP in holdings. While the headline figure appears simple, the context behind it carries weight. JUST IN: Franklin Templeton’s $XRP spot ETF has crossed 100M $XRP in holdings for the first time, now holding 101.55M $XRP worth $192.7M. Bullish pic.twitter.com/6UAAI0U7q4 — Amonyx (@amonyx) December 23, 2025 A Key Institutional Milestone Amonyx’s post focused on scale. Crossing 100 million XRP signals more than steady inflows. It shows sustained accumulation from regulated capital. ETFs do not chase momentum intraday. They reflect allocation decisions made by asset managers, advisers, and institutions seeking long-term exposure . Franklin Templeton operates as one of the world’s largest asset managers. Its decision to join the XRP ETF race and continued expansion of XRP holdings indicate conviction in the asset. The ETF has also shown consistent performance since launch. Holdings did not spike in a single session, but increased over time, suggesting methodical inflows rather than speculative bursts. ETF Performance Signals Growing Institutional Adoption The performance of the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF strengthens the bullish case. Growing assets under management require constant sourcing of XRP from the open market. Each new unit purchased removes liquid supply from circulation. This is where institutional adoption becomes a central driver. ETFs operate within regulatory frameworks. They attract capital that previously could not access XRP directly. Retirement accounts, traditional brokers, and compliance-focused investors now participate. As more institutions choose this route, demand becomes less sensitive to daily price fluctuations. That creates a different market dynamic compared to retail-driven rallies. It also reduces the likelihood of sudden liquidations tied to leverage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply Dynamics Tighten as XRP Leaves Exchanges Beyond demand, supply conditions add another layer. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) summed it up clearly. “101M $XRP locked up. The walls are closing in on supply, and most still don’t see it.” Exchange balances for XRP continue to trend lower . Tokens are quickly moving into long-term storage, institutional custody, and ETF vehicles. Once inside an ETF, that supply effectively exits the liquid market unless redemptions occur. XRP has a fixed supply, and when the circulating supply tightens while demand remains steady or grows, price pressure builds naturally. ETFs accelerate this process by removing large amounts of XRP. This shrinking balance increases the risk of a supply shock if demand accelerates. This could kickstart a major XRP rally.

With experts debating its potential, many are questioning if ZEC can soar to the $500 mark. This article explores the factors driving this renewed interest and identifies other coins poised for significant growth. Zcash Shows Mixed Signals: Price Hesitation Amidst Past Surge Source: tradingview Zcash is dancing within a range, with its price hovering between around $390 and $480. After a strong surge of more than 1000% over the last six months, it now faces hurdles around $510. If it manages to overcome this, it could aim for nearly $600, marking a rise of over 20% from its high range. However, if it falters, support lies in the mid-$300s. Despite a recent 13% dip over the month, a weekly jump of almost 15% suggests there's still lively interest. With its ten-day average higher than the hundred-day, some traders spot a potential uptrend, waiting to be confirmed by further moves. Conclusion Zcash could see a significant rise in its value if the renewed interest continues. With other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin showing stability or upward trends, Zcash may benefit from increased investor confidence. The growing focus on privacy and anonymity can also favor Zcash in the long run. If the market trends remain positive, Zcash has the potential to reach new heights.

Despite this, most of the token sales failed to outperform the market. For the past year, Pump.fun held the first place in achieving the most valuable token sale. The platform raised $600M in a sale that ended in under a minute, after years of waiting. PUMP is down 70% since its launch, with an even deeper loss from peak levels of $0.008. | Source: CoinGecko . Initially, PUMP expected to launch as an airdrop token. Instead, the platform chose a token sale for a $4B valuation. PUMP had a volatile journey since July, peaking at $0.008. Toward the end of the year, PUMP extended its slide to $0.0017, down from the initial IPO price of $0.004. Following the token sale, PUMP was pressured by direct whale selling. The token ended the year with a market cap of $1B, with $1.7B in fully diluted value. PUMP was also depressed by the slowdown in meme trading, new launches, and creator activity. The token slid despite regular buybacks, in which Pump.fun poured all trading fees. For now, Pump.fun still achieves significant daily revenues as a Solana DEX, though this has also not helped the token’s performance. PUMP tokens retail a relatively high mindshare of 5.9%, though token fatigue and market weakness are still preventing a rally. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the ICO, PUMP was one of the warning examples in 2025. Other projects stuck to airdrops or remained tokenless. World Liberty Fi token sale leaves buyers with losses World Liberty Fi reported $550M from its WLFI token sale, including both retail rounds and pledges from high-profile investors. The token sale also included Justin Sun’s buy-in for $30M. The Trump family crypto project was highly active in 2025, with multiple investments in crypto. However, the WLFI token was also limited by the lack of an altcoin market. WLFI became transferable and tradeable after months of holding. WLFI fell from a peak of $0.24, down to $0.14 in late 2025. The project got a boost from the usage of USD1 tokens, but WLFI still underperforms. High-profile token sales faced bear market conditions While PUMP and WLFI still saw some liquid trading, other token sales failed more dramatically. Monad (MON) caused some of the biggest losses, after a rally to $0.04. In the past month, MON erased 50% of its value, down to $0.02. The project caused investor discontent, despite raising $217M. L2 projects MegaETH and Aztec are yet to generate their tokens. The projects are still expected to launch, although the conditions for new tokens remain unfavorable. The ICO model and other token sales were mostly used for small-scale projects. High-profile events ended up destroying sentiment, as some projects stayed away from tokenization and moved to the IPO model . Even long-term projects with a wide support network like Berachain (BERA) fared worse once they created their token and launched it during a hostile market.

After months of consolidation, analysts are now pointing to clear technical signals suggesting a major Bitcoin breakout could be imminent. The key level to watch? A decisive push above a critical downtrend line that could propel BTC toward $95,000 and beyond. Let’s examine the data and expert opinions shaping this optimistic forecast. Why Are Analysts Bullish on a Bitcoin Breakout Now? Several converging factors are giving market watchers confidence. First, a significant options expiry event has passed. Trader BitBull, with a substantial following, noted that the expiration of roughly $24 billion in options could remove a major source of selling pressure. This ‘hedging overhang’ often suppresses spot prices. Its removal typically allows for cleaner price discovery, potentially clearing the path for a sustained Bitcoin breakout . Furthermore, the broader sentiment suggests the crypto market remains undervalued. Prominent analyst Michaël van de Poppe has echoed this, stating that the current landscape could set the stage for new all-time highs in the coming months. This foundational belief in underlying value adds weight to the technical setup currently forming on the charts. The Technical Case for a Move to $95K The most compelling evidence comes from the price chart itself. Analysis firm Crypto Ideology has highlighted a crucial pattern. Bitcoin’s daily price candle is currently testing a two-month resistance line that has capped every rally since October. This line represents the dominant downtrend. The Resistance Line: A diagonal trendline connecting the lower highs since Bitcoin’s peak. The Breakout Signal: A daily close convincingly above this line on significant volume. The Initial Target: A successful Bitcoin breakout sets a first price target near $95,000. The Next Milestone: A move to $95K significantly increases the probability of a final push to the symbolic $100,000 level. Therefore, the $95,000 mark isn’t just a random number; it’s a calculated projection based on chart structure and becomes the pivotal level for confirming a true trend reversal. What Could Fuel or Hinder the Rally? While the setup is promising, traders should consider both sides. The potential fuel for a rally is clear: reduced derivatives pressure, positive market structure, and a general sense that prices have consolidated enough. A clean Bitcoin breakout could trigger a wave of algorithmic and momentum buying. However, challenges remain. The broader macroeconomic environment, including interest rate decisions and traditional market volatility, still influences crypto. Additionally, the resistance line is a formidable barrier. A rejection here could see Bitcoin fall back into its established trading range, delaying the anticipated surge. The key is sustained buying pressure at the critical moment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Watchers How should you process this information? First, monitor the daily chart for a strong close above the descending trendline. Volume is a critical confirmation—a breakout on low volume is less trustworthy. Second, understand that a move toward $95,000 would likely be a process, not a single event, possibly involving pullbacks to test the newfound support. For long-term investors, this analysis reinforces the importance of viewing volatility as part of the journey. For active traders, the $95K level serves as a clear intermediate target and a zone to watch for either continuation or consolidation signals. The overarching message from analysts is one of cautious optimism, with a defined technical roadmap. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin The coming days and weeks could be defining for Bitcoin’s 2024 trajectory. Analysts have laid out a clear narrative: a successful Bitcoin breakout from its multi-month downtrend, catalyzed by shifting derivatives dynamics and technical momentum, with $95,000 acting as the crucial pivot point. While never guaranteed in markets, this confluence of factors presents one of the more compelling bullish setups seen in recent months. The market now waits to see if Bitcoin has the strength to seize this opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing the potential Bitcoin breakout now? The primary drivers are the removal of significant options-related selling pressure and Bitcoin’s price testing a key multi-month resistance line for a potential breakout. Why is $95,000 considered a pivotal level? Analysts from Crypto Ideology identify $95K as the initial technical target following a confirmed breakout above the current downtrend, based on chart measurements. What happens if Bitcoin fails to break the resistance? A rejection at the trendline would likely mean continued consolidation or a move back into the previous trading range, delaying the bullish scenario. Is the $100,000 target still realistic? Analysts view $100K as a high-probability target after a successful hold above $95,000, making the $95K level the critical hurdle to clear first. Should I invest based on this analysis? This is market analysis, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and understand that cryptocurrency investments are volatile.

56389025,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=870255,1766740500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56389025.jpeg,"Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-is-repeating-its-2020-accumulation-cycle-analyst-says/,"Crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica on X) is arguing that Dogecoin’s weekly chart is doing that familiar thing again: carving out a rounded base, bleeding off volatility, resetting momentum and quietly setting up what he frames as the “calm before the storm.” Or, at least, that’s the pitch. In a Dec. 23 TradingView analysis titled “DOGE: The Cycle Repeats (1W Timeframe),” Cryptollica calls the current structure a “textbook fractal setup,” pointing to four prior “structural points (1, 2, 3, 4)” across DOGE’s longer-term history and claiming the market is now sitting at “Point 4.” The core claim is less about a single indicator and more about pattern recognition: “the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past.” Will Dogecoin Repeat History? Cryptollica frames Zones 1 and 2 as prior “boredom phases” — the type of long, dead-feeling stretches that, in hindsight, look like accumulation. “Zones 1 & 2: These were the ‘boredom phases’ where volatility died, and smart money accumulated,” the post reads. Zone 2, in particular, is described as “the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run.” The current period, which the analyst labels Zone 4, is presented as a near-mirror: “We are seeing the exact same rounding bottom formation. The price is stabilizing, forming a heavy base just like it did before the previous explosions.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally If It Reclaims This Fibonacci Level That’s the structural argument. The momentum argument is RSI, and Cryptollica is unusually direct about how they’re treating it: “Look at the RSI indicator at the bottom. The red line (~32. level) acts as a historical floor.” They add that “every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline (Points 1, 2, and 3), it marked a macro bottom.” Right now, in their read, “the RSI has reset back to this critical support level,” which they interpret as seller fatigue: “It indicates that the sellers are exhausted and the momentum is primed to flip.” If you’ve been around crypto markets long enough, you’ve seen this exact rhetorical move: the past as a template, the present as a rhyme, the future as a pending punchline. Cryptollica tries to pre-empt the eye-roll by insisting the setup isn’t coincidence: “This isn’t just random noise; it’s a cyclical reset.” The post argues DOGE is sitting in what they call “the ‘Golden Pocket’ for accumulation,” and suggests that if the 2020-era analog holds “like it did in 2020 (Zone 2)” then today’s price action is basically quiet loading time. The editorial machinery at TradingView itself leaned in. The platform responded publicly on Dec. 23 that the publication “has been selected as one of our Editor’s Picks and will be featured on the Home Page,” adding a line that reads like the house style for community encouragement: “Good trading plans are valuable, regardless of their outcomes, and particularly rewarding when they succeed.” Cryptollica replied in kind: “TradingView, thank you.” Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention Still, one of the more useful parts of this whole thread is a cautionary comment from another user, ZarinSyed, who essentially says: yes, the fractal is interesting, no, that doesn’t mean it’s fate. “The fractal analysis is compelling,” they wrote, “however, while the setup does resemble prior accumulation phases, it’s worth noting that fractals are not deterministic — macro conditions and liquidity flows can alter outcomes.” They put a practical marker on what “confirmation” would look like in their view: “Watching DOGE’s weekly close above the $0.15–$0.17 range could validate the bullish thesis.” And they don’t let RSI off the hook, either. The ~32 level may signal exhaustion, they concede, but “momentum confirmation often requires a sustained move above the midline (50). Until then, the risk of prolonged sideways action remains.” They add a market-structure wrinkle that matters for 2026-style crypto narratives: “Unlike 2020, DOGE now trades in a more mature market with ETF-driven institutional flows. Retail-driven fractals may play out differently.” So what does it mean, in plain trader terms, without pretending the chart is prophecy? Cryptollica is making a high-conviction, weekly-timeframe claim that DOGE is back in an accumulation “buy zone,” with RSI near a historical floor and a rounded base that resembles prior cycle setups. ZarinSyed is basically saying: fine, now prove it, ideally with a breakout and follow-through, and keep an eye on relative metrics like DOGE/BTC dominance if you want to know whether this is a DOGE story or just another alt wobble.

Meanwhile, BTC stayed stuck in a narrow $85,000 to $92,000 band after a sharp drop from above $110,000. On chain data shows large Bitcoin holders boosted balances in late 2025 On-chain data from Glassnode showed a sharp jump in net buying by entities holding 100 BTC to 1,000 BTC, a cohort often tracked as “sharks.” The move came as Bitcoin’s price stayed near cycle highs, while the group’s total supply line climbed to a new peak on the chart. A post from “That Martini Guy” claimed “whales” accumulated about $23.5 billion worth of Bitcoin over recent weeks and called it the fastest pace since 2012. The Glassnode chart does show one of the strongest positive spikes in the cohort’s net position change in years, alongside a steep rise in the amount of BTC held by these addresses. Still, the chart tracks a specific bracket, not every whale sized wallet, and the dollar figure depends on the price used for the estimate. In addition, on-chain cohorts can shift when exchanges reshuffle wallets, when custody providers consolidate addresses, or when entities get re labeled over time. Even so, the late 2025 surge signals renewed demand from larger holders, and it points to aggressive accumulation rather than steady distribution in that period. Precious metals surge as Bitcoin lags over six month window Meanwhile, Gold and Silver posted strong gains over the past six months, while Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction, according to the price comparison data. Gold rose about 38 percent over the period, and silver more than doubled, climbing roughly 107 percent. By contrast, Bitcoin fell about 17 percent, despite holding a market capitalization near $1.8 trillion. BTC/XAU/XAG Price Comparison. Source: CoinCodex The chart shows a clear divergence that developed from late summer into year end. Gold advanced steadily, with limited pullbacks, reflecting sustained demand. Silver accelerated even faster, with sharper rallies in October and November that pushed returns well above gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trended lower through the same period, with several failed rebounds and deeper drawdowns into December. This split highlights how capital rotated toward traditional safe haven assets during the period, while Bitcoin underperformed both metals. Even so, the gap between assets has widened to levels not seen earlier in the year. The data shows metals leading decisively, while Bitcoin remains compressed near the lower end of its six month range, setting a clear contrast in relative performance. Bitcoin compresses into tight range after sharp pullback Bitcoin traded sideways in late December after a steep decline from its recent highs, according to the daily BTC USDT chart from TradingView. Price moved into a narrow consolidation band near the mid to high $80,000s, following a breakdown from a broader distribution zone that capped advances earlier in the year. The chart shows Bitcoin falling from above $110,000 before stabilizing between roughly $85,000 and $92,000. Multiple candles printed long wicks on both sides of the range, signaling active two way trading rather than a clear trend. This structure suggests the market is absorbing prior selling pressure after the sharp drop. Crypto Rover said a decisive move could follow once Bitcoin exits this range. The chart supports that view, as prolonged compression often precedes expansion. For now, price remains trapped between short term support and resistance, leaving direction unresolved until a clear breakout or breakdown occurs.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 09:29:20

These are the ones that creep up and supply narrows and schedules get synchronized. That is the arrangement that most analysts are following today. One of these cryptocurrencies has already made a 2.5x move at a price of $0.035, although it is at an early maturity against the initiations of its roadmap. In the view of people interested in what crypto to invest in now before 2026, this is more of a positioning than a chasing move. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the project that attracts this attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The initial presale distribution of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was at a price of $0.01. After that, the token has gone to increase to $0.035, indicating an increase of 250% during its presale stages. This expansion has not happened in an abrupt way but has developed over a period and this development has been attributed by many market commentators as an indication of long lasting interest. Phase 6 is already assigned over 99% and that is, availability at the present price is almost over. The official launch price is fixed at $0.06, and current investors are positioned for a significant discount in comparison to the launch. There is a growth in participation together with price. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $19.45M, and has 18,650 holders to date. The total sold tokens have been 825M. Out of a fixed presale supply of 1.82B MUTM or 45.5% of the amount is designated to the early distribution. What is Being Built at Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance has one objective. Creating a decentralized lending protocol, where on-chain capital is useful. The site will be built on a dual lending model where people can provide assets to get yield and borrowers can use collateral to obtain liquidity. Users that provide assets get mtTokens. Such tokens signify their status in the protocol and are more valuable the more interest they earn. Yield is captured empirically in the balance of the mtTokens without the need to take any actions. The other important component is the buy-and-distribute model. Part of the protocol fees is utilized in buying MUTM over the counter. The computers obtain MUTM in the open market and resell it to users in the safety module by staking their mtTokens. This may relate platform usage directly with token demand that some analysts feel relevant after the launch. Security has been realized at the outset. Mutuum Finance has gone through an audit of CertiK with an audit score of 90/100 with a token scan, and is currently in an independent audit with Halborn Security , reviewing finalised contracts. Stablecoin Plans, Oracles and Price Outlook In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance is going to launch a multi-asset-backed stablecoin. This enables the borrowers to use various forms of collateral instead of using one token. The system will be able to be more stable in the market fluctuations by diversifying the risks. Any lending protocol is based on accurate pricing. The architectural design of Mutuum Finance expects that oracle feeds, like Chainlink, will be decentralized, but that they will also have fallback sources. These oracles are used to facilitate just values of collaterals and proper liquidations. Other observers even reckon that with a mixture of lending business, a sound currency, and a good price framework, a company can then grow robustly after launch. In a bullish case, the estimates indicate that transitioning between the present level with the introduction and initial adoption would help in sustaining 500% growth over time. These are results of models depending on execution. Why Whales Are Watching As per the official statements on X , V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol will run on the Sepolia testnet in the Q4 2025. Its main entities will consist of liquidity pools, mpTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. Early assets will be ETH and USDT. This timing is critical. A workable version before the launch time is an advantage that can enhance credibility and presence. According to market commentators, live infrastructure projects stand better chances of receiving broader attention after their launch. Phase 6 is also closing out in a hurry. The bigger buyers will do so due to tighter allocation. Six-figure whale allocations over the past two years have been reported by analysts as an indication larger players are setting the groundwork before the next level commences. Whales tend to seek opportunities that are characterized by scarcity and milestones. This setup fits that pattern. The Reason Why Q1 2026 is a Part of The Conversation The reason why this new crypto could be a first mover in Q1 2026, is a matter of timing. Presale allocating of the work coming to completion. A defined launch price. A V1 protocol is planned. Audits in place. These are now converging just in time when the wider market interest is all there. To investors who follow the potential best cheap cryptocurrency to keep a long-term position, Mutuum Finance remains at a crossroads where there are already instances of growth but the bigger picture might be yet to be seen. With Phase 6 approaching completion and development milestones, the window of early entry is closing at prices as of $0.035. Provided that the adoption process happens in accordance with the setup, it may become one of the new cryptocurrencies that characterizes the first half of the next cycle.

56389676,648763,1766741421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56389676.jpeg,Crypto’s High-Stakes Corner Booms As Derivatives Trading Soars To $86 Trillion,https://bitcoinist.com/cryptos-high-stakes-corner-booms-as-derivatives-trading-soars-to-86-trillion/,"According to a report by liquidation tracker CoinGlass, cryptocurrency derivatives trading hit roughly $85.7 trillion in 2025, an average of about $264 billion a day. That surge put derivatives back at the center of crypto activity and left a clear imprint on markets worldwide. Market Concentration And Exchange Share Binance handled roughly $25 trillion of that volume, or about 29% of global derivatives trading. OKX, Bybit and Bitget each posted between $8 trillion and $10 trillion, and the four of them together controlled about 62% of the market. Based on reports , that level of concentration means a handful of platforms still drive most of the action, and any major hiccup at one of them can ripple through other venues fast. Crypto: Institutional Pathways Expanded Trading moved beyond retail bets. Spot ETFs listed in the US, options desks and compliant futures helped mainstream venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange gain ground. The CME had already overtaken Binance in Bitcoin futures open interest in 2024, and it consolidated that position through 2025. More institutions started using derivatives for hedging and basis trades rather than pure speculation. That change pushed pricing patterns to look more like traditional markets, even as new risks built up under the surface. Open Interest And Market Swings Open interest began the year near a low of about $87 billion after a broad round of deleveraging in the first quarter. It then climbed through the middle of the year and reached a record $236 billion on October 7. An abrupt reset in early Q4 wiped out more than $70 billion in positions — roughly one-third of the open interest at the time. Even after that shock, year-end open interest stood at $145 billion, a 17% rise from where the year began. Bitcoin Price Action Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has yet to breach the $90k level, trading at $89,950 at the time of writing. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, recorded net outflows, weakening what some had called the institutional bid. A record-sized Bitcoin options expiry landed on Friday, Dec 26, and several analysts argued it kept price pinned in a tighter band — at least for a while. Sentiment gauges stayed on the gloomy side, with many investors showing caution despite broader product access and more regulated routes to trade. Forced Liquidations Total forced liquidations across the year were estimated at about $150 billion. A big portion of the pain came on Oct. 10 and Oct. 11, when more than $19 billion was erased in just two days. The data for 2025 shows a market that has grown in size and in institutional involvement, while also carrying structural tensions. Trading volumes and product variety have increased, but so have the paths that can transmit shocks.

This announcement from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao brings relief to the crypto community and sets a new standard for accountability in self-custody solutions. The Trust Wallet hack incident highlights both the vulnerabilities and the evolving responsibility frameworks in decentralized finance. What Exactly Happened in the Trust Wallet Hack? According to reports from Cointelegraph, the Trust Wallet hack resulted in approximately $7 million in damages. The incident involved unauthorized access to user funds through the self-custody wallet platform. Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance which acquired Trust Wallet in 2018, personally addressed the situation to reassure users about their asset security. Zhao explained that while the investigation continues, all user funds remain fundamentally safe. The company’s immediate response demonstrates their commitment to user protection. This approach contrasts with many historical crypto incidents where users bore full responsibility for losses. Why Is Trust Wallet’s Compensation Promise Important? Trust Wallet’s decision to cover all losses represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency security practices. Here are the key implications: User Protection Priority: By assuming financial responsibility, Trust Wallet places user security above profit considerations Industry Standard Setting: This move pressures other wallet providers to enhance their security and accountability measures Trust Reinforcement: Despite the Trust Wallet hack , the compensation promise actually strengthens user confidence in the platform Regulatory Alignment: This proactive approach aligns with increasing regulatory expectations for consumer protection in crypto How Does This Affect the Future of Crypto Security? The aftermath of the Trust Wallet hack provides valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. First, it demonstrates that even established, reputable platforms face security challenges. Second, it shows that responsible companies can turn security incidents into trust-building opportunities through transparent communication and financial accountability. For users, this incident reinforces several important practices: Always enable additional security features like two-factor authentication Regularly update wallet software to benefit from security patches Consider spreading assets across multiple storage solutions Stay informed about platform security updates and announcements What Can We Learn From This Security Incident? The Trust Wallet hack and subsequent compensation announcement offer crucial insights into the maturing cryptocurrency landscape. While the incident itself is concerning, the response sets a positive precedent for how crypto companies should handle security breaches. The investigation’s findings will likely lead to enhanced security protocols that benefit all Trust Wallet users and potentially influence industry-wide standards. Moreover, this situation highlights the importance of choosing platforms with strong backing and established reputations. Trust Wallet’s connection to Binance provided both the resources and the incentive to make users whole, which might not be the case with smaller, independent wallet providers.

According to remarks attributed to the SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, the long-anticipated Crypto Clarity Act and the Market Structure Bill are now heading to Congress , a move that could dramatically reshape the digital asset landscape. If passed, these reforms are expected to reduce market manipulation by as much as 80%, restoring confidence to a sector long plagued by regulatory uncertainty. At the heart of both bills is a push to clearly distinguish between digital assets that qualify as securities and those that function more like commodities or payment tokens. For years, the lack of clear definitions has created confusion for crypto firms, investors, and regulators alike. The proposed legislation aims to allocate oversight responsibilities more precisely between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), reducing enforcement-by-litigation and replacing it with rule-based clarity. Therefore, this clarity could be especially meaningful for XRP. Ripple’s token has been one of the most high-profile examples of regulatory ambiguity, spending years entangled in legal disputes over whether XRP should be classified as a security. While recent court rulings have already offered partial relief by differentiating between retail and institutional sales, comprehensive legislation could further solidify XRP’s regulatory status. If the Crypto Clarity Act provides explicit criteria under which tokens like XRP are deemed non-securities when used for payments or network utility. On the other hand, the Market Structure Bill could also benefit XRP by establishing standardized rules for trading venues, custody, and settlement. XRP’s use case as a bridge asset for cross-border payments aligns well with a regulated market structure that emphasizes transparency, compliance, and efficiency. Clear rules could accelerate partnerships between Ripple and traditional financial institutions, particularly banks seeking blockchain-based payment solutions that meet regulatory standards. Beyond XRP specifically, these bills could boost overall market sentiment. Regulatory certainty tends to reduce risk premiums, attract institutional capital, and foster innovation. For XRP, which already has an established infrastructure and real-world utility, being on the right side of regulatory clarity could translate into renewed demand and long-term growth. Conclusion The SEC Chairman’s confirmation that the Crypto Clarity Act and Market Structure Bill are headed to Congress signals a pivotal shift for U.S. crypto regulation. By replacing long-standing uncertainty with clear, enforceable rules, the legislation could unlock stalled growth across the industry with XRP expected to be a major beneficiary. Clear statutory definitions for digital assets and market oversight could finally lift the regulatory overhang, opening the door to deeper liquidity, broader exchange support, and increased institutional participation. If passed, these bills could not only legitimize XRP’s status as a compliant, utility-focused asset but also position it at the forefront of a more transparent, mature, and innovation-friendly crypto market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 09:44:19

Market experts predict pain ahead. In fact, prominent crypto analyst Doctor Profit believes the asset could bottom out in September-October 2026. Long Bear Market for Bitcoin In a recent tweet, he explained that he has moved all remaining USDT back into the banking system and currently holds no liquid crypto assets, while citing the ongoing bear market as the reason. Doctor Profit said that the current market conditions do not warrant staying liquid in crypto, and he believes the bear phase will continue for a long period. He also disclosed his largest positions, including a BTC short from the $115,000-$125,000 range and a medium-sized BTC holding purchased around 85,000. He intends to ride a potential short-term upswing toward $107,000 before the next downward leg in February-March. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $89,259 after a 2% daily gain. While the asset did show some short-term upward movement, it continues to hover below crucial resistance levels. According to CryptoQuant, $100,000 is a major short-term resistance for BTC, largely due to the concentration of cost bases among recent whale investors and Binance users. New whales, who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days, have an average cost basis of roughly $100,500. This makes it a critical break-even zone where profit-taking or fresh accumulation could determine the near-term price trend. On the other hand, Binance spot users average around $56,000, providing a significant support level in a potential extended bear phase. Long-term whales with holdings over 155 days have an average cost basis of around $40,000, which means that they remain significantly profitable and are likely contributing to recent profit-taking activity. $40K Drop Risk Supporting the broader bearish narrative, analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted Bitcoin’s behavior around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). He explained that in past cycles, losing this level has typically led to an average decline of about 54%. When applied to current prices, such a move would mean a potential drop toward $40,000. The analyst did not call for an immediate selloff, but did warn that failure to reclaim this level could expose the crypto asset to extended downside pressure.

This is the ambitious vision behind the Midnight blockchain , a new project from the Cardano ecosystem that its founder, Charles Hoskinson, is calling nothing less than the “Manhattan Project” for privacy technology. But what does this dramatic comparison mean for the future of crypto and data security? What is the Midnight Blockchain Project? Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano (ADA), has set his sights on a monumental challenge: building the ultimate privacy-preserving blockchain. He has dubbed this new spin-off project, Midnight , the “Manhattan Project” for privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). This historical reference signals a focused, intensive, and groundbreaking effort to solve one of digital society’s core dilemmas—how to balance transparency with personal privacy. Hoskinson is deeply immersed in the technical work, reportedly writing 80 to 100 pages of documentation daily. An internal workshop is planned for January to accelerate development. The goal is clear: to create a foundational technology that redefines how data is handled on-chain. Why is Midnight Being Called a Privacy Revolution? The core innovation of the Midnight blockchain lies in its use of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Simply put, PETs are cryptographic tools that allow for computation and verification without exposing the underlying raw data. For example, you could prove you are over 18 without showing your birthdate, or verify a transaction’s validity without revealing the amount or parties involved. Midnight aims to integrate these technologies at its core, focusing on three critical pillars: Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs): The bedrock for confidential computation. Chain Abstraction: Simplifying user interaction across different blockchains. Smart Compliance: Enabling regulatory requirements to be met automatically and privately. This triad addresses the major pain points of current public blockchains: data exposure, complexity, and regulatory uncertainty. What Challenges Will the Midnight Blockchain Face? Labeling a project the “Manhattan Project” sets incredibly high expectations. The original was a secretive, state-funded mission with a single, clear objective. Replicating that intensity in the open-source, decentralized world of crypto presents unique hurdles. Firstly, achieving robust, scalable, and user-friendly privacy is a formidable technical challenge. Secondly, the project must navigate the complex global landscape of financial regulations. “Smart compliance” is an elegant concept, but its practical implementation will be closely watched by regulators worldwide. Finally, it must gain adoption and trust from developers and users who are cautious of new, unproven networks. How Could Midnight Reshape the Crypto Landscape? If successful, the Midnight blockchain could unlock transformative use cases. Consider supply chain tracking where companies can prove ethical sourcing without exposing sensitive supplier data. Envision financial services where loans are approved based on private credit scores, or digital voting systems that are both verifiable and anonymous. For the Cardano ecosystem, a successful Midnight sidechain could drive significant utility and value to ADA, positioning it as a hub for secure, enterprise-grade decentralized applications. It represents a strategic move beyond pure currency into the realm of confidential data infrastructure. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Data Privacy? Charles Hoskinson’s comparison of Midnight to the Manhattan Project is a powerful statement of intent. It is not merely an upgrade; it is a dedicated mission to build a new paradigm for privacy on the blockchain. While the path ahead is steep, the potential reward—a world where individuals and businesses can operate with both transparency and confidentiality—is profound. The crypto community will be watching closely as this ambitious project moves from intense documentation to a working reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the Midnight blockchain? A: Midnight is a privacy-focused blockchain and sidechain project from the Cardano ecosystem, designed to be a foundational platform for privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Q: Why is it called the “Manhattan Project”? A: Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson uses the term to emphasize the project’s intense, focused, and groundbreaking mission to solve core challenges in data privacy and blockchain technology. Q: How does Midnight protect privacy? A: It uses Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), which are cryptographic methods that allow data to be verified and computed without ever exposing the original, sensitive information. Q: Is Midnight a separate cryptocurrency from Cardano’s ADA? A: Midnight is a separate blockchain project (a sidechain) within the Cardano ecosystem. It will have its own tokenomics and rules but is designed to interoperate with the main Cardano chain. Q: What are the main goals of the Midnight blockchain? A: Its three main pillars are advancing Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), enabling seamless chain abstraction for users, and building tools for smart, automated compliance with regulations. Q: When will Midnight launch? A: There is no official public launch date yet. Development is in active stages, with an internal workshop planned for January to advance the technical groundwork.

Over 1 billion OZ tokens have been bought by investors, and the fund size is now reached the $5 million target. The growth momentum and both numbers could increase higher upon listing. OZ and SOL Solana tokens, for a broader reference, were around $0.6893 on April 17, 2020. SOL then surged to $27.82 on April 16, 2021. Thereby marking a 40.35x gain in a single year. The token is now listed at $142.59, up by 28176.58% from the all-time low value of $0.5052, which was recorded on May 12, 2020. The early-stage momentum of OZ is demonstrated by the fact that investors have bought more than 1.03 billion tokens and have pumped over $5.12 million in funds. More tokens are being bought every day, and funds are inching closer to the $5.5 million milestone. The growth momentum is also demonstrated by the price uptick of 14x. OZ has surged from $0.001 to $0.014. It is next estimated to rise by 71x and reach the target price of $1 upon listing. Longer projections forecast that the token may generate 300x ROI months after getting listed on exchange platforms. Ozak AI Ecosystem Boosting its Growth The growth momentum of Ozak AI is mainly credited to its ecosystem, which houses a fusion of AI tools, tokenized growth, and decentralized infrastructure. These collectively enable the community to earn auto-optimized yields and make real-time informed financial decisions. A deeper dive brings out components like DePIN and cross-chain functionality. The latter is critically essential because it facilitates long-term sustainable growth. Cross-chain functionality boosts operations of Ozak AI across multiple blockchains by enhancing its compatibility in the Web3 sphere. DePIN, an acronym for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, prevents malicious manipulation of the data structure. It distributes the data across a network of nodes - simultaneously supporting redundancy for scalability and resilience. Growing Interest in Ozak AI Ozak AI accumulating strongest early-stage momentum is further on the grounds of strategic alliances established to this point, like the one with Openledger. An association between Ozak AI and Openledger encompasses bringing together Prediction Agents and on-chain data/model tools. The objective is to create better ways to handle AI training and boosting datasets driven by the community. Ozak AI has entered into similar partnerships with Meganet, Phala Network, and SINT, among many others. Key Takeaways Ozak AI is approaching the $5 million milestone. It has sold over 1 billion OZ tokens to mark the strongest early-stage momentum since Solana. Contributing to this pace are its technical components and growing interest of AI crypto market players in the Ozak AI ecosystem.

56391053,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93328,1766743211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before BTC Hits 150K?,https://timestabloid.com/whats-the-best-crypto-to-buy-before-btc-hits-150k/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) moves closer to the highly anticipated 150K milestone, the market focus is already shifting toward early-stage projects that are positioned to benefit from the next expansion cycle. History shows that while Bitcoin (BTC) leads the rally, the strongest gains often come from platforms that enter the market with real utility, clear demand, and solid structure. This is exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand out as a new crypto coin designed to attract serious crypto investment attention before the broader market catches on. Presale Momentum Is Building Before the Market Turns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing through its presale with strong participation across all phases. The total supply is fixed at 4 billion tokens, and combining all presale phases so far, around $19.45 million has already been generated. The current presale price is set at $0.035, offering early participants an entry point before broader exposure. More than 18,600 holders have joined across all phases, reflecting growing confidence in the project’s direction. In the current phase, 98% of the 170 million token allocation has already been sold, signaling tightening availability as demand continues to rise. A major accessibility update has further strengthened presale momentum. Investors can now purchase MUTM tokens using a card, with no purchase limits. This change will remove barriers for new participants and will accelerate onboarding as the presale approaches later stages. As Bitcoin (BTC)’s upward trajectory continues to draw new capital into the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will already be positioned with a strong base of holders and limited remaining supply at early pricing. A Lending Platform Built for Real Market Use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed around two complementary models that address different risk profiles. In simple terms, the platform will allow users to lend assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing more collateral than they borrow, ensuring system stability. The first model, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), will focus on well-known and liquid assets. Lenders will pool assets such as stablecoins and established cryptocurrencies into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access these pools by providing overcollateralized positions. Interest rates will automatically adjust based on pool usage, rising as demand increases and easing when liquidity is abundant. This dynamic structure will create balance, encouraging deposits while discouraging excessive borrowing. Depositors in P2C will receive mtTokens, which will represent their share of the pool along with accumulated interest. These mtTokens will also function as collateral, unlocking additional flexibility within the system. Borrowers will be able to choose between variable rates that respond to market conditions or stable rates that offer predictable repayment costs. Stable rates will begin at a higher level to reflect added certainty and will rebalance under defined conditions to protect liquidity. For assets that carry higher volatility or lower liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a separate Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model. This environment will isolate riskier tokens such as meme coins from the core liquidity pools. In P2P lending, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, including interest rates and loan duration. Since there will be no shared pool, lenders will accept greater risk in exchange for higher returns. This structure will preserve overall protocol safety while expanding earning opportunities across different market segments. Audit and Protocol Announcement on X and Impact Security remains a central focus. An independent audit by Halborn Security thoroughly testing Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing contracts for vulnerabilities and errors. With the code finalized, this review will ensure reliability, correct functionality, and strong protection for users, reinforcing trust as the platform approaches launch. The protocol’s first version is expected to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Version 1 will include core components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. All loans will require overcollateralization, monitored through a Stability Factor. When collateral values fall below required thresholds, liquidations will activate automatically, preventing bad debt from affecting the wider system. Deploying V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the platform before the mainnet rollout. This phased launch promotes openness, supports early user involvement, and allows the team to gather actionable feedback to refine the protocol. As participation expands and awareness grows, confidence in the ecosystem may strengthen, helping to support long-term interest and demand for the MUTM token. One of the strongest selling points of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its expected simultaneous platform launch and token listing. Instead of releasing a token without functionality, the project is expected to debut with live lending and borrowing modules on day one. This coordinated rollout will create immediate utility, encouraging active participation from traders and lenders alike. The presence of a working product will also support faster consideration from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges, driving visibility and volume. As Bitcoin (BTC) approaches 150K, attention will increasingly shift toward projects that combine timing with substance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will enter the market with capped supply, strong presale traction, audited contracts, and an in process dual lending system designed for real demand. With phase 6 nearing full allocation and accessibility expanding through card purchases, the window for early positioning is narrowing fast.

The talks did not include Ukraine, Putin added, even though the plant remains on Ukrainian territory under international law. Putin said U.S. representatives showed interest in directing excess electricity from the facility toward cryptocurrency mining operations. At the same time, he claimed Washington also raised the idea of supplying electricity from the plant to Ukraine. Kyiv has not confirmed any such discussions and has repeatedly opposed arrangements that bypass Ukrainian authorities. The Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been under Russian control since March 2022. Its status remains one of the most sensitive issues in the war, touching on energy security, nuclear safety, and sovereignty. Control Talks Sideline Ukraine According to Putin, discussions with the United States focused on “joint management” of the plant without Ukraine’s involvement. He said Ukrainian technical staff continue to work at the facility but now hold Russian passports, a claim Ukrainian officials have previously rejected as illegitimate. Ukrainian authorities have instead promoted alternative frameworks. In recent comments reported by RBC Ukraine , Kyiv proposed a model of joint operation that would involve Ukraine and international partners, not bilateral talks between Moscow and Washington. Ukrainian officials argue that any governance arrangement must restore Ukrainian control and ensure demilitarization of the site. The International Atomic Energy Agency has maintained a presence at Zaporizhzhia and continues to warn about safety risks linked to military activity near the plant. Power disruptions and reliance on backup systems have kept the facility in a fragile operating state. Energy Crisis and Crypto Angle The comments come as Ukraine enters winter with a strained power grid. A recent report by The Wall Street Journal described ongoing attacks on energy infrastructure that have forced rolling outages across the country, increasing pressure to secure stable electricity supplies. Against that backdrop, the idea of using nuclear-generated power for crypto mining adds a new dimension to the dispute. Bitcoin mining requires large, steady energy inputs, and nuclear plants provide consistent baseload power. However, critics argue that raising crypto mining in talks about a war-zone nuclear facility highlights how far negotiations have drifted from Ukraine’s priorities.

56391162,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93341,1766743357,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: Next XRP Explosive Rally Is Coming Soon. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-next-xrp-explosive-rally-is-coming-soon-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) has returned focus to XRP’s long-term structure, pointing to a recurring behavior that has defined its biggest historical moves. His analysis centers on XRP’s tendency to spend extended periods consolidating inside wedge formations before resolving with sharp upward expansions. The weekly chart he shared highlights this pattern across multiple market cycles, raising questions about whether XRP is nearing another decisive phase. #XRP loves to consolidate in wedges. Next explosive move up coming soon pic.twitter.com/8cRL98elUX — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 23, 2025 Repeating Consolidation Phases on the Weekly Chart At first glance, XRP’s recent price action appears uneventful. However, consolidation has often preceded major trend changes in XRP’s history. The chart outlines several large wedge structures stretching back more than a decade. Each wedge formation indicates a period where price action tightened between converging trendlines. The first wedge began in 2014, and XRP remained within this formation until it began a rapid ascent in 2017. However, it paused and entered another wedge for a few months before resuming its climb. This move culminated in its previous peak of $3.36 in January 2018. Recently, XRP entered the longest wedge in its history. It attempted to break out of this formation, but its price was held back by the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The 2024 Breakout and the Current Wedge In late 2024, the crypto market began a massive rally after Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. election. XRP rode this wave, breaking out of that multi-year consolidation and rising by over 500%. Following this move, XRP continued that climb in 2025, reaching a new peak of $3.65 in July . However, the asset’s momentum has stalled, and CryptoBull’s chart shows it trading within another wedge. The rallies that followed the previous wedges were not marginal. They defined XRP’s most aggressive upside periods. A repeat of this pattern could send XRP to new heights. Where XRP May Be Headed Next CryptoBull suggests that XRP is approaching another inflection point. The chart shows XRP near the apex of the current wedge, and he believes the surge is imminent. Many analysts are convinced that XRP will rise significantly in 2026 , and CryptoBull’s chart supports that idea. While the analyst does not provide a specific price target, the context of the chart implies a quick transition from consolidation to expansion. A sustained break above long-term resistance would mark a structural shift rather than a short-term breakout.

The Bank of Lithuania said crypto service providers that fail to secure the required license by December 31 will be treated as operating illegally and may face enforcement action. The message targets firms offering crypto exchange services and custodial wallets to Lithuanian users. According to the regulator, only companies licensed under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets framework, known as MiCA , will be allowed to continue operating after the transition period ends. The announcement places pressure on dozens of firms that registered in Lithuania during earlier, lighter regulatory regimes. Many now face a hard deadline to either comply with EU wide rules or exit the market. The regulator stressed that licensing can be obtained either directly from Lithuania or from another EU member state. However, firms must hold an approved MiCA authorization to operate across the bloc. Registration alone will no longer be sufficient. While it did not list specific sanctions, Lithuanian law allows for fines, orders to cease operations, and removal from the national crypto register. Users Urged to Check Providers Early Alongside the warning to firms, the Bank of Lithuania issued guidance to crypto users. It urged customers to check whether their service provider has applied for or obtained a MiCA license before the end of the year. If a provider plans to exit the market, users should act before December 31. The regulator said clients can request transfers of crypto assets to licensed providers or to self hosted wallets under their own control. For fiat balances, customers may instruct providers to move funds to personal bank accounts or to other payment institutions, depending on contract terms. The central bank said early action reduces the risk of service disruptions or delays. Part of a Broader EU Regulatory Shift Lithuania was once a popular hub for crypto firms due to its fast registration process. However, EU regulators have since moved to tighten oversight following market collapses and consumer losses in recent years. MiCA introduces unified rules on licensing, governance, capital requirements, and consumer protection across the EU. National regulators, including the Bank of Lithuania, now play a supervisory role only over licensed entities. As the deadline approaches, Lithuania’s message is direct. Crypto companies must meet EU standards or leave the market. Users, meanwhile, are being told not to wait until the final days to secure their assets.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 10:05:25

The event closed with record $28B in notional value. Deribit options reached the peak day of expiry, combining the monthly, quarterly, and yearly event. Historically, large-scale options repositioning has led to market volatility. Deribit is also closely watched for a hint on trader sentiment and the potential to determine the future direction of BTC. gm to everyone who knows that the largest options expiry day of the year is here — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) December 26, 2025 On Friday, 267,000 BTC options expire, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.35. The notional value of yearly BTC options is a total of $23.6B, with maximum pain above current prices at $95,000. On the Ethereum market, a total of 1.28M options expired, with a nominal value of $3.71B and maximum pain at $3,100. Deribit marks the largest options expiry in history The options market in 2025 gained influence, as a way to protect from the downside to BTC trading. The yearly event with $28B in total options is the largest in trading history, reflecting the increasing scale of cryptocurrency activity and the effect of institutions and whales. The event will affect more than half the open options positions on Deribit. Ahead of the settlement, trading volumes also rose due to repositioning. After the settlement, March options are the most influential, accumulating 30% of open interest. Deribit awaits a record options expiry event, with $28B in notional positions expiring, out of a total open interest of $42B. | Source: CoinGlass . The options expire at a time when the crypto fear and greed index is at 27 points , slightly up from last week’s 21 points. The options accumulation followed an increasingly volatile market for BTC and ETH. The leading coins are also pressured by multiple factors, including slow trading during the year-end period, as well as a general loss of positive sentiment. The fourth quarter of 2025 is also one of the worst in crypto history, despite expectations for a year in the green. BTC reached new price records, but quickly broke down, following unexpected market volatility. As a result, the options market reflected seller strategies and attempts to protect from a bear market downside. Deribit options point to ongoing fears of BTC dip After repositioning, Deribit options are signaling further expectations of a downside for BTC . During previous options expiry events, most Deribit traders set up put options at $85,000 to $80,000. Currently, the most numerous options by strike price are at $75,000, with high levels still available at $80,000 and $85,000. Call options start growing above $90,000, where traders are signaling a return to a potential bull market. BTC traded at $88,701.51, remaining in a narrow range for the past month. Despite this, any attempt to break out above $90,000 has invited more selling and long liquidations. The yearly options expiry is also expected to bring more volatility, with some price range anomalies during the low-volume trading period.

RWA tokenization emerged as one of the few thriving sectors. Crypto narratives showed weakness in all of 2025, with most of the dependable categories posting deep losses. Only a handful of narratives saw net gains and sustainable structure. Overall, returns remained low in 2025, with most tokens outperforming the market only in the short term. RWA tokens emerged as the most profitable class in 2025 on average, with over 185% net growth. The strongest narratives offset losses in other crypto trends. In 2025, the bull cycle achieved much lower returns, with fewer opportunities for 100X growth compared to previous cycles. This time, investors were seeking infrastructure and sustainability, rather than outsized gain potential. According to Coingecko research, RWA tokens returned 185.8% on average, based on the performance of top tokens. The smaller assets still underperformed. Tokenization appeared as one of the major trends in late 2025, based on demand for on-chain stock exposure. Chainlink (LINK) emerged as a proxy for tokenized stocks, while smaller platforms retained relatively low valuations. ONDO had a market cap of just $1.2B, despite being one of the major hubs for tokenization. L1 crypto narrative struggled in the past year L1 chains were considered blue chips, but most of the assets also slowed down in the past year. ETH is down a net 10% for the past 12 months, despite the growing activity. Ethereum emerged as a utility chain with growth in stablecoins, lending, and other activities, but ETH failed to break out to a higher range. SOL is down over 34% in the past month, at $123.52. Despite becoming a trading hub and a strong meme season, SOL did not manage to retain significant earnings. The only exceptions among L1 tokens were BNB, up by 22% net in the past year, and TRX, rising by 9.9% net. Both tokens are down from their all-time peak, but are among the few major L1 chains in the green. Smaller L1 chains fared the worst, as they lost traffic to L2 networks. AVAX was down by 66.5% for the year, despite expectations of emerging as a key liquidity hub and reinventing itself as a DeFi chain. Telegram’s TON token is down by 73.4% in the past year, down to $1.52. The network failed to capture sufficient liquidity, despite the inflow of users from Telegram. Memes and AI agents track losses despite popularity Memes and AI agents helped build new types of on-chain and consumer structures. Briefly, those narratives offset the lack of an altcoin market. Memes lost 31.6% on average, while AI agent tokens are down by 50.2% for the year to date. The slowdown of memes and AI agents affected DEX activity, leading to a 55.5% slump in DEX-based tokens. L2 chains, some of which were used for memes and AI agents, are down by 40.6% on average. Again, token performance does not always reflect on-chain activity, as some of the networks retained their liquidity and some of the trading volumes. The Solana ecosystem as a whole was down more than 64%, based on the slower meme market. The worst performers in 2025 were GameFi and DePIN tokens. The AI narrative was not sufficient to reawaken older DePIN tokens, which are down by over 95% on average. In 2025, tokens and altcoins also showed the market rarely returned to old assets, instead seeking new trends and use cases.

While hundreds of platforms now advertise themselves as crypto casinos, only a fraction operate with proper licensing, transparent rules, and consistent payout behavior. For players betting with Bitcoin, trust matters just as much as bonuses or game variety. This review focuses on licensed BTC casinos that meet basic standards of safety and reliability. We compare how leading crypto casino sites handle licensing, Bitcoin support, sign-up bonuses, and overall usability — helping players separate trusted platforms from short-term operations. What Makes a Crypto Casino “Licensed” and Why It Matters A licensed crypto casino operates under a recognized gambling authority, which sets minimum standards for how the platform runs. While crypto casinos differ from traditional online casinos in payments and wallets, licensing still plays a critical role in protecting players. At a practical level, licensing usually means: Clear ownership and operating structure Publicly stated bonus and wagering rules Defined withdrawal procedures Accountability if disputes arise For players, this matters most after a win. Unlicensed platforms may accept deposits easily, but problems often appear when withdrawals or bonus terms are involved. A license doesn’t guarantee perfection — it creates responsibility. Most reputable crypto casino online platforms operate under international licenses such as Curaçao or similar jurisdictions that allow cryptocurrency gambling. These licenses are not overly restrictive, but they enforce baseline transparency. How We Review and Compare Crypto Casino Sites Not all crypto casinos are reviewed equally. For this comparison, we focus on factors that directly affect real gameplay — not just marketing claims. Our review process prioritizes: License and RegulationWe verify whether the platform operates under an active gambling license and clearly displays it. Bitcoin and Crypto SupportA true cryptocurrency casino should support BTC deposits and withdrawals without forced conversions or delays. Bonuses and Wagering TermsSign-up bonuses are evaluated based on clarity, wagering requirements, and usability — not headline size alone. User Experience and ReliabilityInterface stability, payout behavior, and consistency matter more than flashy features. By focusing on these criteria, we aim to highlight safe and trusted crypto gambling sites rather than short-lived promotions. Top Licensed BTC Casinos Compared Not all licensed crypto casinos are built the same. Some focus on fast payouts, others on loyalty rewards, and a few aim to deliver a fully decentralized, privacy-first experience. Below is an updated comparison of licensed BTC casinos based on game depth, crypto support, bonuses, and overall trust factors. Casino License Games BTC & Crypto Support Welcome Bonus KYC Policy Best For Dexsport Anjouan 10,000+ BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TRON + 40+ coins 480% (3 deposits) + 300 FS No KYC Anonymity, transparency, all-in-one Instant Casino Anjouan 4,500+ BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE, BNB 200% up to $7,500 No KYC Fast payouts & simplicity BC.Game Curaçao 10,000+ BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, TRON 180% + daily rewards Conditional Long-term VIP rewards Wild.io Curaçao 7,000+ BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, USDT 350% + 200 FS Conditional Game variety & tiered bonuses Cybet Anjouan 3,500+ BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, LTC 100% + 50 FS Conditional Hybrid casino + sportsbook How These Crypto Casinos Compare in Practice The comparison highlights clear differences in positioning. Dexsport stands out as the most privacy-oriented platform, combining a massive game library, no-KYC access, and on-chain transparency. Its audited smart contracts, public bet desk, and multi-chain support make it closer to a decentralized betting ecosystem than a traditional crypto casino. Instant Casino focuses on speed and convenience. It delivers fast crypto payouts and a clean UX, though higher wagering requirements may limit its appeal for bonus-focused players. BC.Game remains one of the strongest choices for long-term users. Its provably fair system, extensive rewards, and community-driven model work best for players who stay active over time. Wild.io balances game variety and bonuses well, offering a large catalog and frequent promotions, though wagering requirements are higher than average. Cybet is still establishing its reputation but offers a solid all-in-one model with casino, sportsbook, and esports betting under one roof. The key difference is philosophy:some platforms optimize for rewards, others for speed — while Dexsport prioritizes privacy, transparency, and user control. Sign Up Bonuses at Licensed Crypto Casinos — What to Look For Sign up bonuses are often the first thing players notice when choosing a crypto casino online. However, headline percentages rarely tell the full story. The real value of a bonus depends on how usable it is in practice. When reviewing crypto casino sites, a few factors matter more than the bonus size itself: Wagering requirementsLower or flexible wagering makes it easier to convert bonus funds into real BTC withdrawals. Game contribution rulesSome games contribute less to wagering, which can slow progress unexpectedly. Crypto vs fiat logicBonuses designed specifically for crypto users tend to have clearer terms and faster settlement. Additional incentivesCashback, free spins, or sports free bets often provide better long-term value than one-time matches. Large welcome bonuses can be attractive, but experienced players usually prefer transparent conditions over aggressive promotions. Licensed platforms are generally better at disclosing these rules upfront, which reduces friction later. A good sign up bonus supports play — it doesn’t block withdrawals. Risks to Consider Even at Licensed Crypto Casinos Licensing improves trust, but it does not remove risk entirely. Players using a cryptocurrency casino should still be aware of a few important limitations. Common considerations include: Conditional KYC triggersEven no-KYC platforms may request verification after large or unusual withdrawals. Bonus abuse policiesLicensed casinos strictly enforce wagering and behavior rules. Crypto volatilityUsing BTC can amplify gains — and losses — independently of gameplay results. Self-control during fast playInstant deposits and withdrawals can encourage over-betting without proper limits. Licensed crypto casinos provide structure and accountability, but bankroll management and asset choice remain the player’s responsibility. Conclusion The crypto casino market has matured significantly, but not all platforms have evolved at the same pace. Licensing, transparency, and consistent payout behavior now separate long-term operators from short-lived projects. Among the platforms reviewed, each serves a different type of player — from loyalty-driven users to those prioritizing speed or bonuses. What sets stronger platforms apart is balance: reliable licensing, native Bitcoin support, usable bonuses, and clear operational rules. Dexsport fits this profile as one of the top crypto casino options for players who value privacy, multi-chain flexibility, and verifiable transparency.

According to the publication, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that United States representatives expressed direct interest in establishing a cryptocurrency mining facility utilizing the plant’s substantial energy output. This revelation immediately raises profound questions about energy security, wartime diplomacy, and the evolving intersection of digital assets with global power dynamics. Cryptocurrency Mining Proposal Emerges From Ceasefire Talks The Kommersant report, which has drawn significant international attention, details how discussions about the Zaporizhzhia plant extended beyond immediate security concerns. Consequently, the dialogue reportedly included speculative economic projects for the facility’s future. Russian officials apparently expressed hope for cooperation with the United States on operating the plant. Meanwhile, U.S. negotiators, according to the same sources, proposed a potential joint operation structure. This structure would theoretically grant equal stakes to Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. However, the outlet crucially emphasized that the feasibility of any cryptocurrency mining project remains entirely uncertain at this stage. No concrete technical or financial agreements have been reached, and the proposal exists primarily as a discussed concept. This development occurs against a complex geopolitical backdrop. The Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been under Russian military control since early 2022. Its status remains a persistent flashpoint in the ongoing conflict. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned of the severe safety risks posed by military activity near the reactors. Therefore, introducing a discussion about energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining adds a novel and contentious layer to an already volatile situation. Industry analysts note that nuclear power plants offer a unique proposition for bitcoin mining operations: they provide massive, consistent baseload power, which is a critical requirement for the energy-hungry process of validating blockchain transactions. Analyzing the Technical and Political Feasibility The technical logistics of establishing a mining operation at an active nuclear facility are extraordinarily complex. First, cryptocurrency mining requires dedicated, high-capacity computing infrastructure—thousands of specialized ASIC miners. These machines would need secure installation, constant cooling, and a direct, stable connection to the plant’s power grid. Second, diverting significant megawatts from a critical civilian energy source during a regional war would inevitably trigger humanitarian and ethical concerns. Ukraine has previously faced severe energy shortages due to targeted infrastructure attacks. Third, the security of such an operation in a conflict zone would be nearly impossible to guarantee, posing risks to both the physical hardware and the digital assets being mined. From a political perspective, the proposal appears equally fraught. The United States government maintains stringent sanctions against Russian entities and has been a leading military supporter of Ukraine. A joint commercial venture on occupied territory would contradict established policy positions. Furthermore, the Ukrainian government has consistently stated its goal is the full restoration of its territorial integrity, including the Zaporizhzhia plant. Kyiv would likely view any deal legitimizing Russian control as unacceptable. Experts in international law suggest such an arrangement would face immediate legal challenges and could be seen as violating sanctions regimes. Expert Perspectives on Nuclear Energy and Crypto Mining Energy economists and cryptocurrency analysts provide critical context for this unusual proposal. Dr. Elena Petrova, a senior fellow at the Center for Energy Policy, notes, “Nuclear plants are designed for steady-state grid load. Cryptocurrency mining can act as a controllable, flexible demand source, potentially helping to balance a grid. However, co-locating major computing infrastructure at a plant under international scrutiny and in a war zone introduces unprecedented risk factors that likely outweigh any theoretical economic benefit.” Her analysis underscores the tension between a technically interesting application of excess energy and the grim reality of the plant’s current situation. Meanwhile, blockchain technology experts point to precedent. “There are existing pilot projects exploring behind-the-meter bitcoin mining at power generation sites, including some in the United States,” explains Mark Chen, a data center strategist. “The goal is to monetize stranded or excess energy and improve grid stability. The Zaporizhzhia concept follows this logic but transplants it into a completely non-commercial, hyper-politicized environment. The primary hurdles here are not technological; they are overwhelmingly geopolitical and security-based.” This expert view frames the proposal as a familiar idea placed in a uniquely hostile context. The Broader Context of Crypto Mining and Geopolitics The discussion does not exist in a vacuum. It reflects a broader global trend where nations are strategically positioning themselves within the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem. Following China’s 2021 mining ban, operations relocated to countries with cheap, abundant energy, often from fossil fuels. This has led to environmental criticism. Proponents of nuclear-powered mining argue it offers a low-carbon alternative. A joint U.S.-Russia venture, however hypothetical, could be interpreted as an attempt to shape governance and gain influence in this emerging sector, using the ZNPP as a high-stakes bargaining chip. The timeline of events is also crucial. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been a central concern since its capture. IAEA missions have continuously advocated for a safety and security protection zone. Introducing a commercial mining proposal during ceasefire talks suggests some parties are thinking about long-term economic utilization of captured infrastructure. This could complicate diplomatic efforts focused solely on demilitarization and return to Ukrainian control. The table below outlines key conflicting priorities at play: Table: Conflicting Priorities at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Humanitarian & Safety Priority: Immediate demilitarization, establishment of a safety zone, prevention of a nuclear accident. Ukrainian Sovereignty Priority: Full restoration of Ukrainian control and operational authority over the plant. Proposed Economic Priority: Leveraging the plant’s energy for commercial projects like cryptocurrency mining. Diplomatic Priority: Using the plant as a point of negotiation in broader ceasefire and settlement talks. Conclusion The reported discussion of cryptocurrency mining at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant reveals the increasingly complex intersection of digital asset economies with traditional geopolitics. While the proposal remains speculative and faces monumental technical, legal, and ethical barriers, its mere mention in high-level ceasefire talks is significant. It highlights how actors may view strategic infrastructure through multiple lenses: as military assets, diplomatic leverage, and potential economic platforms. The future of the Zaporizhzhia plant will ultimately be decided by security and sovereignty concerns. However, this episode underscores that the global contest for influence now extends into the virtual realms of blockchain and bitcoin mining , even amidst the stark realities of armed conflict. FAQs Q1: What exactly was proposed regarding cryptocurrency mining at the Zaporizhzhia plant? According to the Kommersant report, the idea was discussed for the United States and Russia to potentially cooperate on a cryptocurrency mining operation using power from the nuclear plant, with a U.S. suggestion of a three-way equal stake including Ukraine. No formal agreement exists. Q2: Why would a nuclear power plant be considered for cryptocurrency mining? Cryptocurrency mining, especially for Bitcoin, requires immense, constant electricity. Nuclear power plants provide reliable, high-output baseload power, making them a theoretically suitable, low-carbon energy source for large-scale mining operations. Q3: Is it safe to run a crypto mining farm at a nuclear facility? Safety experts express major concerns. Adding large, non-essential industrial load to a plant in a conflict zone could complicate operational safety. The required infrastructure and personnel also introduce new security risks to an already vulnerable site. Q4: How has Ukraine responded to this reported proposal? Ukrainian officials have not formally commented on this specific report. However, Ukraine’s consistent position is the full de-occupation and return of the Zaporizhzhia plant to its control, making any commercial deal involving Russian administration highly unlikely to be accepted. Q5: Does this mean the US is changing its stance on sanctions or the war? Analysts widely interpret the reported discussion as exploratory and highly preliminary. It does not signify a change in official U.S. policy, which continues to support Ukraine and enforce sanctions against Russia. The political and legal obstacles to such a joint venture remain enormous.

As regulations tighten and verification processes become more intrusive, many players are actively looking for no-KYC betting sites that offer speed, privacy, and cross-border access. Crypto has become the natural solution, enabling anonymous betting without relying on banks or traditional identity checks. In this guide, we review the best no-KYC betting sites in Europe, explain how betting without verification actually works, and highlight platforms that combine privacy with reliability—starting with a fully anonymous crypto-native option. What Does “No-KYC Betting” Really Mean? “No-KYC” does not always mean the same thing across platforms. In practice, it refers to betting sites that do not require identity verification at sign-up or during regular play. Most no-KYC betting platforms share these characteristics: No document upload during registration Wallet-based or minimal account creation Crypto deposits and withdrawals only Verification requested only in exceptional cases It’s important to distinguish between: True no-KYC betting sites, where identity checks are not part of the standard flow Low-KYC platforms, which delay verification until certain thresholds are reached For users searching for betting without ID, crypto-first platforms usually offer the clearest and most consistent experience. Why No-KYC Betting Is Popular in Europe European bettors face a unique mix of regulation, payment restrictions, and geo-limitations. No-KYC betting has grown as a response to these pressures rather than as a workaround. The main reasons players choose no-KYC betting sites in Europe include: Privacy concernsMany users prefer not to share personal documents with multiple gambling platforms. Speed and convenienceWithout verification delays, deposits and withdrawals happen faster. Cross-border accessCrypto betting works regardless of local banking limitations. Crypto adoptionEurope has a large base of crypto-native users comfortable with wallet-based betting. For sports bettors who value control over their data and funds, anonymous crypto betting feels more aligned with how the internet already works. Dexsport — Fully Anonymous No-KYC Betting Platform Dexsport is built specifically for players who want sports betting without ID while still accessing a full betting ecosystem. The platform combines a sportsbook, live betting, and a large casino offering under a crypto-native, no-KYC structure. Instant Access Without Verification Dexsport allows users to start betting immediately via: Email or Telegram sign-up DeFi wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet No identity checks or personal data are required, ensuring full anonymity from the first bet to withdrawal.

Start Betting Without ID on Dexsport Betplay — Lightning-Fast No-KYC Crypto Betting Betplay takes a different approach to no-KYC betting, focusing on speed and on-chain execution. The platform supports Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, enabling extremely fast deposits and withdrawals. Betplay offers: Sports betting across 40+ sports Casino games and poker in one account Daily rakeback and weekly cashback While Betplay does not operate under a traditional license and has higher wagering requirements, it appeals to experienced crypto users who prioritize instant payouts and minimal friction. No-KYC Betting vs Licensed Betting — Key Trade-Offs Betting without ID offers clear advantages, but it also comes with trade-offs. Understanding these differences helps players choose the right platform for their priorities. No-KYC betting sites typically offer: Faster registration and withdrawals Minimal data exposure Wallet-based access without banks Licensed, KYC-heavy platforms usually provide: Stronger regulatory oversight Formal dispute resolution channels Mandatory identity verification Neither approach is universally better. Privacy-first users often accept lighter regulation in exchange for speed and control, while others prefer the structure of traditional compliance. Risks of Betting Without ID Even the best no-KYC betting sites are not risk-free. Players should remain aware of potential limitations before committing funds. Key considerations include: Conditional verification in rare or suspicious cases Limited player protection compared to heavily regulated platforms Responsibility for self-custody, including wallet security Fewer formal complaint channels if disputes arise Betting without ID works best for users who are comfortable managing their own risk and understanding platform rules upfront. Who No-KYC Betting Sites Are Best For No-KYC betting is not for everyone—but for certain users, it offers a clear upgrade over traditional sportsbooks. These platforms are especially suitable for: Crypto-native players using non-custodial wallets Bettors who value privacy and anonymity Users betting across borders within Europe Players who prioritize speed over paperwork For these profiles, anonymous crypto betting aligns naturally with how digital assets are already used. Final Verdict — Best No-KYC Betting Sites in Europe No-KYC betting has become a practical choice for European players who value privacy, speed, and control over their funds. While betting without ID comes with trade-offs, the right platform can offer a smooth and secure experience without unnecessary friction. Dexsport stands out as one of the most complete no-KYC betting platforms, combining anonymous access, multi-chain crypto support, live betting with Cash Out, and on-chain transparency. For players looking to bet on sports in Europe without verification, it offers a rare balance of privacy and reliability.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-26 11:25:58

ChatGPT Explains,https://cryptopotato.com/what-must-ripples-xrp-do-to-enjoy-a-merrier-christmas-in-2026-chatgpt-explains/,"With 2025 almost in the history books, it’s time to reflect on certain market behavior, and Ripple’s XRP is quite a curious case. The company behind it is about to notch its perhaps best year to date. It concluded the lawsuit against the US SEC, which had lasted since the end of 2020, announced numerous partnerships with some big names, and completed several significant acquisitions, including the prime broker Hidden Road for well over $1 billion. Its native token also had a highly impressive year, until July, that is. It surged to a new all-time high of $3.65 in the middle of that month, but it has been mostly downhill since then. XRP currently trades below $1.90, which represents a nearly 50% decline in less than half a year. Even the recently launched spot XRP ETFs couldn’t help its case as it dumped more than 20% since mid-November when the first one saw the light of day. So, what more does XRP have to do to enjoy a happier Christmas next year? Christmas 2026: XRP Edition With the 2025 Christmas (almost) over, it’s safe to say that it wasn’t a particularly happy one. The 2024 Christmas saw XRP trading at around $2.30, but in this year’s edition, the asset lost the $2.00 and $1.90 support levels amid calls for a more profound price correction. To find the answer to the question above, we decided to ask ChatGPT, and its first answer was not really groundbreaking. It said that “XRP needs to break out of its long-term downtrend” to have a happier 2026 Christmas. The first step would be to reclaim the $2.20 resistance convincingly and then break and hold above $2.50. If successful, the bulls’ next target will be a retest of the $3.00-$3.20 level, but with strong volume – something that has been missing for the past several months. Second, the AI solution said, “Translate ETF inflows into real market impact.” As repeatedly reported in the past month, the spot XRP ETFs have enjoyed investors’ attention, registering only green days since inception. However, the underlying asset has slumped by double digits within this timeframe. To improve its position by next Christmas, XRP would need: Larger and more consistent ETF inflows Broader institutional participation More behemoths to join the ETF race, such as BlackRock and Fidelity Narratives Matter OpenAI’s solution noted that narratives matter significantly in finance and especially in crypto. While BTC continues to be the market-leader and the ‘digital gold,’ XRP needs to find its own to stage a more profound rally. According to ChatGPT, this could be a “renewed narrative around payments, a clear role in real-world tokenization, or stronger storytelling around enterprise adoption and ETF growth.” Lastly, the AI platform noted that XRP would benefit from improvements to its on-chain utility. It admitted that “Ripple’s payment technology is solid,” but it added that the market “wants scale.” To fuel more long-term sustainable growth in value, the ecosystem would require higher on-chain settlement volume, more financial institutions using XRP liquidity in production, and expansion of ODL corridors and enterprise integrations.

This New Altcoin Under $0.1 Enters Its Final 1% Allocation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-before-q4-2025-ends-this-new-altcoin-under-0-1-enters-its-final-1-allocation/,"The last part of the year can give a hint on where the steam is gathering. Not by sharp price increases, but by constriction of supply, by increased publicity, by projects on which critical milestones were reached simultaneously. Q4 2025 is approaching its end and one of the new altcoins that are below $0.1 is secretly making an entry into that altcoin. This is not more of a speculative moment but more of a positioning moment to those investors who are querying what crypto to buy now before timelines change. This interest is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Developing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that is developing to make the capital chain productive. The platform will enable people to deposit assets and earn money through their mtTokens, whereas borrowers can acquire loans by posting collateral liquidity. The rates are automatically adjusted depending on the level of usage of capital and thus they are able to maintain balance in the system. In fact, in the case when the liquidity is high, then borrowing costs are low and stimulate activity. Increased rates and emerging deposits are achieved when liquidity becomes tight. This is a dynamic model that will ensure that funds are not sitting idle. As stated by official sources on X , V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol will be launched to the Sepolia testnet in the fourth quarter of 2025. The main features will be liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot (the first will support ETH and USDT). The issue of security is being prioritized. The audit is going on with Halborn Security by an independent auditing firm, verifying contracts of lending and borrowing that have been finalized. To analysts tracking DeFi crypto development, this is a sign of preparation, as opposed to rushing into force. Funding Growth and What the Price Signals The interest in Mutuum Finance is supported by the involvement. The company has been able to raise $19.45M and has gained 18,650 investors in the project. This is important since the inclusion of many people usually shows confidence among various market segments, and not dependence on few individuals. The original price of the token was $0.01 and it is currently selling at $0.035, which has increased by 250%. This type of gradualism implies long-term demand as opposed to spurts. To crypto trackers, steady increases over time can be taken to be a better indicator of financial trends than irregular surges. According to market commentators, the underlying conviction is indicated when a new cryptocurrency exhibits this trend, prior to mainstream publicity. Supply Structure, Tokens Sold and Community Activity The total supply of the tokens in Mutuum Finance total 4B MUTM. Out of that, 45.5% is to be distributed at an early stage, which amounts to approximately 1.82B tokens. It has already sold 825M tokens. What this means is simple. There are lesser tokens at current levels since allocation becomes tight. When the supply is low, and the interest increases, the situation tends to alter rapidly. This stage has seen a high level of community involvement. A 24 hour leader board will give the highest daily contaminant $500 in MUTM and will ensure that the activity remains going on as the allocation becomes slim. The project has also been concerned with easing the entry barriers such as the support of card payments. The wider participation can be supported by easier access, which is important to get adoption at the post-launch. Long term Plans The issue of security has been tackled early. Mutuum Finance has already passed the CertiK audit with a score of 90/100 token scan, which is another source of confidence. This, together with the current Halbon Security review, presents a multi-layered risk management approach. In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance will launch a stablecoin, which is supported by various assets according to the official roadmap. This helps the borrowers in having various collateral as opposed to having one token. This system allows the company to be more resilient in volatile markets as the risk is spread. The design also comprises reliable pricing. The protocol expects the decentralized oracle feeds e.g. Chainlink, which is backed by fallback sources. Pricing is extremely important in collateral valuation and liquidations particularly in rapidly moving markets. To many analysts, early success in this area can lead to bigger problems in the future. Why Timing Is Developing Urgency Phase 6 is currently going into closing at an impressive speed, and the allocation is in its last stage. Recent action has been a whale allocation of $100k that many commentators in the market consider as evidence of bigger players positioning ahead of a shift in the situation. Whales are known to seek time when it is supply constrained and that milestones are nearing. The almost full phase and a range of a V1 launch fitted that pattern. The bigger such allocations are at this stage, the higher the prospects of more visibility in future. The timing can be essential to investors who are posing the question of what crypto to purchase today before the end of Q4 2025 and allocation is in its final trimester. The conditions of entry usually change rapidly after a stage is shut down. Mutuum Finance is at a stage where initial growth, good involvement, and future development successes are on the same path. It entered its final stretch as the price plus audit to launch V1 in Q4 2025 have this new altcoin moving into a decisive phase with its price of less than $0.1.

CEO Ju Ki-young’s recent analysis of Bitcoin spot market data reveals compelling evidence that sophisticated investors are accumulating the digital asset, potentially setting the stage for the next major price appreciation cycle. This development comes amid evolving regulatory landscapes and institutional adoption trends that continue to reshape global cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin Whale Buying Phase Identified Through Market Data CryptoQuant’s proprietary analytics platform detected unusual activity in Bitcoin spot markets throughout early 2025. Specifically, the average order size metric, which tracks transaction volumes across major exchanges, shows a consistent upward trend indicating larger-than-normal purchases. This metric serves as a reliable indicator of whale activity because retail investors typically execute smaller transactions. The data reveals that whale accumulation began accelerating in February 2025 and has maintained momentum through March, suggesting a coordinated accumulation strategy among large holders. Market analysts consider whale buying phases particularly significant because these investors typically possess superior market timing and information advantages. Historical data from previous cycles demonstrates that whale accumulation often precedes substantial price movements. For instance, similar patterns emerged in late 2020 before Bitcoin’s historic rally to $64,000 in April 2021. The current accumulation phase appears more gradual than previous cycles, potentially indicating more sophisticated entry strategies among institutional players who have entered the space since 2021. The Market Cycle Framework Explained Ju Ki-young’s analysis employs a well-documented market cycle framework that has demonstrated predictive value across multiple Bitcoin market cycles. This framework identifies six distinct phases that typically occur in sequence: Retail Accumulation Phase: Smaller investors begin purchasing after significant price declines Whale Distribution Phase: Large holders sell portions of their holdings to retail buyers Price Correction Phase: Market experiences downward pressure as selling continues Retail Capitulation Phase: Smaller investors sell their positions, often at losses Whale Accumulation Phase: Large investors purchase discounted assets from retail sellers Price Appreciation Phase: Reduced selling pressure and renewed buying lead to upward price movement According to CryptoQuant’s current analysis, Bitcoin markets have recently transitioned from the retail capitulation phase to the whale accumulation phase. This transition typically creates favorable conditions for sustained price appreciation because it reduces available supply while increasing demand from deep-pocketed investors. Historical Precedents and Market Context The current whale accumulation pattern finds strong parallels in previous Bitcoin market cycles. During the 2018-2019 bear market, similar whale buying activity preceded Bitcoin’s recovery from $3,200 to $14,000. Likewise, in 2020, whale accumulation during the March market crash set the foundation for the subsequent bull run that peaked in November 2021. These historical patterns provide context for understanding current market dynamics and potential future developments. Several macroeconomic factors may be influencing current whale behavior. The potential approval of additional Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in global markets, evolving regulatory clarity in major economies, and increasing institutional adoption all contribute to favorable conditions for accumulation. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for 2024, historically creates supply-side constraints that large investors often anticipate through pre-halving accumulation. Recent Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Phases and Outcomes Time Period Accumulation Duration Starting Price Subsequent Peak Time to Peak Q4 2018 – Q1 2019 4 months $3,200 $14,000 6 months Q1 2020 – Q2 2020 5 months $5,000 $64,000 14 months Q4 2022 – Q1 2023 4 months $16,000 $44,000 10 months Current Phase (2025) Ongoing $52,000 TBD TBD Analytical Methodology and Data Verification CryptoQuant’s analysis utilizes multiple on-chain metrics to validate the whale accumulation thesis. Beyond average order size, the firm examines exchange net flows, wallet size distribution changes, and miner outflow patterns. These complementary data points provide a comprehensive view of market participant behavior. Exchange net flow data shows consistent outflows from trading platforms to private wallets, suggesting investors are moving Bitcoin to long-term storage rather than preparing for immediate selling. The firm’s analytical approach incorporates both quantitative metrics and qualitative market intelligence. CryptoQuant maintains relationships with major exchanges and institutional players, providing additional context for interpreting on-chain data. This multi-faceted methodology enhances the reliability of their market phase identification and reduces false signals that might occur from analyzing single metrics in isolation. Investment Implications and Market Psychology Ju Ki-young’s consistent message to investors emphasizes maintaining positions during accumulation phases. His analysis suggests that attempting to time market exits during whale buying periods often results in missed upside potential. This perspective aligns with historical data showing that investors who maintained positions through previous accumulation phases captured substantial portions of subsequent bull markets. Market psychology plays a crucial role during transition periods between market phases. Retail investors often experience fear during early accumulation phases because price appreciation typically begins gradually before accelerating. This psychological dynamic creates opportunities for patient investors while testing the resolve of those with shorter time horizons. Understanding these psychological patterns helps investors maintain discipline during critical market transitions. Several risk factors warrant consideration despite the optimistic outlook suggested by whale accumulation data. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and technological factors could influence market trajectories. Additionally, the increasing sophistication of market participants means historical patterns may not repeat exactly. However, the fundamental dynamics of supply, demand, and investor behavior continue to drive cryptocurrency market cycles. Institutional Adoption and Market Maturation The current whale accumulation phase occurs within a fundamentally different market structure than previous cycles. Institutional participation has increased substantially since 2020, with traditional financial firms, corporations, and asset managers establishing significant cryptocurrency positions. This institutional presence may moderate price volatility while potentially extending accumulation and appreciation phases. Market infrastructure has matured considerably, with improved custody solutions, regulatory frameworks, and trading mechanisms. These developments facilitate larger-scale accumulation by reducing operational risks for institutional investors. The growing derivatives market also provides sophisticated risk management tools that were less available during previous cycles, potentially influencing accumulation strategies and market dynamics. Conclusion CryptoQuant’s identification of a Bitcoin whale buying phase provides valuable insight into current market dynamics and potential future developments. The firm’s analysis, based on comprehensive on-chain data and historical pattern recognition, suggests that large investors are accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of price appreciation. While market outcomes remain uncertain and subject to various influencing factors, the identified accumulation pattern aligns with historical precedents that preceded significant bull markets. Investors should consider this analysis within their broader investment strategy while acknowledging both opportunities and risks in evolving cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a “whale” in cryptocurrency markets? A whale refers to an individual or entity holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, typically sufficient to influence market prices through their trading activities. In Bitcoin markets, addresses containing 1,000 BTC or more are generally considered whale addresses, though definitions vary across analysts. Q2: How does CryptoQuant detect whale buying activity? CryptoQuant analyzes multiple on-chain metrics including average transaction size, exchange flows, wallet distribution changes, and miner behavior. By examining these data points collectively, the firm identifies patterns suggesting coordinated accumulation by large holders rather than retail investors. Q3: How long do whale accumulation phases typically last? Historical accumulation phases have varied from 3-6 months, though the current institutionalized market structure may extend this timeframe. The duration depends on multiple factors including price levels, market sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions. Q4: Does whale buying guarantee a price increase? While whale accumulation historically precedes price appreciation, it doesn’t guarantee specific outcomes. Market dynamics involve numerous variables including regulatory developments, macroeconomic factors, and technological advancements that collectively influence price trajectories. Q5: How should retail investors respond to whale accumulation signals? Retail investors should consider whale activity as one data point within a comprehensive investment strategy. Rather than attempting to precisely time markets, most analysts recommend maintaining disciplined investment approaches aligned with individual risk tolerance and financial objectives.

At the time of publication, Hedera was trading at $0.1157, up 4.91% over the past 24 hours and 6.08% on the week, with a market cap of $4.95 billion and 24-hour volume at $107.09 million, according to cryptocurrency market data tracked by Finbold. Hedera 24-hour chart gains among top 100 crypto assets. Source: CoinMarketCap The timing of the move is notable. While broader crypto markets remain mixed, historical data shows that HBAR has averaged gains of roughly 38% in January, a pattern often attributed to post-holiday portfolio rebalancing and renewed risk appetite at the start of the year. Traders appear to be positioning ahead of that seasonal trend, even as year-end dynamics continue to influence price action. At the same time, the final days of December are traditionally shaped by tax-loss harvesting, which can suppress prices as investors sell underperforming assets to offset capital gains. For HBAR, this creates a delicate setup. If the token can hold above the $0.115 support zone through December 27–30, it may signal that selling pressure linked to tax considerations is being absorbed, clearing the path for a potential January rebound. AI Hedera price forecast To assess near-term direction, Finbold examined its custom AI forecasting engine , which aggregates predictions from Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and GPT-4o. For the period ending December 31, 2025, the models produced an average projected price of $0.115, implying a modest -1.33% move from the current level of $0.116 at the time the forecast was generated.

Claude Sonnet 4 delivered the most optimistic scenario, pointing to a potential +6.27% upside, while Gemini 2.5 Flash outlined a downside case of -6.63%. This divergence reflects a market caught between short-term tax-driven selling and anticipatory buying ahead of January’s historically strong performance. Taken together, HBAR’s recent surge, its consistent January seasonality, and the current tax-loss harvesting window suggest that price action into early 2026 could be decisive.

At first, most platforms simply accepted Bitcoin as another payment method. The betting logic, settlement speed, and user experience stayed largely the same. Crypto was there — but it wasn’t driving the product. That model is fading. Today, crypto betting sites are shifting toward infrastructure that is built around blockchain, not just connected to it. Faster settlements, wallet-first access, and on-chain transparency are no longer experimental features — they are becoming expectations. So what exactly changed? And why does it matter for users who bet with crypto? From “Crypto Accepted” to Crypto-Native Betting Platforms Early crypto betting websites treated Bitcoin like an alternative deposit option. You could bet with crypto, but behind the scenes, everything worked as if it were fiat. Modern crypto betting platforms look very different. They are designed with blockchain logic in mind from the start: automated settlement instead of manual processing wallet-based access instead of account-heavy onboarding transparent bet logic rather than opaque result handling This shift created a clear divide in the market. In simple terms, crypto betting platforms now fall into three categories: Crypto-enabled platformsTraditional sportsbooks that allow crypto deposits but keep legacy systems underneath. Hybrid crypto betting sitesPlatforms that mix blockchain payments with centralized betting logic. Crypto-native betting platformsSystems built around wallets, smart contracts, and real-time settlement. Why does this distinction matter?Because it directly affects speed, trust, and user control — three things crypto bettors care about most. Case Insight: How Modern Crypto Betting Platforms Operate To understand what crypto-native betting actually looks like in practice, it helps to look at a real example. Platforms like Dexsport illustrate how crypto betting websites are evolving beyond simple “pay with Bitcoin” models into fully decentralized betting environments. Instead of relying on traditional account systems, Dexsport uses: wallet-based access (email, Telegram, or DeFi wallets) multi-chain infrastructure supporting dozens of cryptocurrencies automated bet settlement with real-time transparency What does this mean for users? It means betting with crypto feels closer to using a DeFi application than a legacy sportsbook. Deposits and withdrawals happen directly on-chain, bets are logged transparently, and users maintain control over their funds throughout the process. Another key shift is in-play flexibility. Features like Cash Out allow bettors to manage risk dynamically during live events — something that only works smoothly when settlement logic is fast and automated. Instead of trusting a black box, users can see how the system behaves in real time. This model doesn’t remove responsibility from the player — but it does remove unnecessary intermediaries. And that distinction is shaping the next phase of crypto sports betting. Faster Settlements — Why Speed Became a Core Metric Why did settlement speed suddenly become such a big deal? Because once users experience near-instant crypto transactions elsewhere — in DeFi, trading, or payments — waiting hours for a betting payout feels outdated. In modern online crypto betting sites, speed affects: live betting accuracy cash-out usability trust during high-volume events Slow settlement isn’t just inconvenient. It creates friction at the exact moment users expect precision. That’s why many crypto betting platforms now prioritize: automated result processing on-chain confirmation over manual review minimal withdrawal queues Speed is no longer a premium feature.It’s the baseline users compare everything against. On-Chain Wagers and Verifiable Betting Logic One of the biggest shifts in crypto betting isn’t about speed. It’s about visibility. Traditional betting platforms ask users to trust the system. Odds are calculated somewhere, results are settled somewhere else, and players only see the final outcome. With on-chain wagers, that logic starts to change. So what does on-chain betting actually mean? In simple terms, it means that key parts of the betting process — wagers, settlements, and sometimes even outcomes — are recorded on the blockchain. This creates a layer of verification that didn’t exist before. Why does this matter for users? Bets can be tracked in real time Settlement rules are predefined and transparent Outcomes are harder to manipulate after the fact Instead of relying on internal databases, crypto betting sites increasingly rely on verifiable execution. This doesn’t eliminate trust entirely, but it reduces blind spots. Transparency doesn’t make betting risk-free. It makes the rules visible. That difference is subtle — but important. How Crypto Sports Betting Platforms Are Adapting Crypto sports betting has its own challenges. Live odds move fast. Markets change in seconds. Liquidity needs to be handled carefully, especially during major events. To keep up, modern crypto betting platforms are adapting on multiple levels. At the infrastructure level, they focus on: Real-time odds updates Automated bet settlement Scalable multi-chain support At the user-experience level, the changes are just as noticeable: cleaner interfaces fewer steps to place a bet faster feedback during live events And then there’s live betting. Live markets only work well when the system behind them can react instantly. That’s why features like dynamic Cash Out and in-play bet adjustments are becoming standard on advanced crypto betting sites. If the platform can’t settle fast, live betting loses its edge. Betting with Crypto: What Changed for Users? A few years ago, betting with crypto felt experimental. Today, it feels… normal. But normal doesn’t mean unchanged. Modern users betting with crypto now expect: wallet-first access minimal onboarding instant control over funds This shift has also changed how people think about risk. Instead of keeping balances on-platform for long periods, many bettors prefer to: deposit only what they plan to use withdraw winnings immediately avoid custodial storage In other words, betting with crypto has become more transactional and intentional. Is that better? For many users, yes — because it aligns with how crypto is used everywhere else. Crypto Betting Apps vs Web-Based Platforms Do crypto betting apps really matter? The answer is mixed. While some crypto betting apps exist, many platforms deliberately focus on web-based interfaces optimized for mobile. Why? Because wallets, security updates, and browser-based signing often work more smoothly without native apps. In practice, most users care less about the app itself and more about: mobile responsiveness speed on live markets seamless wallet interaction For crypto betting websites, the line between “app” and “site” has blurred. What matters is whether the platform feels instant and reliable — not where it’s installed. Risks and Limitations of Modern Crypto Betting It’s easy to focus on innovation. But evolution also brings new responsibilities. Modern crypto betting introduces risks that users must actively manage: smart contract exposure wallet security irreversible transactions crypto price volatility Unlike traditional betting, mistakes aren’t always reversible. There’s no bank to call, no chargeback to request. That’s the trade-off. Crypto betting offers more control — but it also demands more awareness from the user. Where Crypto Betting Is Headed Next So where does all this lead? Not toward more hype. Toward better infrastructure. The next phase of crypto betting is likely to focus on: deeper on-chain settlement improved transparency standards smoother live betting UX better alignment between speed and trust Instead of trying to look like traditional sportsbooks, crypto betting platforms are slowly becoming their own category. And that’s probably a good thing. Final Thoughts Crypto betting is no longer about whether platforms accept crypto. It’s about how deeply crypto is integrated into the betting experience. Faster settlements, on-chain wagers, and wallet-first design are reshaping how users interact with betting platforms. The result is an ecosystem that feels closer to decentralized finance than traditional gambling. For users, the takeaway is simple: understanding the infrastructure matters as much as understanding the odds.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-26 11:49:10

That’s why handling crypto wallets in a safe manner really matters. This guide will explain the best crypto wallet safety tips for 2026. Why wallet security is critical in crypto Using a secure crypto wallet is important. Hackers are on the lookout for the next target. Also, handling crypto wallets correctly is vital to avoid permanent loss of funds. Risks of hacks and phishing attacks Hackers implant traps everywhere. They send spam emails in bulk, and build fake login pages of reputable exchanges. The goal is to phish people and access their crypto wallets. Hackers also phish people through address poisoning. Victims end up sending funds to the hacker’s wallet without realizing. People fall for other tricks like fake customer support, fake recruiters, and fake founders. Some people scan malicious QR codes that lead to a loss of funds. Hackers don’t stop there. They try to install malicious keyloggers to steal passwords and seed phrases. A computer’s clipboard could be hijacked with malicious commands. Poor wallet hygiene leads to a loss of funds quickly. A private key or seed phrase could be stolen easily when interacting with malicious smart contracts . Other dangerous coin drainers include fake mint pages, and rug-pull contracts. Common wallet security mistakes beginners make The majority of newbies make mistakes when dealing with crypto wallets. The average Joe isn’t tech savvy, and sending crypto has many steps. That’s why a lot of people make mistakes that lead to loss of funds. For example, some people send funds to the wrong wallet or forget to switch networks. Others store seed phrases in the notes app or in the cloud. Some people even connect their wallets to untrusted dApps or use public Wi-Fi to transact. Most beginners reuse one wallet address for every activity or copy an address without checking. Attackers exploit these mistakes to steal crypto with ease. Consequences of losing private keys Losing your private keys equates to losing your coins. Any tokens, NFTs , or DeFi activities linked to the lost wallet are gone forever. There’s no “forgot my private keys” button in crypto. No customer support or chargebacks are available since blockchain is decentralized. Crypto transactions are irreversible. Once an attacker controls a private key, there’s no going back. If the wallet were publicly linked, an attack may lead to identity exposure. Keeping your private keys and seed phrase in a safe place is the only way to preserve coin access. Top crypto wallet security tips 1. Always use a hardware wallet for large holdings A hardware wallet is the best place to store large holdings. It stays offline unless the user connects it online, and it’s more secure than software or browser-based wallets. Hardware wallets protect tokens from malware , phishing, and keyloggers. They keep private keys offline, reducing exposure to hacks. It also limits damage if a computer or phone is compromised. To spend coins from a hardware wallet, the user must physically confirm the transaction and sign it with their private key. A hardware wallet is ideal for long term investments. 2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) Setting two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional security layer to crypto wallets. Accessing a wallet becomes harder since 2FA is the second verification step after logging in. 2FA protects wallet access and funds even if passwords and credentials are leaked to hackers. It helps prevent unauthorized access when login details are compromised, especially on exchanges and custodial platforms. Non-custodial wallets like MetaMask and Ledger benefit from 2FA as well. But if an attacker obtains private keys, 2FA will not stop them from spending funds. Setting up 2FA on an authenticator app is safer compared to SMS messages. However, access to authenticator apps could be lost forever if a smartphone was damaged or lost. Back up your phone regularly on a local machine. Also, write down or print the recovery codes of your 2FA app. The code should be stored offline, on paper, and inside a safe or lockbox. Treat it like a crypto wallet private key. 3. Keep private keys and seed phrases offline Private keys and seed phrases should be kept offline. They should not be stored online, photographed, or backed up to the cloud. Large crypto wallets can attract hackers. For this reason, seeds should be stored in a secure place and protected against fire, water, and theft. Backup copies should be kept separately. The best practice is to keep your primary wallets in cold storage and use hot wallets only for daily transactions. Funds should be sent to a hot wallet only when needed, reducing losses if it’s hacked. The main wallet should never transact directly. Also, seed phrases and private keys should never be shared with friends or customer support. Never enter them in a website page or a form page. Seed phrases and private keys are only used in a physical wallet, like the Ledger or Trezor before spending. And they’re the way to access your funds in case your physical wallet is damaged. 4. Backup your wallet in multiple secure locations Backing up crypto wallet seed phrases or private keys in multiple locations is a smart approach. In case of a disaster like a flood or fire, access to your wallet can still be preserved. Use durable materials for backups. Fireproof and waterproof metal plates made from steel or titanium are a strong choice. Stamp or engrave your seed phrase to ensure long term physical durability. Laminated paper backups can work, but they should be treated as temporary. Paper is vulnerable to fire, water, and natural decay over time. Follow the 3-2-1 approach. Keep at least three copies of your backup to reduce the risk of total loss. Store backups in different physical locations. For example, keep one copy at home and another in a bank safety deposit box. This stops the impact of theft or a single physical event. Avoid easily accessible storage locations. Backups should be hidden and protected against unauthorized access. To take it a step further, some users choose to split a seed phrase or private key across locations. But this approach requires careful planning to avoid making wallet recovery impossible. 5. Download wallets only from official sources Downloading a wallet app from its official website is a critical step. Searching on Google and clicking on the first link can be dangerous. Scammers often target crypto users through malvertising. Malvertising is a tactic where malware is hidden inside legitimate online ads. Most search engines have systems in place to detect malicious ads, but these protections are not perfect. Hence, scammers can still promote fake crypto products or services through paid ads. To reduce exposure to fake URLs, using ad blockers is helpful. Browsers with built-in ad blockers, such as Brave, can reduce the risk of clicking on malicious ads. To take it a step further, tech-savvy users can build a home network using Pi-hole. This setup can block many ads and tracking domains at the network level. But those solutions should not replace careful human verification of official crypto wallet links. 6. Use a strong and unique password manager Using a password manager to save login details for crypto wallets and exchanges is recommended. Password managers such as 1Password, LastPass, and Proton Pass are useful for storing login details. But they are not an ideal solution for storing private keys and seed phrases. Those should remain offline. A strong password is an important security layer for crypto wallets. Security researchers recommend passwords that combine lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. One step many people miss is password length. Long passwords are harder to hack and stronger against brute force attacks. A password length of 15 characters or more is highly recommended for crypto users. Hacking a 15-char password takes 77 million years, according to security researchers. Never reuse passwords across crypto platforms. A breach of one platform can expose other accounts if the same password is used. Protect the password manager as well. Use a strong master password and enable two-factor authentication. 7. Watch out for phishing emails, links, and fake apps Hackers run phishing email campaigns all the time. Such emails contain malicious links that aim to compromise crypto wallets and access them. Never click on phishing links. Move phishing emails to your spam inbox, report the sender, and block them. The best tactic to reduce exposure to phishing emails is having multiple email addresses. Each email address should have a purpose. An email for personal correspondents, another for crypto wallets, and a third one for newsletters. It is not recommended to use the same inbox for personal use, crypto wallets, and newsletters. The reason is that email lists leak on the dark web all the time. Hackers use this data to target crypto wallet users and run phishing email campaigns. They would know which email the victim uses to access a crypto wallet or CEX. Avoid clicking on links from untrusted sources. And avoid clicking on hyperlinks embedded inside Telegram messages. Hackers use this method to evade Telegram security filters. A URL without a preview is suspicious. Do not click it. Assume everything is a scam until proven otherwise. 8. Keep wallet software and firmware updated Installing the latest wallet updates is good wallet hygiene. Updates fix security vulnerabilities and bugs. They also ensure compatibility with the latest network protocols. Developers actively identify and patch security flaws. Outdated software leaves your wallets wide open to attack. Enable auto-update for software wallets like Exodus, MetaMask , and Phantom. Make sure updates are from the official app store or the internal updater. Never install updates prompted by emails, text messages, or website pop-ups. These are common phishing tactics. Hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor, and Keystone require firmware updates too. Only install updates using the manufacturer’s official software or the device’s internal updater. 9. Consider using multi-signature wallets A multi-signature crypto wallet is more secure compared to a standard single-signature wallet. Such wallets require a minimum of three private keys. To execute a transaction, two private keys are required to sign a transaction. Having three signatories adds a strong security layer. It prevents intruders from spending your crypto. It also makes the recovery process easier in case a single private key is lost or compromised. Multi-sig wallets are ideal for crypto custodians. Corporate funds like DAO treasuries or digital asset treasury companies utilize such wallets since they manage large amounts of crypto. Multi-sig wallets are technically advanced to use. A good option for individual users is Bitkey. It’s a multi-sig wallet created for serious retail investors. 10. Separate hot wallets and cold storage Creating multiple hot wallets and cold storage is a smart move to protect funds. Pro crypto users don’t put all their eggs in one basket. Hot wallets are usually utilized for frequent trading and transacting. They provide fast connectivity to dApps and seamless trading for arbitrage traders. Liquidity providers and yield farmers rely on hot wallets to move stablecoins fast. For example, a hot wallet like Phantom is useful to move funds fast from one pool to another. Or to stake coins in a new dApp with better yield. Cold storage, on the other hand, is the ideal choice for long term crypto holdings. Whales with large Bitcoin or Ether holdings keep their coins in a hardware wallet. Utilizing cold storage in this case aligns with the whale’s goal of holding coins for 3 to 5 years or even more. Hot vs cold wallet security What is a hot wallet? A hot wallet is an online crypto wallet. It’s connected to the internet. MetaMask, Exodus, and Phantom are examples of hot wallets. These wallets can be downloaded on a smartphone or computer and used immediately across most blockchain networks and DeFi dApps. Such wallets remain connected to the internet, and there’s no way to disconnect them. The private keys and seed phrase associated with hot wallets are exposed to malware. What is a cold wallet? A cold wallet is an offline crypto wallet. It’s disconnected from the internet. Ledger, Trezor, and Bitkey are examples of cold wallets that remain isolated from internet connections. In the early days of Bitcoin, people used paper wallets. Those wallets were the first form of cold storage. Private and public keys were printed as QR codes on a piece of paper. Such wallets stay offline most of the time unless the users connect them to spend crypto. The private keys and seed phrase linked to cold storage are protected from cyberattacks. When to use each for maximum safety It is recommended to use cold wallets for large crypto holdings . Any coins planned for three to five years of investing belong in cold storage. A hot wallet could be utilized easily for daily trading, arbitrage, and DeFi activities. Advanced wallet safety practices Using hardware security modules (HSMs) A hardware security module, or HSM, is a device that manages and protects cryptographic keys. An HSM stops malicious access to private keys because it is tamper-resistant. Such a device is difficult to alter without rendering the device unusable. Moreover, an HSM is tamper-evident. The device sends alerts after any attempt to access or interfere. HSMs are tamper-responsive, too. When tampering is detected, an HSM may delete stored private keys. Backing up private keys and seed phrases in a hardware security module makes it extremely difficult to hack or access. Air-gapped devices for ultimate protection Air-gapped devices are similar to hardware security modules. They protect private keys but with a different approach. An air-gapped crypto wallet is created specifically for storing private keys offline. It’s disconnected from most external forms of communication. Wireless communication via WiFi, Bluetooth, and NFC is not possible. And data transfer through a USB cable is not available. Air-gapped wallets use scannable QR codes or micro-SD cards for communication. A typical wallet comes with a display and buttons. The purpose is to store private keys and display them when needed. An old phone or computer could be repurposed as an air-gapped crypto wallet. Decentralized wallet recovery options Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) is an advanced approach to recovering crypto wallets. Instead of relying on a single seed phrase, DeRec spreads recovery control across multiple people or devices. DeRec doesn’t require multi-signatories. It relies on four principles: secret splitting, trusted helpers, recovery on demand, and key reassembly. DeRec uses cryptography to split a secret key into multiple fragments. Then a user can choose trusted helpers, such as friends or family, to securely hold these key fragments. These helpers do not have full access to the wallet. If a device is lost or stolen, the user can request recovery from a specified number of helpers. Then, the helpers provide their fragments. This allows the decentralized recovery app to reconstruct the key and restore wallet access on a new device. DeRec is useful because it is user-friendly, versatile, and has no single point of failure. What to do if your wallet gets compromised Immediate steps to secure remaining funds Transfer any remaining funds to a new and secure wallet address. Then disconnect your hardware wallet from the internet. Scan your hardware wallet for any malware. Do not reuse the compromised wallet address or private keys again. Keep an eye on fund movement by tracking the compromised wallet on the correct blockchain explorer. Report the incident to the local cybercrime authorities. Consider contacting a blockchain forensic service to track the stolen tokens and identify the cybercriminal. Contacting exchanges or service providers If the breach impacts a centralized exchange wallet, contact customer support immediately. If a software wallet is under attack, empty it and disconnect any unrecognized dApp. Abandon the wallet address completely. Reach out to the service provider, such as MetaMask or Phantom, to report the incident. Track the funds or hire a professional to do that. Preventing future attacks Reset all passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all crypto accounts, centralized exchanges, and related emails. Create new wallet addresses and store tokens there. Set up new hardware wallets for large holdings and backup private keys and seed phrases in multiple locations. Learn about phishing attacks and malware. Also, implement the top crypto wallet safety tips and tactics. Future of crypto wallet security in 2026 and beyond Biometric security in wallets Biometric security refers to using fingerprints or facial scans to unlock a crypto wallet. In some cases, iris scanning could be used too. Biometric tech is widely used for identity protection. It makes unauthorized access far more difficult compared to passwords and pins. Moreover, a biometric crypto wallet is user-friendly in terms of functionality and ease of use. Biometric data is unique to the user and difficult to replicate. This adds a strong security layer and shields the wallet. Crypto wallets that rely on fingerprints and facial scans are expected to spread in the future. At the moment, there are a few biometric wallets, including D’Cent, Shield BIO, and Tangem. Social recovery wallets A social recovery wallet lets the user recover access through a pre-selected group of trusted people. There’s no single point of failure like a single seed phrase. Social recovery wallets rely on smart contracts to manage access and recovery. The user chooses trusted friends or family members, or even personal devices. A common setup includes three to five people or devices. Despite the decentralized recovery process, social wallets are single-sig wallets. One private key is required to spend coins and transact. If the private key is lost, the user can start the social recovery process. Integration of AI fraud detection AI fraud detection monitors crypto transactions in real time. The system learns the user’s behavior using machine learning (ML). And it can detect and block suspicious activity. AI makes a standard crypto wallet intelligent. It continuously learns how a user interacts with their wallet and reacts when behavior changes. AI fraud detection uses behavioral analysis to learn transaction habits, login times, and usage patterns. It also analyzes on-chain data within milliseconds. The AI detects unusual transactions, scam-linked addresses, or risky smart contract activities.",Cryptocurrency Guides|Bitkey|Exodus|Keystone|Ledger|MetaMask|Phantom|Trezor,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-26 11:50:43
56395685,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-lending-with-low-ltv-safety-first-borrowing-explained,1766750078,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56395685.jpeg,Crypto Lending with Low LTV: Safety-First Borrowing Explained,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-lending-with-low-ltv-safety-first-borrowing-explained,"Crypto lending makes it easy to borrow against digital assets, but ease of access often obscures the real source of risk. Liquidation does not come from interest rates or loan duration. It comes from leverage. The most effective way to control that leverage is by borrowing at a low Loan-to-Value, or LTV. Low-LTV crypto borrowing trades maximum borrowing power for stability. In volatile markets, that trade-off often determines whether a loan remains a useful liquidity tool or turns into forced selling. What Low LTV Means in Crypto Lending LTV measures how much you borrow relative to the value of your collateral. A low LTV means you borrow a smaller amount compared to the assets securing the loan. For example, if you deposit $20,000 in crypto and borrow $4,000, your LTV is 20%. At that level, even a significant market drawdown leaves a wide safety margin before liquidation becomes a risk. Low LTV does not eliminate risk, but it creates time and flexibility—two things that matter most during sharp market moves. Why Low LTV Reduces Liquidation Risk Crypto prices can move quickly and unpredictably. When collateral values fall, LTV rises automatically. Borrowers operating close to liquidation thresholds have little room to respond. Low LTV positions behave differently. Price drops compress the safety margin, but do not immediately threaten the loan. This allows borrowers to add collateral, repay part of the balance, or simply wait for volatility to pass. In practice, most forced liquidations happen at high or moderate-high LTVs. Low-LTV loans tend to survive market stress without intervention. The Cost Side of Low LTV Borrowing less means paying less interest in absolute terms, but low LTV also affects pricing directly. Many platforms link interest rates to LTV. Lower LTVs are considered safer and therefore qualify for lower rates. This creates a structural incentive to borrow conservatively rather than aggressively. Over time, the combination of lower principal and lower APR can significantly reduce total borrowing costs. How Clapp Supports Safety-First Borrowing Clapp credit line model aligns well with low-LTV strategies. Users secure a borrowing limit with crypto collateral, but interest accrues only on the amount actually drawn. Unused credit carries 0% APR and does not increase LTV risk. Because rates on Clapp depend on LTV, borrowers who maintain conservative positions benefit from lower interest costs. LTV is calculated in real time, and users receive advance notifications as risk increases. The ability to repay partially and instantly restore available credit makes it easier to adjust exposure without closing the position. This flexibility encourages deliberate, safety-first borrowing rather than one-time leverage decisions. Low LTV as a Strategic Choice Low LTV borrowing is often misunderstood as inefficient or overly cautious. In reality, it reflects a different objective. Borrowers using crypto loans for liquidity—rather than speculation—prioritize control over maximization. They accept lower borrowing power in exchange for predictability and resilience. This approach is particularly relevant for long-term holders who want access to cash without selling assets or reacting to every market move. Final Thoughts Crypto lending does not have to be a high-risk activity. The primary lever for controlling risk is LTV, not timing or prediction. Borrowing at a low LTV shifts the focus from maximizing leverage to preserving optionality. Platforms that support flexible credit lines, transparent LTV tracking, and usage-based interest make this approach easier to maintain. In volatile markets, safety is not about avoiding borrowing. It is about structuring it so that market moves do not force decisions on your behalf. FAQ on Crypto Loans with Low LTV What is a low LTV in crypto lending?A low LTV means borrowing a small portion of your collateral’s value, often well below the platform’s maximum. This creates a wider safety margin against price volatility and liquidation. Why is low LTV considered safer?Because crypto prices can fall quickly. A low LTV provides more room for price fluctuations before liquidation thresholds are reached, giving borrowers time to react. Does low LTV reduce interest costs?Yes. Borrowing less reduces total interest paid, and many platforms offer lower APRs at lower LTV levels because the risk to the lender is lower. Is low LTV inefficient compared to higher leverage?It depends on the goal. Low LTV prioritizes stability and control over maximum borrowing power. For liquidity needs rather than speculative strategies, it is often more efficient. How does Clapp support low-LTV borrowing?Clapp uses a credit-line model where interest accrues only on drawn funds, not on unused credit. Rates depend on LTV, and real-time monitoring with alerts helps borrowers maintain conservative positions. Can I adjust LTV after borrowing?Yes. You can lower LTV by adding collateral or repaying part of the borrowed amount. On flexible credit lines, repaid amounts immediately restore available credit. Who should consider low-LTV crypto loans?Low LTV suits long-term crypto holders, users seeking fiat liquidity without selling assets, and anyone who wants to minimize liquidation risk during volatile market conditions.

56395642,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254495,1766750110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Arthur Hayes LDO Purchase: Strategic $1.03 Million Bet Signals Confidence in Ethereum Staking Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/arthur-hayes-ldo-purchase-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Arthur Hayes LDO Purchase: Strategic $1.03 Million Bet Signals Confidence in Ethereum Staking Future In a significant move that captured immediate market attention, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes executed a substantial cryptocurrency transaction, acquiring 1.85 million LDO tokens worth approximately $1.03 million from the Binance exchange. This transaction, reported by blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lense on March 15, 2025, represents a notable investment by one of cryptocurrency’s most influential former exchange executives. The purchase naturally raises questions about the strategic outlook for Lido DAO’s liquid staking token and the broader Ethereum staking derivative ecosystem. Market analysts immediately began scrutinizing the timing and potential implications of this high-profile acquisition. Arthur Hayes LDO Purchase: Transaction Details and Immediate Context Blockchain data confirms the transfer of 1.85 million LDO tokens from a Binance hot wallet to a wallet associated with Arthur Hayes. The transaction occurred during standard trading hours and settled on the Ethereum mainnet. At the prevailing market price of approximately $0.556 per LDO token, the total value reached $1,028,600. Consequently, this acquisition represents one of the largest publicly identifiable purchases by Hayes since his departure from BitMEX. Onchain Lense, the analytics firm that first identified the transaction, specializes in tracking high-net-worth individual movements and institutional wallet activity. Their reporting provides transparency for major market movements. Arthur Hayes co-founded BitMEX, one of the earliest and most influential cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges. Although he stepped down from an operational role in 2021, he remains a closely watched figure in crypto circles. His public commentary and investment decisions often carry significant weight. Therefore, this LDO purchase immediately generated discussion across trading forums and analyst reports. The trade coincides with a period of consolidation for LDO’s price, following a broader market correction in the first quarter of 2025. Market data shows LDO trading within a defined range for several weeks prior to this purchase. Understanding Lido DAO and the LDO Token Ecosystem Lido Finance operates as a decentralized liquid staking protocol, primarily for Ethereum. It allows users to stake their ETH without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure. In return, users receive stETH, a liquid staking token that represents their staked ETH and accrued rewards. The Lido DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governs the protocol. The LDO token serves as the governance token for this DAO. Holders use LDO to vote on key protocol parameters, treasury management, and future upgrades. The protocol’s significance stems from its dominant market position. Consider these key metrics: Total Value Locked (TVL): Lido consistently maintains the largest TVL among liquid staking protocols, often controlling over 30% of all staked Ethereum. Node Operator Network: The protocol distributes staked ETH across a curated set of professional node operators to ensure security and decentralization. Staking Derivative Utility: stETH tokens integrate across major DeFi platforms like Aave, Curve, and MakerDAO, providing liquidity and yield opportunities. LDO’s value accrual is inherently tied to the protocol’s success and fee structure. The DAO votes on a fee share, where a percentage of staking rewards fund the treasury, potentially benefiting LDO holders through buybacks, burns, or dividends. This economic model makes LDO a proxy for belief in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake security and the growth of liquid staking. Expert Perspective on Liquid Staking’s Growth Trajectory Industry analysts point to several fundamental drivers for the liquid staking sector. Ethereum’s successful transition to proof-of-stake (The Merge) created a permanent yield mechanism for ETH holders. However, native staking requires a 32 ETH minimum and locks liquidity. Liquid staking solutions like Lido solve this problem. According to recent reports from blockchain analytics firm Messari, the total value of liquid staking derivatives surpassed $50 billion in early 2025. This growth reflects increasing institutional and retail adoption. Regulatory developments also shape the landscape. Clearer guidance from jurisdictions like the EU (via MiCA) and potential US frameworks provide more certainty for staking-as-a-service models. Furthermore, the integration of staking derivatives in traditional finance pipelines, such as collateral for repo transactions, expands the addressable market. Hayes’s investment may signal a belief that Lido is positioned to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. His historical focus on derivatives and financial infrastructure makes this sector a logical area for his capital allocation. Market Impact and Historical Precedents of Hayes’s Moves Following the public reporting of the purchase, LDO’s price experienced a modest increase of approximately 4-6% over the subsequent 24-hour period. Trading volume spiked by over 200% compared to the weekly average. This reaction is consistent with the “whale watching” phenomenon, where large transactions by known entities influence short-term market sentiment. However, sustained price movement depends on broader market conditions and fundamental developments within the Lido ecosystem. Historical analysis of Hayes’s public investment moves reveals a pattern. He often takes contrarian or strategically timed positions in assets related to core crypto infrastructure. For instance, his earlier accumulation of Bitcoin during market lows and commentary on Ethereum’s scalability roadmap preceded significant rallies. It is critical to note that his investments are personal and not necessarily indicative of market direction. Analysts caution against interpreting a single transaction as a definitive signal. Instead, they recommend viewing it within the context of accumulating evidence about an asset’s fundamentals. The table below summarizes key data points surrounding this event: Metric Detail Token LDO (Lido DAO Token) Amount Purchased 1,850,000 LDO Approximate Value (USD) $1,028,600 Source of Report Onchain Lense Analytics Date of Transaction March 15, 2025 Purchase Venue Binance Exchange LDO Price at Time ~$0.556 24-hr Price Change Post-News +4.5% The Broader Context: Ethereum Staking and DeFi in 2025 The Ethereum network continues to evolve post-Merge, with a focus on scalability through proto-danksharding and continued Layer 2 rollup adoption. These upgrades aim to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput. A more scalable and cheaper Ethereum network benefits all applications built on it, including liquid staking protocols. Higher network usage can drive greater demand for block space, increasing validator rewards and, by extension, the yield generated by staking pools like Lido’s. Competition within liquid staking is intensifying. Protocols like Rocket Pool, Frax Ether, and Coinbase’s cbETH offer alternative models. Lido’s market share, while dominant, faces pressure from these competitors. The DAO’s ongoing decisions regarding fee structures, node operator decentralization, and multi-chain expansion (to solana, polygon) will directly impact its competitive position. An investment in LDO is, therefore, a bet on the DAO’s governance making superior long-term strategic choices. Market observers will monitor whether Hayes’s purchase precedes more active participation in Lido DAO governance proposals. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions influence all risk assets, including crypto. Interest rate environments, inflation data, and traditional market flows create headwinds or tailwinds. The staking yield offered by Ethereum (currently around 3-4% annually) presents a relatively attractive real yield in certain macroeconomic scenarios. This yield characteristic makes staking derivatives a unique asset class, potentially appealing to investors seeking crypto exposure with an income component. Hayes’s move may reflect a portfolio allocation strategy balancing high-growth assets with those offering more consistent yield. Conclusion Arthur Hayes’s purchase of $1.03 million in LDO tokens represents a significant, data-pointed vote of confidence in the Lido DAO ecosystem and the future of Ethereum liquid staking. While the immediate market reaction was positive, the long-term significance hinges on fundamental factors: the growth of Ethereum staking, Lido’s ability to maintain its competitive edge, and the effective governance of the Lido DAO. This transaction underscores the maturation of the staking derivative market, attracting sophisticated investors who recognize its critical role in the proof-of-stake blockchain economy. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency assets. The Arthur Hayes LDO purchase will undoubtedly remain a key reference point for analysts tracking smart money flows within the decentralized finance sector. FAQs Q1: What is LDO and what is its purpose? A1: LDO is the governance token for Lido DAO, the decentralized organization that controls the Lido liquid staking protocol. Holders use LDO to vote on proposals concerning protocol fees, treasury management, node operator selection, and strategic upgrades. Q2: Why is Arthur Hayes’s purchase considered significant news? A2: Arthur Hayes is a prominent and influential figure in cryptocurrency due to his role as a co-founder of BitMEX. His investment decisions are closely monitored as potential signals of where experienced industry veterans see value, particularly in infrastructure-related projects. Q3: What is liquid staking and how does Lido provide it? A3: Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrency (like ETH) to secure the network and earn rewards, while receiving a tradable token (like stETH) in return. This token represents their staked assets and rewards, providing liquidity instead of a locked position. Lido pools user funds, stakes them with professional node operators, and mints the derivative stETH tokens. Q4: Did this purchase cause the LDO price to surge? A4: The purchase was followed by a short-term price increase of approximately 4-6% and a large spike in trading volume. However, sustained price action depends on broader market trends and the fundamental performance of the Lido protocol, not a single transaction. Q5: Where can investors track this kind of on-chain activity? A5: Blockchain analytics platforms like Onchain Lense, Nansen, Arkham Intelligence, and Etherscan allow users to track wallet activity, large transfers, and exchange flows. These tools provide transparency into the movements of large holders, often called “whales.” This post Arthur Hayes LDO Purchase: Strategic $1.03 Million Bet Signals Confidence in Ethereum Staking Future first appeared on BitcoinWorld .",Crypto News|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DeFi.|ETHEREUM|Investment,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|LDO|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-12-26 11:55:10

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a popular crypto analyst, recently highlighted this shift, pointing to technical damage that has altered the short-term structure. He suggests the asset is on the verge of a notable breakdown. What the Chart Shows Ali’s chart presents a clear technical narrative. XRP began a rally in late 2024 and crossed the $3 level in early 2025. While it suffered some losses later in the year, it rallied again, hitting a peak of $3.65 in July . However, it experienced bearish pressure in the months that followed, entering a steady decline. Each rebound grew weaker, and Ali shows that the support near $1.9 has given way. According to the analyst, XRP now targets lower levels after losing this crucial support. His next target is $1.1, much lower than the $1.53 level it fell to on October 10 . $1.1 would mark XRP’s lowest level in 2025, and could cause a mass exodus as investors seek better-performing assets to start 2026. XRP is currently trading at $1.86, and the structure shows lower highs since the peak in July, reinforcing the belief that momentum has faded. Support is gone for $XRP . $1.10 comes into focus. pic.twitter.com/RGBqV52vf6 — Ali Charts (@alicharts) December 24, 2025 Recent Price Action Adds Pressure Recent sessions have reinforced the warning. XRP slipped below $2 and failed to reclaim it. While it has slipped below this level before, it quickly recovered, and analysts downplayed the dip . However, extended periods below this level suggest that the decline will continue. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With XRP now trading below $1.9, many investors are closely watching the area. That level now acts as resistance rather than support. As long as XRP remains below it, downside risk stays elevated. This type of action keeps pressure on short-term traders, and selling pressure from these traders could accelerate the decline. Can XRP Still Recover? Despite the technical weakness, not all outlooks are bearish. Several market participants remain constructive on XRP over a longer horizon. ChatGPT recently predicted that XRP could start 2026 as high as $2.2 , placing it above the crucial support level. Many analysts have even more bullish expectations for XRP. Regaining the $1.9 level will be the first positive sign, and its performance over the next few days will determine its next direction.

56396107,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884318,1766750576,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56396107.jpeg,Inside Bitget’s strategy: Interview with CMO Ignacio Aguirre Franco,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitget-interview-cmo-ignacio-aguirre-franco/,"As the year comes to a close, we got the chance to sit down with Ignacio Aguirre Franco, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget. In our discussion, we explored his work experience, Bitget’s rebranding, and their distinctive branding and marketing strategies that have kept them ahead of the competition. Ignacio also gave us a hint of the biggest opportunities for crypto exchanges in the coming years. Working experience Coming from a computer engineering background, Ignacio began his coding journey at a young age. He later transitioned to consulting, where he identified a gap for professionals with a technological and marketing background. He would later work in various sectors, including entertainment at Universal Pictures, gaming, and companies such as Adobe and SAP. “I’ve been in the crypto space for almost ten years now, and working professionally in crypto for six. I’ve worked in crypto compliance, DeFi, and even a Bitcoin bank before joining Bitget.” Each experience built a knowledge layer. According to Ignacio, his primary goal in the space is to create narratives and storytelling that connect with people. “For me, marketing isn’t just about features—it’s about the business case and the value people can relate to.” We then asked Ignacio how it is working at Bitget. While at Bitget for only three months, Ignacio highlighted the exchange’s rebranding into a universal exchange, which he delves into later in the interview. He also lauded the exchange’s global team, which is heavily remote, comprising highly specialized individuals. “In my past roles, I learned different things from different companies, and Bitget is similar in that sense — we have specialists who understand their functions down to the smallest detail.” Bitget CMO Ignacio Aguirre Franco on the left and Cryptopolitan’s Rohan on the right Marketing a crypto exchange Good code eliminates friction, good branding eliminates doubt. Ignacio weighed the balance between product and marketing. A good product can survive without great marketing, but a bad product cannot survive even with the best marketing. While technical teams highlight metrics, real value is in translating technical capabilities into human, relatable value. “We build storytelling around our brand… the kind of storytelling that connects the product to a real human experience. “ We then asked him about the unique challenge of marketing a crypto exchange. Ignicio shared that compliance and regulation were a must when entering a new market. The biggest challenge, however, was that the rules varied across borders. “What’s acceptable in one jurisdiction might be restricted in another. Some markets are extremely tough; others have different sets of requirements entirely.” This meant that all forms of messaging had to conform to all the varying regulations. While frustrating at first, it became easier with time, he confessed. In regions where crypto adoption was fragile or regulatory frameworks were evolving, they simply never marketed there. On blockchain principles and terminologies. “Communication has to strike a balance. We aim to attract new people to crypto, so our messaging needs to be simple and approachable. At the same time, there is a strong existing cryptocurrency community, and our company’s DNA is deeply rooted in the crypto space. So we can’t ignore advanced users either.” Bitget as a universal exchange On Bitget becoming a universal exchange, Ignacio discussed the three main things people look for in an exchange: asset variety, usability, and liquidity. All these were at Bitget. The exchange also included a decentralized exchange and access to real-world asset tokens (RWAs). “The idea is to bring more products from TradFi and real-world assets into the play. Because we see a place where you don’t have to jump between apps, a central place where everything sits together.” He also highlighted Bitget’s security systems, which have never been hacked, its $700 million Protection Fund, and 1.8x Proof of Reserves. “To scale, there are two things: compliance and innovation. Because if you don’t innovate, you’re not relevant. So that’s where we sit, and then the whole marketing comes after it.” Ignacio went on to talk about Bitget’s flagship product, GetAgent. According to Ignacio, GetAgent was a natural step for Bitget, as it incorporates artificial intelligence as a trading assistant. “GetAgent is an AI assistant. So you can ask, ‘Is it a good time to enter the market?’ or ‘Can you tell me the situation with this blockchain?’ And you can also ask it to trade. If you’re a beginner, it takes the friction out because you can ask, ‘Is this a good time to enter Bitcoin?’ It’s not going to tell you ‘yes, enter’ or ‘no, don’t.’ It’s going to say, ‘Here are the indicators — based on these indicators, it could be a good time to jump in.’ And then you can ask it to make the buy for you.” For advanced traders, GetAgent helped in trade analysis and validation. In addition to trading, GetAgent also serves as a knowledge base, collecting real-time information from multiple channels, including social media, real-time price data, and news. “So I think it’s essential to have a tool that helps you clarify things. For beginners, it enables you to gain a better understanding. For advanced users, it allows you to make a more educated decision.” Bitget CMO Ignacio Aguirre Franco and Cryptopolitan’s Rohan Maintaining brand identity With most of the crypto exchanges offering similar products, we wanted to know how Bitget managed to stand out. Ignacio discussed attention as a scarce resource in exchanges; therefore, there was a need to be different. “We differentiate by bringing the best experience we can.” Bitget pioneered copy trading, which has over 200,000 elite traders and is also the first exchange to become a universal exchange. Staying ahead of the pack was crucial. He also emphasized the importance of improved communication and fostering trust with their clients. When it came to working with key opinion leaders, Ignacio said that they only collaborated with individuals who shared the company’s values. “For us, the most important part is to stay honest and stay true. So we work with people who align with our culture.” Looking ahead We asked Ignacio about the most significant opportunities for crypto exchanges in the next 2 to 3 years. Ignacio identified massive adoption and RWAs as significant opportunities for crypto exchanges in the coming years. As a universal exchange, Bitget would become a platform, not only for crypto, but also for traditional financial assets and RWAs. “When it’s tokenized — like tokenized stocks — the beauty is you don’t even have to buy the whole thing; you can opt for fractional buying. And it’s also available all day. Because stock trading in the U.S., for example, is Monday to Friday, 9:30 to 4:00. We don’t want you to trade on their time — we want you to trade on yours.” He also observed that adoption will increase among the younger generation, digital natives who will interact with these assets as their first financial products. “I see people who may never have a bank account, because now you can have a debit card linked to your crypto. So I see a huge opportunity of not just seeing it as a crypto exchange, but as their financial product.” Ignacio closed off by telling us about how much they value their users. “We always listen to and take feedback from customers about what they like or what they don’t like. For us, it’s about delivering the best experience on a platform with all the necessary assets. That’s the reason why we’re going to grow.”",Exclusive Interviews with Crypto Founders & Influencers|Bitget,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-26 12:02:56

After several cycles of lender failures and opaque risk-taking, users increasingly want to understand what compliance actually delivers—and which platforms translate regulation into safer, more usable products. This review explains how regulated crypto lending works in Europe, what borrowers realistically gain from compliance, and why some platforms such as Clapp.finance have emerged as trusted options by aligning regulation with borrower-friendly design. Why Compliance Matters in European Crypto Lending Europe still does not issue a single, universal “crypto lending license.” Instead, regulation applies through a mix of: Registration as a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) Mandatory AML/KYC compliance Custody and client-asset handling rules Disclosure and consumer-protection standards Ongoing supervisory oversight at the national or EU level For borrowers, regulation does not eliminate risk. What it does is define responsibilities—who holds your collateral, how liquidations work, and which legal framework applies if something goes wrong. Clapp: A Regulated Crypto Credit Line Built for Europe Clapp stands out among European crypto lenders because its regulatory status and product design are closely aligned. Clapp holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic, confirming that it operates as a licensed crypto-asset service provider within the European Union. This places the platform under EU AML and compliance obligations and subjects it to oversight by an EU member state regulator. Borrowers can: Draw funds when needed Repay partially or fully at any time Pay interest only on the amount actually used Leave the credit line unused at zero cost This structure significantly reduces unnecessary interest exposure and aligns well with consumer-protection principles around transparency and fairness. Clapp Fits the “Trusted Regulated Lender” Profile Clapp’s approach reflects several traits borrowers typically associate with regulated financial providers: Transparent cost structure No interest on unused credit, no hidden compounding, and clear visibility into borrowing costs. Conservative LTV framework Credit limits are designed to absorb market volatility rather than maximize leverage. Clear liquidation logic Risk thresholds are defined in advance, giving users time to react. Euro-native design Support for euro withdrawals and SEPA transfers positions Clapp as a European financial product, not just a crypto wrapper. Compliance-first onboarding Identity checks and AML procedures are part of the platform’s baseline, not optional add-ons. Rather than competing on headline rates or extreme borrowing limits, Clapp competes on predictability—a quality that matters more the longer a credit relationship lasts. What Regulation Still Does Not Guarantee Even with trusted, compliance-aware lenders, borrowers should remain realistic. Regulation does not: Prevent liquidation if collateral value drops Remove exposure to crypto market volatility Guarantee profitability Eliminate all platform risk What it does is ensure that outcomes follow known rules, not ad-hoc decisions. Final Thoughts In European crypto lending, regulation increasingly separates tools for liquidity from tools for leverage. Platforms that embrace compliance tend to design for durability, not short-term growth. Clapp exemplifies this shift. By pairing a flexible credit-line model with conservative risk management and regulatory alignment, it demonstrates what a trusted crypto lender in Europe looks like in practice.

For European users, access to liquidity on the same day—without selling assets—can matter more than headline rates or promotional terms. This is where crypto credit lines differ from traditional crypto loans. Instead of locking funds into fixed contracts, crypto credit line models allow users to draw liquidity when needed, repay flexibly, and keep collateral working in the background. Not all platforms handle this equally well. This article reviews how same-day crypto credit lines work in Europe and how Clapp platform delivers real-time access. What “same-day” means in crypto lending In practice, same-day access means two things: Credit becomes available immediately after collateral is posted Funds can be drawn without manual approval or waiting periods Most European platforms meet the first condition. Fewer meet the second consistently. Delays often come from fixed loan issuance, internal approvals, or rigid repayment schedules. Credit lines remove these frictions by separating credit availability from credit usage. Clapp: same-day crypto credit lines built around usage Clapp operates a credit-line model designed for immediate access and controlled borrowing. Once collateral is deposited, the credit line becomes available without fixed draw schedules or mandatory loan issuance. Borrowers pay interest only on the amount they withdraw. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. When funds are repaid, the available limit is restored instantly, without reapplying or restructuring the position. Clapp supports multi-collateral borrowing, allowing users to combine up to 19 assets into a single credit line. This includes BTC, ETH, SOL, and major stablecoins. Collateral can be adjusted without closing the line, which helps users manage exposure as markets move. There is no fixed repayment schedule. Funds can be drawn or released at any time directly from the Clapp Wallet, making the setup suitable for short-term liquidity needs as well as ongoing access. From a regulatory standpoint, Clapp holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic. This confirms its status as a licensed crypto loan provider operating within the EU framework. Taken together, the structure prioritizes availability and cost control. Liquidity is accessible the same day, interest accrues only when capital is in use, and collateral is not locked into rigid terms. What to pay attention to in same-day borrowing Speed alone is not enough. Effective same-day credit lines share several traits: Immediate credit availability after collateral deposit No fixed loan issuance required Interest charged only on used capital Instant restoration of credit after repayment Clear liquidation thresholds Platforms that combine these features reduce both cost and operational friction. Closing thoughts Same-day crypto credit lines reflect a shift away from rigid lending structures toward on-demand liquidity. For European users, this shift matters most when EUR access is reliable and borrowing costs track actual usage. Clapp’s credit-line model aligns closely with these priorities. By separating credit availability from credit usage, it allows users to manage liquidity without unnecessary interest or structural lockups. As crypto lending matures in Europe, flexibility and timing are becoming as important as rates. Credit lines built for same-day access reflect that change.

What initially appeared as scattered wallet losses quickly hardened into something far more serious: a confirmed supply-chain compromise of Trust Wallet’s official Chrome browser extension. The Christmas Trust Wallet hack The incident traces back to December 24, 2025, when Trust Wallet released version 2.68.0 of its Chrome browser extension. The first major public alarm came from on-chain investigator ZachXBT, who linked the wallet drains directly to the v2.68 update while funds were still in motion. His warnings helped frame the incident as an extension compromise rather than a user-level mistake. In many cases, wallets were emptied within minutes of importing a seed phrase or accessing an existing wallet through the extension. By December 26, the picture was clearer, and Trust Wallet publicly confirmed that only the browser extension version 2.68 was affected. Trust Wallet @TrustWallet · Follow We’ve identified a security incident affecting Trust Wallet Browser Extension version 2.68 only. Users with Browser Extension 2.68 should disable and upgrade to 2.69.Please refer to the official Chrome Webstore link here: chrome.google.com/webstore/detai… Please note: Mobile-only users 1:21 am · 26 Dec 2025 2 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Although mobile users were not impacted, the company advised all extension users to immediately disable version 2.68 and upgrade to version 2.69 through the official Chrome Web Store. What really went wrong Researchers and on-chain investigators described the exploit as a straight supply-chain attack, not phishing and not user error. According to multiple analyses shared publicly, the compromised extension contained a malicious JavaScript payload embedded in what appeared to be routine analytics code. The script, often referenced as a file similar to “4482.js,” allegedly masqueraded as a PostHog-style integration. Its function was simple and devastating. When users entered or accessed their recovery phrase, the data was silently exfiltrated to attacker-controlled infrastructure using domains that closely resembled legitimate Trust Wallet metrics endpoints. Once attackers had the seed phrase, no further interaction was needed. There were no approvals to trick and no transactions to sign. The wallet could be restored elsewhere and drained across every supported blockchain. That is exactly what investigators observed, with rapid multi-chain sweeps affecting Bitcoin, EVM networks, Solana, and BNB Chain. Money trailed to instant exchange services and CEXs While some reports pointed to roughly $2.8 million in confirmed drains, others tracked more than $4 million passing through identified services. Trust Wallet has, however, confirmed that the total impact stood at approximately $7 million . Binance founder CZ, whose company acquired Trust Wallet in 2018, also stated that losses were around $7 million and confirmed that users would be made whole. CZ also highlighted the most uncomfortable issue raised by the incident: how a malicious build was able to reach the Chrome Web Store under an official wallet brand. On-chain analysis reveals that the stolen funds are being transferred quickly, with a significant portion routed through instant exchange services and centralised platforms. Public trackers cited flows into services such as ChangeNOW and FixedFloat, as well as exchanges including KuCoin and HTX.

The recently announced plans by Japan’s industry ministry will see its budgeted support for cutting-edge semiconductors and artificial intelligence development increase to about ¥1.23 trillion ($7.9 billion) for the fiscal year starting in April. The overall METI budget has risen by almost 50% from the previous year, largely due to the jump in chips and AI spending. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Cabinet has signed off on it; however, there are still plans to debate the government’s initial budget plan in parliament in the new year. Japan quadruples AI spending plans for the upcoming fiscal year Japan is paying more attention to its chips and AI spending in a bid to strengthen its capacities in frontier technology so it can catch up with the U.S. and China. Both countries have remained on tense terms even though they are no longer lobbing tariffs at each other, and Japan has been trying to secure better supply chain access for key technologies. In the upcoming fiscal year, Japan’s ministry will also reportedly work to secure most of the additional funding for chips and AI in regular budgets from the onset. In the past, the ministry used a more ad-hoc approach, funding it through supplementary budgets drafted later in the year. The move is expected to provide more stable funding to the sectors. Of the total amount set aside for semiconductor and AI development, ¥150 billion has been earmarked for state-backed chip venture Rapidus, bringing the cumulative government investment in the venture to ¥250 billion. For AI, ¥387.3 billion will go towards the development of domestic foundation AI models, strengthening data infrastructure and “physical AI” where AI controls robots and machinery. In the broader budget, ¥5 billion will go towards securing key minerals, including rare earths, while ¥122 billion has been earmarked for decarbonization and the development of so-called next-generation nuclear power plants. About ¥1.78 trillion of special bonds will also be issued to aid the state-backed Nippon Export and Investment Insurance to support Japanese investment into the U.S. as part of both countries’ trade agreement. Japan’s fiscal stimulus package expected to drive growth next year The revelation of plans to increase the METI budget for AI and semiconductors comes after Japan’s government revised its economic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year on projections that growth will accelerate in the following year, as reported by Cryptopolitan. This claim is based on the view that its massive stimulus package will boost consumption and capital expenditure. The stimulus package was compiled by the administration in November and funded by a supplementary budget for the current fiscal year that focused on cushioning the blow to households from rising living costs. It was worth about ¥21.3 trillion ($136.7 billion) and included payouts to families with children, subsidies to cut utility bills, and fiscal spending to promote investment in areas such as infrastructure, artificial intelligence and semiconductor chips. As a result of the package, the latest projections approved by the cabinet see Japan’s economy expand 1.1% in the current fiscal year, up from 0.7% growth estimated in August due to the smaller-than-expected hit from U.S. tariffs. Growth is also expected to accelerate to 1.3% in fiscal 2026 as consumption and capital expenditure are encouraged by the stimulus offsetting soft overseas demand, according to the projections. As for consumption, the government expects it to rise 1.3% next fiscal year, while capital expenditure may likely increase 2.8% in fiscal 2026, faster than an estimated 1.9% rise for the current fiscal year.

However, the depeg was confined to secondary markets, where the USX stablecoin trades freely on DEXs. These venues rely on liquidity providers rather than guaranteed redemption mechanisms. As sellers rushed to exit positions, arbitrage failed to stabilise prices quickly, allowing the discount to deepen before support arrived. Solstice steps in to restore the USX stablecoin stability Solstice acknowledged the volatility within hours and moved to address the imbalance. At approximately 04:30 UTC, the team and its partners began injecting fresh liquidity into the affected pools. On-chain data confirmed the intervention, and prices responded almost immediately. Following the liquidity injection, USX’s price rebounded sharply, and the stablecoin began trading closer to parity. Market data later showed the stablecoin hovering between $0.94 and $0.99, with some reports placing it near $0.987. While the peg was not restored cleanly in a single move, stability gradually returned as depth improved. Solstice has emphasised that the incident did not stem from a failure of backing. Solstice has also stated that assets under custody remained unaffected and that USX stayed over 100% collateralized throughout the episode. According to the team, the core protocol functioned as designed, and the disruption was purely a secondary market event. The issuer also highlighted the distinction between primary and secondary markets. Institutional partners with permissioned access can mint and redeem USX directly at a 1:1 ratio, subject to KYC requirements. Retail users, however, depend entirely on DEX liquidity, which can deviate from peg during periods of stress. Questions linger despite the prompt intervention Despite the swift response, the sharpness of the depeg raised eyebrows across the crypto community. For some users, the damage was already done. Those who sold USX during the downturn locked in losses, as secondary market trades are final. Others who bought at a discount benefited from arbitrage opportunities created by the dislocation. Although temporary depegs are not uncommon, a drop of this magnitude exposed vulnerabilities in how liquidity is distributed relative to circulating supply. casinokrisa @casinokrisa · Follow Replying to @PeckShieldAlert Temporary depegs often signal liquidity management issues, even if collateral remains intact. Watch for recurring volatility. 11:03 am · 26 Dec 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Several traders warned that reliance on manual intervention could amplify risk if market conditions worsen. Actually, panic selling continued even after prices recovered, suggesting lingering unease among holders. Some users even publicly compared the event to past stablecoin failures, including the collapse of Terra’s UST , though analysts stressed the comparison was flawed. However, the USX stablecoin is neither algorithmic nor reliant on reflexive mint-and-burn mechanics, and its backing did not unravel. Solstice has, however, countered the narrative by promising greater transparency. The company has said that it has requested an immediate third-party attestation to verify reserves and pledged to deepen secondary market liquidity to reduce the chance of a repeat event, and stated that monthly proof-of-solvency reports are already available.

According to Uniswap Founder Hayden Adams, the proposal, dubbed “UNIfication,” jointly introduced by Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation back in November, has officially passed with 99.9% support.

UNIfication marks one of the biggest overhauls in the decentralised exchange protocol’s seven-year history and has garnered strong support right from the moment voting went live on Dec. 20. Within just two days, the proposal surpassed nearly 70 million votes, far exceeding the 40 million quorum that was required for it to pass. This goes to show that the initiative was highly anticipated by the community. The proposal aims to activate the long-awaited fee switch, as part of which a portion of swap fees will now be redirected directly to the protocol in order to continually burn UNI tokens. The goal is to create a deflationary loop where more UNI will be burned as trading activity on the protocol continues to grow. Community members expect this to support UNI’s price appreciation over the long term by tightening supply. Further, to account for the years during which the fee switch remained inactive, a total of 100 million UNI will be burned from the treasury to make up for the tokens that would have been burned if the system had been in place from the beginning. Other key changes in the proposal include the rollout of a new incentive system called Protocol Fee Discount Auctions, which aims to improve liquidity provider returns by allowing traders to bid for temporary fee exemptions. The winning bids will be used to burn even more UNI. Uniswap Labs to take the lead There are also several important structural changes that will be implemented. Uniswap Labs will now assume core responsibilities instead of the Uniswap Foundation. In effect, most of the operational teams from the Uniswap Foundation will transition to Uniswap Labs to bring research, development, and ecosystem growth under a unified strategy. Uniswap will also be setting its interface, wallet, and API fees to zero as part of this alignment. Lastly, a growth budget of 20 million UNI per year will be established, beginning in 2026, to support protocol development, integrations, and long-term ecosystem expansion. With the passage of the proposal, it has now entered a two-day time lock period, which was part of the execution timeline laid out in the governance process. UNI, the native token of Uniswap, has been rallying since voting initially went live late last week. At press time, the token is up over 13% in the past 7 days after surging over 2% in the past 24 hours.

The technical structure remains constructive, though confirmation is still required to unlock further upside. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency built on data, trends, and market timing. It helps Web3 projects make the most of every moment. ETH Holds Above Short-Term Trend Support Source: coinmarketcap ETH closed above its 7-day simple moving average at $2,968, signaling that buyers are defending recent gains. This level has acted as near-term trend support, helping stabilize price action after the latest pullback. Holding above this moving average keeps the short-term structure intact and supports the case for another attempt at higher resistance levels. $3,000 Remains the Key Hurdle Ethereum is now approaching the $2,980–$3,000 resistance zone. This area carries technical and psychological significance, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the $3,000 round number. A daily close above $3,000 would mark a clear technical breakout. Such a move could trigger algorithmic buying and force the liquidation of approximately $58 million in short positions, potentially accelerating upside momentum. Momentum Leaves Room for Upside The 14-day Relative Strength Index currently sits at 41.9, indicating neutral momentum. This suggests Ethereum has room to move higher before approaching overbought conditions, provided buying pressure continues. While momentum is not yet strong, it remains supportive of a breakout attempt rather than signaling exhaustion. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. ETH Price Outlook If Ethereum fails to break through the $3,000 resistance zone, a pullback remains possible. The next key support lies near $2,850, which would likely attract renewed buying interest if tested. A sustained move below this level would weaken the bullish setup and shift focus back to consolidation. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This comes as some Bitcoin advocates and developers downplay the imminent risk posed by quantum computing, stating that it is unlikely to be a concern anytime soon. Ripple’s XRP Ledger Works On Quantum-Resistant Code In an X post , Ripple’s XRP Ledger validator Vet revealed that developers are already working on quantum-resistant code on the network. This came as he drew attention to a fully quantum-proof XRPL, including consensus, which is currently in testnet. This marks progress for the network, even as it achieves something that networks like Bitcoin still lag on. Vet indicated that creating a quantum-proof XRP Ledger is likely to come with some disadvantages for the network. He stated that one of the downsides of these encryptions is the size of the signatures. He shared a video showing that transaction signatures for payment on the quantum XRPL are much longer than on the XRPL mainnet . Vet’s post followed the revelation by XRPL Labs engineer Dennis Angell that the AlphaNet, the developer network for XRPL, is now fully quantum-secure. Angell mentioned that the testnet now has quantum consensus, quantum accounts, quantum transactions, and dilithium cryptography. He further remarked that they had added native smart contracts while declaring that the quantum-resistant future of blockchain is live. Notably, this move comes as Ripple and the XRP Ledger look to onboard more institutions onto the network. Concerns about quantum computing are on the rise, with Bitcoin in the spotlight at the moment, as developers have yet to make meaningful progress on making the flagship crypto quantum-resistant. Following the XRP Ledger’s progress on making the network quantum-resistant, crypto pundit Jenna questioned the possibility of Bitcoin investors selling their BTC because it’s not quantum-resistant and then buying XRP because it is safer. Another pundit, Mickle, also noted how the XRP Ledger is already pretty much quantum-proof while Bitcoiners argue over whether quantum computing is real or not. Why Working Towards Quantum-Resistant Transactions Matters In an X post , crypto pundit Sandip noted that blockchains such as Bitcoin, XRP Ledger, and Ethereum rely on ECDSA cryptography. This puts them at risk, as a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could theoretically break them in the future. He then remarked that testing this early ensures the network is future-proofed against the time when quantum computers become powerful enough to break these networks. Meanwhile, Sandip explained that these XRP Ledger developers are testing optional and upgradeable signature schemes. This will ensure that wallets and validators can later support post-quantum keys. It also enables a smooth migration before quantum risk becomes real. The pundit added that this is long-term infrastructure planning, not price manipulation, as it puts the XRPL ahead of many competitors, including Bitcoin. Venture capitalist Nic Carter, who has been very vocal about the quantum risk to Bitcoin, has explained why it is important to start preparing against this risk from now. He highlighted how there are several decisions to be made and processes to be taken if developers are to successfully make the flagship crypto quantum-resistant.",Ripple|bitcoin|Dennis Angell|ECDSA|Ethereum|Jenna|Mickle|Nic Carter|ripple|Sandip|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 12:30:07

Instead, Saylor’s outlook positions Bitcoin price appreciation as the outcome of a deeper structural transition that is unfolding quietly within the banking system. Michael Saylor On Bitcoin Price’s Structural Shift As the market looks toward 2026, Michael Saylor’s thesis on Bitcoin price action focuses on a structural shift away from trader-driven dynamics toward regulated financial institutions, a transition that could fundamentally reshape how capital engages with Bitcoin at scale. For most of its history, Bitcoin price discovery has been dominated by cyclical trading behavior, leverage, and sentiment-driven momentum. Related Reading: Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense Even milestones such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, while broadening access, largely remain confined to traditional capital markets. Saylor’s view departs from this model by highlighting Bitcoin’s gradual integration into bank balance sheets, where valuation is driven by utility, collateralization, and long-term capital allocation rather than short-term market cycles. Recent developments underscore this shift. A growing number of major US banks have begun offering Bitcoin-collateralized loans, a move that signals a reclassification of Bitcoin from a high-volatility trading asset to a recognized form of financial collateral. Lending against Bitcoin reflects institutional confidence in its liquidity, custody standards, and long-term value stability. In practical terms, this positions Bitcoin alongside assets that are suitable for credit creation rather than short-term speculation. Once Bitcoin is integrated into lending structures, treasury operations, and institutional risk models, demand characteristics change materially. Capital deployed through these channels is not reactive to short-term price fluctuations. It is strategic, compliance-driven, and designed for multi-year horizons. This type of demand absorbs supply consistently, reinforcing scarcity dynamics already embedded in Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model. As a result, Bitcoin price appreciation becomes a function of sustained capital allocation rather than episodic market rallies. Banking Infrastructure And The New Ceiling For Bitcoin Price Saylor identifies 2026 as the period when the impact of banking adoption becomes fully visible. Major financial institutions such as Charles Schwab and Citigroup, planning to roll out Bitcoin custody and related services, point to a broader alignment between Bitcoin and regulated financial infrastructure. Related Reading: $130 Million XRP Fumble: Analyst Reveals What Went Wrong Custody plays a pivotal role in this process. When banks custody Bitcoin, they unlock the ability to embed it across wealth management platforms, corporate treasury strategies, and secured lending products. This dramatically expands Bitcoin’s addressable capital base by enabling participation from institutions previously constrained by regulatory, operational, or fiduciary limitations. As banking participation deepens, Bitcoin price behavior is likely to evolve. Volatility driven by leveraged trading and speculative positioning diminishes in relative importance, while long-term balance-sheet accumulation becomes a dominant force. In this environment, according to Saylor, Bitcoin’s new all-time highs will not be the product of sudden euphoria but the result of sustained absorption by institutions operating at scale.

Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $126,000 in October, following another record earlier in the year when the total crypto market capitalization hit $4.2 trillion in June. These records reflected deeper shifts across regulation, adoption, and infrastructure rather than a short-lived market rally. This recap looks at the key forces that shaped the market trends and crypto media attention in 2025 and explains how the industry evolved beyond speculation toward broader integration with global finance. Regulatory Clarity and Accelerating Crypto Adoption The year began with a defining moment for institutional crypto adoption in the United States. Donald Trump, elected U.S. President in late 2024 and openly supportive of digital assets, proposed the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (SBR). The initiative was formalized via executive order in March 2025. For the first time, Bitcoin was framed as a strategic asset within a national financial framework. The reserve positioned BTC alongside traditional stores of value, signaling a shift away from its long-standing classification as a purely speculative instrument. At the same time, governments in other regions explored blockchain adoption at the infrastructure level. In 2025, Georgia’s Ministry of Justice signed a MoU with Hedera, as the country considered migrating its land registry on-chain and tokenizing real estate assets. The initiative signaled growing interest among governments in using public blockchains for recordkeeping, transparency, and asset management. 🚨 Today, on our radar:Georgia’s Ministry of Justice signed an MoU to migrate its entire national real estate registry to @hedera . This means full #RWA tokenization of property titles on the network, one of the strongest enterprise endorsements Hedera has received to date. — Outset PR (@OutsetPR) December 5, 2025 Europe Enforces MiCA, Reshaping the Stablecoin Market While the U.S. focused on strategic adoption, Europe concentrated on regulation. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) became fully applicable at the end of December 2024, making 2025 the first full year of enforcement across the EU. MiCA shifted the region from legal uncertainty to a structured regulatory framework, particularly for stablecoins. In practice, enforcement in 2025: Standardized reserve, transparency, and risk-control requirements for stablecoin issuers Enabled licensing and EU-wide passporting, lowering barriers for institutional participation Triggered compliance-driven market restructuring, including the delisting of non-compliant tokens Encouraged the launch of euro-pegged stablecoins by regulated financial institutions However, regulation also had secondary effects. Outset PR, a data-driven crypto PR agency with an in-house media intelligence system, observed a notable correlation: traffic declined across 82% of crypto media outlets in Western Europe in Q1 2025, coinciding with active MiCA implementation. According to Outset PR’s analysis, new compliance requirements may have acted as risk signals in Google’s algorithmic evaluations, contributing to a sharp drop in visibility and traffic during the transition period. Stablecoin Adoption Boom in Latin America Outside Europe, stablecoins continued to gain traction—particularly in Latin America, where they increasingly function as everyday financial tools. In countries such as Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico, persistent inflation and currency instability pushed users toward dollar-pegged stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC, as a way to preserve value and manage cross-border transactions. Data from Chainalysis’ Q2 report shows that stablecoins dominated crypto transaction flows on exchanges and P2P platforms across major LATAM markets. In Colombia, nearly 50% of all crypto purchases involved stablecoins, underscoring their role as a preferred on-chain medium of exchange. Despite rising adoption, media engagement told a different story. Outset PR’s report indicates that crypto media traffic in Latin America fell by roughly half in Q2 2025. The data suggests uneven audience behavior: while mainstream crypto outlets faced volatility, generalist publishers recorded modest growth, pointing to a shift in how crypto information is consumed in the region. Major Protocol Upgrades and Infrastructure Progress in 2025 Beyond regulation and adoption, 2025 also delivered meaningful progress at the protocol level. One of the most significant technical milestones was Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, deployed in May. The upgrade merged the Prague and Electra proposals and introduced several key improvements: Expanded validator flexibility, allowing staking from 32 ETH up to 2,048 ETH Enhanced execution-layer efficiency Improved account abstraction, enabling smoother wallet interactions Pectra marked Ethereum’s largest protocol upgrade since The Merge, with a focus on validator efficiency and user experience rather than experimental features. Solana followed a different path. Already optimized for high throughput, the network explored auxiliary layer-2 and multi-layer scaling approaches to support applications such as high-frequency trading and gaming. These developments preserved fast execution times while giving developers more flexibility in deployment and cost management. A Year of Structural Progress Taken together, 2025 marked a shift in crypto’s trajectory. Regulatory frameworks moved from theory to enforcement, stablecoins evolved into core financial infrastructure in emerging markets, and protocol upgrades focused on practical improvements rather than headline-driven innovation. The records set this year reflected not just market enthusiasm, but a maturing industry increasingly shaped by policy, adoption, and long-term infrastructure decisions.

This analysis provides a data-driven EOS price prediction for 2026 through 2030, examining whether its extensive technical foundation can finally catalyze significant market movement. We will dissect network developments, macroeconomic factors, and comparative blockchain metrics to build a comprehensive forecast. EOS Price Prediction: Foundation and Current Context Launched in 2018 after a record-breaking initial coin offering, EOS promised a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications. However, its price trajectory has remained relatively stagnant for several years, especially when compared to broader market rallies. Consequently, any meaningful EOS price prediction must first ground itself in the project’s fundamental evolution. The transition of governance to the EOS Network Foundation (ENF) in 2021 marked a pivotal shift towards community-led development. Furthermore, the implementation of the Antelope protocol stack and significant upgrades like the Mandel 3.1 consensus hard fork have substantially improved network performance and developer incentives. These technical milestones form the bedrock for our forward-looking analysis, separating speculative chatter from infrastructure-based assessment. Technical Analysis and Historical Price Patterns Analyzing historical data reveals distinct phases for EOS. The 2018 launch saw rapid appreciation followed by a prolonged consolidation period. Price action has frequently correlated with Bitcoin’s market cycles but with diminishing volatility amplitude over time. Key resistance and support levels established over multiple years provide critical technical markers for future movement. On-chain metrics, including active address counts and transaction volume, offer additional layers of insight beyond simple price charts. For instance, sustained growth in network utility often precedes price discovery phases in blockchain assets. Therefore, monitoring developer activity and dApp deployment on the EOS network becomes as crucial as tracking trading volume. Expert Perspectives on Network Utility and Adoption Industry analysts emphasize that long-term value accrual in blockchain stems from sustainable use cases. Reports from entities like Messari and CoinMetrics consistently track the health of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems on various platforms. For EOS, the growth of its DeFi total value locked (TVL) and the activity on NFT marketplaces provide quantifiable measures of adoption. Experts like those at the ENF point to the network’s high throughput and negligible transaction fees as structural advantages for application developers. The real-world adoption of these features by enterprises and independent developers will be the primary driver influencing any EOS price prediction for the latter half of the decade. Macroeconomic and Regulatory Factors for 2026-2030 No cryptocurrency operates in a vacuum. Broader financial conditions, including interest rate policies from major central banks and global liquidity measures, profoundly impact risk asset valuations. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is also crystallizing across major jurisdictions like the United States, the European Union under MiCA, and parts of Asia. Clear, constructive regulation could provide a significant tailwind for compliant, established layer-1 networks like EOS. Conversely, restrictive policies could hinder growth. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance (TradFi) and the potential for institutional investment via vehicles like spot ETFs for assets beyond Bitcoin could redirect capital flows. These macro forces will interact directly with EOS’s technical progress to shape its market position. Comparative Analysis with Competing Layer-1 Blockchains A realistic EOS price prediction requires benchmarking against its peers. The layer-1 blockchain space is intensely competitive, with networks like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche all vying for developers and users. The table below summarizes key comparative metrics that influence investor and developer allocation decisions. Blockchain Key Focus Transaction Finality Approx. Fees EOS High-throughput dApps ~3 seconds Negligible Ethereum Decentralization & Security ~15 seconds Variable, often high Solana Ultra-high speed ~0.4 seconds Very low Avalanche Custom subnetworks ~2 seconds Low EOS’s value proposition hinges on its consistent performance and cost structure. Its challenge lies in marketing these advantages and fostering a vibrant ecosystem that leverages them, moving beyond pure technical specifications to tangible user benefits. Scenario-Based Price Forecasts: 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030 Based on the synthesis of technical development, adoption metrics, and market environment, we outline potential scenarios. These are not financial advice but models based on observed growth patterns in blockchain networks. 2026: This period could see the maturation of current ENF-led initiatives. Price action may remain range-bound unless a major dApp achieves breakout adoption, serving as a catalyst. 2027-2028: Broader crypto market cycles, potentially aligned with Bitcoin’s halving rhythm, may lift all boats. EOS’s price could test previous all-time highs if its ecosystem growth outpaces the market average during this phase. 2029-2030: The long-term horizon depends on sustained utility. Success in key verticals like gaming, enterprise supply chains, or digital identity could establish a new, higher valuation floor. Failure to capture meaningful market share could result in continued consolidation. Critical variables to watch include the network’s developer growth rate, the TVL in its DeFi protocols, and partnerships that drive real-world transactions. These indicators will provide early signals confirming or contradicting these scenario pathways. Conclusion The path for EOS between 2026 and 2030 is not predetermined. Our EOS price prediction analysis underscores that its potential hinges on converting robust technical infrastructure into undeniable ecosystem growth. The network possesses the foundational elements—speed, low cost, and renewed governance—required for success. However, the blockchain landscape is a marketplace of attention and innovation. Therefore, breaking its long silence in the markets will ultimately depend on the network’s ability to attract and retain developers who build applications that attract and retain users. The coming years will be a definitive test of whether EOS can translate its latent potential into realized value. FAQs Q1: What is the main factor that could positively impact the EOS price by 2030? The single largest positive factor would be the emergence of a “killer application”—a widely adopted dApp built exclusively on EOS that drives significant, sustained network usage and demand for the EOS token. Q2: How does EOS’s technology compare to Ethereum for future growth? EOS offers significantly higher transactions per second and lower fees, which is advantageous for user-facing applications. Ethereum prioritizes maximal decentralization and security, fostering a larger developer community and total value locked. Growth depends on which attributes the market values more for specific use cases. Q3: Is EOS considered a good long-term investment? As a journalistic analysis, we do not provide investment advice. EOS is a high-risk, high-potential-reward asset within the volatile cryptocurrency sector. Its long-term viability depends entirely on adoption and execution, not just its technology. Q4: What are the biggest risks to this EOS price prediction? Key risks include intensified competition from other layer-1 or layer-2 blockchains, failure to grow its developer ecosystem, adverse global cryptocurrency regulations, and broader macroeconomic downturns that reduce investment in risk assets. Q5: Where can I find reliable data on EOS network activity? Independent blockchain analytics platforms like Messari, CoinMetrics, and TokenTerminal provide verifiable data on metrics such as daily active addresses, transaction counts, developer activity, and total value locked in DeFi protocols on the EOS network.

Ethereum (ETH) In the second part of December, Ethereum has been mostly flat with a price similar to last week, hovering above the support at $2,870. The momentum is flat due to the lack of volume and interest from market participants (holiday season). ETH needs a catalyst to take it above the key resistance at $3,345. Looking ahead, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating around the $3,000 level since late November, indicating indecision. This is likely to continue until a decisive breakout, most likely to happen in early 2026. Ripple (XRP) In December, XRP lost its key support at $2 and closed this week with a modest 1% loss. Buyers returned around $1.8 to defend the price, but due to the low volume, there was no significant bounce to attract more buyers. With $2 now acting as a resistance, XRP will have a tough time breaking this level in the future, particularly because the current momentum is bearish with lower lows more likely. Looking ahead, XRP could fall to $1.6 before buyers return in force, a level not seen since April and October 2025. Cardano (ADA) Bad news for ADA holders as the price lost its support at 40 cents and closed the week with a 3% loss. This level will also act as a key resistance going forward. With no buyers in sight, the price action looks extremely bearish and has stayed so since the October 10th crash. The current downtrend has been very aggressive with barely any relief. Looking ahead, if sellers maintain this pressure in the future, Cardano could fall to 30 cents next or even lower if bulls don’t return. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin tried to break the resistance at $900, but was sharply rejected, and the price is currently hovering around $840. This also pushed BNB to close the week with a 1% loss. With momentum clearly on the bear side, the price could fall much lower in the days and weeks to come. Support is found at $800 and $690, which could bring back buyers should such discounts appear in the future. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is likely to underperform until early 2026, when a bounce or relief rally could materialize if the key support levels hold. Hype (HYPE) HYPE closed the week in green with a modest 2% gain. To get excited, buyers will need to break above $26, which is currently acting as a key resistance. The downtrend since late September has been extremely aggressive, with the price losing over 60% of its valuation. At the time of this post, this cryptocurrency found strong support around $22, which allowed the price to bounce. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency remains weak, with the downtrend intact. HYPE needs to move above $26 and, ideally, $30 to build confidence in a sustained recovery.

The firm now targets accumulating 210,000 Bitcoin (BTC) by 2027, a figure representing precisely 1% of the cryptocurrency’s total finite supply. This strategic pivot, confirmed through corporate filings and foreign media reports in early 2025, positions MetaPlanet not merely as an investor but as a potential cornerstone entity within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Consequently, the company’s plan necessitates a fundamental reorganization of its capital structure, recently approved by shareholders, to fund this unprecedented acquisition. Decoding MetaPlanet’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy MetaPlanet’s strategy transcends simple asset accumulation. The company intends to leverage innovative financial products to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases. This method, enabled by the recent capital structure overhaul, suggests a sophisticated, sustained acquisition plan rather than a one-time market entry. Furthermore, achieving the 210,000 BTC target would catapult MetaPlanet into an elite tier of corporate holders. According to the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries, the current leader, MicroStrategy, holds 671,268 BTC as of late December 2024. Therefore, MetaPlanet’s success would instantly make it the world’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, a monumental shift in the landscape of institutional digital asset adoption. The Mechanics of the Capital Raise The approved capital reorganization is critical for execution. Typically, such restructuring allows a company to issue new shares, convertible bonds, or other equity-linked instruments. MetaPlanet plans to channel proceeds from these new financial products directly into Bitcoin. This approach provides a scalable funding mechanism while offering investors a novel vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated, publicly-traded entity. The strategy mirrors methods pioneered by other firms but on a potentially larger and more systematic scale. The Rising Tide of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption MetaPlanet’s announcement is not an isolated event. Instead, it represents a significant acceleration in a broader corporate trend. Since 2020, numerous publicly-traded companies globally have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, citing its properties as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. This movement, often called the “Bitcoin treasury strategy,” has created a new class of institutional holders. The table below illustrates the current competitive landscape MetaPlanet aims to enter. Company BTC Holdings (Approx.) Country Status MicroStrategy 671,268 BTC United States Largest Holder Tesla ~10,800 BTC United States Major Holder Block (Square) ~8,027 BTC United States Major Holder MetaPlanet (Target) 210,000 BTC Japan Projected by 2027 This trend underscores a fundamental shift in how corporations view reserve assets. Traditional cash and short-term treasuries now compete with digital alternatives. Analysts point to several driving factors: Monetary Policy Response: Expansionary policies by central banks have devalued many fiat currencies. Institutional Infrastructure: Improved custody solutions and regulatory clarity have reduced operational risk. Network Effect: Each major corporate adoption validates the strategy for others, creating a powerful network effect. Potential Market Impact and Strategic Implications MetaPlanet’s goal, if pursued aggressively, could have tangible effects on the Bitcoin market. Acquiring 210,000 BTC represents a substantial portion of the liquid supply, especially considering Bitcoin’s daily trading volume and the amount held in long-term storage by other entities. Such consistent, large-scale buying pressure from a single corporation could influence market dynamics, potentially reducing volatility and increasing the asset’s perceived stability for other institutional investors. However, market analysts caution that execution is key; the plan depends on successful capital raises and strategic timing of purchases to minimize market impact costs. Expert Perspective on the 1% Supply Target Financial strategists note the symbolic and practical weight of targeting 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Bitcoin’s protocol enforces a hard cap of 21 million coins, making its supply truly scarce and predictable. Securing 1% of this total supply positions MetaPlanet as a permanent, significant stakeholder in the network. This move is less about short-term trading and more about securing a strategic, non-dilutable asset on the company’s balance sheet for decades. Experts compare it to a corporation acquiring a foundational resource, akin to a tech company securing key intellectual property or an energy firm locking in long-term resource rights. Regulatory and Operational Considerations in Japan As a Japanese listed company, MetaPlanet operates within a specific regulatory framework. Japan has historically taken a more structured approach to cryptocurrency regulation compared to some other jurisdictions. The country’s Payment Services Act recognizes Bitcoin as a legal form of property. This regulatory clarity likely provides MetaPlanet with the legal certainty needed for such a large-scale balance sheet commitment. Operationally, the company must also navigate: Custody: Securing billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin requires enterprise-grade, insured custody solutions, likely involving multiple institutional custodians. Accounting: Japanese accounting standards for digital assets will dictate how the holding is reported, affecting quarterly and annual financial statements. Shareholder Communication: Maintaining transparent communication with shareholders about strategy, risks, and performance is paramount. Conclusion MetaPlanet’s Bitcoin treasury strategy targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027 represents a watershed moment in corporate finance. The plan demonstrates a profound commitment to Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset and reflects the maturation of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. If successful, MetaPlanet will not only become the world’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder but will also further legitimize the digital asset class for boards and investors worldwide. The journey from announcement to execution will be closely watched, serving as a critical case study for the feasibility and impact of large-scale corporate Bitcoin acquisition in the coming years. FAQs Q1: How does MetaPlanet plan to buy 210,000 Bitcoin? MetaPlanet intends to raise capital by launching new financial products, such as equity or debt instruments. The company recently underwent a capital structure reorganization approved by shareholders to enable this funding strategy. Proceeds will be allocated directly to purchasing Bitcoin over time. Q2: What does holding 1% of Bitcoin’s supply mean? Bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins. Holding 210,000 BTC equals exactly 1% of that total. This gives MetaPlanet ownership of a significant, finite portion of the entire network, positioning it as a major permanent stakeholder. Q3: Who is currently the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin? As of December 2024, the business intelligence firm MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder, with approximately 671,268 BTC. MetaPlanet’s target of 210,000 BTC would make it the second-largest if achieved. Q4: Why are corporations like MetaPlanet buying Bitcoin? Corporations cite several reasons, including Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, its properties as a long-term store of value with a verifiably scarce supply, and its low correlation to traditional assets, which can help diversify a corporate treasury. Q5: What are the risks of MetaPlanet’s Bitcoin strategy? Key risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, which could significantly impact the company’s balance sheet value; regulatory changes in Japan or globally; operational risks related to securing and custodying the asset; and execution risk in raising sufficient capital to meet the ambitious target.

He noted that while the broader market remains weak and XRP price action stays flat, ETFs continue to absorb large volumes of the token. His post stressed that this activity does not resemble retail speculation. He wrote that ETFs absorbed over $1 billion worth of XRP in roughly five weeks, despite limited price movement. He added, “That’s not retail exit liquidity. That’s institutional entry.” Listen $XRP Holders The market is down. $XRP price is flat And yet, ETFs just absorbed over a billion dollars worth of it in 5 weeks. That’s not retail exit liquidity. That’s institutional entry. They don’t need fireworks, they need infrastructure. This kind of inflow… https://t.co/QvrKF9qva2 pic.twitter.com/PbnjzlBIVQ — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 24, 2025 Analyzing the ETF Chart The chart shared alongside the post supports his argument. Data from SoSoValue shows steady and repeated net inflows into XRP spot ETFs from mid-November through late December. Several single-day inflows exceed $100 million. One session shows inflows of nearly $250 million. Over the same period, total net assets climbed to over $1.25 billion . This accumulation occurred while XRP’s price hovered near $1.9. Despite over a month of net inflows , XRP has not experienced a sustained breakout. Strong inflows emerge during rising prices, but XRP has remained within the same range. The contrast between flat price action and rising ETF assets suggests persistent buying pressure that absorbs available liquidity without pushing the price higher. That dynamic often occurs when larger participants build exposure over time rather than rush into the market. XRP: Why This Accumulation is Important Institutional buyers rarely chase sudden price spikes. They prefer stable conditions. Sideways markets allow size without disruption. X Finance Bull emphasized this behavior when he wrote, “This kind of inflow during sideways price action is the footprint of capital with a plan.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETF structures reinforce this view. These investors do not react emotionally to daily price swings. When inflows continue despite weak sentiment, it shows institutional conviction. This accumulation also reduces the circulating supply. Each unit absorbed by an ETF tightens liquidity on exchanges. Over time, that constraint can amplify price moves once demand expands beyond ETF accumulation. What’s Next for XRP? Sustained ETF inflows create a base by establishing consistent demand. As total net assets rise, so does the sensitivity of the asset to incremental buying. When new demand enters, the price tends to react quickly because available supply has already thinned . X Finance Bull summarized this dynamic clearly. He stated that by the time XRP’s price starts showing positive signs, “the train is already full.” Institutions are already positioning themselves, and investors who join them early could reap the biggest rewards.

This analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based examination of Bancor Network’s market position, technological developments, and the resulting BNT token price predictions for 2026 through 2030, focusing on the critical factors that will determine its potential recovery. Bancor Network (BNT) Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Horizon Projecting the Bancor Network token price for 2026 requires a multi-faceted analysis of both internal protocol mechanics and external market forces. The Bancor protocol, a pioneer in automated market makers (AMMs), introduced impermanent loss protection, a feature that significantly influenced its initial adoption. Consequently, the BNT price prediction for 2026 hinges on several interconnected variables. Market analysts from firms like CoinShares and Delphi Digital often reference metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), protocol fee generation, and cross-chain integration progress. For instance, Bancor’s migration to its third version aimed to reduce gas costs and improve capital efficiency, directly impacting its competitive stance against rivals like Uniswap and Curve Finance. Furthermore, broader cryptocurrency market cycles, often analyzed through Bitcoin’s halving events and macroeconomic liquidity conditions, will exert considerable influence. A bullish macro environment for decentralized exchanges could see BNT capitalize on renewed DeFi interest, while a bearish trend might pressure its recovery timeline. The Role of Protocol Upgrades and Market Share Bancor’s development roadmap provides concrete data points for price analysis. The successful implementation and adoption of Bancor 3 features, such as Omnipool architecture and superfluid staking, are quantifiable milestones. According to on-chain data aggregators like Dune Analytics, an increase in unique liquidity providers and sustained TVL growth following these upgrades would signal strong fundamentals. Conversely, stagnation in these metrics amidst fierce competition would present headwinds. Historical price action shows BNT often correlates with Ethereum’s performance and overall DeFi sentiment, but its unique value proposition in single-sided liquidity provision creates a distinct demand driver. Long-Term Forecast: BNT Price Trajectory from 2027 to 2030 Extending the BNT token price prediction to the 2027-2030 window involves assessing longer-term technological and regulatory trends. The maturation of layer-2 scaling solutions and the potential mainstreaming of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) present both challenges and opportunities for Bancor Network. A sustained recovery through 2030 would likely necessitate Bancor capturing a defined niche within the multi-trillion-dollar future digital asset market. Experts point to several potential scenarios based on adoption rates. Baseline Adoption Scenario: Assumes moderate growth in DeFi TVL and Bancor maintaining its current market share among AMMs. Price models in this scenario often reference gradual, linear growth tied to general crypto market expansion. Accelerated Integration Scenario: Projects Bancor becoming a preferred liquidity layer for major institutional DeFi products or new asset classes, leading to exponential demand for BNT tokens for governance and fee capture. Regulatory Impact Scenario: Considers the effects of clear global DeFi regulations, which could either legitimize and boost protocols with robust compliance features or restrict operations, impacting all projections. Financial modeling from entities like Bloomberg Intelligence often incorporates discounted cash flow analyses on protocol fees, though this remains a nascent methodology for governance tokens. Comparative Market Analysis and Valuation Benchmarks A factual BNT price prediction must include comparative analysis. The table below outlines key metrics (as of illustrative 2025 data) for Bancor against two primary competitors, providing context for its valuation and recovery potential. Metric Bancor (BNT) Uniswap (UNI) Curve (CRV) Market Cap Rank Outside Top 100 Top 30 Top 70 30-Day Avg. Fees $X Million $Y Million $Z Million Core Value Prop Impermanent Loss Protection Largest Liquidity, Brand Stablecoin & Pegged Asset Efficiency For BNT to achieve a significant recovery, it must demonstrate superior growth in fee generation or TVL relative to these established players, justifying a higher valuation multiple. Will BNT Recover? Assessing the Fundamental Drivers The central question of a BNT recovery is not purely speculative but grounded in observable on-chain and economic activity. Recovery implies a sustained price increase supported by network utility, not short-term market volatility. The primary fundamental drivers include: First, protocol utility and demand : The BNT token is integral to the network’s operation, used for governance, staking, and as a counterparty asset in pools. An increase in protocol usage directly increases demand for BNT. Second, tokenomics and supply dynamics : Bancor’s mechanism involves minting and burning BNT in relation to pool activity. A net positive flow into the protocol creates buy pressure, while outflows can increase sell pressure. Third, strategic partnerships and integrations : Collaborations with other DeFi primitives, layer-2 networks, or traditional finance gateways can unlock new user bases and liquidity streams. Finally, broader crypto adoption : As digital asset ownership grows globally, the total addressable market for all DeFi services, including automated liquidity provision, expands correspondingly. Expert Perspectives and Risk Factors Industry commentators, such as researchers from Messari or The Block, frequently highlight both the innovative aspects of Bancor’s model and its execution risks. The complexity of its v3 system, while powerful, may present a barrier to entry for less technical users compared to simpler interfaces. Additionally, the protocol’s historical reliance on its own treasury to fund impermanent loss protection raised sustainability questions, though later iterations aimed to address this. Smart contract risk, though mitigated through extensive audits, remains a perennial concern in DeFi that can affect investor confidence and token price stability overnight. Conclusion In summary, constructing a reliable Bancor Network BNT token price prediction for 2026 through 2030 necessitates a disciplined focus on verifiable data: protocol upgrade adoption rates, competitive market share shifts, fee generation metrics, and overarching cryptocurrency market cycles. While past performance shows significant volatility, the potential for BNT recovery is intrinsically linked to the network’s ability to leverage its unique impermanent loss protection to capture a growing segment of the liquidity provider market. Investors and observers should monitor on-chain metrics and development progress rather than short-term price fluctuations to gauge the long-term viability of this pioneering DeFi project. FAQs Q1: What is the primary use case of the BNT token within the Bancor Network? The BNT token serves multiple functions: it acts as the primary governance token for protocol upgrades, serves as a counterparty asset in all liquidity pools enabling single-sided deposits, and is used for staking to earn trading fees and rewards. Q2: How does Bancor’s impermanent loss protection work, and does it affect BNT price? The protection mechanism uses protocol-owned liquidity to reimburse liquidity providers for impermanent loss. This feature is funded through protocol fees and emissions, creating a direct economic link between its usage, sustainability, and demand for BNT to fund the system. Q3: What are the biggest competitive challenges facing Bancor and BNT? Bancor faces intense competition from larger, more established AMMs like Uniswap and Curve, which have greater liquidity, brand recognition, and in some cases, simpler user experiences. Capturing market share requires clear differentiation and superior capital efficiency. Q4: How do broader cryptocurrency market conditions impact BNT price predictions? BNT exhibits a high correlation with the overall health of the DeFi sector and, by extension, the wider crypto market. Bull markets typically increase trading volume and TVL across all protocols, benefiting BNT, while bear markets reduce activity and put downward pressure on its price. Q5: What key metrics should someone watch to assess BNT’s recovery potential? Critical metrics include Total Value Locked (TVL) trend, protocol-generated fee revenue, the number of active liquidity pools and providers, the net mint/burn rate of BNT tokens, and development activity on its GitHub repository.

By deepening strategic ties with top-tier institutional liquidity partners, the enhanced RPI ecosystem now delivers market-leading depth that significantly outperforms industry benchmarks. Latest data from a comprehensive market audit conducted in late 2025 reveals that the RPI upgrade has triggered a massive surge in liquidity across Phemex's core assets. Based on internal comparative research of public order book depth (±0.1% from mid-price) relative to top-tier exchange averages: BTCUSDT: Liquidity depth is now 2x the standard industry benchmark. ETHUSDT: Liquidity has reached a staggering 5x the average market liquidity. SOLUSDT: Liquidity has climbed to 5.5x compared to high-performance market standards. Top 12 Trading Pairs: Aggregate liquidity consistently tracks at 3x the baseline of top-tier exchange requirements. RPI orders are specifically engineered as Maker orders for retail customers (non-API manual traders). This upgrade ensures a much denser order book and more aggressive pricing, narrowing spreads and providing ""price improvement"" that often exceeds the visible order book. By ensuring that RPI orders interact exclusively with the retail maker liquidity — effectively bypassing high-frequency API algorithms — Phemex's upgraded RPI has allowed the platform to maintain a competitive edge in liquidity across more than 210 trading pairs.

According to CoinPost the blueprint explores classifying crypto assets alongside traditional financial products such as stocks and investment funds. As part of this approach, policymakers are also considering the introduction of separate taxation for certain types of crypto-related income, aligning the sector more closely with Japan’s established capital markets framework. Separate Taxation Under Consideration — Not for All Crypto Income A key focus of the reform is the possible application of separate taxation to gains from spot crypto trading, derivatives transactions, and crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If implemented, this would mark a major departure from Japan’s current system where most crypto income is treated as miscellaneous income and subject to progressive tax rates. The blueprint stops short of applying separate taxation across the board. CoinPost notes that staking and lending rewards which generate income through holding crypto rather than price appreciation are not explicitly covered in the proposal. These forms of income may continue to fall under general taxation rules, depending on how future legislation defines income categories. Loss Carryforward and Limits to Offsetting Another notable factor is the proposal is to allow loss carryforwards for up to three years on qualifying crypto transactions. This would bring crypto taxation closer to the treatment of stocks and FX trading in Japan where investors can offset future gains with past losses. The reform does not suggest broad cross-asset loss offsetting. Even if crypto gains become subject to separate taxation, losses from crypto trading are unlikely to be offset against profits from equities or other asset classes. Income categories are expected to remain strictly separated. NFTs and Scope of Eligible Assets Remain Unclear The blueprint does not explicitly address non-fungible tokens (NFTs), indicating that NFT-related income may continue to be taxed under the general system. The reform refers to transactions involving “specified crypto assets,” implying that only assets handled by registered operators under Japan’s financial regulatory framework may qualify for the new tax treatment.

The event, however, was not a market-wide collapse but a fleeting liquidity vacuum on an obscure trading venue that was quickly corrected by automated bots. Anatomy of a Flash Wick The reported “crash” occurred exclusively on Binance’s BTC/USD1 pair, a market with minimal trading activity. As analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera explained , “The ‘crash’ existed on ONE order book. Not Bitcoin. Not the market. One pair.” He pointed out that data had confirmed that the primary BTC/USDT pair, where the vast majority of volume trades, never moved below $86,400 during the incident. According to him, the entire price dislocation lasted approximately three seconds before arbitrage algorithms bought the cheap BTC, restoring the price to around $87,000. The market observer also noted that the pattern was not new, with a similar wick from $96,000 to $76,000 happening on the same USD1 pair on December 10. Perera directly linked the instability to a Binance promotional campaign. “Binance launched a 20% APY promotion on USD1 deposits 24 hours before this happened,” he noted. This incentive, he said, caused a rush of traders to swap their USDT for the USD1 stablecoin to earn yield, which drained sell-side liquidity from the BTC/USD1 order book. When a single large market sell order was placed, it hit an empty book, causing the price to plummet until it found a bid. The account Master of Crypto also summarized it plainly: “That single trade wiped the order book and pushed price down for seconds… Just a liquidity event, not a crash.” Broader Market Context and Lingering Jitters This micro-event unfolded against a backdrop of broader market uncertainty, with Bitcoin’s price action choppy and repeatedly rejected near the $90,000 level. At the time of writing, the asset was trading around $88,500, showing modest daily gains but struggling for a clear directional break. Furthermore, the severe market crash on October 10, which saw Bitcoin lose over $12,000 in a single day, has left the crypto community psychologically scarred. As one expert recently stated , “October 10 broke something psychologically,” creating a lasting caution that makes the market sensitive to any sign of trouble, even illusory ones. The Christmas Day wick serves as a case study in how promotional activity can create predictable risks in illiquid markets and how sensational but incomplete information spreads fast. For traders, it highlighted the danger of new, thinly traded pairs, and for the wider market, it was a brief distraction from Bitcoin’s ongoing struggle to build momentum and shake off the lingering effects of a turbulent fourth quarter.

The upcoming 2024 U.S. midterm elections will serve as a major, real-world test to validate the sector’s core premise and multi-billion dollar valuations. This event will critically assess whether these platforms function as reliable collective intelligence tools or remain speculative novelties. Prediction Markets Approach a Defining Moment The prediction market sector has experienced explosive growth and institutional interest throughout 2023 and 2024. Leading platforms have achieved staggering valuations, signaling strong investor confidence. For instance, Polymarket reached a valuation of approximately $9 billion. Similarly, Kalshi attained an $11 billion valuation. These figures underscore the substantial financial stakes now involved in this emerging industry. Consequently, the midterms present more than a political event. They represent a pivotal case study. Analysts from publications like The Block suggest the elections could be a turning point. The performance of these markets will either solidify their credibility or expose fundamental flaws. This test comes at a critical juncture for regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. The Core Value: Data Infrastructure, Not Gambling Industry proponents consistently argue that the true value of prediction markets extends far beyond simple betting. Leo Chan, co-founder of Sportstensor, emphasizes this perspective. He states the core value lies in their function as a collective intelligence data infrastructure. This framework aggregates dispersed information and opinions from a vast participant pool. Many financial institutions and data firms now share this view. They increasingly see these platforms as sophisticated data collection mechanisms. The markets generate a continuous, quantified signal about the probability of future events. This signal can inform decisions in finance, policy analysis, and risk management. The midterms will test the accuracy and utility of this signal against a highly scrutinized, binary outcome. Expert Analysis on Market Mechanics and Impact The theory behind prediction markets relies on the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ principle. When many individuals trade contracts on an event’s outcome, the market price should reflect the aggregated knowledge and beliefs of all participants. This process creates a dynamic forecast. Experts note that for this to work effectively, markets need high liquidity, diverse participation, and clear event resolution. The 2024 elections provide an ideal testing ground due to their national scale, clear timelines, and definitive results. A successful forecast could demonstrate tangible utility for: Journalists and Pollsters: Offering a real-time supplement to traditional polling. Policy Analysts: Gauging the perceived likelihood of legislative changes. Business Strategists: Assessing political risk for long-term investments. Conversely, a significant failure could attract regulatory scrutiny and dampen institutional interest. The performance will be measured not just by picking a winner, but by how precisely the market probabilities track with the evolving race and final result. Comparing Traditional and Modern Forecasting Tools To understand the potential shift, it’s useful to contrast prediction markets with established methods. The table below outlines key differences: Forecasting Method Primary Mechanism Key Strength Notable Weakness Traditional Opinion Polling Statistical sampling of voter intent Demographic depth and historical data Slow, costly, and subject to response biases Expert Punditry Qualitative analysis by specialists Contextual and narrative insight Often subjective and inconsistent Prediction Markets Financial incentives for accurate bets Real-time, incentive-aligned aggregation Requires liquidity; vulnerable to manipulation This comparison highlights the unique proposition of prediction markets. They incentivize participants to research and bet accurately, creating a dynamic price. The midterms will test if this price proves more reliable than polls or pundits, especially in forecasting close races and turnout dynamics. The Regulatory and Mainstream Adoption Landscape The path forward for prediction markets remains intertwined with regulatory frameworks. In the United States, platforms operate in a complex legal environment. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees certain markets, while others rely on regulatory exemptions or operate on blockchain technology to navigate rules. A strong performance during the midterms could build a compelling case for clearer, more supportive regulations. Furthermore, success could accelerate integration into mainstream financial and media ecosystems. Data feeds from prediction markets might become a standard component on financial news networks. Hedge funds could formally incorporate market probabilities into quantitative models. This integration represents the ultimate goal for many in the industry: to be viewed as essential financial infrastructure. Conclusion The 2024 U.S. midterm elections represent a watershed moment for prediction markets. This real-world event will rigorously test their foundational claim of harnessing collective intelligence. A successful demonstration of accuracy and utility could validate their multi-billion dollar valuations and catalyze broader adoption as serious data infrastructure. Conversely, a high-profile failure may prompt a sector-wide reevaluation. All eyes will now be on these platforms as the election cycle intensifies, making the midterms the most crucial test yet for the entire prediction market sector. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a prediction market? A prediction market is a speculative exchange where participants trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. The trading price represents the market’s collective belief about the probability of that outcome occurring. Q2: Why are the 2024 midterms so important for these markets? The midterms are a high-profile, nationally scrutinized event with clear outcomes. They provide a perfect, large-scale test case to measure the accuracy and reliability of prediction markets against traditional forecasting methods. Q3: How do prediction markets differ from sports betting or gambling? While structurally similar, proponents argue the primary purpose is different. The goal is to aggregate information and create a forecast (data), not purely to wager money. Many users are motivated by a desire to be correct and inform the market price. Q4: What are Polymarket and Kalshi? Polymarket and Kalshi are two leading prediction market platforms. Polymarket is a blockchain-based platform focusing on global events, while Kalshi is a U.S.-regulated exchange allowing trading on economic and political events. Q5: Could prediction markets influence the elections they are trying to predict? This is a topic of debate. Some theorists worry a market forecast could influence voter or donor behavior (a bandwagon or underdog effect). Most platforms have small trading volumes relative to the electorate, making significant influence unlikely, but it remains a consideration for researchers.

Technical indicators for both BTC and RIOT signal bearish momentum, with RIOT's head & shoulders pattern and weak RSI/MACD suggesting a move to single-digit share prices. RIOT's cost to mine, including depreciation, is $89k per BTC, exposing the company to material net losses if BTC remains below this level in 2026. Despite potential long-term upside from the Corsicana facility, near-term CapEx and premium valuation heighten downside risk; selling is advised until cycle lows are reached. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is facing some serious fundamental and technical risks for 2026. My theory is that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is repeating its crypto winter or bear market, which occurs every four years. The last two price cycles were consistent, lasting exactly 1,050 days from the price bottom to the price peak . My theory is that this price cycle already peaked in October 2025, which would have marked the same length of time from the price bottom from the end of 2022. Bitcoin's bear markets tend to last about one year from the peak price. Since Riot's stock price action is highly correlated to bitcoin's, the stock is likely to experience a significant drop. Riot's stock tends to decline over 95% during the bitcoin bear markets. So, it is not worth owning Riot during the bear markets. I don't know if Riot will drop that drastically this time, but the stock does tend to decline more than bitcoin percentage-wise during the crypto winters. Bearish Technical Set-up Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Monthly Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Bitcoin's monthly chart supports my thesis that we are already in the crypto winter for this price cycle. Bitcoin's bear markets have been confirmed when the MACD makes a bearish crossover. This occurs when the blue MACD line crosses below the red signal line and the histogram bars turn red. The bearish crossover occurred in November as Bitcoin made a significant drop from over $100k down to about $80k before recovering. What also stands out about the price cycles is that bearish divergences formed at the peaks. A bearish divergence occurred from April 2021 to November 2021 as bitcoin's price made a higher high while the RSI made a lower high. The same thing occurred from December 2024 to October 2025. Bearish divergences like this typically result in significant reversals from what I have observed. Riot Platforms (RIOT) Weekly Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) I provided Riot's weekly chart to display the head & shoulders pattern that formed from July 2025 to November 2025. July formed the left shoulder, while November formed the right shoulder. The head of the pattern formed in October. Head & shoulder patterns tend to result in significant drops to key support levels in my observations. These support levels are in the single digits for Riot's stock. That is where I think the stock is headed in 2026. Riot's weekly chart is already bearish as the RSI moved below the 50 level. The MACD is also bearish, as the blue line crossed below the red signal line while the histogram bars turned red. I expect the stock to test the $10 to $12 area before dropping further to the $6 area in 2026. If the price breaks below $6, the stock could drop to the low single digits. Riot's stock did drop to the $3 to $4 range in the last price cycle. Of course, this time, Riot may have peaked at a much lower price than previous price cycles, so we could see a very low price at the bottom of this bear market. Riot's Fundamental Issues While I believe that bitcoin's price action will have the biggest impact on Riot's stock in 2026, the company also has some fundamental issues that could derail the stock. The main fundamental issue for Riot has been the struggle to maintain and grow profitability. I do acknowledge that Riot benefitted from Bitcoin's higher prices in 2025. The company's cost to mine bitcoin , excluding depreciation, was $46,324 in Q3 2025. However, the cost to mine when bitcoin miner depreciation is included was about $89,000. Riot is at risk of significant net losses as the price of Bitcoin dropped to $87,000. My opinion is that the price of Bitcoin will continue to decline in 2026 as part of its cycle's bear market or crypto winter. The price of Bitcoin has historically dropped about 80% during the year-long bear markets. A similar drop this cycle could take the price down to $25,200 from the high of $126,000 in this bear market. It may not drop that far, but the possibility is there. If the price of Bitcoin does decline in 2026 and remains lower than Riot's $89k cost to mine, it would likely cause Riot to experience a net loss for the year. Margins are likely to be significantly narrowed if this occurs. Analysts estimate that Riot will have an EPS loss of -$0.52 for 2026 . This would be an over 4x higher loss than the expected EPS loss of -$0.12 for 2025. Such a large increase in net losses is likely to drive the stock lower in 2026. Riot has been developing its Corsicana facility over the past few years. When Corsicana is completed, it is expected to generate 1 gigawatt ((GW)) of bitcoin mining and data center hosting power. However, Riot currently only has 400 megawatts online for bitcoin mining operations. This leaves 600 megawatts left to be built out and utilized. Riot plans on using the remaining capacity for critical IT infrastructure. This is likely to be used for AI and high-performance computing applications. It may take a few years to get the remaining 600 megawatts up and running. This means that the cash flow from the 400 megawatts may not compensate for the unused portion of Corsicana in the short term, especially in 2026. Construction of the two Core and Shell buildings for the data center portion of Corsicana is expected to begin in Q1 2026 and is not expected to be completed until 2027. Riot will be incurring CapEx of $214 million within the next 18 months for these 2 buildings. While I think that Corsicana can be a positive driver of long-term growth for Riot, I think it will hurt margins in 2026 due to the high costs associated with it. The high costs may put negative pressure on the stock in 2026. Valuation Since Riot Platforms is not yet sustainably profitable, I used the price/sales ratio for the valuation. Riot is trading with a forward price/sales of 7.8x . This is more than 2x higher than the sector median price/sales of 3.4x. Riot is expected to earn $757 million in revenue in 2026, according to consensus estimates. This would be 14% higher than the $663 million in revenue that analysts expected Riot to earn in 2025. That's not bad revenue growth. However, if Bitcoin's price continues to decline in 2026 as part of a bear market, the revenue estimate could be lowered. Plus, the expected net loss could be worse than expected. Since Riot is trading at a premium valuation as compared to the sector median, I think the stock is poised to drop further. The valuation is likely to be reset as it typically does during bitcoin bear markets. Data by YCharts We can see in the chart above that Riot's forward price/sales ratio dropped to about two at the price bottom of the last bitcoin bear market back in early 2023. It looks like the forward price/sales is trending further down as the bitcoin bear market continues. It is likely that it will continue to drop to the low single digits in 2026 if this bear market is similar to the previous one. Risks to the Thesis My thesis that Bitcoin will have a bear market that is similar to the previous price cycles might turn out to be different this time. Some analysts believe that this time is different because more institutional investments into Bitcoin will lead to an avoidance of the bear markets of the past. Higher demand from large investors could provide better support for bitcoin's price. However, people were saying something similar back in 2021, but a year-long bear market occurred anyway. It is also possible that Riot performs better than I expect if the price of Bitcoin remains above the $89k cost to mine for most of 2026. Riot could beat analysts' expectations, driving the stock higher. The Bottom Line If you believe that Bitcoin and Riot will experience a year-long bear market that is similar to previous price cycles, selling your shares will probably be a wise decision. Riot's stock price tends to drop significantly during the bitcoin bear markets. Bitcoin and Riot may bottom approximately in September 2026 if this price cycle is similar to previous cycles. At that point, we can evaluate if buying back in would be a good idea.",RIOT|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-26 13:59:20

However, this persistent downward trend has not entirely crushed the sentiment of investors, especially whale holders. Large Holders Of XRP Are Stepping Back In XRP has been in a downward trend for the past few weeks due to a market drawdown in October. After several weeks of subdued price performance and failed upward attempts, key investors are beginning to exhibit positive sentiment towards the leading altcoin. As observed in the report from Steph is Crypto, a market expert and trader, large investors, also known as whale holders, are making their presence felt once again. Despite the ongoing bearish action of the XRP’s price, there is a steady resurgence in accumulation among the cohort. While this shift signals growing confidence of deep-pocket investors, it also suggests that they are likely repositioning themselves in anticipation of a broader market move upward. When whale investors start to buy again, it often precedes upward spikes, which raises the question of whether the accumulation could serve as the foundation for the altcoin’s next major direction. According to the expert, the renewed buying pressure is triggered by large investors holding between 100 million XRP and 1 billion XRP. After days of significant adoption from the group, the total number of coins held by them grew from 8.11 billion to 8.23 billion XRP, valued at approximately $150 million. A similar resurgence in sentiment and investor activity is also observed among those holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP. Data from the chart shows that these investors now hold about 10.90 billion compared to the 10.88 billion a few days ago. Despite large investors buying again, Steph is Crypto believes that the renewed accumulation is more of a cautious move than a bullish move. However, should the trend continue over the following days or weeks, the altcoin may attract enough momentum for an upward move. Nearly Half Of The Supply In Loss With XRP’s price declining and trading below the $2 mark, a lot of coins are starting to show major losses. According to on-chain data, the profitability of holders has sharply declined amid the ongoing bearish phase. In a previous post , Steph is Crypto highlighted that nearly 50% of the altcoin’s total supply is now underwater, suggesting a shift in attitude where patience and selectivity are replacing optimism. The chart shared by the expert shows that the share of XRP supply currently in profit has dropped to 52% following weeks of consistent declines. While nearly half of the total supply held by investors is sitting at a loss, this development increases the risk of panic-driven selling pressure during periods of weakness, as seen in the past. However, this cooling in profitability often marks a pivotal phase, as it could still act as a trigger for a notable rally in the upcoming days or weeks. According to the expert, the last time profitability dropped to this level was in November 2024, just before a major upside expansion.",XRP|Altcoin|ripple|Steph is Crypto|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Whales|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 14:00:17

The market is now grappling with significant net outflows, as data confirms that investment flows have turned decisively negative. This shift represents a stark turnaround in market dynamics, where selling pressure is currently overwhelming buying interest across major platforms. Why Markets Move Before Narratives Catch Up In an X post, a trader and investor in stocks and crypto, WealthManager, revealed that since December 8th, Bitcoin has recorded approximately $716 million in net outflows. Over the past two weeks, flows have been dominated almost entirely by outflows, reflecting a market that has lost momentum rather than conviction. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Crash Incoming? Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses Currently, the cryptocurrency market is not the preferred destination for momentum-driven capital. That momentum has rotated into gold, silver, and broader metals, but the rotations are temporary by nature. However, the opportunity remains in crypto, and the momentum will shift back into the sector at some point. “The lower BTC goes, the bigger the opportunity would become,” WealthManager noted. Analyst Cipher2X has offered an insight into why he is accumulating Bitcoin ahead of 2026. According to Cipher2X, BTC has never waited for perfect conditions to do its most important work. It builds its foundations when liquidity is tight and expectations are low. At this stage, price action is misleading, but the structure is not. On-chain data has shown that supply is increasingly locked up with long-term holders, while access to BTC through regulated channels is becoming routine rather than exceptional. At the same time, micro uncertainty continues to reinforce BTC’s role as a hedge against policy risk, not as a speculative bet on growth. This setup is the kind of environment where BTC intends to move sideways, frustrate the traders, and quietly shift ownership from impatient hands to committed ones. Cipher2X explains that the purpose of accumulating BTC isn’t a short-term catalyst, but because the next regime tends to reward those who have positioned early, not those who have reacted late. 2026 isn’t about the hype; it’s about who was already holding the asset. What Falling Volatility Says About Bitcoin’s Maturity The Bitcoin chart has shown the implied volatility on the BTC options over the past few years. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, pointed out that aside from a few short spikes of volatility, there’s a clear trend down on this part. BTC is maturing as its market cap is growing over time, and the market is becoming more institutionalized.

He noted that the asset is “quietly pulling nine figures in fresh inflows, consistently, and with conviction.” He also stated that XRP ETFs have attracted over $1.1 billion since launch. This occurred while volatility dominated broader crypto markets. He stressed that this behavior did not reflect retail speculation. He positioned ETF flows as deliberate capital deployment tied to infrastructure rather than short-term price swings. ETF Inflows in Late 2025 He attached a video showing XRP ETFs posting positive net inflows in both November and December 2025. XRP has now recorded over 30 consecutive days of net inflows . Bitcoin and Ethereum tell a different story. Their ETFs posted net outflows across the same months. Red bars dominate their flow charts during periods when XRP shows steady green inflows. Bitcoin ETFs lost $3.48 billion in November and $629.05 million in December. ETH ETFs lost $1.42 billion in November and $511.56 million in December.

We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Impact on XRP’s Price ETF inflows increase demand without forcing immediate price spikes. Authorized participants must source XRP to back ETF shares. That process tightens the available supply over time. Sustained inflows also reduce reliance on speculative volume. Institutional capital tends to move early. It positions before narratives change. XRP showing positive inflows while BTC and ETH bleed capital suggests institutional preference. If inflows continue, price discovery can follow quickly. XRP ETFs have seen a much better reception than other top assets . If this trend continues, XRP could dominate institutional financial circles in 2026. The data reinforces that belief, and while its price may lag today, inflows suggest preparation for 2026 and beyond.

Kulechov has also denied allegations that he influenced the outcome despite his flagged on-chain moves just before the voting ended. What did Kulechov say about the recent Aave DAO vote? According to Kulechov, the recent DAO vote raised important questions about the relationship between Aave Labs and $AAVE token holders, calling it a “productive discussion that’s essential for the long-term health of Aave.” He acknowledged that the voting was hectic and that there was “debate and disagreement,” but he brushed them off as features of decentralized governance. “I want to state clearly,” he wrote . “I am committed to making the economic alignment between Aave Labs and $AAVE token holders more clear. We haven’t done a great job explaining this and will do so going forward.” He went on to talk about how the DAO has earned $140M this year, more than the past three years combined. Kulechov also reminded that $AAVE token holders have control over the treasury, a fact that got lost amid the chaos. “In the future, we’ll be more explicit about how products built by Aave Labs create value for the DAO and $AAVE token holders,” he wrote before going on to address his recent $15 million purchase of $AAVE. “These tokens were not used to vote on the recent proposal and that was never my intention,” Kulechov claimed. “This is my life’s work, and I am putting my own capital behind my conviction.” The statement implies that his purchase was just him supporting the Aave ecosystem as a whole. However, critics on X as well as community members of his ecosystem are unconvinced. The skepticism is mainly due to the timing to the purchase, which happened during a period when the DAO and Aave Labs were locked in a voting war. On Wednesday, Robert Mullins, a decentralized finance (DeFi) strategist and liquidity specialist, argued that the purchase was made to increase Kulechov’s “voting power in anticipation to vote for a proposal directly against the token holders best interests.” He called it a “clear example of tokens not being equipped to adequately disincentivize governance attacks.” His sentiments were echoed by prominent crypto user Sisyphus, who claimed that Kulechov might have sold “millions of dollars” worth of Aave tokens between 2021 and 2025, questioning the economic rationale behind the move. Why Aave DAO and Aave Labs disagree The proposal that started what many are now calling a civil war within the Aave ecosystem surfaced mid-December and sought to transfer control of critical Aave brand assets, including the aave.com domain, social media handles, trademarks, GitHub repositories, and naming rights, from Aave Labs to Aave DAO and token holders. It was authored by former Aave Labs CTO Ernesto Boado, who argued it would better align incentives with token holders, who currently bear the economic risk, and prevent potential overreach by the Labs entity. However, backlash followed after the proposal was escalated to a snapshot vote despite ongoing debate. Several stakeholders voiced their displeasure, and Boado, the proposal’s author, admitted the vote escalated without his consent, breaking community trust. The vote, touted as a temperature check, ultimately ended in a win for Aave Labs, with 55% of participants voting no, while a mere 3.5% voted yes and 41% chose to abstain. Whether or not this outcome reflects the true desire of the participants is debatable since, as Samuel McCulloch of USD.ai pointed out, voting power is concentrated in the hands of a small group of large holders. Snapshot data from the Aave DAO reportedly shows that the top three voters alone control more than 58% of the entire vote, with the top voter holding 27.06% of the voting power, while the second-largest voter, aci.eth, controls 18.53%.

Bitcoin Options Expiry Removes Structural Price Cap According to analysis from Negentropic, an influential market intelligence account managed by Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, the cryptocurrency derivatives market experienced its most significant monthly expiration event of 2025. Consequently, this massive expiry eliminated what analysts describe as a “structural price cap” that had artificially constrained Bitcoin’s upward momentum through sophisticated hedging mechanisms. Market participants had previously observed repeated rally attempts consistently thwarted by derivative-related flows. Therefore, the resolution of this derivatives overhang represents a fundamental change in market structure. Derivatives markets, particularly options, create complex hedging requirements for institutional participants. Market makers and large traders typically hedge their options exposure through spot market transactions. This hedging activity generates consistent selling pressure during price rallies and buying support during declines. The $23.6 billion expiration, representing one of the largest quarterly expiry events in cryptocurrency history, effectively unwound these positions. As a result, Bitcoin’s price discovery mechanism can now function more organically. Understanding Derivatives Market Mechanics Options contracts give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a specific date. In cryptocurrency markets, these instruments have grown exponentially since 2020. Major exchanges like Deribit, CME, and Binance facilitate billions in daily options trading. The hedging of these positions creates what analysts term “structural flows” that can dominate short-term price action. Specifically, when many call options exist at certain price levels, market makers selling those options must hedge by buying spot Bitcoin as prices approach those levels. Conversely, they sell spot Bitcoin as prices move away from those levels. The recent expiry event was particularly significant because it concentrated at key strike prices that had acted as magnets for Bitcoin’s price. According to exchange data, the largest open interest existed at the $70,000 and $75,000 strike prices for Bitcoin calls. This concentration created what Negentropic’s analysis described as a “structural price cap” around these levels. Every approach toward these prices triggered substantial hedging-related selling from market makers protecting their short call positions. Following the expiry, this mechanical selling pressure has dissipated. Historical Context and Market Evolution Cryptocurrency derivatives markets have evolved dramatically since Bitcoin’s inception. Initially, traders relied almost exclusively on spot markets. However, the introduction of futures contracts in 2017 and options in 2019 created sophisticated hedging instruments. Consequently, derivative market influence on spot prices has increased substantially. Historical data shows that large quarterly expiries often precede significant volatility and trend changes. For instance, the December 2023 quarterly expiry preceded Bitcoin’s breakout above $45,000. Similarly, the March 2022 expiry coincided with the beginning of a prolonged bear market. Glassnode’s data indicates that open interest in Bitcoin options reached approximately $18.5 billion before the recent expiry, while Ethereum options approached $5.1 billion. This combined $23.6 billion represented nearly 30% of the total cryptocurrency derivatives market. The scale of this expiry distinguishes it from regular weekly or monthly expiries. Market analysts emphasize that such large expiries effectively “reset” the derivatives market, allowing new positions to form without the overhang of previous hedging requirements. Current Market Conditions and Support Levels Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin continues demonstrating remarkable resilience. The digital asset maintains position above crucial support levels identified by technical analysts. Specifically, the $65,000 level has acted as strong support throughout March 2025. Additionally, the 50-day moving average around $63,500 provides further technical support. Market data reveals sustained buying pressure from long-term holders and institutional investors even during corrections. On-chain metrics show accumulation patterns among addresses holding more than 100 BTC, suggesting confidence among sophisticated participants. The removal of derivatives overhang coincides with several positive fundamental developments. Firstly, Bitcoin exchange reserves continue declining, indicating reduced selling pressure from exchanges. Secondly, the hash rate maintains record highs, signaling robust network security. Thirdly, adoption metrics show increasing institutional participation through regulated products. These factors combine to create what analysts describe as a “fundamentally sound” environment for Bitcoin’s next price discovery phase. Expert Analysis and Market Implications Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, through their Negentropic analysis, bring substantial expertise to derivatives market interpretation. As Glassnode co-founders, they possess unparalleled access to on-chain data and derivatives market metrics. Their analysis emphasizes that derivative market structure often creates temporary distortions in price discovery. However, these distortions typically resolve following major expiry events. The current situation presents what they term a “normalization opportunity” where Bitcoin’s price can better reflect underlying supply and demand fundamentals. Other market analysts echo this perspective. Derivatives researchers at major trading firms note that the “gamma” exposure from options had created unusually high sensitivity to price movements. Gamma represents the rate of change in an option’s delta relative to price changes in the underlying asset. High gamma environments often produce choppy, range-bound trading as market makers constantly adjust hedges. The expiry has significantly reduced overall gamma exposure, potentially allowing for cleaner trend development. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Markets Bitcoin’s derivatives market evolution parallels developments in traditional finance. Equity options markets experienced similar growing pains during their expansion in the 1980s and 1990s. Initially, options expiration created substantial volatility in underlying stocks. However, as markets matured and participants gained experience, these effects diminished. Cryptocurrency markets appear to be following a similar maturation path. The increasing institutional participation in Bitcoin derivatives suggests growing sophistication in risk management practices. Notably, Bitcoin’s options market now represents a significant percentage of its total market capitalization. This ratio exceeds that of most traditional assets, indicating the cryptocurrency’s unique characteristics. Bitcoin’s volatility and 24/7 trading create different dynamics than traditional markets. However, the basic principles of derivatives pricing and hedging remain consistent across asset classes. The current normalization process may represent an important step in Bitcoin’s integration with global financial markets. Conclusion The $23.6 billion Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency markets in 2025. By removing the structural price cap created by hedging flows, this event enables genuine price discovery based on supply and demand fundamentals. Bitcoin’s demonstrated resilience above key support levels, combined with positive on-chain metrics, creates favorable conditions for normalized price action. As derivative market influence diminishes temporarily, market participants can focus on underlying adoption trends and macroeconomic factors. Consequently, the coming weeks may reveal Bitcoin’s true market valuation without artificial constraints from derivatives positioning. FAQs Q1: What exactly happened with Bitcoin options on March 21, 2025? Approximately $23.6 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options contracts expired, representing one of the largest quarterly expiry events in cryptocurrency history. This removed significant hedging-related flows that had been constraining price movement. Q2: How do options expiries affect Bitcoin’s price? Options expiries eliminate the hedging requirements associated with those contracts. Market makers who sold options no longer need to buy or sell spot Bitcoin to hedge their positions, allowing price to move more naturally according to supply and demand. Q3: Who provided the analysis about this market development? The analysis comes from Negentropic, an X account managed by Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann. Glassnode is a leading blockchain data and intelligence platform with extensive derivatives market expertise. Q4: What is a “structural price cap” in derivatives markets? A structural price cap occurs when concentrated options positions at certain price levels create consistent selling pressure through hedging activity. As price approaches these levels, market makers sell spot assets to hedge their short options positions, preventing further upward movement. Q5: Will Bitcoin’s price become more volatile after this expiry? While expiries often precede increased volatility initially, analysts suggest the removal of hedging flows may actually reduce artificial volatility caused by constant position adjustments. Price may become more responsive to fundamental factors rather than derivatives mechanics. Q6: How does this development affect long-term Bitcoin investors? Long-term investors may benefit from more accurate price discovery that better reflects adoption fundamentals rather than temporary derivatives market structure. The removal of artificial constraints could allow Bitcoin’s price to better represent its underlying value proposition.

Early Investors Point to This $0.035 Altcoin for 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-cryptocurrency-to-surge-1000-early-investors-point-to-this-0-035-altcoin-for-2026/,"The largest shifts within the crypto do not often begin with the headline. They start with timing. A project starts aligning its product, its user base and dynamic in its supply long before the rest of the market is paying any attention to this. And that is the stage most of the initial investors think we are entering at the moment. In the year 2026, a single altcoin at $0.035 of price is a whimpering competition that is being negotiated as a long-term candidate. What is becoming clear is not due to noise, but the pieces are beginning to fall together. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi crypto that is centered on decentralized lending and borrowing. The protocol is developing to be based on two but collaborating markets. In the peer to contract market, the users deposit assets in common liquidity pools. They in turn are awarded with mtTokens which symbolize their standing. These mtTokens will increase in value as time goes by due to interest accruing. As an example, a user who deposits the value of $5,000 in ETH in a pool with a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) would see his/her mtTokens gain value continuously without any direct intervention. This renders earning yield an easy and predictable task. This is in addition to the peer to peer market. In this case, lenders issue loans directly upon security of their assets, at specified terms. Market conditions vary the borrow rates and loan to value allowance is determined depending on the asset risk. In case collateral value declines excessive, liquidations are made to ensure the safeguard of liquidity and maintain the liquidity of the system. This is a structure that enables risky borrowing. Growth and Investors The involvement has increased with the development. Mutuum Finance has already gathered $19.45M and is already counted by 18,650 holders. This amount of participation is important as it reveals the demand has been distributed on a broader base and not focused interest. On X, it is reported that V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol will go to the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. It consists of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot, featuring the initial assets of ETH and USDT. To analysts who follow the trend of crypto investment, a working version is frequently a landmark to spot around the time of its actual launch. It transforms a project into implementation. Value Progression The present price of MUTM token is $0.035 and the project is in presale Phase 6 which is almost over. The total MUTM supply is limited to 4B tokens. Out of this, 45.5% of this is set to the presale and this amounts to 1.82B tokens. Up to now, 825M tokens are already sold. Since the beginning, there has been evident progression in the token. At stage 1, participants were introduced at $0.01. That is a 250% improvement at the current price. On an initial launch price of $0.06 of those first participants, MUTM is 500% growth pegged. The price increments have been made in phases. The next step is expected to increase the price of the tokens by nearly 20 %, that is why timing is a crucial issue to many early investors. It is usually risky and rewarding to get in prior to phase shifts. Other commentators view this organised advancement as more healthy than abrupt leaps of other upcoming cryptocurrency initiatives. Risk management, Audits and Security Security has been dealt with extensively. Mutuum Finance has passed a CertiK audit receiving a score of 90/100 on a token scan, which is a preliminary evaluation of the integrity of the token. Not only that, an independent audit that involves Halborn security is ongoing and the reviewed finalized lending and borrowing contracts are being examined line by line. Moreover, a 50k bug bounty is also introduced as a way of motivating the uncovering of any form of vulnerability. It has been pointed out by market commentators that such an overlapping approach is a positive indication of long-term thinking, particularly when applied to DeFi crypto protocols that handle user funds. Well-defined security systems will draw in new users once it has been launched, and this can affect adoption and eventually affect crypto prices. Growing Urgency Ahead of 2026 During the Phase 6 transition, investor urgency is increasing. A 24 hour leaderboard facilitates the activity and rewards the most active contributor with $500 in MUTM to maintain the interest levels. This has also reduced the barrier of participation considering the fact that card payments are becoming readily available hence access is easy to new users. Discussion of 1000% move must be put into perspective. No outcome is guaranteed. However, pre-investment indications show that there are a number of things that long-term growth rates are typically possessed by Mutuum Finance. A well spelled out product, increasing involvement, set supply levels and pre-launch execution. Currently, MUTM is turning into a part of the discussion of what is the potential best cryptocurrency to invest in today to realize a 2026 horizon. At $0.035, in the middle of milestones that are yet to be reached and stages moving swiftly, this altcoin is entering a phase where first mover advantage could be more important than subsequent validation.

The comment came in a public exchange that initially focused on taxes, wealth, and corporate behavior. Schwartz’s post brought the discussion back to Ripple and the mechanics of XRP distribution. Responding to an accusation that he implemented Ripple’s escrow system to pay for his career, Schwartz chose to explain how things worked before the escrow system existed. Before the escrow, Ripple could have sold as much XRP as it wanted every month. And I opposed the decision to implement the escrow precisely because I didn't see enough upside to justify giving up that flexibility. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 25, 2025 Schwartz Explains Ripple’s Pre-Escrow Position In his post, Schwartz stated, “Before the escrow, Ripple could have sold as much XRP as it wanted every month.” He followed that with a personal clarification. “I opposed the decision to implement the escrow precisely because I didn’t see enough upside to justify giving up that flexibility.” His comments confirm two key points. First, Ripple did not face a technical limit on XRP sales before escrow. Second, the escrow was not universally supported inside the company. Schwartz made clear that he valued flexibility and questioned whether locking up supply created sufficient benefits at the time. He did not claim the escrow was harmful or forced. He simply explained his position and why he disagreed with the decision when it was proposed, debunking claims that he implemented it for selfish reasons. How the XRP Escrow Works Ripple introduced the XRP escrow in 2017. The company locked 55 billion XRP into time-based smart contracts on the XRP Ledger. Each month, the company unlocks 1 billion tokens . The unused portion, approximately 600 million and 800 million tokens, is returned to escrow. This system created predictability. Markets could see the maximum possible supply that might enter circulation each month. Ripple no longer had the discretion to release unlimited XRP based on internal decisions. Schwartz’s comment confirms that this predictability came at a cost. Ripple voluntarily gave up the control it previously held.

While the escrow has its critics, it offers some advantages. It limits uncertainty around supply shocks. Experts also believe it protects XRP’s price and separates Ripple’s operational needs from short-term market conditions. Although Schwartz initially opposed the move, the system addressed long-standing concerns. Investors can now evaluate XRP with clear data on potential monthly releases. That clarity supports confidence and eliminates speculation about hidden sell-offs. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In 2031, we expect the 0G price to achieve $180. The launch of the Aristotle Mainnet in September 2025 marked a major milestone for 0G, transitioning from testnet to full production and positioning itself as a leader in the AI-crypto space. With over 100 day-one partners—including Chainlink, Google Cloud, Binance Wallet, MetaMask, and Coinbase Wallet—0G entered the market with one of the strongest ecosystems in blockchain history. Its modular design has already showcased breakthrough performance, achieving 50 GB/s throughput and processing more than 650 million transactions on testnet. Real adoption is starting with HAiO’s AI-powered iNFT music agents, while institutional support grows through Flora Growth’s $401 million treasury commitment to 0G. Combined with listings on Binance, Bitget, and HTX, plus $325 million in funding from top-tier investors, 0G crypto shows strong fundamentals that could fuel significant growth. Based on these developments, many analysts see upside potential in the 0G token price prediction for 2025 as adoption and demand accelerate.

Is 0G a good investment? Deciding whether 0G tokens are a good bet comes down to what they bring to the fast-growing AI-crypto space. They stand out as the first “deAI OS,” tackling real problems like huge data and computing needs that other blockchains haven’t solved yet. With $360 million in backing from major investors and a proven testnet history, they’ve got both funding and credibility. Key advantages include strong scalability for growth, full on-chain transparency (better than centralized AI), and easy integration for developers who want to connect AI with Web3 apps. Since the AI market is expected to grow rapidly, 0G’s low-cost storage and compute could attract many builders and boost demand for the token. On top of that, community rewards and alignment nodes give extra reasons to hold it. Of course, crypto is always risky, but if you believe in AI’s role in blockchain, 0G looks like a solid option. Why is the 0G price up today? Over the last few hours, 0G price faced strong buying pressure from buyers. As a result, short-liquidation is creating a push for 0G price. Will 0G price recover? If buyers hold the $1 level, we might see a strong recovery in the 0G price chart. Will 0G reach $100? 0G price might reach the $100 mark in 2029 if buying demand surges and 0G attracts altcoin investors with its strong AI adoption. Will 0G reach $1000? The $1000 mark is a distant dream for 0G token. This price level is achievable in the long run if 0G continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is 0G a good long-term investment? 0G token has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on 0G token The 0G Foundation has officially launched Phase 2 of its Airdrop Claims, enabling eligible users who completed KYC in either Phase 1 or Phase 2 to claim their tokens. 0G price prediction December 2025 Over the last few days, 0G prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K in December, we might see a solid surge in the 0G price.

But first, let’s rewind the clocks by a week and quickly recap what happened last week. The US CPI data came out and was much stronger than anticipated. This led to an immediate but very brief BTC surge to almost $90,000, but the subsequent rejection pushed the asset south to under $85,000. It managed to recover some ground over the weekend and even went on the offensive on Monday. For the first time in several days, bitcoin jumped past $90,400, and it looked sustainable at first. However, that was yet another failed breakout as BTC plunged to under $87,000 by Tuesday and Wednesday. It remained sluggish over Christmas Eve and Day at just under $88,000. It dipped to under $87,000 earlier this morning, but then surged to $89,500. However, it faced another rejection at this point and now sits just inches above $88,000. Consequently, BTC is still in the red year-to-date, as it entered 2025 at over $94,000. Its weekly performance is relatively stable, while its market cap reclaimed the $1.760 trillion level. Its dominance over the alts, though, is on the run as it has neared 58% on CG. The weekly charts for the altcoins are a mixed bag. ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, DOGE, and ADA are slightly in the red, while BCH, XMR, and ZEC are with minor gains. CC and UNI have marked the most significant increases.

Two monumental forces are at the heart of this convergence: the unstoppable rise of Artificial Intelligence, headlined by the hotly anticipated OpenAI IPO, and the resurgence of blockchain technology, led by Ethereum's powerful market recovery. As Ethereum regains the crucial $2900 level after trading at monthly lows, smart capital is not just celebrating its return; it's actively seeking the next layer of growth. This is where the narrative gets truly exciting. The same analytical power driving AI's dominance is being used to identify the Cryptos to Explode in 2026. And if an advanced AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT were to analyze the market for the optimal investment, its logic would invariably point toward a project that sits at the perfect intersection of these two mega-trends: the Based Eggman Presale . The OpenAI IPO: The Trillion-Dollar Tsunami The upcoming OpenAI IPO is not just another tech offering; it is a generational wealth event poised to redefine market dynamics. The speculation around its valuation speaks volumes about the sheer scale of the AI revolution. Analysts are debating whether the OpenAI valuation on November 25, 2025, will be $500 billion, $750 billion, or even a staggering $1 trillion. An OpenAI $1 Trillion IPO Valuation would instantly make it one of the most valuable companies in the world, unleashing a wave of capital and euphoria that will spill over into every adjacent high-growth sector. This ""AI spillover"" will see newly minted millionaires and institutional funds hunting for assets with venture-capital-like returns—assets that are innovative, technologically sound, and positioned for exponential growth. They will be looking for the ""AI of crypto,"" and the projects that fit this profile will be the primary beneficiaries of this capital tsunami. Why ChatGPT Predicts Based Eggman is the Best Crypto to Buy Now If we apply the cold, hard logic of an AI to the crypto market, what would it look for? It would seek a project with a strong foundation, a multi-faceted growth strategy, and a clear path to market dominance. This is why OpenAI ChatGPT Crypto Predictions, were they to be made public, would almost certainly highlight the Based Eggman Presale . Here’s the logical breakdown: Strategic Ecosystem Positioning (Ethereum and Based Eggman ): Based Eggman is built on Base, Ethereum's premier Layer-2 scaling solution developed by Coinbase. This places it directly in the path of Ethereum's growth, poised to capture the overflow of users and liquidity. Its multi-chain expansion to the Binance Smart Chain further diversifies its strength, a move an AI would recognize as superior risk management. Utility-Driven Model: Unlike thousands of purely speculative meme coins, Based Eggman has a functional ecosystem with a Play-to-Earn gaming hub and creator monetization tools. An AI prioritizes projects with tangible value and sustainable demand loops. Market Validation: The fact that the Based Eggman presale explodes with each new stage is a critical data point. It indicates strong, organic market demand and investor confidence before it even hits public exchanges—a clear signal of a project with momentum. Based on these factors, Based Eggman is a calculated investment in a project that ticks every box for explosive growth in 2026. How to Buy Eggman Crypto and Position for the 2026 Explosion Getting into the Based Eggman Presale is a straightforward process designed for both new and experienced crypto investors. Secure a Web3 Wallet: Download MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or a similar wallet that supports the Base and/or Binance Smart Chain networks. Fund Your Wallet: Purchase ETH (for the Base network) or BNB (for the BSC network) and send it to your wallet address. Visit the Official Presale Site: Crucially, only use the official link from Based Eggman's verified Twitter or Telegram channels. This is the most important step to ensure your security. Connect and Purchase: On the website, connect your wallet, select your network (Base or BSC), enter the amount you wish to invest, and confirm the transaction. Ethereum's Resurgence and the 2026 Price Prediction Running parallel to the AI boom is Ethereum's powerful comeback. Its recent climb back to $2900 demonstrates incredible resilience and market conviction. But this is just the beginning. The combination of a potential spot Ethereum ETF, deflationary tokenomics from the burn mechanism, and a thriving Layer-2 ecosystem creates a perfect storm for a parabolic rally. A conservative Ethereum Price Prediction for 2026 places ETH well into five-figure territory, likely ranging between $12,000 and $15,000. While this represents a significant gain, the most strategic investors understand that the real opportunity lies in using ETH's momentum to fuel investments in its highest-potential ecosystem projects. This is precisely why Ethereum investors are moving into the $GGs coin.

The trio of the OpenAI IPO, the Ethereum price rally, and the strategically brilliant Based Eggman Presale represents a once-in-a-generation investment trifecta. While the AI boom will create a tidal wave of new capital and Ethereum's rise will lift the entire blockchain market, Based Eggman is the vessel perfectly built to ride these waves to their peak. For investors looking to position themselves at the intersection of the two most powerful trends on the planet, the time for action is now. Frequently Asked Questions What does the stock market's OpenAI IPO have to do with my crypto investments? The OpenAI IPO is a ""capital tsunami"" event. When a company of this magnitude goes public, it creates a massive wave of new wealth for its early investors. Historically, a significant portion of this new capital seeks the next high-growth frontier. Crypto presales, with their potential for venture-capital-like returns (100x or more), are the logical destination. The IPO will create a new class of investors actively hunting for the Cryptos to Explode in 2026, and projects like Based Eggman are perfectly positioned to attract this capital. Is the ""ChatGPT Crypto Prediction"" real? Did ChatGPT actually endorse Based Eggman? This is a conceptual framework to illustrate a point. While you cannot prompt ChatGPT for direct financial advice, the article uses this idea to show that if you apply the cold, hard logic of an advanced AI to the market, Based Eggman is the project it would likely identify as superior. An AI would analyze data points like: Strategic Positioning: Its multi-chain presence on both Base and BSC. Sustainable Utility: Its functional gaming and creator ecosystem. Market Validation: Its explosive, stage-by-stage presale momentum. The conclusion is that Based Eggman is not a speculative gamble; it's a logically sound investment. You mention a ""trifecta."" How exactly does Based Eggman connect all three trends? Based Eggman sits at the unique intersection of all three mega-trends: OpenAI IPO: It represents the kind of innovative, utility-driven project that new capital from the AI boom will seek out. Ethereum Price Rally: As an ecosystem project built on Ethereum's L2 (Base), its success is directly tied to Ethereum's growth and user adoption. Presale Opportunity : It is the ground-floor investment vehicle that allows you to capture the upside from both the AI and Ethereum narratives simultaneously, before the project hits the mainstream market. What is the direct relationship between the Ethereum Price Prediction for 2026 and Based Eggman's potential? The relationship is twofold. First, as the Ethereum price climbs towards its predicted 2026 peak, investors will take profits and ""rotate"" that capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets within the ETH ecosystem to amplify their gains. Based Eggman is a prime target for this capital rotation. Second, a more valuable and active Ethereum network means a more valuable and active Base network, increasing the user base and demand for Based Eggman's gaming platform. Why is 2026 the key year for these predictions? Why not 2025? 2026 is projected to be the peak of this bull cycle, driven by several converging factors. It allows enough time for the full market impact of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to be felt, and it aligns with the post-OpenAI IPO period when ""spillover capital"" will be actively seeking new investments. Launching and maturing in this ""perfect storm"" of peak retail euphoria and massive new capital inflow gives projects like Based Eggman the highest possible ceiling for growth. Is Based Eggman an ""AI coin""? No, and this is a critical distinction. Based Eggman is not an ""AI coin"" promising to integrate AI into its protocol. Rather, its investment thesis is compelling to an AI-driven analytical model. It's a project whose strengths—utility, multi-chain strategy, strong presale metrics—are exactly the kinds of data points that a logical, data-first investment approach would favor over purely speculative, hype-driven projects.

56403384,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254517,1766761811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $88,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Downturn",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-88000-7/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $88,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Downturn Global cryptocurrency markets witnessed a significant correction on March 15, 2025, as Bitcoin’s price fell below the crucial $88,000 threshold, trading at $87,978.73 on the Binance USDT market according to Bitcoin World monitoring. This movement represents a notable shift in market sentiment following weeks of relative stability above key support levels. Market analysts immediately began examining multiple contributing factors, including macroeconomic indicators, institutional trading patterns, and blockchain network metrics. The descent below this psychological price point triggered automated sell orders across major exchanges, consequently amplifying the downward pressure. Furthermore, this development follows Bitcoin’s recent achievement of new all-time highs, making the current pullback particularly noteworthy for both retail and institutional investors monitoring long-term trend sustainability. Bitcoin Price Movement: Technical Breakdown Technical analysis reveals Bitcoin broke through several support levels during this decline. The $88,000 mark previously served as strong support throughout early 2025, with the asset bouncing from this level three times in February. Market data shows trading volume spiked by approximately 42% during the breakdown, indicating substantial participation in the move. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode reports that the number of Bitcoin addresses in profit decreased by 3.2% following this price action. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped into oversold territory for the first time in six weeks, potentially signaling a near-term buying opportunity according to some technical traders. Exchange order book data from Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken shows significant sell walls forming between $87,500 and $88,500, suggesting continued resistance at these levels. The futures market experienced notable liquidations during this move. According to Coinglass data, approximately $240 million in long positions were liquidated across derivatives exchanges in the 24-hour period surrounding the decline. This represents the largest single-day liquidation event since January 2025. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts decreased by 8%, indicating traders reduced their leveraged positions amid increased volatility. Perpetual funding rates turned negative on several major platforms, showing that short positions now pay long positions—a shift from the positive funding environment that prevailed throughout most of February. These derivatives metrics typically provide insight into trader sentiment and potential price direction. Historical Context and Market Cycles Historical Bitcoin data reveals similar corrections have occurred during previous bull markets. For instance, during the 2021 cycle, Bitcoin experienced 13 separate corrections exceeding 10% while ultimately reaching new highs. The current pullback from recent highs measures approximately 12%, falling within normal historical parameters for Bitcoin volatility. Blockchain analyst Willy Woo notes that on-chain support levels around $85,000 represent the realized price for short-term holders, potentially providing stronger support if the decline continues. Additionally, long-term holder supply remains near all-time highs, suggesting conviction among veteran investors despite price fluctuations. This historical perspective helps contextualize current movements within broader market cycles rather than viewing them in isolation. Cryptocurrency Market Correlation Analysis The broader cryptocurrency market typically follows Bitcoin’s price direction, and this instance proved no exception. Ethereum declined 9% against the US dollar during the same period, while major altcoins like Solana and Cardano experienced even steeper corrections of 14% and 16% respectively. This correlation underscores Bitcoin’s continued role as market leader and primary price setter for the digital asset ecosystem. However, some decentralized finance tokens demonstrated relative resilience, with certain governance tokens declining only 5-7%. Market capitalization for the entire cryptocurrency sector decreased by approximately $180 billion during the sell-off, bringing total market value back to levels last seen in early February 2025. Trading volume across all digital assets increased by 65%, indicating heightened activity rather than complete capital exit. Institutional responses to this movement varied significantly. Several major asset managers announced they were “monitoring the situation” but maintained their long-term Bitcoin allocations. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency mining companies saw their stock prices decline more sharply than Bitcoin itself, with some mining stocks falling over 20% during the session. This disproportionate reaction reflects investor concerns about mining profitability at lower Bitcoin prices, especially ahead of the anticipated halving event. Public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, including MicroStrategy and Tesla, saw modest stock price declines of 3-5%, generally in line with broader technology sector movements. These corporate responses provide insight into institutional perspectives on Bitcoin’s price sustainability. Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Crypto Markets Several macroeconomic developments coincided with Bitcoin’s price decline. The U.S. Federal Reserve released stronger-than-expected employment data, increasing expectations for continued interest rate stability. Consequently, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by 0.8%, creating headwinds for dollar-denominated assets including cryptocurrencies. Additionally, bond yields rose slightly, making fixed-income investments marginally more attractive relative to volatile assets. Traditional equity markets experienced modest declines, with the NASDAQ falling 1.2% during the same trading session. This correlation between traditional and digital asset markets has strengthened throughout 2025 as institutional participation in cryptocurrency has increased. Global geopolitical tensions also contributed to risk-off sentiment across multiple asset classes, though cryptocurrency markets typically demonstrate mixed reactions to such developments. Blockchain Network Fundamentals Remain Strong Despite price volatility, Bitcoin’s underlying network metrics showed remarkable stability. The hash rate, measuring computational power securing the network, remained near all-time highs throughout the price decline. This indicates mining operations continued normal activities without significant disruption. Network difficulty, which adjusts approximately every two weeks to maintain consistent block times, is projected to increase slightly in the next adjustment. Transaction count and total settlement value processed through the Bitcoin network showed no unusual patterns, suggesting regular usage continued unaffected by price movements. The number of active addresses decreased modestly by 4%, remaining within normal fluctuation ranges. These fundamental metrics demonstrate the network’s operational resilience independent of short-term price action. Lightning Network capacity continued its steady growth trajectory, increasing by approximately 2% during the week of the price decline. This layer-2 scaling solution now processes an estimated 15% of Bitcoin’s transaction volume, providing faster and cheaper transactions for everyday use. Developer activity across major Bitcoin improvement proposals remained consistent, with several teams continuing work on privacy enhancements and smart contract functionality. These technological developments proceed according to their own timelines rather than reacting to market prices. Such fundamental strength provides long-term investors with confidence in Bitcoin’s underlying value proposition regardless of temporary price fluctuations. Regulatory Environment and Institutional Adoption The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies continues evolving independently of market prices. Several jurisdictions announced new cryptocurrency frameworks during early 2025, generally providing clearer guidelines for institutional participation. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations entered their final implementation phase, while several Asian financial hubs refined their digital asset licensing regimes. In the United States, legislative proposals for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation gained additional co-sponsors despite the market downturn. Major financial institutions continued expanding their cryptocurrency custody and trading services, with three additional traditional banks announcing Bitcoin ETF products for their wealth management clients. This institutional infrastructure development creates a more robust foundation for long-term adoption regardless of short-term volatility. Expert Perspectives on Market Movements Industry analysts offered varied interpretations of Bitcoin’s price decline. Some technical analysts viewed the movement as a healthy correction within an ongoing bull market, noting that similar pullbacks occurred before previous major rallies. Others expressed concern about decreasing momentum and suggested the possibility of further downside testing. Several quantitative trading firms reported adjusting their algorithmic strategies in response to changed volatility patterns. Academic researchers highlighted that Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility remained within historical norms despite the sharp decline. Risk management professionals emphasized the importance of position sizing and diversification during such volatile periods. These expert opinions collectively provide a balanced perspective on interpreting market movements without resorting to sensationalism or unfounded predictions. Market structure analysts noted changes in exchange flows during the decline. Bitcoin reserves on major exchanges decreased slightly as some investors moved holdings to private wallets—a pattern often associated with long-term holding rather than imminent selling. The ratio of Bitcoin moving to and from exchanges shifted toward accumulation, with more coins leaving exchanges than entering during the 24 hours following the decline. Derivatives positioning became more balanced after the initial liquidation wave, reducing extreme leverage in the system. Spot market order books showed increased bid support forming below $87,000, potentially indicating buyer interest at lower price levels. These microstructure developments provide insight into trader behavior beyond simple price charts. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $88,000 represents a significant market event with implications across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This movement reflects complex interactions between technical factors, macroeconomic conditions, and market sentiment. The Bitcoin price action triggered substantial derivatives liquidations while testing key support levels that market participants closely monitor. Despite short-term volatility, fundamental network metrics remain strong, institutional adoption continues progressing, and regulatory frameworks keep developing. Historical context suggests such corrections are normal during Bitcoin market cycles rather than indications of structural weakness. Market participants should consider multiple data sources—including on-chain analytics, macroeconomic indicators, and market microstructure—when assessing the significance of price movements. The cryptocurrency market’s evolution toward greater maturity involves navigating volatility while maintaining focus on long-term technological transformation and adoption trends. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $88,000? Multiple factors contributed including technical breakdown of support levels, increased selling pressure from leveraged positions, macroeconomic developments strengthening the U.S. dollar, and broader risk-off sentiment across financial markets. No single catalyst explains the entire movement. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? The current approximately 12% pullback from recent highs falls within normal historical parameters for Bitcoin volatility. During previous bull markets, Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections exceeding 10% while ultimately reaching new price highs. Q3: Did other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin’s price movement? Yes, most major cryptocurrencies declined alongside Bitcoin, though with varying magnitudes. Ethereum fell approximately 9%, while some altcoins experienced steeper corrections of 14-16%. This correlation demonstrates Bitcoin’s continued role as market leader. Q4: What happened to Bitcoin’s network fundamentals during the price decline? Network fundamentals remained strong with hash rate near all-time highs, consistent transaction processing, and continued development activity. These metrics demonstrate the network’s operational resilience independent of short-term price fluctuations. Q5: How did institutional investors respond to the price movement? Responses varied with some asset managers maintaining long-term allocations while monitoring the situation. Mining company stocks declined more sharply than Bitcoin itself, reflecting concerns about profitability. Corporations holding Bitcoin on balance sheets saw modest stock price declines generally in line with technology sector movements.

In particular, XRP’s market capitalization peaked at approximately $210.4 billion on July 22, 2025, when the token traded near $3.56. XRP peak market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap As of December 26, XRP is trading around $1.86, giving it a market cap of roughly $112.8 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap retrieved by Finbold. XRP peak price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The current total worth of the XRP ledger token represents a decline of about $97.6 billion from the absolute peak. XRP price peaked near $3.56 XRP’s July surge was abrupt and event-driven, with the token jumping from the mid-$2 range to above $3.50 in a matter of days. However, the move proved unsustainable. Selling pressure emerged almost immediately, and XRP failed to establish a higher support zone above $3, leading to a prolonged downtrend through August, September, and November. By late December, XRP had retraced more than 40% from its yearly high, reflecting fading momentum and increased profit-taking following the summer rally, despite the approval of Spot XRP ETFs. Market cap data confirms $98 billion valuation drawdown The market-cap chart reinforces this picture. After briefly breaking above the $210 billion threshold, XRP’s valuation entered a steady decline, marked by lower highs and lower lows. Even periods of increased trading volume, including a notable spike around late November, failed to reverse the broader trend. As of December 26, XRP’s market capitalization sits near $112.8 billion, placing it well below its 2025 peak and highlighting the scale of capital that exited the asset after the rally cooled. Can XRP reclaim key support levels in 2026? As for next year, XRP’s ability to reclaim lost ground will likely depend on whether it can stabilize above the $1.80–$2 range and convert former resistance into support. Without a sustained break higher, the charts suggest the token remains in a consolidation phase following one of the most aggressive boom-and-bust cycles of 2025.

The move comes well ahead of the planned adoption of new legislation expected to comprehensively regulate crypto transactions in Russia next year. Sberbank pilots crypto-backed lending in Russia Russia’s top lender, Sberbank, has granted a loan backed by cryptocurrency for the first time since Moscow started legalizing the market. The corporate loan provided to Intelion has been secured with coins minted by the Russian mining giant, Sber announced Friday. In a press release published on its website, and quoted by the business news publications RBC and Vedomosti, the bank unveiled: “Sberbank issued a pilot loan to a cryptocurrency miner, Intelion Data JSC. The collateral was digital currency mined by the miner.” The banking giant further highlighted that it used its own storage solution, called Rutoken, to safely deposit the cryptocurrency during the loan period. Intelion Data Systems is one of the largest mining operators in Russia, which also supplies hardware and provides hosting services at its big data centers. It is the country’s second-largest mining firm, in terms of both capacity and revenue, after Bitriver. Together, the two control more than half of the Russian mining market. In a statement released by Sberbank, the Deputy Chairman of its Management Board, Anatoly Popov, noted: “The pilot transaction allowed us to test mechanisms for working with digital collateral, which could form the basis for future regulation. We believe this product will be relevant not only for cryptocurrency miners, but also for companies that own crypto assets.” Crypto-secured loans may soon become common Popov’s comments come only a day after Russian media quoted excerpts from an interview on the same matter that he recently gave to the official TASS news agency. In the latter, the executive unveiled that Sberbank is exploring the possibility of offering fiat loans backed by cryptocurrency holdings, as reported by Cryptopolitan. He also indicated that the majority state-owned bank is prepared to support efforts by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) to adopt proper rules for the country’s crypto space, elaborating: “Cryptocurrency market regulation in Russia is still in its infancy, and we are ready to participate in developing relevant solutions and creating the infrastructure to launch such services, together with the regulator.” Earlier this week, the monetary authority in Moscow published the main points of a new concept for complete regulation of the Russian crypto market. Moving beyond its overly conservative stance on decentralized digital assets such as Bitcoin, the CBR now suggests legalizing crypto investment and trading outside the current experimental legal regime. Besides qualified investors, non-professional, retail investors will also be granted legal access to cryptocurrencies and their derivatives. Draft legislative amendments implementing the central bank’s latest proposals have already been submitted for government review, and lawmakers are expected to adopt them by July 1, 2026. Mining recognized as an industry with growing weight Russia regulated crypto mining through dedicated legislation, which went into force in 2024, but most of those involved in the sector are yet to come out of the shadows. Both companies and individual entrepreneurs are allowed to mint digital coins, provided they register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS). However, less than a third of mining enterprises have done that so far, prompting suggestions to offer an amnesty for miners, who have also been accused of illegally importing hardware. Meanwhile, the industry has been growing at a fast pace. A recent report revealed that the number of Russian crypto farms approaches 200,000, despite restrictions imposed in several regions to deal with power shortages caused by their activities. Nevertheless, its growing importance for Russia’s sanctioned economy was recently acknowledged both by the Bank of Russia and a representative of President Putin ’s administration.

According to real-time market monitoring data from Bitcoin World, BTC currently trades at $86,965.44 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline from recent highs. This movement represents one of the most substantial single-day price adjustments observed in the current market cycle, consequently drawing immediate attention from institutional and retail investors worldwide. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis Market analysts immediately began examining the factors behind Bitcoin’s sudden decline below $87,000. The cryptocurrency had maintained relative stability above this level for several trading sessions previously. Trading volume data reveals increased selling pressure across major exchanges, particularly during Asian and European trading hours. Meanwhile, technical indicators show the price breaking through multiple support levels that had previously held firm during recent market fluctuations. Historical data from previous market cycles provides essential context for understanding current movements. For instance, Bitcoin has experienced similar percentage declines approximately 15 times during the past two years alone. Each instance typically correlated with specific market events or macroeconomic developments. The current trading pattern suggests a combination of profit-taking behavior and shifting market sentiment rather than fundamental weakness in the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology or adoption metrics. Cryptocurrency Market Context The broader digital asset market typically mirrors Bitcoin’s price movements, creating a cascading effect across thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies. Today’s decline consequently triggered corresponding adjustments in major altcoins including Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Market capitalization across the entire cryptocurrency sector decreased by approximately 3.2% within a six-hour window, according to aggregated exchange data from multiple tracking platforms. Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Financial analysts specializing in digital assets emphasize several contributing factors to the current price movement. First, traditional market correlations have reemerged, with Bitcoin showing increased sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators including inflation data and interest rate expectations. Second, exchange flow data indicates moderate outflows from centralized platforms, suggesting some investors are moving assets to cold storage rather than exiting positions entirely. Third, derivatives market activity shows changing sentiment in futures and options positioning. The following table illustrates key market metrics during the decline: Metric Value Change (24h) Bitcoin Price $86,965.44 -4.2% Trading Volume (24h) $42.8B +18.3% Market Dominance 52.4% +0.8% Fear & Greed Index 48 (Neutral) -12 points Several institutional factors may be influencing current market conditions. Notably, regulatory developments in major economies continue creating uncertainty for market participants. Additionally, traditional financial institutions adjusting their cryptocurrency exposure frequently create temporary price dislocations. The increasing integration of Bitcoin into conventional financial systems means traditional market dynamics now exert greater influence on cryptocurrency valuations than during earlier market cycles. Technical and Fundamental Factors Technical analysis reveals several important levels that market participants are monitoring closely. The $85,000 level represents the next significant support zone based on historical trading data. Resistance now appears around $89,500, where previous buying activity concentrated during the last upward movement. Moving averages provide additional context, with the 50-day exponential moving average currently positioned at $84,200 and the 200-day simple moving average at $76,400. Fundamental developments continue supporting long-term Bitcoin adoption despite short-term price volatility. Network fundamentals remain strong with several key metrics showing positive trends: Hash rate stability: Mining difficulty adjustments maintain network security Address growth: Active addresses continue expanding steadily Institutional adoption: Corporate treasury allocations show gradual increase Layer-2 development: Scaling solutions enhance transaction capacity Market structure analysis reveals changing participant behavior during this decline. Unlike previous corrections dominated by retail trading, current data shows balanced participation across investor categories. Institutional flows demonstrate particular resilience, with several major investment vehicles reporting net inflows despite the price decline. This pattern suggests sophisticated investors may view current levels as accumulation opportunities rather than exit signals. Historical Comparison and Market Cycles Comparing current movements to historical patterns provides valuable perspective. Bitcoin has experienced 15 corrections exceeding 20% during bull markets since 2010, with the average decline measuring approximately 32% from local highs. The current adjustment remains well within historical norms for cryptocurrency volatility. Previous cycles demonstrate that healthy markets frequently experience periodic corrections that ultimately strengthen long-term price foundations. The 2021-2022 market cycle offers particularly relevant comparisons, featuring similar macroeconomic conditions including inflationary pressures and monetary policy adjustments. During that period, Bitcoin experienced multiple corrections exceeding 30% before ultimately reaching new all-time highs. Current technical patterns share characteristics with mid-cycle consolidations observed during previous expansion phases, suggesting potential continuation of the broader upward trend following the current consolidation period. Global Economic Influences Macroeconomic factors increasingly influence cryptocurrency markets as institutional adoption expands. Current global economic conditions create specific pressures on risk assets including digital currencies. Central bank policies, particularly regarding interest rates and quantitative tightening, directly impact capital allocation decisions across asset classes. Geopolitical developments additionally contribute to market uncertainty, frequently triggering volatility across all financial markets including cryptocurrencies. Regional market dynamics reveal interesting patterns during this decline. Asian trading sessions initiated the downward movement, followed by amplified selling during European hours. North American markets showed relative stability by comparison, with buying support emerging during U.S. trading hours. This geographical distribution suggests differing regional perspectives on current valuation levels and future price expectations. Investor Implications and Risk Management Volatility represents an inherent characteristic of cryptocurrency markets that investors must incorporate into their risk management strategies. Several approaches help navigate these conditions effectively. Position sizing according to risk tolerance remains fundamental to sustainable participation. Diversification across asset classes and investment time horizons additionally provides stability during market fluctuations. Finally, maintaining perspective on long-term adoption trends helps investors avoid reactionary decisions during short-term price movements. Market infrastructure has evolved significantly since previous cycles, providing investors with enhanced tools for managing volatility. Options markets now offer sophisticated hedging strategies previously unavailable to cryptocurrency participants. Additionally, regulated investment vehicles provide traditional investors with familiar structures for exposure. These developments contribute to more mature market behavior despite persistent volatility characteristic of emerging asset classes. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $87,000 represents a significant market movement within the context of current cryptocurrency trading patterns. The price adjustment reflects complex interactions between technical factors, macroeconomic conditions, and evolving market structure. Historical comparisons suggest such corrections represent normal market behavior during expansion phases. Fundamental adoption metrics continue supporting long-term growth prospects despite short-term price volatility. Market participants should monitor key support levels while maintaining perspective on the broader adoption trajectory driving cryptocurrency markets forward. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $87,000? Multiple factors contributed including profit-taking behavior, shifting market sentiment, and reactions to macroeconomic indicators. Increased selling pressure during Asian and European trading sessions initiated the decline. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? The current adjustment remains within historical norms for cryptocurrency volatility. Bitcoin has experienced 15 corrections exceeding 20% during previous bull markets, with the current decline measuring approximately 4.2% from recent highs. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Technical analysis identifies $85,000 as the next significant support zone. The 50-day exponential moving average at $84,200 and the 200-day simple moving average at $76,400 provide additional reference points. Q4: Are fundamental Bitcoin metrics affected by the price decline? Network fundamentals remain strong with hash rate stability, address growth, and institutional adoption continuing positive trends. Price movements frequently diverge from fundamental metrics in the short term. Q5: How should investors respond to this volatility? Investors should maintain risk-appropriate position sizing, diversify across assets and time horizons, and focus on long-term adoption trends rather than short-term price movements when making investment decisions.

Based on this development, the selling pressure could be easing for the altcoin, while ETFs continue to contribute to buying pressure as they maintain their inflow streak. Analyst Reveals XRP’s Stochastic RSI Has Hit 0.0 In an X post, Skipper revealed that XRP’s stochastic RSI has hit 0.0 for only the second time ever. This came as he noted that the altcoin has had a rough run, as it is down 35% in this quarter, 10% this year, marking its first yearly loss since 2022. The analyst added that XRP is also below the key $2 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Stay Above This Level Or Crash To $0.9 However, Skipper suggested that analyst Steph’s discovery about XRP’s Stoch RSI hitting 0.0 on the 3-week chart provides some optimism. He noted that this has only happened once before, which was in 2020, right before the altcoin bottomed at $0.28 during the Terra LUNA crash. Skipper also pointed to Steph’s statement that this could mean selling pressure is almost gone for XRP, though a quick bounce may not occur. The altcoin notably stayed flat for months in 2022 before it recovered. The analyst also mentioned that the drop in the stoch RSI marks cycle lows, not short-term trades. While the selling pressure looks to be cooling, XRP continues to see significant buying pressure from the XRP ETFs, which marks a positive for the altcoin. SoSo Value data shows that these funds have recorded daily net inflows since they launched. As a result, they hold net assets of $1.25 billion, which is almost 1% of XRP’s market cap. XRP Supercycle To Happen Next Year Self-acclaimed largest IQ holder YoungHoon Kim stated in an X post that the XRP supercycle will happen next year. Kim had earlier predicted that the altcoin could reach $10 or higher next year, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs). This looks to be based on his belief that “all crypto will eventually connect with XRP.” Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why This Changes Everything For XRP In The Long Term In the meantime, crypto analyst Crypto King has stated that patience is key as XRP looks to reclaim key levels. The analyst noted that the price is holding just above the $1.85 critical support and that a strong bounce and a reclaim of $1.98 would signal a momentum shift. He added that if that price level breaks, the first upside target is the first resistance at $2.58. Meanwhile, there is also room for the altcoin to rally to as high as $3.66 next. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.86, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

56404163,648895,1766763039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56404163.jpeg,Top XRP Ledger Developments Investors Should Be Aware Of,https://bitcoinist.com/top-xrp-ledger-developments/,"The XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to evolve as Ripple pushes forward with new technical upgrades to strengthen network reliability, expand future use cases, and improve overall network performance. A recently released amendment report highlights several key developments that investors may want to track closely, as these could spark significant changes for the network by 2026. Upcoming XRP Ledger Developments Ripple rolled out the XRPL version 3.0.0 earlier this month, introducing five new amendments currently under review by validators. These proposed changes directly address issues related to price-oracle sorting, token-escrow accounting errors, missing ledger-entry files, Automated Market Maker (AMM) rounding issues, and more. Investors are paying close attention to these amendments , as they directly affect asset pricing, accounting, and tracking on the XRP Ledger. These areas can also influence risk assessment and confidence among market participants. The five active amendments in Rippled 3.0.0, currently open for voting by January 2026, include: fixAMMClawbackRounding fixIncludeKeyletFields fixMPTDeliveredAmount fixPriceOracleOrder fixTokenEscrowV1 Firstly, the fixAMMClawbackRounding amendment resolves an accounting issue that can occur during AMM clawback transactions involving the final Liquidity Provider (LP) token holder. Previously, rounding errors could create mismatches between AMM balances and trust lines. The newly proposed update ensures these balances remain aligned, allowing invariant checks to function correctly. The second amendment, fixIncludeKeyletFields, adds missing identifying fields to several ledger entries. This includes escrow and payment channel sequence numbers, owner fields for signer lists, and document IDs for Oracle entries. The update makes it easier to reference and manage objects within the XRP Ledger . The fixMPTDeliveredAmount amendment restores missing DeliveredAmount metadata for direct Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) payment transactions. While payments already deliver the correct amounts, the added metadata from the proposed update makes it easier for investors and developers to see and verify what was actually delivered. To ensure more reliable price data, the fixPriceOracleOrder amendment addresses inconsistencies in how asset pairs are ordered in price oracle entries. By enforcing a consistent order, the change allows applications and users to look up asset prices seamlessly. The final amendment, fixTokenEscrowV1, aims to improve accounting accuracy. It corrects an error affecting MPT escrows that include transfer fees. The update ensures that issuer-locked balances and the total supply are reduced by the correct net amounts when escrowed tokens are unlocked, improving the transparency of XRPL . XRPL Plans New Institutional Lending Protocol By 2026 Edward Hennis, a software engineer at Ripple, has announced an upcoming XRPL Lending Protocol that is set to transform on-ledger lending. According to Hennis, the protocol will offer fixed-term, fixed-rate, and underwritten credit designed for institutions. In his post on X, the Ripple engineer revealed that each loan on the ledger will operate within a Single Asset Vault that isolates risks and allows either private or public contributions.

Bitcoin reached new all-time highs while crypto returned to daily institutional and media discourse—this time in a far more constructive light than during the downturn of 2022–2023. “Financial systems don’t change because prices move. They change because products become useful at scale.” @jmmognetti In his latest letter, Jean-Marie Mognetti reflects on a defining year for digital assets, from @Bitcoin ’s new highs to the shift away from speculation toward… pic.twitter.com/EojHyNxT1Q — CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) December 26, 2025 The year was not without turbulence. Periods of volatility and liquidation events served as reminders that crypto remains a young asset class. CoinShares argues that focusing exclusively on price action risks overlooking the industry’s deeper progress. After years of sustained building the foundations supporting digital assets have strengthened materially. Digital Assets Move Inside the Traditional Economy CoinShares notes that digital assets are no longer operating outside the traditional financial system. Instead, they are increasingly embedded within it, augmenting core financial infrastructure rather than attempting to replace it outright. Progress in 2025 was decisive across both technology and adoption. The industry has matured beyond its most speculative instincts, with attention shifting toward protocols and applications delivering measurable real-world utility. Projects gaining traction today are those solving tangible economic problems, rather than chasing short-term narrative momentum. Utility Over Narrative Signals Market Maturity From CoinShares’ perspective, the most meaningful indicators of crypto’s direction are practical integrations rather than speculative cycles. Chainlink’s growing role in connecting blockchain networks with established benchmark providers offers a clearer signal of market evolution than any meme-driven rally. At the consumer level, the emergence of prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi demonstrates that crypto-enabled applications are reaching product-market fit. These platforms are no longer experimental; they are operational, regulated in parts, and increasingly used. Meanwhile in the United States, spot Bitcoin ETFs have begun achieving mainstream adoption, gradually reshaping perceptions through familiarity rather than hype. 2026: Adoption Matters More Than Macro Catalysts Looking ahead, CoinShares acknowledges that many market participants expect a fresh macro catalyst in 2026, potentially through renewed liquidity from the Federal Reserve. While such developments may influence markets, CoinShares argues that adoption will be the more consequential force. In 2026 CoinShares says app-based retail savings products may begin competing directly with bank deposits while payment companies fintechs and banks expand stablecoin settlement, custody, and trading services. Though gradual, these changes are structural and difficult to reverse once embedded. Economic Purpose Will Define the Winners In this environment, CoinShares believes winners will be defined by economic function rather than narrative appeal. Bitcoin continues to solidify its role as a global, non-sovereign asset. Stablecoins are evolving into settlement rails for a more digital and international economy. Tokenised financial products are beginning to transition from pilot programmes to real issuance. As these rails mature, decentralised finance increasingly resembles finance itself—delivered through different technology rather than positioned as a parallel system. Regulation Enables Scale, Not Suppression CoinShares highlights meaningful regulatory progress, particularly in the United States, where recent legislative developments have clarified frameworks for stablecoins, tokenised assets and market infrastructure. For Europe, the firm argues the opportunity lies in consistent, pragmatic implementation of regulation that attracts long-term institutional capital. The objective should not be to constrain innovation through uncertainty, but to make innovation safe enough to scale. From Graceful Return to Real-Economy Consolidation CoinShares also cautions that future cycles will still produce micro-bubbles. Some themes will attract excessive capital, and some projects will fail. This, it says, is inevitable in a rapidly evolving frontier market. The firm believes the direction of travel is increasingly clear. The market is turning toward utility, cash flow and integration. If 2025 represented crypto’s graceful return, CoinShares concludes that 2026 is shaping up to be the year digital assets consolidate into the real economy.

This $0.035 New DeFi Coin Is Closing Out Phase 6,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-this-0-035-new-defi-coin-is-closing-out-phase-6/,"Moments like this tend to arrive before the wider market reacts. Activity builds quietly, timelines tighten, and signals start to stack up. For those asking what crypto to buy now while attention is still divided, this is often where early positioning takes shape. A new DeFi coin priced at $0.035 is now entering that window, with momentum pointing toward a transition rather than a pause. Behind that movement is Mutuum Finance, a project that has been advancing step by step instead of chasing headlines. What Mutuum Finance Is Building and Why It Matters Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to make on-chain capital more productive. The idea is simple in concept, but powerful in execution. Users can supply assets to earn yield, while borrowers access liquidity by posting collateral. Rates adjust based on real usage rather than fixed incentives. For example, a user supplying assets into the protocol receives mtTokens that represent their position. As interest accrues across the system, the value of those mtTokens increases automatically. This makes yield transparent and easy to track without complex actions. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core components include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial assets will include ETH and USDT. Security has also been a focus from the start. An independent audit is currently in progress with Halborn Security , reviewing finalized lending and borrowing contracts. For analysts tracking DeFi crypto development, this level of preparation before launch often signals long-term intent rather than short-term noise. Funding and Investors Momentum around Mutuum Finance is backed by participation, not just interest. So far, the project has raised $19.45M and attracted 18,650 investors. That scale of involvement matters because it reflects broad engagement rather than reliance on a small group. The token began its early stages at $0.01 and now trades at $0.035, marking a 250% increase over time. This kind of progression suggests steady demand rather than sudden spikes. For those watching crypto prices today, gradual growth is often viewed as a healthier signal than sharp jumps followed by pullbacks. Many market commentators suggest that when a new cryptocurrency shows this type of price development before broader exposure, it often points to underlying confidence rather than short-term trading. Allocation and Community Activity Mutuum Finance has a fixed total supply of 4B tokens. Of that amount, 45.5% is allocated for early distribution, which equals roughly 1.82B tokens. To date, 825M tokens have already been sold. What this means in practical terms is that available supply at current levels is becoming limited. As allocation tightens, new participants are competing for a smaller remaining portion. This dynamic often influences price discovery once a project transitions into its next stage. Community engagement adds another layer. A 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM, keeping participation active and visible. This type of structure encourages ongoing involvement rather than one-time interest. The team has also focused on simplifying access. While details continue to develop, easier payment options are part of the broader effort to reduce friction for new users entering the ecosystem. Analysts often point out that smoother access can support wider adoption over time. Audits and Long-Term Structure Security remains one of the strongest signals around Mutuum Finance. The project has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score, which provides an additional layer of confidence. Alongside the ongoing Halborn Security review , this creates a multi-layered approach to risk management. Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance is planning a stablecoin backed by multiple assets. This design allows borrowers to use diverse collateral rather than relying on a single token. By spreading risk, the system can remain more resilient during market swings. Accurate pricing is handled through robust oracle infrastructure. The protocol design anticipates decentralized data feeds such as Chainlink, along with fallback sources. Reliable pricing is critical for lending systems, especially when liquidations depend on real-time values. Some analysts believe that combining lending, a stablecoin, and strong oracle support places Mutuum Finance in a category closer to infrastructure-focused DeFi projects rather than short-lived trends. Why Phase 6 Timing Is Drawing Attention Phase 6 is now closing out rapidly, with allocation nearing completion. Recent activity includes a $100k whale allocation, which many market commentators view as a signal of growing confidence among larger participants. Whales often look for moments when supply tightens and milestones approach. A closing phase combined with an upcoming V1 launch fits that pattern. Larger allocations at this stage suggest that some participants are positioning ahead of broader visibility. When people ask what is the potential best cryptocurrency to invest in right now, the answer often depends on timing as much as fundamentals. Mutuum Finance brings both into focus. A working lending protocol in development, strong funding, active community engagement, and multiple security layers all point toward a project built for longevity. With Phase 6 closing out and activity accelerating, this $0.035 new DeFi coin is entering a moment where early positioning becomes harder to find. For those tracking the potential best crypto to buy now ahead of 2026, Mutuum Finance is increasingly difficult to overlook.

Price action may appear muted, but usage metrics tell a different story. His post focused on how deeply XRP is embedded in Ripple’s payment network today. ChartNerd revealed that 40% of RippleNet’s 300 financial institutions now use XRP for On-Demand Liquidity . He also noted that Ripple ODL covers 80% of global remittance corridors. He shared data supporting a shift that is already underway, even if it is not yet reflected on price charts. $XRP : 40% of RippleNet's 300 financial institutions are utilizing $XRP for On Demand Liquidity, but wait, It gets better, Ripple ODL now covers 80% of ALL global remittance corridors pic.twitter.com/5WG26RElsr — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 23, 2025 These Numbers Deserve Attention ChartNerd suggested two adoption metrics tied directly to Ripple’s payment infrastructure. The first, showing that 40% of Ripple’s 300-plus partner institutions are using XRP, signals active institutional use rather than experimental testing. These institutions now rely on the digital asset to source liquidity during live transactions. He also noted that Ripple ODL now covers 80% of global remittance corridors. Remittance corridors drive constant transaction volume. As coverage expands, XRP usage scales with real payment demand rather than speculative trading. Together, these data points show XRP operating inside active financial systems. ODL depends on XRP to move value between currencies without pre-funded accounts. Why This Supports XRP’s Price Structure Utility-driven demand behaves differently from speculative demand. Institutions using ODL do not buy XRP based on sentiment. They access it to settle transactions. As corridor coverage expands, transaction frequency increases. That creates consistent liquidity demand rather than bursts of hype driven volume. ChartNerd’s post suggests that XRP demand now ties directly to payment throughput. This reduces reliance on retail momentum. It also strengthens XRP’s case as a bridge asset inside regulated financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Position in Global Finance XRP’s role inside ODL places it at the center of cross-border settlement. Speed, cost, liquidity, and availability are crucial parts of an efficient global payment system. XRP excels in all areas, settling transactions in seconds at fractions of a cent. Ripple’s ODL system removes the need for pre-funded accounts, freeing up capital while using XRP as the bridge asset for real-time liquidity. Ripple holds billions of XRP in escrow, providing supply predictability as usage scales. ChartNerd’s data shows this model is no longer theoretical. With 80% corridor coverage and growing institutional usage , XRP continues to integrate into global payment rails. Its price may lag, but infrastructure is moving fast.

This potential downturn hinges on the persistence of a critical chart pattern known as a weekly dead cross, according to recent analysis reported by U.Today. The forecast underscores the fragile equilibrium in digital asset markets as traders worldwide scrutinize key support levels. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyzing the Dead Cross Threat Crypto analyst Gamza Khanzadaev has identified a precarious technical setup on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. Specifically, he warns that failure to reclaim the $90,000 level before the weekly candle closes could cement a bearish dead cross formation. This pattern, a cornerstone of traditional technical analysis now applied to crypto markets, signals potential long-term weakness. It materializes when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term one, historically indicating shifting momentum. Consequently, market participants are closely monitoring the 50-week and 200-week moving averages. The interaction between these indicators often guides institutional and retail investment decisions. Moreover, the current price action near the $86,000 support zone adds urgency to the analysis. A decisive break below this level, according to Khanzadaev, would invalidate the $80,000 psychological support and target a deeper retracement toward $74,111. Understanding the Technical Landscape for BTC Technical analysis provides a framework for interpreting market sentiment and potential price trajectories. The dead cross pattern carries significant weight due to its historical correlation with extended downtrends across various asset classes. For Bitcoin, a weekly timeframe confirmation would suggest a shift in medium to long-term investor outlook. Key support and resistance levels form the architecture of any price prediction. The identified thresholds—$90,000, $86,000, $80,000, $74,111, and the ultimate $67,000 target—represent zones where buying and selling pressure have previously concentrated. Analysts examine volume profiles and order book data at these levels to gauge their current strength. Immediate Resistance: The $90,000 level acts as a crucial ceiling Bitcoin must overcome to negate the bearish setup. Primary Support: The $86,000 zone is the first major defense against a deeper decline. Secondary Support: A breach opens the path to $74,111, a level derived from historical consolidation and Fibonacci retracement studies. Furthermore, the lack of strong buying pressure this week is a central concern. Sustained volume is essential for validating any price movement, and its absence during a key technical test can amplify downside risks. Contextualizing the Analysis in the 2025 Crypto Market The year 2025 presents a unique backdrop for cryptocurrency valuation. Regulatory clarity in major economies, institutional adoption rates, and macroeconomic factors like interest rates directly influence digital asset prices. Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the broader altcoin market, making its technical health a bellwether for the entire sector. Expert analysis from figures like Khanzadaev contributes to the market’s information ecosystem. While no prediction is certain, such technical warnings encourage risk management and informed decision-making. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced and recovered from multiple dead cross events in its history, though each instance carried unique market conditions. For instance, the 2022 bear market featured similar technical warnings that preceded a prolonged downturn. Conversely, false signals, often called “bear traps,” have also occurred where the pattern failed to lead to a significant drop. The current market’s high leverage and derivative product prevalence add another layer of complexity, potentially accelerating moves once key levels break. The Role of Moving Averages in Crypto Forecasting Moving averages smooth price data to identify the underlying trend direction. The 50-week and 200-week averages are particularly significant for long-term investors. A sustained position above the 200-week average has historically signaled a bull market regime for Bitcoin. Therefore, the threat of the 50-week average crossing below it represents a potential regime change warning. The following table illustrates the typical interpretation of moving average crossovers: Crossover Type Shorter MA vs. Longer MA Traditional Interpretation Market Sentiment Golden Cross Crosses Above Bullish Signal Long-term uptrend likely beginning Dead Cross Crosses Below Bearish Signal Long-term downtrend likely beginning It is crucial to remember that these are lagging indicators. They confirm trends that have already begun rather than predict future prices with certainty. Analysts therefore use them in conjunction with other tools like momentum oscillators, on-chain data, and support/resistance analysis to build a more complete picture. Conclusion The Bitcoin price prediction highlighting a risk down to $67,000 centers on a critical technical juncture. The potential weekly dead cross pattern demands attention from traders and long-term holders alike. While the pattern is not yet confirmed, the analysis underscores the importance of the $86,000 and $90,000 levels in the immediate term. Market participants should monitor buying pressure and volume closely, as these factors will ultimately determine whether Bitcoin stabilizes or tests deeper support zones. As always in volatile cryptocurrency markets, technical analysis provides a roadmap, not a guarantee, emphasizing the need for prudent risk management strategies. FAQs Q1: What is a “dead cross” in cryptocurrency trading? A dead cross is a technical chart pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average (like the 50-day or 50-week) crosses below a long-term moving average (like the 200-day or 200-week). Traders often interpret it as a bearish signal suggesting a potential shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. Q2: Why is the $86,000 level so important in this Bitcoin price prediction? According to the analyst, $86,000 is identified as a major support level. A sustained break below this price on significant volume could trigger further selling, opening the path toward the next support levels at $74,111 and potentially $67,000. Q3: Has Bitcoin experienced a dead cross before? Yes, Bitcoin has formed dead cross patterns on its charts several times throughout its history. The outcome has varied; some instances led to prolonged bear markets, while others resulted in shorter corrections or even failed to produce significant downside (false signals). Q4: What could invalidate this bearish Bitcoin price prediction? The primary invalidation point, as stated in the analysis, would be for Bitcoin to reclaim and hold above the $90,000 level before the weekly candle closes. This would prevent the confirmed formation of the weekly dead cross and could shift near-term sentiment. Q5: How should an investor react to this type of technical analysis? Technical analysis is one tool among many. Investors should consider it alongside fundamental analysis, their own risk tolerance, and investment horizon. It can inform decisions about position sizing, setting stop-loss orders, or rebalancing a portfolio, but it should not be the sole basis for investment choices.

BMNR trades at 0.80x book value, a 20% discount to NAV, with the stock consolidating near critical $25-28 support after a 170% gap-up in July 2025. Technical setup targets $131. The MAVAN staking solution, launching in early 2026, could convert BMNR’s passive ETH holdings into a yield-generating asset, supporting income and dividends. I rate BMNR a Buy for risk-tolerant investors seeking leveraged Ethereum exposure at a discount to NAV, with position sizing limited to 2-5% of portfolio and a hard stop below. BitMine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) was originally focused on bitcoin mining. Now it is the largest public ethereum treasury in the whole world. It has more than 4 million ETH. And this makes the total value to 12 billion dollars. Even though the total assets amounting to $13.2 billion include $1 billion cash as of December 2025, there are ongoing concerns. Moreover, the stock trades at just 0.80x book value. Fundstrat chairman Tom Lee leads the ""Alchemy of 5%"" strategy that seeks ownership of 5% of all ETH in circulation. Following the Q2 2025 results, technical analysis suggests a breakout gap of over 170%, which has formed with a consolidation in the stock at the nearby important support level of weekly moving averages. Furthermore, the stock was consolidated by a range of around $25-30. If this support stays intact, we can expect an advance towards the upper trendline resistance in the area of $131. The MAVAN staking solution set to arrive in early 2026 could transform this passive treasury into a yield-generating instrument. SA From Bitcoin Miner to Ethereum Whale BitMine Immersion Technologies has undergone one of the most dramatic corporate transitions we have ever seen. What started as a Bitcoin miner with immersion cooling technology has become the world's biggest Ethereum treasury company. In June 2025, Tom Lee, the famous co-founder of Fundstrat and Wall Street strategist, became Chairman of the Board. With his appointment, BitMine completed a $250 million private placement with some of the highest quality investors, such as Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and Kraken. The fundraising went towards an aggressive Ethereum accumulation strategy that Lee has labelled the ""Alchemy of 5%."" In the 5.5 months since its launch, BitMine has accumulated a total of 4.066 million ETH tokens , or 3.37 percent of all Ethereum. At current prices near $3,000 per token, this stake is worth approximately $12 billion. The overall holdings of the entity surpassed $13.2 billion as of December 21, 2025. It consists of 193 BTC, $32 million worth of Eightco Holdings stakes and $1 billion in cash. Asset Holdings Value ( USD ) Ethereum ( ETH ) 4,066,062 $12.17B Bitcoin ( BTC ) 193 ~$17M Eightco Holdings ( ORBS ) Equity Stake $32M Cash - $1.0B Total - $13.2B The firm has become a vehicle for institutional Ethereum exposure. BMNR is now one of the 70 most actively traded stocks in the US, with average daily dollar volume of $1.7 billion. This liquidity permits ongoing capital raising and ETH accumulation with negligible friction. theblock.co Financial Analysis: A Balance Sheet Story The financial data of BitMine shows that the company has changed 180 degrees. The Income Statement shows modest operating revenues of $6.1 million TTM, which is an 84% year-over-year increase, but this is about irrelevant to the investment case. It's the balance sheet that matters. The latest report witnessed a surge in assets from $7.3 million in August 2024 to $8.79 billion. Most of this growth stems from an Ethereum treasury strategy funded by the issuance of equity. In fiscal 2025, the firm issued stocks to raise $7.95 billion. What stands out the most is the misvaluation. The stock's price is $29-30 while its book value per share is $37.04. Investors can purchase exposure to BitMine's Ethereum treasury at a 20% discount to net asset value. The price-to-book ratio of 0.80x is 78% lower than the sector median of 3.64x. Recent press releases indicate approximately $1 billion in total cash as of December 2025. This enables plenty of room for further ETH purchases and operations. The company is winding down legacy Bitcoin mining operations, this has caused the TTM operating losses to remain high at $13.7 million. The net income was impacted positively at $348.6 million due to unrealized gains in crypto holdings. The massive appreciation in the ETH treasury resulted in normalized EPS of $11.55 for the period. The company recently began paying a small dividend of $0.01 per share , reflecting confidence in the treasury strategy, as negative operating cash flow was $4.1 million TTM. SA The Tom Lee Factor Tom Lee is a reputable source for BitMine's Ethereum thesis. Fundstrat co-founder and veteran Wall Street strategist Lee made a name for himself with bold market calls that had reason. Back in 2017, he was one of the earliest mainstream analysts to produce research coverage on cryptocurrencies. According to Lee, the basis for his investment thesis is titled ""The Crypto Supercycle."" He argues that developments in regulation in 2025 like the GENIUS Act and SEC's Project Crypto will impact financial services as much as in 1971, the end of the Bretton Woods gold standard. This event modernized Wall Street, leading to the creation of many financial giants. With regards to Ethereum, Lee mentions that stablecoins are dominant on the Ethereum network. According to statements by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the stablecoin market could reasonably reach $2 trillion compared to the current $250 billion. Because stablecoins' largest trading volume is on Ethereum, ETH will benefit directly from the growth. Lee publicly speculated Ethereum could 100x , similar to how Bitcoin has performed since Fundstrat's first Buy recommendation in a rather long-ago 2017, and BitMine's acquisitions of ETH underscore the soundness of the former view. The MAVAN Catalyst BitMine is creating the Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) staking infrastructure solution, expected to be launched in early 2026; this could possibly change the company's business model. BitMine currently holds a treasury asset of 4 million ETH. With MAVAN, the company can stake these assets to earn validator rewards. At current Ethereum network staking yields of around 3-4% per annum, a stake of 4 million ETH could create annual staking income of US$360-480 million at current prices. BitMine will evolve from a treasury play into an income-generating crypto infrastructure company. The revenue from staking could pay for operating expenses, lower dependency on equity issuance and support larger dividends. Management considers MAVAN ""best-in-class"" for secure staking infrastructure. ""Made in America"" positioning emphasizes regulatory compliance and political benefits as U.S. policymakers develop crypto regulations. Technical Analysis: Breakout Consolidation As per the weekly chart, it appears that investor perception changed significantly after BitMine announced on July 21, 2025 its results for Q2 2025. The stock gapped up over 170% in just a week which seemed to be a classic breakaway gap. Prior to the gap, the BMNR stock price was moving within a descending channel of about $160 to single digits. The breakaway gap caused shares to soar from roughly $10 to $70 and continued to push up the price all the way to $161 in October 2025. Since then, it has corrected sharply. Fibonacci retracement from the pre-gap low of $3.91 to the $159.96 high gives us the $66 level at the 0.236 retracement, $38.74 at 0.382, and the $25-28 at the 0.50 retracement. Trading View Right now, the equity is worth around $29-$30. The region in which the weekly moving averages overlaps would act as support. The previous test saw the value supported by the trend lines. Should the $25 support stay intact, then the technical set-up is primed for a return move towards the upper descending trendline at $131. It means over 300 percent upside from present levels. If $25 does not hold, the next support area is around $20, and $16 at the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Scenario Price Target Fibonacci Level Upside/Downside Bull Case $131 Upper Trendline +347% Base Case $66 0.236 Fib +126% Current $29-30 0.50 Fib - Bear Case 1 $20 Support -31% Bear Case 2 $16 0.618 Fib -45% The RSI has retraced from the overbought zone and is now in the neutral zone of 30-40. It means corrective actions may have been completed. The decline in volume fell below the advance, so bulls will take encouragement from that. Trading View Risks and Considerations BitMine involves risks that a serious investor needs to know. The price of Ethereum represents the gravest risk. Over 4 million ETH on the balance sheet means that a significant decline in the price of ETH will lead to a decline in book value and subsequently the firm's market valuation. As ETH trades 36% below its August 2025 highs, CoinDesk reports that BitMine is sitting on almost $3 billion in unrealised losses. The possibility of dilution is increasing. The number of shares increased significantly from 2.5 million in August 2024 to 384 million by November 2025 , and then to over 425 million by December 2025, following the company's use of an at-the-market equity programme used to fund ongoing ETH acquisitions. While it has created a large treasury, it has also diluted the current shareholders. Date Shares Outstanding Change August 2024 2.5M - August 2025 234.7M +9,288% November 2025 384M +64% December 2025 425M+ +11% The regulatory uncertainty associated with crypto assets may restrict the Ethereum price and the BitMine staking strategy. Changes in U.S. crypto policy could affect the firm's operations. Concentration risk is significant. BitMine has zero diversification, with its entire corporate value tied to Ethereum. In contrast to a diversified crypto fund, there is no protection against ETH underperformance. Legacy mining operations are still generating losses. Management is putting a stop to these, but they continue to drain cash in the interim. Valuation: Trading Below Assets BitMine presents an unusual valuation situation. Traditional metrics like P/E and EV/EBITDA are largely meaningless for a company whose value derives primarily from its crypto treasury. The most important measure is the price-to-book value. Investors are getting the BitMine assets for only 0.80x book, which is 20% less than book value. This compares favorably to closed-end crypto funds that often trade at premiums to NAV. ETH per share is another way to look at valuation. With 4.066 million ETH and approximately 425 million shares outstanding, one BMNR share represents about 0.0096 ETH. At the current ETH price near $3,000, this implies approximately $28.80 in ETH value per share, plus the proportional value of cash holdings. Component Value Total ETH Holdings 4,066,062 Shares Outstanding ~425M ETH per Share 0.0096 ETH ETH Price ~$3,000 ETH Value per Share $28.80 + Cash per Share ~$2.35 Total NAV per Share ~$31.15 The discount to NAV likely reflects execution risk around the treasury strategy, continued dilution risk, and general volatility of crypto assets. If investors are confident about Ethereum's long-term potential, then the most attractive find here is buying exposure at a discount to its spot value. Conclusion: Accumulate on Support Using traditional equity markets to gain exposure to Ethereum is differentiated by BitMine Immersion Technologies. With major movements done by the credible Tom Lee, this firm which was previously a Bitcoin miner has now turned into an Ethereum treasury. Moreover, today, this firm has become the biggest publicly-traded holder of ETH . The current stock price of $29-30 is below its book value although it has a $13.2 billion crypto and cash asset. The technical set up shows that stock is consolidating around the 0.50 Fibonacci support with weekly moving averages providing a cushion. If the support zone of $25 holds, the price can reach the $131 after touching the upper trendline. The MAVAN staking launch early in 2026 could be the catalyst that transforms passive holdings into yield-generating assets. My recommendation for investors with cryptocurrency volatility tolerance looking for an Ethereum play at a discount to NAV is buy. The size of the position should be aligned with this risk. If the stock breaks below $20, the bullish thesis will be invalidated. The supercycle thesis for ETH may not play out, but at current values, a lot of downside seems priced in while there is substantial upside if ETH can rise towards former highs.",ETH|BMNR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-26 16:41:46
56407475,648832,1766768408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56407475.jpeg,Why This Pundit Believes That XRP Holders Will Become Millionaires And Billionaires,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-millionaires-and-billionaires/,"A pundit has stirred conversation in the crypto community by suggesting that XRP holders could see unprecedented wealth, potentially reaching millionaire or billionaire status. He cites the evolving crypto regulatory landscape in the United States (US) and XRP’s potential to play a significant financial role in the economy , which could drive strong demand and value growth for the altcoin. Why XRP Holders Are Poised For Extraordinary Wealth Joshua Dalton, the founder of Triblu, an unfunded IT services company, predicted in an X post that XRP holders could become millionaires , billionaires, trillionaires, and even quadrillionaires. He stated that while Bitcoin enthusiasts, including Strategy founder Michael Saylor , may see little to no gains from the token in the future, community members are uniquely positioned to achieve extraordinary wealth. In his post, Dalton characterized the altcoin as a unique opportunity for financial growth, potentially surpassing what Bitcoin offers. Trading at just $1.86 compared with Bitcoin’s value of more than $88,000, XRP’s low price gives its investors a notable advantage. This affordability could prove especially beneficial to creating wealth if the cryptocurrency experiences a major price surge in the future . In Dalton’s case, the focus is not on price differences but on the potential impact the token could have on the US economy if it becomes a reserve currency . He argued that Bitcoin cannot serve as the official currency for the US reserves because its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , remains unknown. He also suggested that Bitcoin could potentially be controlled or operated by China, making it untrustworthy and unreliable for national financial purposes. On the other hand, the Triblu founder noted that the government can fully trust XRP because it is operated by Ripple and entirely based in the United States . Dalton emphasized that, unlike Bitcoin, the altcoin has the capacity to address the national challenges, including the roughly $38 trillion debt crisis . He framed it as a more reliable and strategically valuable asset for the country, highlighting its capacity to support large-scale economic stability in ways that Bitcoin cannot. XRP’s Potential Amid Evolving US Regulations Dalton’s remarks about XRP being a better reserve currency than Bitcoin for the US come amid evolving regulatory developments in the country. In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national reserve for Bitcoin and other altcoins, fueling rumors that the token could be included in the reserve. Additionally, this year, the US House of Representatives has passed multiple crypto-related bills, including the CLARITY ACT , GENIUS ACT, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. These legislative measures are expected to positively influence the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, potentially fostering wider adoption, increasing investor confidence, and creating a more stable environment for digital assets. This is particularly significant for XRP, especially following the resolution of its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has strengthened its legitimacy and growth prospects.",XRP|altcoins|CLARITY Act|Donald Trump|GENIUS Act|Joshua Dalton|michael saylor|ripple|Satoshi Nakamoto|Strategy|The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act|Triblu|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 17:00:08

That hesitation has not been due to a lack of utility or demand but to strict regulatory capital rules that made holding XRP economically impractical for regulated institutions. However, a small adjustment in how XRP is treated under global banking rules could remove that barrier and change how banks interact with the cryptocurrency. Why Banks Can’t Hold XRP The main obstacle preventing banks from holding XRP has been its treatment under the global banking framework known as Basel III. Basel III is an international regulatory framework developed after the 2008 financial crisis that introduces higher quality and quantity of capital requirements in the international banking sector. Right now, XRP currently falls into the Type 2 crypto exposure under Basel III, which is set up with rules for assets that pose higher risks. Under these rules, most cryptocurrencies, including XRP, fall into a high-risk category that carries a punitive capital requirement. Banks are required to apply a 1,250% risk weight to such assets, implying they must set aside far more capital than the value of the XRP itself. This means that under the Basel III framework, for every $1 of XRP exposure, a bank must hold $12.50 in capital. This dynamic was recently explained by a crypto commentator with the name Stern Drew on the social media platform X. In a post on X, Drew explained that this capital inefficiency alone accounts for years of institutional hesitation. The issue has not been demand nor technology, but the regulatory capital treatment that made holding XRP irrational from a balance sheet perspective. The Regulatory Inflection Point The conversation around XRP’s regulatory status is becoming increasingly important to its long-term outlook. Interestingly, Drew’s analysis goes further by pointing to what he describes as an inflection point that markets may be overlooking. Now that legal and regulatory clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies is improving, XRP could be reclassified into a lower-risk category under Basel III. The endgame is that XRP is on a clear path to becoming a Tier-1 digital asset for global institutions, which is mostly for tokenized traditional assets and stablecoins with strong mechanisms. If that reclassification occurs, the economics will change immediately. XRP would become acceptable for direct balance sheet exposure, allowing banks to custody, deploy, and settle using the asset without the need of excessive capital. This is not a discussion about short-term price movements but about capital mechanics that determine whether large pools of institutional money can participate in holding XRP at all. In this case, liquidity provisioning of XRP by banks would change from off-balance-sheet usage to direct institutional ownership.

Here’s What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-selling-pressure-fades-heres-whats-coming/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has revealed that XRP has returned to a major horizontal support level on the weekly chart. The analyst also noted that momentum indicators are at extreme oversold levels, adding to the bullish sentiment. In his post, the analyst highlighted the Stochastic RSI reading and noted that selling pressure has already done most of its work. He argued that market reversals tend to occur when one side runs out of fuel, not when conditions appear bullish. On the weekly chart, $XRP is back at a major horizontal support zone while momentum indicators are flashing extreme oversold conditions. The Stochastic RSI is sitting at extreme oversold levels, showing that selling pressure has already done a lot of work. Markets don’t… pic.twitter.com/1ljp2a28G3 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 25, 2025 Extreme Conditions on the Weekly Chart Steph shared a chart showing XRP sitting at a major horizontal support level. The zone has acted as a base during prior consolidation phases. The asset is now revisiting that area after a steady pullback from its peak in July . He also noted that momentum indicators are stretched. The Stochastic RSI is at 0.41, an extremely oversold level . According to Steph, this signifies that selling pressure has already played its part. Falling to similar oversold levels preceded previous rallies, and the asset could repeat this performance. Steph’s observation that markets only reverse when there is little fuel left on one side matters on this higher timeframe . Weekly oversold readings near established support often signal late-stage selling rather than the start of a fresh breakdown. Why This Support Zone Matters for XRP The highlighted support sits just under $2 on the chart. XRP previously used this level as a launch point before pushing toward the mid $3 range earlier in the cycle. The price structure suggests consolidation above this area before expansion, not brief wicks or shallow reactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Returning to this zone resets the market sentiment. Short-term traders often exit, reducing downside momentum. The current weekly candles suggest slowing sell pressure rather than acceleration. What Comes Next for XRP? Steph Is Crypto did not provide explicit upside targets in his post. From a technical perspective, the immediate question is whether XRP can hold this support on a weekly closing basis. Holding it keeps the structure intact, but losing it would open the door to deeper consolidation . If support holds, the first objective becomes reclaiming prior weekly closes above $2.30. That level aligns with former consolidation and would signal renewed demand. Above that, the $2.8 to $3 zone stands as the next area where sellers previously stepped in.

As markets rotate and capital looks for asymmetric opportunities, attention is quietly shifting toward the best presale crypto projects that combine structure, narrative, and early access advantages. This cycle, three names are repeatedly entering serious conversations: APEMARS ($APRZ), Litecoin ($LTC), and Monero ($XMR). Litecoin continues to demonstrate resilience as a mature asset holding key technical levels. Monero, meanwhile, is evolving beyond a privacy coin into a core infrastructure layer. Yet while these established networks attract long-term confidence, a different kind of opportunity is forming earlier in the curve. That is where APEMARS ($APRZ) enters the picture. Positioned as a narrative-driven, stage-based presale with a defined entry structure, it is quietly opening whitelist access before broader exposure begins. Early-stage access has historically been where the highest upside forms, long before confirmation reaches the crowd. This article breaks down why these assets matter right nowand why whitelist positioning is becoming one of the most strategic moves in crypto this year. APEMARS ($APRZ): Why Early Positioning Is Driving Serious Presale Interest Among emerging contenders in the best presale crypto projects category, APEMARS ($APRZ) stands out for one reason: a 23-stage structured mission. Unlike chaotic launches that rely on short-lived hype, APEMARS follows a clearly defined, multi-stage rollout inspired by a symbolic Mars mission. The whitelist is not a marketing gimmick. It is the gateway to Stage 1 access, where pricing is lowest, and token availability is highest. Each stage lasts one week or sells out earlier, meaning demand directly compresses time. As stages progress, supply tightens, and entry costs rise. Whitelist participants receive priority access before the public window opens. That positioning reduces execution risk and removes the need to chase allocations once momentum builds. It also provides early communication on stage transitions, access windows, and participation mechanics. $4,000 Today, Insane ROI Tomorrow: The Stage 1 FOMO Turning Heads Presales are defined by entry timing, and APEMARS ($APRZ) makes that math visible. At the Stage 1 price of $0.000016990, a $4,000 position secures a significantly larger allocation than later stages. With a projected listing price of $0.0055, the implied ROI potential reaches 32,271.98%. At listing, that same allocation would reflect an estimated value of $1,294,879.34. These numbers explain why early stages attract serious attention. Each stage lasts only one week or until tokens sell out, whichever happens first. That structure rewards decisiveness, not hesitation. As the presale advances, pricing increases, and upside compresses. Early positioning has always been where asymmetric outcomes form, and $APRZ makes that reality hard to ignore. Early Access Isn’t Open Forever: Here’s How to Join $APRZ Whitelist Visit the official APEMARS website. Enter your email in the whitelist section. Confirm your registration via email. Once registered, you position yourself ahead of public access to $APRZ at the lowest available stage price. Whitelist spots are limited, and early registration often determines allocation certainty. Those who wait usually compete later, at higher prices, with fewer tokens available. Getting listed now means staying ahead of demand instead of reacting to it. Litecoin ($LTC): Quiet Strength Beneath the Surface Litecoin continues to demonstrate why longevity matters in crypto. Trading around $77 on Christmas Day, $LTC has held firm during broader market hesitation. Charts show a tightening range with equal highs above and multiple equal lows below, a structure often associated with breakout phases. Recent price action reflects disciplined accumulation. A small green candle with bulls defending support reinforces Litecoin’s reputation as a stabilizing force during uncertain conditions. Often described as silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin continues grinding without drama. Its resilience, liquidity, and technical consistency keep it relevant for investors prioritizing durability over speculation. According to the best crypto to buy now site, Litecoin’s No. 14 ranking reflects its steady relevance, proven network resilience, and continued role as a reliable transactional asset in evolving markets. Monero ($XMR): Privacy Moves From Feature to Infrastructure Monero’s evolution is accelerating. $XMR is no longer viewed solely as a privacy coin but increasingly as an infrastructure component. Recent interoperability developments involving Polkadot ($DOT) and OpenZeppelin highlight this shift. OpenZeppelin’s implementation of ERC-7984 enables private, interoperable transfers across the $DOT ecosystem. This positions privacy as a foundational layer rather than an optional add-on. Monero’s relevance was further underscored by historic private donations totaling nearly $900,000 USD to the Free Software Foundation, all made in $XMR. These were among the largest private crypto donations ever received, reinforcing Monero’s real-world utility and ideological alignment. Final Thoughts: Where Structure, Stability, and Early Access Converge Markets reward preparation, not reaction. Litecoin offers proven resilience. Monero represents the future of private infrastructure. Yet for those evaluating the best presale crypto projects, early-stage positioning remains where the highest asymmetric opportunities form. APEMARS structured rollouts, defined pricing stages, and controlled access windows are becoming the new standard for serious launches. Projects that respect timing and community positioning tend to outperform those that rely purely on noise. Early access creates optionality. Optionality creates leverage. And leverage favors those who act before visibility peaks. APEMARS whitelist window does not stay open long; those who secure access early usually never need to chase it later.

Among the best presale crypto projects, investors often favor structured launches with transparent stages, limited early access, and clear demand signals. Projects offering whitelist priority and fixed progression tend to attract stronger early participation. Which crypto has 1000x potential? APEMARS is gaining attention due to its early-stage positioning, compressed presale structure, and narrative-driven rollout. Assets entering before public exposure historically present higher upside compared to post-listing entries. What is the biggest crypto presale in history? Historically, the largest presales combined massive community traction with long timelines. Unlike those, APEMARS focuses on speed, scarcity, and weekly progression, creating a different model optimized for modern market behavior. What makes APEMARS different from other presales? APEMARS uses a 23-stage mission structure with fixed weekly advancement, early whitelist access, and built-in incentives. This design rewards early participation while maintaining momentum through predictable, time-based progression. Why is whitelist access important in crypto presales? Securing whitelist access to $APRZ allows early participants to enter at the lowest stage pricing before public demand increases. This positioning reduces competition and improves allocation certainty during high-interest launch phases. Article Summary This article examines why capital is rotating toward the best presale crypto projects as investors seek early, asymmetric opportunities ahead of broader market confirmation. It highlights APEMARS ($APRZ) as a structured, narrative-driven presale offering with whitelist access, staged pricing, and early positioning advantages that historically deliver the highest upside. Alongside APEMARS, the article also covers Litecoin ($LTC) for its proven resilience and technical stability, and Monero ($XMR) for its evolution into a critical privacy and interoperability infrastructure. By comparing early-stage presale access with established market strength, the article explains why whitelist positioning, timing, and structure are becoming decisive factors for crypto investors in the current cycle.

LFGY: This Crypto Income ETF Is Beating Bitcoin While Others Erode,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855899-blox-vs-lfgy-this-crypto-income-etf-is-beating-bitcoin-while-others-erode?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary While the spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) delivered a negative return of -14.62% over the last 6 months, the BLOX fund provided investors with a +15.51% Total Return. Fundamental analysis reveals that BLOX's success stems from its use of underlying physical assets and put spreads, whereas YieldMax’s synthetic strategy for LFGY leads to inevitable capital erosion. My stress test indicates that in the event of a 20% Bitcoin drop, LFGY risks losing up to 45% of its NAV. Investment thesis This is the continuation of my series comparing funds with similar management structures and investment strategies. This time, we are looking at the Nicholas Crypto Income ETF ( BLOX ) and the YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ), which are notable for their use of option strategies. Since the current market for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency stocks is trending downward, the selection of assets that can demonstrate positive results regardless of the market cycle is important. Taking the last six months as an example, the total return of BLOX is +15.51%, whereas the spot iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is -14.62%. With this in mind, it is of fundamental interest to me to understand the ""secret"" of BLOX's success and determine whether LFGY can repeat its results or, even better, outperform them. My fundamental analysis has led me to be skeptical about LFGY, so my recommendation for this fund is to ""Hold,"" whereas for BLOX it is to ""Buy."" This article provides answers to all questions surrounding these funds. Fundamental similarities and differences between BLOX and LFGY The BLOX and LFGY funds are structurally similar exchange-traded funds focused on the development of the crypto industry. If BLOX is characterized by combining exposure to cryptocurrencies (through shares of cryptocurrency companies and ETFs with Bitcoin as the underlying asset) and option strategies to generate high returns, then LGFY is similar in its operating principle, except that it does not include spot ETH-BTC ETFs in its portfolio. In its place, YieldMax's portfolio managers work exclusively with shares of cryptocurrency companies (though not owning them directly). There is a similarity between these funds in their use of options strategies. For this reason, BLOX and LFGY's results are highly volatile and sensitive to the market cycle in the cryptocurrency market. In addition, such funds are essentially designed for a specific target audience of income investors who are willing to accept increased volatility and capital erosion risks in exchange for high returns. The sensitivity of fund performance to volatility reflects their ability to generate high returns. When the price of assets on the cryptocurrency market is more unstable, it becomes more expensive to buy options that portfolio managers sell. As a result, higher premiums are generated. At the same time, this feature limits growth. In other words, if, let's say, Bitcoin prices start to rise again quickly, the funds will sacrifice some of their profits because of the covered call strategy. But there are also differences, mostly related to how they build their portfolios. Check out BLOX, it's got a really balanced structure for a fund dealing with crypto assets. The main chunk is in three spot Bitcoin ETFs, making up 29.11% . This is followed by various assets that are directly or indirectly related to the development of the crypto industry. It even includes shares of companies that belong to the Mag-7. Nvidia, for example, accounts for 3.72% of the BLOX portfolio. Combining such different types of assets makes the fund's portfolio balanced, partially diversified, and included in the overall development of the crypto industry. Top 10 Holdings BLOX LFGY previously focused exclusively on cryptocurrency industry stocks. It mainly included shares of various miners, cryptocurrency treasury holders, and crypto exchanges. But today, it has a bunch of other assets, such as Nvidia shares and the Ethereum spot ETF (iShares Ethereum Trust ETF). Over time, these additions make the LFGY portfolio more balanced and diversified. The majority of the portfolio (11.51%) is made up of options expiring on February 20, 2026. These are long-term options on the underlying asset IBIT with a strike price of $10.01. The portfolios of the funds under review are quite similar in terms of their high concentration among the top 10 assets (56.2% for BLOX and 52.68% for LFGY). Top 10 Holdings LFGY The other difference between BLOX and LFGY lies in their income generation mechanics. Portfolio managers at BLOX employ a combination of selling call options and using put spreads. They do this depending on the market situation, using a modified version of the covered call strategy. The LFGY follows a synthetic scheme, because instead of directly owning shares in selected companies, the portfolio managers create a synthetic long position through options, by selling calls over them. As a result of this strategy, LFGY is characterized by capital erosion. The chart below shows the changes in total returns over the last 6 months (since BLOX began operating on June 16, 2025). The result is that BLOX's total return is 15.51%, whereas LFGY's is a loss of 2.66%. Such results only prove the hypothesis about the huge difference between BLOX and LFGY in terms of investment strategy, portfolio formation approach, and yield generation mechanics. Total Return, 6М Comparative table of BLOX and LFGY characteristics The table below compares the main criteria that distinguish BLOX from LFGY. Many criteria favor BLOX. Firstly, its more structured approach to asset selection and its combined options strategy. Although the risk concentration is more manageable, its asset structure is as high as that of LFGY. Several other metrics have similar values, and the dividend yield does not yet fully reflect the full potential of BLOX, the full extent of which will be determined after the first full year of dividend payments. For this reason, its performance is significantly lower. But for me, the overall return is still more important in assessing the attractiveness of these ETFs, where BLOX has a clear advantage. Criteria BLOX LFGY Key components BTC/ETH ETF + Stocks Crypto Stocks (Basket) Income Source Stock Options and ETFs Covered calls Counterparty Risk Moderate (diversification by class) High (dependence on MSTR and COIN) Beta to Bitcoin ~0.7 – 0.9 ~1.1 – 1.4 Number of Holdings 123 87 Assets in Top 10 56.20% 52.68% P/NAV 1.03х 1.01х Expense Ratio 1.03% 1.02% Short Interest 0.44% 0.05% AUM $215.09M $154.08M Dividend Yield (TTM) 20.94% 87.56% Dividend frequency Weekly Weekly Total Return, 1М 7.15% 3.99% Total Return, 6М 15.51% -2.66% Risks of investing in crypto industry ETFs during Bitcoin correction In one of my recent articles on IBIT, based on technical analysis, I downgraded Bitcoin from ""Buy"" to ""Hold."" The weekly chart shows a break below the lower boundary of the global uptrend channel, indicating a potential correction to the key support zone ($74,400–$78,200). This signal is also confirmed by the daily chart analysis, where the medium-term downward trend channel signals a decline to the above-mentioned price zone. Ultimately, it is likely that we will see a continuation of Bitcoin's corrective decline to 20%. Bitcoin Technical Analysis on the 1W Timeframe. Source: Tradingview Suppose this decline does occur. How will ETFs such as BLOX and LFGY be affected? For BLOX, I think the expected drop in NAV will be somewhere between 18% and 25%. Those parts of the fund's portfolio that are made up of spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as IBIT, would fall by exactly the same 20%. On the other hand, shares of crypto companies, including miners and exchanges, would lose somewhere between 30% and 40%. They have a beta of 1.5x to 2.0x relative to Bitcoin volatility. Still, using put spreads and rebalancing the investment portfolio would likely soften the blow. Volatility premiums from selling call options will offset up to 3% of the losses caused by the decline in the value of assets in the portfolio. In the end, fund performance may be comparable to the decline in Bitcoin prices. For LFGY, I expect NAV to drop somewhere between 35% and 45%. The fund's portfolio consists of shares in cryptocurrency companies, sometimes with a beta to Bitcoin volatility even higher than 2.0x. As an example, if Bitcoin's price drops by 1%, the price of MARA drops by 2.5%. Because the fund doesn't directly own the stocks but instead has a synthetic position through options, a moment of market panic can lead to a faster loss in value due to changes in the Greeks. Of course, selling call options partially offsets the loss with the premium received. However, this is likely to be no more than 5%. As with all YieldMax funds, the LFGY is characterized by significant capital erosion when prices collapse, due to which it will be much more difficult to restore the previous value of the shares. This is because selling calls leads to a reduction in potential profits from strong price growth. As a result, the drawdown will be deeper when investing in LFGY. Even though investors will receive higher dividends, capital erosion will be very strong, negatively affecting total returns. Conclusion The results of the comparative analysis between BLOX and LFGY reveal fundamental differences between them, as reflected in the actual performance of the funds. If I had to pick between these two assets, I would go with BLOX, as it has seen positive total return growth over the past six months, whereas LFGY is still in the red. An interesting fact is that if we look at the results of the Bitcoin spot ETF, IBIT, we see that its performance over the same period is even worse (-14.62%). It signals to investors that BLOX portfolio managers, through their options strategy, can offset losses from falling cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency stock prices by using a combination of selling call options and using put spreads. That is why my recommendation for BLOX is ""Buy,"" whereas for LFGY it is ""Hold.""",IBIT|IBIT:CA|BTC-USD|BLOX|LFGY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-26 17:19:40

In 2028, XLM will range between $0.903353 and $1.03, with an average price of $0.967878. The token could reach as high as $1.68 in 2031. Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and payment protocol launched in July 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Developed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, it aims to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Stellar operates on its blockchain, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to validate transactions, which enhances security and efficiency. One of Stellar’s key features is its ability to enable currency exchange between different fiat and digital assets. The network charges a minimal transaction fee of 0.00001 XLM, making it an attractive option for users seeking affordable transaction solutions for real world assets with low transaction costs. Stellar is particularly focused on financial inclusion, targeting unbanked populations in developing regions by providing access to essential financial services without traditional banking systems and as an alternative to traditional money. XLM, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network, is used for transaction fees and as a bridge currency in cross-asset transactions. Initially, there were 100 billion XLM, but in 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation burned approximately half of the total supply to enhance its value and utility. Today, around 30.6 billion XLM are in circulation, with the network gaining traction for its real-world applications in remittances and asset transfers due to its ongoing project developments. Is XLM a good investment? Will it go up? Is Stellar Lumens a buy or sell? Where will it be in 5 years? We answer these questions and more in our Stellar’s Cryptopolitan Price Prediction.

Further upside might be observed soon, as the buyers continue to advance. Is Stellar a good investment? Stellar (XLM) has potential as a long-term investment due to its focus on facilitating fast, low-cost international payments and its growing utility. While past performance shows significant volatility, XLM has outperformed many top cryptocurrencies. With the upcoming launch of smart contracts via Soroban, Stellar’s utility is set to expand massively in 2026. However, the coin’s price is closely tied to its adoption, and competition from other cryptocurrencies poses risks. Ultimately, Stellar’s viability as an investment depends on your risk tolerance and belief in its future growth potential, so your own research or professional advice is suggested. Why is XLM up? Stellar Lumens (XLM) has struggled to gain traction due to its high circulating supply, which limits price growth potential. Additionally, its price movements often lag behind the broader cryptocurrency market, and ongoing operational sales by the Stellar Development Foundation contribute to downward pressure; however, the token’s price has increased today. Will XLM reach $1? Predictions for Stellar Lumens (XLM) suggest it is likely to reach $1 in the near future. Most forecasts estimate prices between $0.903353 and $1.03 by 2028, indicating significant gains for the coin, making it a good option to buy Stellar tokens. Will XLM reach $3? XLM is not expected to reach $3 by 2032. During this time, it is expected to achieve a maximum price of $1.89, which is less than $3 but still makes it a good decision to buy XLM coins; however, this is not investment advice. Will XLM reach $10? Current predictions suggest that Stellar Lumens (XLM) is unlikely to reach $10 in the near future. Most forecasts estimate its price will remain below $3 through 2032, with some projections suggesting a maximum of around $4.05. How much will stellar lumens be worth in 2030? Stellar (XLM) is expected to trade anywhere from $1.33 to $1.46 in 2030. How safe is XLM? Stellar (XLM) is a relatively safe cryptocurrency with a strong foundation, regular protocol updates, and partnerships with major entities. However, the crypto market is unpredictable, and potential investors should be cautious due to possible regulation changes. Does Stellar Lumens have a future? Stellar Lumens (XLM) shows potential for a positive long-term future due to its innovative blockchain technology and strategic partnerships, particularly in cross-border payments. Analysts predict significant price increases, potentially reaching $1.89 by 2032, driven by ongoing developments and market adoption.

XLM historical price sentiment XLM price history Stellar (XLM) was launched in April 2015, starting with a price of approximately $0.00279. The cryptocurrency experienced a challenging year, closing at around $0.00175, marking it as one of its worst years. In 2016, XLM’s price further declined to an average of $0.00200, with a maximum price of $0.00338. The following year, 2017, was a turning point, as Stellar surged significantly, reaching an average price of $0.0335 and peaking at $0.3904, as per historical data of financial markets. The bullish momentum continued into 2018, where XLM hit its all-time high of $0.9381 in January. However, the price fell sharply throughout the year, closing at approximately $0.1103. In the subsequent years, XLM’s price fluctuated, with notable lows in 2019 around $0.0450 and a recovery in 2021, where it reached $0.7930. In July 2023, Stellar’s price jumped to $0.159, reflecting its volatility and potential for growth in the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin has erased its recent peak. Ethereum is also grappling with regaining grounds. Memes coins formerly dominating the headlines are declining. When such occurs, attention is not lost. It shifts. Capital is leaking out to projects that are as yet young, as yet in construction, and as yet off the radar. That is beginning to change in Q4 2025, and one DeFi altcoin is already beginning to emerge. The Sudden Interest of Investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The latter is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At a time when most crypto coins have been trading in straight lines, Mutuum Finance is receiving interest due to what it is creating, as opposed to short-term price action. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a loaning and borrowing protocol aimed at maintaining capital on the chain. Users will be able to place the assets to earn or borrow against collateral in a system that would adjust rates according to actual demand. This construction is important at times of puzzles in the market. It puts capital in motion instead of laying it down. The story also involves timing. As stated on X, official statements, V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol is scheduled to run on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Its liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot are its core features, and the first assets are ETH and USDT. To a large number of traders, the product timeline represents putting money on something with confidence when crypto prices at large are stalled. Protocol Growth Since Early 2025 The data on participation surrounding Mutuum Finance has been made more difficult to disregard. The project has raised $19.45M and has 18,650 holders. Such numbers are important since they indicate consistent participation whether on a large scale or not only a few individuals in the early stages who backed the company. This actually is a confidence sign to the market commentators. It implies that interest is being maintained in the long term as opposed to sudden spurts. When the index of crypto fear and greed are at their ups and downs, consistent partaking could speak more than the favored price. To anyone who is a crypto investment tracking analyst, these metrics indicate that attention is on Mutuum Finance because the company is in a period where investors are increasingly demanding when it comes to depositing assets in any particular entity. Price Flow, Price Movement and Token Structure The MUTM has a current selling price of $0.035 and is in presale Phase 6 currently which is more than 99% assigned. The maximum quantity of supply is 4B tokens. Out of this, 45.5% is assigned to early distribution which amounts to approximately 1.82B tokens. There are 825M tokens that have been sold so far. The outstanding fact has been the trend of price. MUTM started at $0.01 and has increased step by step to where it is at present, and this is a 250% growth. The initial launch price will be determined as $0.06 which poses expectations as we move to the next level. The movement of prices has been documented in an orderly manner rather than the jumps. Analysts are known to point out that such a development may make the volatility after launch less volatile since less people will be sitting on stark gains. Infrastructure and Security Development has been building alongside security. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit with a score of 90/100 scan of a token. Meanwhile, Halborn Security is also conducting an independent review, which analyzes final lending and borrowing agreements. There is also a $50k bug bounty that is active to promote the finding of any existing code issues. These layers are important to a lending protocol. Collateral, liquidations and user funds management need the trust in the code. Early security investment is also seen by analysts as an expectation by a project to last, rather than launch hype. Infrastructure plans indicate this point of view. Mutuum Finance plans to make use of decentralized oracle feeds like Chainlink, although fallback sources will be used in order to achieve stable pricing. The roadmap also includes the development of stablecoins so that the borrowers can use various kinds of collateral. Aligning the L2 would minimize fee charges and enhance speed, which is essential in use of active DeFi. Looking Forward Q1 2026 Urgently, as Phase 6 tight ends. Allocation is almost at 100% and market commentators have reported a recent six figure increase in whale interest. Bigger purchasers tend to seek occasions of restricted provision and milestones being near. Activity is further maintained by a 24-hour leaderboard that will give the best daily depositor $500 in MUTM, which will ensure continued participation. The use of card payments has also reduced friction by new entrants, which will help increase participation at the critical stages. When considering 2026 (Q1), analysts are noticing that Mutuum Finance is setting itself, at a time when such an event is uncommon. Its product roadmap, security model and supply forces are in line as much of the wider market turns activated. To investors who want to know which crypto to buy today or what is the best altcoin now to position in the long-term, this DeFi token with the price of $0.035 is entering the discussion. With the long way to go at Q4 2025 and the focus still being on a shift, Mutuum Finance is coming out as one of the newly developed cryptocurrencies that could define where the next cycle will start.

According to Bloomberg, the DXY Index dropped 0.8% this week, putting it on pace for the worst weekly loss since June. The dollar is also about to wrap up the year with an 8% decline, its biggest drop since 2017, and it’s sitting at its lowest level since September. With the UK markets shut on Friday and trading activity muted by the holidays, investors are now focused on a batch of U.S. economic data coming in January. The December jobs report and inflation readings are the ones everyone’s waiting for. The Fed just cut borrowing costs for the third straight time this year last month. What happens next depends entirely on whether that data comes in hot or cold. Right now, markets are leaning toward more cuts. Currency traders bet against the dollar as liquidity dries up The dollar’s slide this week was helped by rising appetite for risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone, which both outperformed. Over in the bond market, the dollar’s pain has been Treasuries’ gain. 10-year yields dropped about three basis points to 4.12%, staying in a tight range but pointing to steady buying. Traders have nearly priced in a 90% chance that the Fed won’t touch rates at the next meeting. But markets still expect at least two more quarter-point cuts by year-end, one by mid-year, and another before 2026 kicks in. While the dollar floundered, stocks stayed in party mode. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high on Friday. The Dow and Nasdaq were also hovering around weekly gains of more than 1%. It’s the fourth winning week out of the last five for the S&P, even though trading volumes were light coming off the Christmas holiday. Wednesday’s session was already a record-breaker, with the S&P notching new intraday and closing highs. U.S. markets were closed on Thursday, but traders returned Friday still riding the momentum. Investors are deep into what’s known as the Santa Claus rally, that quiet year-end stretch that historically lifts stocks. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.3% gain during this seven-day window, based on Stock Trader’s Almanac data. Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management, said, “People are taking profits here and there, or buying on lows, but there’s not a lot of information. You’re not getting corporate profit results. You’re not getting a lot of economic data, so it’s probably just more technicals and positioning heading into here.” Tom also pointed to a change in what’s driving the market, which is tech stocks weren’t behind the latest gains, instead, it was financials and industrials. “That just gives more confidence heading into 2026 that it’s not just tech here and everybody behind them,” Tom said. “It’s the market benefiting from the tax bill that was signed in July, the rate cuts that came in the fourth quarter of this year. Heading into 2026, those are some tailwinds.” Get seen where it counts.

His analysis reveals that community loyalty alone cannot guarantee long-term viability in the evolving digital asset landscape. Consequently, projects must demonstrate tangible utility to withstand the 2025 market cycle. XRP and ADA Face Critical Utility Test Mike Novogratz recently highlighted a significant market shift during a Galaxy Digital quarterly briefing. He emphasized that cryptocurrencies must now prove concrete business applications. Furthermore, the financial services executive pointed specifically to Ripple’s XRP and Cardano’s ADA as examples. These tokens face increasing pressure to move beyond community enthusiasm. The cryptocurrency market undergoes constant evolution with each cycle. Novogratz observes that projects relying solely on dedicated followers face diminishing prospects. Meanwhile, competitors with clear revenue models continue emerging. The Galaxy Digital CEO explains this transition represents market maturation. Therefore, investors increasingly prioritize fundamentals over hype. Market Evolution Demands Tangible Value The cryptocurrency sector demonstrates remarkable transformation since Bitcoin’s inception. Initially, technological innovation and community building drove most projects. However, the 2025 landscape requires more substantial foundations. Regulatory developments and institutional adoption accelerate this change significantly. Novogratz references historical market patterns to support his analysis. Previous cycles witnessed numerous projects fading after initial excitement. For instance, many 2017 ICO tokens disappeared despite strong communities. The Galaxy Digital CEO suggests similar patterns could affect current major assets. Thus, demonstrating utility becomes essential for survival. Expert Analysis of Revenue Structures Financial analysts increasingly examine cryptocurrency revenue models. Traditional businesses generate cash flow through products and services. Similarly, blockchain projects must establish sustainable economic mechanisms. Novogratz specifically mentions several key metrics for evaluation: Transaction fee revenue – Sustainable networks generate value through usage Protocol revenue distribution – Clear mechanisms for value capture Enterprise adoption metrics – Measurable business integration Developer activity – Consistent ecosystem growth beyond speculation Comparative analysis reveals significant differences among major cryptocurrencies. The following table illustrates key utility metrics for selected projects: Cryptocurrency Primary Use Case Enterprise Partnerships Developer Activity (2024) XRP Cross-border payments Multiple financial institutions Moderate growth Cardano (ADA) Smart contracts platform Government collaborations Strong growth Ethereum Decentralized applications Extensive enterprise adoption Very strong growth Solana High-throughput applications Growing Web3 integration Rapid growth Community Loyalty Versus Business Fundamentals Cryptocurrency communities represent powerful network effects. However, Novogratz argues they cannot substitute for economic fundamentals. The Galaxy Digital CEO acknowledges community importance for initial adoption. Nevertheless, he stresses that sustainable value requires broader utility. XRP demonstrates this dynamic through its payment network adoption. Ripple continues expanding its financial institution partnerships. Meanwhile, Cardano focuses on academic research and government applications. Both projects maintain dedicated communities while pursuing utility expansion. Market data supports Novogratz’s perspective on valuation drivers. During the 2021-2022 cycle, projects with clear utility demonstrated greater resilience. Conversely, purely speculative assets experienced sharper declines. This pattern suggests increasing investor sophistication regarding fundamentals. Regulatory Environment Accelerates Change Global regulatory developments significantly impact cryptocurrency evaluation. Regulatory clarity often favors projects with identifiable utility. Securities classifications frequently depend on economic reality rather than technical claims. Consequently, projects must demonstrate genuine functionality. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission maintains ongoing cryptocurrency oversight. Their actions consistently emphasize economic substance over form. Similarly, international regulators increasingly focus on consumer protection and financial stability. These regulatory pressures accelerate the utility-focused transition that Novogratz describes. Future Projections for Blockchain Adoption Industry analysts project continued blockchain integration across sectors. Financial services represent the most advanced adoption area. However, supply chain management, healthcare, and digital identity show promising developments. Successful cryptocurrency projects will likely demonstrate cross-industry utility. Novogratz references Galaxy Digital’s internal research during his comments. The firm tracks numerous utility metrics across blockchain networks. Their analysis suggests divergence between projects with genuine adoption and those without. This divergence may intensify during the next market cycle. Institutional investors increasingly apply traditional evaluation frameworks to digital assets. They examine revenue potential, competitive advantages, and management quality. Consequently, cryptocurrency projects face growing pressure to demonstrate business fundamentals. This institutional scrutiny represents a significant market evolution. Conclusion Mike Novogratz delivers a timely warning about cryptocurrency survival requirements. His analysis emphasizes that XRP and ADA must prove utility beyond community loyalty. The 2025 market cycle will likely reward projects with tangible business foundations. Therefore, blockchain networks must demonstrate real-world value creation to ensure long-term viability. Market evolution continues favoring substance over speculation as the industry matures. FAQs Q1: What specific utility does Mike Novogratz believe XRP and ADA need to demonstrate? Novogratz emphasizes tangible business applications beyond community support, including clear revenue structures, enterprise adoption, and measurable real-world usage that generates sustainable value. Q2: How does the 2025 cryptocurrency market differ from previous cycles? The 2025 market shows increased institutional participation, regulatory clarity, and investor focus on fundamentals rather than speculation, creating greater pressure for projects to demonstrate utility. Q3: What examples exist of cryptocurrencies successfully demonstrating real-world utility? Ethereum demonstrates utility through extensive decentralized application development, while blockchain networks like Chainlink provide verifiable oracle services, and several enterprise blockchain solutions show measurable business integration. Q4: How can investors evaluate whether a cryptocurrency has genuine utility? Investors should examine enterprise partnerships, developer activity metrics, protocol revenue generation, transaction volume trends, and verifiable use cases beyond trading and speculation. Q5: What timeframe does Novogratz suggest for this utility-focused market transition? While not specifying exact dates, Novogratz indicates the transition is already underway and will likely intensify during the next full market cycle, with projects needing to demonstrate utility within the coming years to maintain relevance.

While market cycles rise and fall, online commentators continue to shape sentiment, highlight emerging narratives, and influence how retail and institutional participants interpret price action and industry developments. For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding which influencers provide value — and how to consume their content critically — will be essential in navigating the next phase of the crypto market. The 2026 cycle is widely expected to be shaped by post-halving dynamics, increasing institutional involvement, evolving regulation, and further convergence between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Against that backdrop, influencers who combine market awareness, technical insight, and consistency are likely to stand out. Why Crypto Influencers Still Matter Crypto markets move faster than traditional finance. News, rumours, and sentiment often spread first on social media platforms before appearing in mainstream financial coverage. Crypto influencers can therefore act as early indicators of shifting narratives, whether that involves Bitcoin dominance, altcoin rotations, layer-2 adoption, or regulatory changes. However, influence does not automatically equal accuracy. The best market participants treat influencer commentary as one input among many, rather than as direct financial advice. Those who benefit most from crypto influencers are typically individuals who use them to gather perspectives, not instructions. Technical Analysts and Market Commentators One category likely to remain highly relevant in 2026 is technical analysts who focus on price structure, cycles, and market psychology. Crypto Rover, known on X as @CryptoRover, has become a prominent voice in this space and has been ranked as the best crypto influencer by iBusiness.News . His content combines technical chart analysis with market commentary, helping followers interpret potential trends before they hit mainstream awareness. Crypto Rover’s approachable style makes complex indicators understandable for both beginners and experienced traders. Many investors follow his updates to gauge market sentiment and spot early signals of volatility or potential bull trends. Influencers Bridging Education and Market Insight Beyond purely technical analysis, some influencers focus on educating their audience about blockchain fundamentals, project evaluations, and the wider crypto ecosystem. These influencers are particularly valuable for 2026, as markets mature and new participants enter with varying levels of experience. Understanding tokenomics , network utility, and regulatory implications is as important as reading charts. Combining education with timely market commentary allows followers to make informed decisions rather than acting on hype alone. Social Media Strategy and Risk Awareness Engaging with crypto influencers in 2026 requires discernment. Followers should cross-reference insights, track historical accuracy, and avoid relying on a single voice for decision-making. Social media can amplify emotional responses, and impulsive moves based on trending posts often result in losses. Investors who integrate influencer perspectives with personal research and risk management strategies are more likely to navigate the market successfully. Conclusion Crypto influencers will continue to play a central role in shaping how participants approach the market in 2026. From technical analysts like Crypto Rover (@CryptoRover) to educational content creators and institutional commentators, followers have more tools than ever to stay informed. The key to benefiting from these voices lies in critical consumption, balancing insights with independent analysis, and maintaining disciplined trading strategies. Those who master this balance can leverage influencer content to enhance understanding, identify opportunities, and reduce the impact of market noise.

56409809,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884570,1766771462,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56409809.jpeg,"AI supercharges cybercrime as scams grow faster, cheaper and harder to spot",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-is-making-cyber-scams-more-believable/,"Cybercriminals are using artificial intelligence to pull off more elaborate schemes. They’re targeting everything from retirement savings to corporate secrets with methods that keep getting harder to spot. The same technology that tailors advertisements to online shoppers is now being used by bad actors to gather personal details and launch custom scams fast. Really fast. Major AI companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google report that criminals are tapping into their platforms to orchestrate complex phishing operations, develop harmful software, and execute various digital attacks. Security specialists warn that criminals are also producing fake audio and video clips of company leaders to trick employees into giving up sensitive information. Businesses and government offices may soon face swarms of AI-powered systems that can spot weaknesses in computer networks and then plan and carry out attacks with almost no human help. The technology is changing how criminals operate online. Alice Marwick heads research at Data & Society, an independent technology research organization. She told the Wall Street Journal that the biggest shift involves size and reach. “The real change is scope and scale. Scams are bigger, more targeted, more convincing.” Brian Singer is a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University. He studies how large language models are used in cyberattacks and defenses. His estimate? Half to three-quarters of worldwide spam and phishing messages now come from AI systems. The attacks themselves have gotten more believable. AI systems trained on company communications can produce thousands of messages that sound natural and match a company’s style. They copy how executives write. They mention recent news found in public records. The technology also helps overseas scammers hide language mistakes that used to make their attempts obvious. Criminals can impersonate victims through fake videos and copied voices . They use the same fake identity to target several people at once. John Hultquist is chief analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group. He describes the main shift as “credibility at scale.” Bad actors are also getting better at picking targets. They use AI to look through social media and find people dealing with major life difficulties. Divorce, family deaths, losing a job, and situations that might make someone more vulnerable to romance tricks, investment fraud, or fake job offers. Dark web markets lower entry barrier The barrier to entry for cybercrime has dropped. Underground markets now sell or rent AI tools for criminal work for as little as $90 each month. Nicolas Christin leads Carnegie Mellon’s software and societal systems department. He said that these platforms come with different pricing levels and customer help. “Developers sell subscriptions to attack platforms with tiered pricing and customer support.” These services go by names like WormGPT, FraudGPT, and DarkGPT. They can create harmful software and phishing campaigns. Some even include teaching materials on hacking techniques. Margaret Cunningham is vice president of security and AI strategy at Darktrace, a security company. She says it’s simple. “You don’t need to know how to code, just where to find the tool.” There’s a recent development called vibe-coding or vibe-hacking. It could let aspiring criminals use AI to make their own malicious programs rather than purchasing them from underground sources. Anthropic disclosed earlier this year that it had stopped several attempts to use its Claude AI for creating ransomware by “criminals with few technical skills.” Criminal operations themselves are changing. Cybercrime has worked like a business marketplace for years now, according to experts. A typical ransomware operation involved different groups. Access brokers who broke into company networks and sold entry. Intrusion teams who moved through systems stealing data. And ransomware-as-a-service providers who released the malware, handled negotiations, and divided the money. Speed and automation reshape criminal networks AI has increased the speed , size, and availability of this system. Work previously done by people with technical knowledge can now run automatically. This lets these groups operate with fewer people, less risk, and higher profits. “Think of it as the next layer of industrialization. AI increases throughput without requiring more skilled labor,” Christin explains. Can AI launch attacks completely on its own? Not quite yet. Experts compare the situation to the push for fully self-driving vehicles. The first 95% has been achieved. But the final part that would let a car drive anywhere, anytime by itself remains out of reach. Researchers are testing AI’s hacking abilities in lab environments. A team at Carnegie Mellon, supported by Anthropic, recreated the famous Equifax data breach using AI earlier this year. Singer led the work at Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab Security and Privacy Institute. He calls it “a big leap.” Criminals exploit AI for harmful purposes. But AI companies say the same tools can help organizations strengthen their digital defenses. Anthropic and OpenAI are building AI systems that can continuously examine software code to locate weaknesses that criminals might exploit. People still must approve any fixes though. A recent AI program developed by Stanford researchers performed better than some human testers when searching for security problems in a network. Even AI won’t stop all breaches. That’s why organizations must focus on creating tough networks that keep working during attacks, Hultquist says.

The split between record network demand and muted price action has sharpened debate around whether Ethereum’s fundamentals are strengthening quietly while short-term market conditions keep prices restrained. Record Transactions Highlight Growing Ethereum Usage Data shared by CryptoOnchain showed Ethereum’s seven-day average transaction count climbing to a new peak of about 1.73 million, the highest level in the network’s history. At the same time, ETH was trading around $2,950, well below its 2021 and 2025 highs, highlighting a clear gap between usage and valuation. The analyst attributed the jump in activity to a combination of Layer-2 networks settling transactions on Ethereum, rising DeFi activity, and steady stablecoin transfers. Unlike previous cycles, this growth has occurred without sharp fee spikes, suggesting the network is handling heavier demand more efficiently. Broader on-chain data from late December supports that view. As CryptoPotato reported previously, large ETH holders have continued adding to positions, with wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH increasing their combined balances to over 21 million coins. At the same time, exchange reserves have fallen by more than 4 million ETH over the past year, pointing to reduced liquid supply. However, not all short-term signals are supportive, with market updates shared by analyst Amr Taha on December 25 showing around $1.4 billion worth of ETH flowing into major exchanges such as Kraken and Binance over a 48-hour period. These deposits followed heavy USDT withdrawals from centralized platforms, a mix that often appears during periods of selling or defensive positioning. Price Stalls Near $3,000 as Liquidity Pressures Build Meanwhile, at the market, ETH was trading at just under $3,000 at the time of this writing, up less than 1% in the last 24 hours and rather flat over the past seven days. The change in price is more pronounced across longer timeframes, with the token down nearly 9% over two weeks and about 14% in the past year. Trading data shows ETH moving within a tight range between $2,900 and $3,000, with volatility lower than earlier in the quarter. However, analysts are still watching the $3,100 area, a level that has capped advances several times in recent years. According to them, a sustained move above that zone could reopen higher targets, while failure to hold current support will keep downside risks in focus. Despite the near-term pressure, Ethereum’s rising transaction load carries longer-term implications. More network usage means higher ETH burn through EIP-1559, gradually reducing supply growth. And with Ethereum still hosting most DeFi value and stablecoin issuance, the mismatch between network demand and price has become harder for investors to ignore. For now, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap sits at an uneasy balance point: strong fundamentals below the surface, but liquidity conditions and exchange flows still shaping price direction in the weeks ahead.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $110K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $86,960 (-1%) Market capitalization $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $89,650 24-hour low $86,500 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $86,960 Price Prediction $ 97,689 (+7.52%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 7.85% (High) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 102,576 200-Day SMA $ 104,352 14-Day RSI 39.65 (Neutral) Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure below $87K Resistance for BTC is at $90,551 Support for BTC/USD is at $85,045 The BTC price analysis for 26 December confirms that BTC faces a decline in bullish volatility as the price declines below $87K. Currently, the price is aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces minor selling pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it dropped below $87K. Currently, the BTC price is facing selling domination around immediate resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.51 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $86,960, decreasing by over 1% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades at 41, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buying domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $100K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.63, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD indicator has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $90,551, it will fuel a bullish rally to $95,568. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $85,045, beginning a bearish trend to $82,598. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , PayPal has launched a sweepstakes running from November 17 to December 21, offering weekly prizes and a total of 1,008 winners for eligible U.S. residents. The company promoted the event on X, highlighting over $1 million in bitcoin prizes with no purchase required. Bitcoin price prediction December 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around December 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2025 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $110,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-26 18:01:00
56409978,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93370,1766772141,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts XRP Price for January 1, 2026",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-xrp-price-for-january-1-2026/,"Market participants continue to seek credible signals as they attempt to assess where XRP may trade at the start of 2026. With price action shaped by a combination of macroeconomic forces, regulatory developments, and digital asset market cycles, long-term forecasting remains complex. In response to this uncertainty, artificial intelligence–driven models are increasingly being referenced for structured, data-based outlooks. Among these, Google Gemini has attracted attention for its analytical ability to focus on probability and historical patterns, and its recent outlook for XRP has added a more measured perspective to the ongoing discussion around early 2026 valuations. Google Gemini’s XRP Price Outlook for January 1, 2026 In its assessment of XRP’s potential valuation by the beginning of 2026, Google Gemini outlines a scenario centered on relative stability. The model notes that, “Based on current market structure, historical performance, and projected growth across the digital asset sector, XRP is most likely to trade within a range rather than experience an abrupt repricing by early 2026.” Gemini further explains that “a reasonable trading range for XRP around January 1, 2026, would fall between approximately $1.80 and $2.00, assuming no extraordinary macroeconomic or regulatory shocks.” This forecast positions XRP close to its established market behavior, suggesting continuity rather than a dramatic departure from recent trends. Factors Behind Gemini’s Projected XRP Trading Range Several variables underpin Gemini’s projected range. One of the most significant is the expectation of moderate growth across the cryptocurrency market, void of the speculation that has characterized previous cycle peaks. The model also accounts for XRP’s historical tendency to move in alignment with overall market liquidity rather than in isolation. In addition, growing inflows into XRP-linked exchange-traded products are viewed as a supportive factor, reinforcing baseline demand without introducing excessive volatility. Under these combined assumptions, gradual price appreciation or extended consolidation is considered more probable than sudden exponential gains within the given timeframe. Macroeconomic considerations further shape the forecast. Interest rate policy, global liquidity conditions, and investor risk tolerance all play critical roles in determining capital flows into digital assets. Gemini’s outlook implicitly assumes a neutral to moderately supportive macro environment, where cryptocurrencies remain relevant but do not command outsized speculative attention.

This backdrop supports a stable pricing framework for XRP rather than extreme volatility. Regulatory Context and the Limits of Predictive Models Regulatory clarity remains another important assumption within Gemini’s analysis. The model suggests that the absence of severe regulatory disruption is essential for XRP to maintain or modestly improve its valuation by early 2026. At the same time, it acknowledges that unfavorable policy developments could pressure prices below the projected range. Ultimately, Google Gemini’s prediction is best understood as a probabilistic guide rather than a definitive target.

It’s ugly in price, but pretty helpful if you’re sitting on stock profits. With the S&P 500 rallying by 18% year-to-date while Bitcoin is down about 5%, investors who own assets in both are now dumping their crypto losses to cancel out equity gains. Tom Geoghegan, who runs Beacon Hill Private Wealth in New Jersey, said: “Tax-loss harvesting in crypto is being treated as part of the overall tax strategy, especially in a year of strong equity market performance, rather than as a standalone tactic.” Crypto investors sell and rebuy fast without IRS limits Tax-loss harvesting works like this: sell an asset that’s gone down, claim the loss, and use it to cut your tax bill. You can wipe out capital gains dollar-for-dollar, and if the losses are bigger than the gains, you can also cut up to $3,000 from your regular income, while rolling over any leftover into next year. For stocks, the IRS wash-sale rule says you can’t buy the same stock back within 31 days or you lose the deduction. But with crypto, the IRS sees Bitcoin as property, not a security, so if you sell it and then buy it back right away, no problem. “You can sell that Bitcoin, buy it on that same day, and it doesn’t trigger that limitation,” said Robert Persichitte, a CPA and financial planner at Delagify Financial near Denver. Will Cong, a finance professor at Cornell, said timing matters this year. If someone bought Bitcoin during the autumn peak and held on, they’re now deep in the red. “A 30% decline from an autumn peak tends to create precisely that situation for more recent entrants, which historically amplifies year-end selling pressure,” Cong told Bloomberg. Final weeks of 2025 show rise in deliberate crypto tax strategies Because there’s no 31-day wait rule in crypto, people are doing the sell-and-rebuy move all in one go. Cong said, “The lack of a wash-sale constraint makes the ‘harvest-and-rebuy’ trade easier to execute immediately, and that tends to concentrate activity around the most tax-salient dates.” In simple terms? The selling happens fast and near the deadline. And this isn’t just a bunch of traders winging it. Geoghegan said clients are thinking about Bitcoin more seriously. They’re using crypto losses to offset stock or private investment gains. “In some cases, clients are harvesting losses and re-establishing exposure quickly; in others, they’re using harvested losses to offset realized gains elsewhere, such as equities or private investments,” he said . It’s no longer just about crypto. It’s part of a bigger tax plan now. But the future might get trickier. Cong said crypto didn’t really show the typical “January effect” until after the IRS cracked down in 2018. And by 2026, the crackdown will go further. Brokers and exchanges will have to file a new form, 1099-DA, reporting crypto sale proceeds to the IRS for the first time. This, of course, raises the stakes. “More volatility makes this more important to consider,” said Persichitte. “If you can harvest that loss with very little restriction or consequences, it makes the loss a lot more palatable.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Bitcoin|IRS,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-26 18:13:16

From renewed pressure on the IRS over staking taxes to the Federal Reserve exploring new account models for payment firms, regulators are confronting how digital assets can be integrated into financial frameworks designed for a very different era. Lawmakers Renew Push on Staking Tax Treatment A bipartisan group of 18 US House lawmakers has urged the Internal Revenue Service to revisit how crypto staking rewards are taxed, arguing that current interpretations amount to double taxation and discourage participation in blockchain networks. A bipartisan group of 18 US House lawmakers is calling on the Internal Revenue Service to revisit how crypto staking rewards are taxed. #Crypto #Tax https://t.co/wJTvU94x7r — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 In a letter sent to acting IRS commissioner Scott Bessent, the group—led by Representative Mike Carey—called existing guidance “burdensome” and asked for a review before 2026. Under prevailing interpretations, staking rewards are treated as taxable income when received, based on their market value at that time, and are then taxed again if sold at a gain. Lawmakers argue this approach fails to reflect actual economic profit, particularly in volatile markets where token prices can fluctuate sharply between receipt and sale. “This letter is simply requesting fair tax treatment for digital assets,” Carey said, adding that taxing rewards only when sold would be a meaningful step toward clarity. The renewed pressure highlights a broader debate over whether staking should be treated like earned income or more akin to unrealised asset appreciation—an issue that remains unresolved as staking becomes more central to proof-of-stake networks. Fed Explores New Access to Payment Rails Separately, the Federal Reserve opened a consultation that could reshape how crypto and payment-focused firms interact with the US banking system. The Fed is seeking public comment on a proposed “payment account,” a limited-use central bank account designed to sit alongside—but remain distinct from—the traditional master account used by banks. @federalreserve seeks public feedback on a new “payment account” that could give crypto firms limited access to U.S. payment rails without full master accounts #FederalReserve #CryptoBanks https://t.co/GBjwtkWS2n — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 The proposal shows growing strain on the Fed’s existing framework as fintechs and crypto firms seek direct access to payment rails without engaging in lending or deposit-taking. By creating a tailored account model, the Fed appears to be weighing how to accommodate new business models while preserving safeguards tied to full-service banking. The 45-day comment period, following publication in the Federal Register, suggests regulators are still in an exploratory phase. But even considering such accounts signals a recognition that denying access altogether may no longer be sustainable as digital payments and tokenised settlement systems expand. SEC Targets Fraud Masquerading as Innovation While tax and banking debates focused on structural reform, enforcement remained firmly in play. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged a network of alleged fake crypto trading platforms and so-called AI investment clubs, accusing them of orchestrating a $14 million retail fraud. The SEC charged fake crypto platforms and AI-branded investment clubs over a $14 million retail investor scam. #SEC #Crypto https://t.co/ssD0ROvZ2e — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 According to the SEC, entities including Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co. Ltd., and several AI-branded investment clubs used social media advertising, messaging apps, and fabricated products to lure investors into what regulators described as an “investment confidence scam.” The case shows persistent regulatory concern: while legitimate crypto firms push for clearer rules, bad actors continue to exploit hype around AI and digital assets to target retail investors. For regulators, enforcement actions like this remain a key justification for maintaining a hard line on consumer protection. Arizona Tests the Limits of State-Level Crypto Tax Policy At the state level, Arizona lawmakers introduced a fresh attempt to carve out a more permissive tax environment for digital assets. Proposals backed by State Senator Wendy Rogers would exempt virtual currency from certain taxes and bar local governments from imposing fees on blockchain node operators. Arizona lawmakers introduce new bills to exempt cryptocurrency from taxes and block cities and counties from imposing local crypto or blockchain fees. #Arizona #CryptoTaxes https://t.co/uSfYHHZHWo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 One bill would remove virtual currency from state taxation, while another would prevent cities and counties from taxing node operations. A separate constitutional amendment would explicitly exclude crypto from property tax—but would require voter approval in November 2026. The effort highlights the tension between state-level experimentation and broader fiscal realities. Arizona currently levies a flat 2.5% income tax and a transaction privilege tax that averages above 8.5% once local rates are included, making a fully “tax-free” status politically and fiscally complex. A Regulatory Picture Still in Motion This week’s developments illustrate a regulatory landscape in transition. Policymakers are increasingly focused on aligning crypto with existing financial principles—fair taxation, controlled access to payment systems, and investor protection—while still wrestling with how far existing rules can stretch. As staking, tokenised payments, and crypto-native infrastructure mature, the pressure on regulators to move from interim fixes to durable frameworks is only set to grow.

This pivotal upgrade, first reported by Cointelegraph, promises to fundamentally enhance the network’s performance by dramatically reducing block generation time and introducing a novel data indexing system. Consequently, the entire BNB Smart Chain ecosystem stands to gain unprecedented transaction throughput and operational efficiency. BNB Chain Fermi Upgrade: Core Technical Specifications The Fermi hard fork centers on two primary, interconnected technical enhancements. First, the network will slash its block generation interval from 750 milliseconds to a mere 250 milliseconds. This 66% reduction represents a monumental leap in potential transaction processing speed. Second, developers will implement a sophisticated new indexing mechanism. This system allows users and decentralized applications (dApps) to query specific on-chain data directly without the need to download and parse the entire blockchain history. These changes directly address critical challenges in blockchain adoption. For instance, faster block times can reduce network congestion during peak usage. Meanwhile, the indexing upgrade lowers the barrier to entry for node operators. The following table contrasts the key network parameters before and after the Fermi upgrade: Parameter Pre-Fermi Post-Fermi Block Time 750 ms 250 ms Theoretical Max TPS ~2,000 ~6,000 Full Node Sync Data Entire Chain Selective Indexing Node Hardware Demand High Significantly Reduced Network architects designed these improvements to work in concert. The faster block time increases the data flow, while the new indexing mechanism ensures that processing this data remains efficient and accessible. Impact on Network Performance and Decentralization The immediate and most noticeable impact for end-users will be transaction speed. A block time of 250 milliseconds positions BNB Chain among the fastest layer-1 blockchains globally. This enhancement is crucial for several high-demand use cases: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Faster block finality reduces slippage and improves trade execution. Gaming and NFTs: Enables real-time, on-chain interactions and asset transfers. DeFi Protocols: Improves the responsiveness of lending, borrowing, and yield farming platforms. Perhaps more importantly, the new indexing mechanism tackles the critical issue of node centralization. Running a full node currently requires substantial storage and bandwidth to handle the ever-growing blockchain data. By allowing queries for specific data, the Fermi upgrade drastically cuts the computing resources needed. This reduction could lead to a more distributed and resilient network, as more participants can afford to run nodes. Therefore, the upgrade strengthens both performance and the foundational principle of decentralization . Expert Analysis: A Strategic Infrastructure Play Blockchain analysts view the Fermi upgrade as a strategic infrastructure play by BNB Chain. The network, which already hosts the largest number of daily active users, is proactively scaling its core architecture to handle future growth. Industry experts note that similar indexing techniques have been successfully pioneered by other chains to manage state bloat. However, combining this with a threefold increase in block speed is a unique and aggressive approach. The timing is also significant. The upgrade precedes anticipated growth in sectors like real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and fully on-chain gaming, which demand high throughput and low latency. By deploying Fermi in early 2025, BNB Chain is not just solving for today’s capacity but building headroom for the next wave of Web3 adoption. Historical data from past BNB Chain upgrades, like the Plato and Hertz hard forks, shows a pattern of consistent, backward-compatible improvements focused on scalability and developer experience. Preparations and Ecosystem Implications The BNB Chain core development team has been testing the Fermi upgrade extensively on its testnet for several months. Validators, node operators, and project developers have received detailed documentation and migration guides. This preparatory phase is standard protocol for a hard fork, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing services. For the broader ecosystem, the implications are profound. dApp developers can now design applications with the assumption of sub-second block confirmation, unlocking new user experience possibilities. Infrastructure providers, such as wallet services and block explorers, will integrate the new indexing APIs to deliver faster and more specific data queries to their users. Moreover, the reduced node requirements could foster a new market for lightweight validator services, further diversifying the network’s infrastructure. Conclusion The BNB Chain Fermi upgrade, scheduled for January 14, 2025, marks a critical evolution in the network’s capability. By reducing the block generation interval to 250 milliseconds and introducing an efficient indexing mechanism, the upgrade directly targets the dual challenges of scalability and accessibility. This strategic enhancement solidifies BNB Chain’s position as a high-performance blockchain platform ready to support the next generation of decentralized applications. The successful implementation of the Fermi hard fork will be a key milestone to watch, as it demonstrates the ongoing innovation within one of the world’s most actively used blockchain ecosystems. FAQs Q1: What is a hard fork, and will the Fermi upgrade require user action? A hard fork is a permanent divergence in a blockchain’s protocol, creating new rules. For most end-users holding BNB or using dApps on BNB Chain, no direct action is required. Wallets and exchanges will handle the technical transition seamlessly. Q2: How does reducing block time from 750ms to 250ms affect transaction fees? While the upgrade increases network capacity, transaction fees are determined by market demand and validator priorities. Increased throughput can alleviate congestion, which historically helps stabilize or lower fees during high-usage periods. Q3: What is the new indexing mechanism, and who benefits from it? The new indexing mechanism allows querying specific blockchain data without downloading the full history. This benefits node operators by reducing hardware costs, dApp developers by enabling faster data access, and block explorers by improving query efficiency. Q4: Will the Fermi upgrade make BNB Chain less secure? Security remains a paramount concern. The core protocol changes have undergone rigorous testing and audit processes. Faster block times are carefully balanced with other consensus parameters to maintain network security and finality. Q5: How does this upgrade compare to other scaling solutions like layer-2 networks? The Fermi upgrade is a layer-1 scaling solution, improving the base chain itself. It is complementary to layer-2 solutions (like rollups), which can be built on top of BNB Chain to provide even greater scalability for specific applications.

It can be placed within 3 dimensions (equity-like, safe asset haven-like, and on-chain). The macro context and the on-chain one play in favor of a bullish thesis, in my view. Unfortunately, the detachment from the anchoring to solutions such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq is, in my view, a source of disorientation. Today, I go back to looking at Bitcoin (BTC-USD) with bullish tones, always on Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF (FBTC) (the instrument I prefer for short-term operations) in view of the fact that there could be a contrarian operation on the table not to be taken lightly. I glimpse between the lines 2 reasons to be optimistic about Bitcoin looking ahead to 2026, and 1 reason to be fearful. But before getting into the heart of the situation, I’ll leave you with a … Short summary of previous analyses For new readers, I’m happy to leave you a list of the key information to know about FBTC : Let’s start from the fact that FBTC’s objective is to replicate the performance of spot Bitcoin; in doing so, it uses the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate as its benchmark. FBTC - BTC/USD: price (Seeking Alpha) The ETF holds physical Bitcoin and uses Fidelity Digital Asset Services ((FDAS)) as Custodian; custody is split between cold + hot storage. It has a Net expense ratio of 0.25% , which is paid in Bitcoin (an element that in the long term fuels the classic fee drag ), against a truly negligible Bid/ask spread (30d median) of around ~0.05%. The TER is convenient and ranks in the 97th-98th percentile according to Fidelity, therefore among the cheapest. FBTC - profile (Seeking Alpha) Not by chance, it has Net assets of around ~$18.22 billion, which makes it widely accepted globally as a traditional-market alternative to Bitcoin: as a consequence, and not to be taken for granted, it is also strong in volumetric terms. FBTC - Liquidity Grade (Seeking Alpha) For this reason, in my latest coverage , in the comparison with peers such as IBIT, BTC and HODL, I considered FBTC an interesting solution for faster Bitcoin trading operations. FBTC - BTC - IBIT - HODL (Seeking Alpha) My opinion Bitcoin is a dynamic asset, both in terms of price action and in terms of identity. This means that in certain contexts it is an equity-like solution, and tends to move in line with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq; at times it is a safe haven asset , and is associated by supporters with digital gold; at other times instead it is detached from any narrative, and moves following its own dynamics, the on-chain ones. So … looking for answers within these 3 identified boxes, I personally identified 2 reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin, and 1 reason not to be (which we will identify as a risk): BTC comparison (Author) Macro point of view Although, in my view, it is the least sensitive dimension for Bitcoin, the macro context is a positive factor today in my opinion, and the reason can be summarized in a series of elements: Deterioration of trust in fiat currencies. Increase in U.S. fiscal deficits. The Fed has turned dovish with a restarted rate-cut cycle. If real rates remain in decline , there will be a progressive reduction in the attractiveness of bonds and cash. US real rate (Seeking Alpha) Here comes into play the dimension of Bitcoin described as a safe haven asset, a parallel solution to Gold : hedge against inflation. hedge against central bank policy errors. And personally, today I would also add to this dimension the decisive role of the Trump administration ; an administration that nonetheless remains pro-crypto and pro-deregulation. It introduced the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act and is moving toward the formation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (without direct purchases). On-chain point of view The second dimension lies within models that attempt to describe Bitcoin’s price action based on technical evidence or data that can only be read on-chain. In these models, Bitcoin’s price is located in an intermediate-low area relative to the secular trend. Specifically: Stock to flow is not working as it should; since 2022, Bitcoin’s price (even if bullish) has not been in line with the average defined by the model, which is based on the concept of scarcity. From one point of view it can be associated with a failure of the model, while from another it can also be seen as a dimension of undervaluation. Hashrate does not give operational signals , but in my opinion it gives an idea of the sentiment of market operators. In recent years hashrate has grown significantly, and for this reason it is synonymous with greater interest in market participation by new players. And who would invest in a market destined to die? In my opinion, very few. We are also in the lower range on logarithmic models; my absolute favorite is the rainbow chart , which still places the price among the lower horizons of the chart. We are in minimum zones also from a technical point of view, if we look at the RSI, below the 50-point level. FBTC - Price (Seeking Alpha) Risk It only remains to question the equity-like nature of Bitcoin. This dimension, for me, is the most important one. With the process of institutionalization of the network (which occurred through the deregulation itself of the Trump administration, and began with the launch of ETFs ), Bitcoin has increasingly taken on a strong anchoring to traditional indices.

When analysts begin modeling large upside scenarios while a token is still priced under $0.04, it often signals that timing, structure, and demand are lining up. As Phase 6 crosses the 99% mark, this $0.035 new altcoin is entering that zone. For investors asking what crypto to buy now before the next cycle gains pace, this setup is drawing growing attention. At the center of these models is Mutuum Finance, a DeFi crypto that has been building quietly while its presale advances step by step. Lending Mechanics and Presale Demand Are Intersecting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing around two lending models that work together. Peer to contract lending allows users to supply assets into liquidity pools and earn yield. Interest rates adjust based on utilization, which helps balance supply and demand. When liquidity is high, borrowing becomes cheaper. When liquidity tightens, rates rise and attract more deposits. Peer to peer lending offers another layer. Borrowers can take loans directly against collateral under defined rules. Loan to value ratios are set based on asset risk. Lower volatility assets can support higher LTV levels, while more volatile tokens are capped lower. If collateral value drops too far, liquidations occur to protect the system. This structure is familiar to analysts who follow DeFi closely. Alongside these mechanics, presale demand has continued to build. The current token price is $0.035, and Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. Mutuum Finance has raised $19.45M, attracted 18,650 holders, and sold 825M tokens so far. Out of a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to roughly 1.82B tokens. The price has already moved from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.035 today, marking a 250% increase during the presale period alone. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which shapes many of the current price discussions. V1 Launch Progress and Analyst Price Outlook Development milestones are another reason analysts are paying attention. According to official statements shared on X , V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core components include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Security has also been addressed early. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. In addition, an independent audit with Halborn Security is currently in progress, reviewing finalized contracts. A $50k bug bounty has been allocated specifically for code vulnerabilities. Some analysts believe that having a live beta close to launch can significantly affect visibility. Market commentators suggest that projects launching with working infrastructure often attract exchange interest more quickly. In a bullish scenario, projections show that this visibility could help the token move beyond the $0.06 launch price, supporting a 200% to 300% increase from current levels shortly after launch. mtTokens and Oracle Infrastructure mtTokens are central to how Mutuum Finance links usage to value. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens that increase in value as interest accrues. The yield is automatic and reflected directly in the token balance. For example, supplying $12,000 worth of USDC into a pool earning 8% APY would gradually increase the value of the mtTokens held. Another key element is the buy-and-distribute model. A portion of protocol fees is used to purchase MUTM on the open market. Those tokens are then redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Some analysts believe this creates sustained buying pressure over time, since higher platform usage leads directly to more token purchases. Reliable pricing is supported through robust oracle infrastructure. The protocol design anticipates decentralized price feeds such as Chainlink, along with fallback and aggregated sources. Accurate pricing is essential for collateral valuation and liquidations, especially during volatile periods. In a bullish scenario, analysts model that combining yield generation, fee-driven token buying, and reliable oracle data could support a 500% to 700% increase over a longer time frame if adoption grows steadily. Why Analysts Compare MUTM to Early Aave One comparison that continues to surface is with early Aave. Before Aave became a large-cap DeFi name, it focused on core lending functionality, clear risk parameters, and gradual adoption. It did not rely on short-term narratives. Analysts often point out that Mutuum Finance is following a similar path. The protocol is centered on making capital productive through lending and borrowing. It uses utilization-based rates, defined LTV limits, and liquidation incentives that protect solvency. These are the same building blocks that helped earlier DeFi leaders scale responsibly. What Mutuum Finance is trying to build is not a one-feature platform. It aims to create a full lending environment where users can earn yield, borrow efficiently, and interact with a stablecoin backed by multiple assets in the future. This broader vision is why some market commentators believe the project has room to grow beyond its initial launch phase. Why the 700% Scenario Is Being Discussed The 700% scenario referenced by analysts is not framed as a guarantee. It is a model based on several factors aligning. A current price of $0.035. A launch price of $0.06. A presale phase nearing completion. A V1 protocol going live. A token model that links usage to buying activity. Early investor sentiment indicates that when these elements converge, price discovery can accelerate. Analysts who accurately tracked early DeFi growth cycles often look for these same patterns. That is why Mutuum Finance is increasingly mentioned in discussions about the best cryptocurrency to invest in today among new altcoins. As Phase 6 crosses 99%, Mutuum Finance is entering a transition point. Presale supply is tightening, development milestones are approaching, and analysts are actively modeling upside scenarios. As long as execution continues as outlined, many believe this could be one of the DeFi crypto stories that unfolds over the next cycle rather than peaking before it begins.

Hosts Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Rebecca Bellan, joined by Build Mode host Isabelle Johannessen, analyze technology developments that will shape the coming year. Their discussion covers artificial intelligence advancements, funding patterns, and regulatory challenges facing the tech industry. AI Agents 2026: From Hype to Practical Implementation The Equity team identifies artificial intelligence agents as a central theme for 2026 technology development. These autonomous systems, designed to perform tasks without constant human supervision, represent the next evolution beyond current large language models. The hosts explain why 2025 expectations exceeded practical implementations, while 2026 promises more functional applications. World models emerge as a critical differentiator from traditional AI approaches. Unlike language models that process text, world models create internal simulations of environments. This capability enables more sophisticated reasoning and planning. The technology shows particular promise for robotics, autonomous systems, and complex decision-making applications. The Shift from Stealth to Transparency AI startup culture undergoes significant transformation according to the predictions. The traditional “stealth mode” approach, where companies operate secretly during early development, faces decline. Instead, startups increasingly pursue alternative funding sources and public engagement. This shift reflects changing investor expectations and market dynamics. Physical AI represents another important trend discussed by the Equity team. This category includes robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure systems. The integration of artificial intelligence with physical hardware creates new challenges and opportunities. Funding patterns for these ventures differ significantly from software-only AI companies. Blockbuster IPOs and Public Market Expectations The Equity predictions include analysis of potential public offerings for major artificial intelligence companies. OpenAI and Anthropic receive particular attention as candidates for 2026 IPOs. The discussion covers market conditions, regulatory considerations, and investor appetite for AI-focused public companies. Several factors influence the IPO landscape according to the analysis. Regulatory clarity, financial performance, and market timing all play crucial roles. The hosts examine how recent executive orders and policy developments might affect public offering decisions. They also consider alternative paths to liquidity for AI companies. Predicted 2026 Technology IPO Candidates Company Sector Potential Valuation Range Key Factors OpenAI Artificial Intelligence $80-100B Regulatory approval, revenue growth Anthropic AI Safety & Research $15-25B Partnerships, enterprise adoption Other AI Startups Various Specializations $5-15B Technology differentiation, market position Hollywood’s Response to AI-Generated Content The entertainment industry’s reaction to artificial intelligence represents another prediction area. Content creation tools powered by AI face increasing scrutiny and potential resistance. Creative industries develop new approaches to protect intellectual property while leveraging technological advancements. Regulatory discussions around AI policy create uncertainty for startups and established companies. The Equity team analyzes potential impacts of different regulatory approaches. They examine how policy decisions might affect innovation, investment, and market development across various sectors. Venture Capital Evolution and Liquidity Challenges Venture capital faces significant transformation according to the 2026 predictions. Liquidity constraints affect investment patterns and portfolio management strategies. The Equity hosts discuss how venture firms adapt to changing market conditions and investor expectations. Several trends shape the venture capital landscape: Extended holding periods for portfolio companies Increased focus on sustainable business models Alternative funding sources gaining prominence Greater emphasis on profitability metrics Changing relationships between founders and investors The “AI native” concept emerges as an important trend across industries. Companies increasingly position themselves as fundamentally artificial intelligence organizations rather than traditional businesses using AI tools. This positioning affects hiring, product development, and market positioning strategies. Rapid-Fire Predictions and Industry Insights The Equity team shares several specific predictions beyond the main themes. These include potential developments in leadership dynamics, technology adoption patterns, and cultural shifts. The predictions reflect deep industry knowledge and analysis of emerging trends. Build Mode’s second season receives attention for its focus on team development and founder dynamics. The program explores practical aspects of building successful technology companies. This includes hiring strategies, co-founder relationships, and organizational development in competitive markets. Conclusion The Equity podcast’s 2026 predictions reveal significant transformations across artificial intelligence, public markets, and venture capital. AI agents move toward practical implementation while facing regulatory and market challenges. Potential blockbuster IPOs could reshape public market perceptions of artificial intelligence companies. Venture capital adapts to liquidity constraints and changing investment patterns. These developments collectively indicate a maturing technology landscape with evolving opportunities and challenges for 2026. FAQs Q1: What are AI agents and how do they differ from current AI systems? AI agents are autonomous systems that perform tasks without constant human supervision. Unlike current language models that primarily process text, agents can take actions, make decisions, and interact with environments through world models that simulate real-world scenarios. Q2: Why might OpenAI and Anthropic consider 2026 IPOs? Several factors make 2026 potentially favorable for AI company IPOs, including maturing business models, regulatory clarity, investor appetite for AI exposure, and the need for liquidity for early investors and employees after extended private market growth periods. Q3: What challenges do venture capital firms face in 2026? VC firms confront liquidity constraints with extended holding periods for portfolio companies, pressure to demonstrate returns to limited partners, competition from alternative funding sources, and the need to adapt investment strategies to changing market conditions and company valuations. Q4: How does “physical AI” differ from software AI? Physical AI integrates artificial intelligence with hardware systems like robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. This creates additional challenges including sensor integration, real-time processing, safety considerations, and hardware reliability beyond pure software implementation challenges. Q5: What regulatory issues might affect AI development in 2026? Key regulatory considerations include data privacy and usage policies, algorithmic transparency requirements, safety standards for autonomous systems, intellectual property rights for AI-generated content, and international coordination on AI governance frameworks that affect cross-border operations.

The year opened with expectations that Elon Musk would dominate tech headlines again. That did not happen. By December, Oracle’s chairman had touched almost every major business story tied to Washington, AI spending, media deals, and volatile markets. The 81-year-old Larry [naturally] stayed close to the White House as Donald Trump returned as president. Oracle explored taking a stake in TikTok as part of a plan tied to Trump’s effort to keep the app operating in the US. At the same time, Oracle stock turned into a daily scoreboard for Ellison’s wealth, swinging hard as investors chased and then questioned the company’s AI ambitions. Oracle builds Stargate and locks in OpenAI as its biggest client January set the tone. On Jan. 21, one day after Trump’s inauguration, Trump stood at the White House with Larry, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and SoftBank head Masa Son. The group announced Stargate, a $500 billion plan to build AI data centers across the US. The announcement included claims of 100,000 jobs and massive long-term investment. Some analysts doubted the numbers from the start. Oracle moved fast anyway. The company began a large-scale buildout of AI-focused data centers. The spending pushed Oracle’s cash flow negative for the first time since the early 1990s. That reversal stood out because Larry had skipped the cloud boom years earlier. In 2025, he leaned into AI instead of watching from the sidelines. By summer, Oracle landed its biggest deal yet . OpenAI agreed to rent roughly $300 billion worth of computing power from Oracle. The contract positioned OpenAI as Oracle’s largest customer. In September, Oracle disclosed how large the commitment really was. Investors reacted immediately. Oracle shares jumped almost 36 percent on Sept. 10, the third sharpest rally since the company’s 1986 IPO. The stock hit an intraday record of $345.72. That single day added $89 billion to Larry’s net worth, lifting it to $388 billion. Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index recorded it as the largest one-day wealth increase ever. For a brief moment, he passed Musk as the richest person alive. Zachary Lountzis, vice president at Lountzis Asset Management, in an interview, said they are extremely bullish on ORCL. In his words:- “Our philosophy is that we’re OK with short-term overvaluation if the economics of the business have not changed, and that was the case with Oracle. We didn’t feel the economics of the business changed with all the largely positive news that came out. And I think what we’ve seen from $340 down to $180 is actually a very healthy correction.” Stock collapse, leadership changes, and pressure on cash follow The surge in wealth overlapped with a media deal at home. In August, David Ellison, Larry’s son, closed Skydance Media’s takeover of Paramount. The acquisition relied heavily on funding from Ellison Senior, tying Hollywood control to Oracle’s chairman during the same year his tech bets peaked. Then the slide began. About three months ago, Oracle appointed Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as co-chief executives, replacing Safra Catz. The timing was rough. Oracle shares have fallen about 30 percent this quarter. With only days left, the decline is tracking toward the company’s worst quarterly drop since the 2001 dot-com crash. Two weeks before the leadership handoff, Oracle reported a 359 percent revenue backlog tied largely to the OpenAI agreement. The deal validated Oracle’s AI push even as the company remained outside Gartner’s top five cloud infrastructure providers for 2024. Oracle still trails Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in market share, despite customers that include Meta, Uber, and Elon Musk’s xAI. Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin initiated coverage this month with a buy equivalent and a $280 target. He said Oracle could change how the market views the business if it delivers on OpenAI. “They’re kind of shifting away from more of a value oriented business to a more growth oriented business,” Michael said. Today, Larry ranks as the world’s fifth richest person with just under $250 billion. Most of that wealth sits in Oracle stock. If he were required to provide the full $40.4 billion backstop tied to the OpenAI deal, cash access remains unclear. Meeting that obligation could force him to sell shares or pledge more stock, extending the risk into 2026.",OP-ED|ORCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-26 18:30:14
56411024,648792,1766773817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56411024.jpeg,From Bitcoin To Ethereum: Exchange Data Signals A Major Rotation In Trading Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/from-bitcoin-to-ethereum/,"While the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum is still struggling with heightened volatility in the crypto market, the balance of trading activity among the two leading digital assets is quietly shifting. This current pivot is sighted across cryptocurrency exchanges as the number of trades displaying a distinct action. Traders Pivoting From Bitcoin To Ethereum Amid the ongoing volatile market phase, a growing disparity has been observed among traders of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the largest cryptocurrency assets. In the report from Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, it appears BTC traders are gradually considering ETH. After examining the action of investors, Alphractal revealed that the number of perpetual market trades completed for BTC across major crypto exchanges has dropped drastically, which indicates a drop in short-term activity. At the same time, the number of trades for ETH has increased as the altcoin grabs a growing share of overall trade flow, signaling renewed involvement from traders and on-chain players. According to the platform, more trades are now being processed in ETH , putting the altcoin ahead of Bitcoin in terms of traders’ conviction. This difference reveals a shifting market dynamic in which focus and liquidity are slowly shifting from the consolidation phase of Bitcoin to the growing ecosystem and use-driven activities of Ethereum. It is worth noting that the market experienced the highest number of leveraged trades in the history of BTC between August and November. During the period, over 19 crypto exchanges, including BitMEX and HyperLiquid, recorded up to 80 million trades in a single day, marking their highest level. However, this activity has remarkably decreased, and the 7-day average is now positioned at just 13 million trades. Such a trend implies a drastic contraction in leveraged trading activity. On the other hand, Ethereum also experienced a surge in 2025, reaching a peak of nearly 50 million trades. What is noteworthy is that the number of recent Ethereum trades is still far higher than that of BTC. Data shows that the 7-day average for ETH is about 17.5 million trades, indicating a clear divergence between the two crypto leaders. BTC Now In A Reset Phase Following Reduced Trades Furthermore, this demonstrates that in the perpetual futures market , BTC and ETH exhibit distinct behavioral patterns. Following the massive liquidation event in October, the market turned extremely cautious toward Bitcoin and leverage itself. Alphractal noted that the impact of this divergence is evident in the largest Open Interest (OI) drawdown in the history of Bitcoin. In the meantime, the platform believes that Bitcoin is currently in a reset phase. Meanwhile, it will take a long time before conditions go back to normal and institutional and whale interest resumes. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was trading at $88,875, demonstrating a 1.33% rise in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has also followed suit, attracting a more than 43% increase over the same time period.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BitMEX|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Hyperliquid|OI|open interest,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 18:30:17

While short-term price action remains heavy and key resistance levels are still capping upside, the broader structure continues to quietly mature beneath the surface. This tension between near-term pressure and a slowly building macro setup is what makes the current phase especially critical for what comes next. A Multi-Year Compression Is Reaching Its Endgame In a recent update, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO emphasized that the XRP macro triangle is far more than just market noise; it is a definitive roadmap. Analyzing the asset on a 2-month timeframe, the analyst noted that this massive structural formation has been developing for years, serving as a primary indicator of where the price is headed in the long term. Related Reading: XRP Price To Surge: Analyst Shares ‘Interesting Chart’ That Has Previously Led To A Rally EGRAG was among the first to identify this specific breakout setup in its early stages. What the broader market might view as stagnation or random volatility is a multi-year triangle reaching its final apex on the macro chart, signaling that a major move is being prepared. The analyst stressed that this technical preparation is not based on “hopium,” but on a disciplined interpretation of long-term price action. Basically, this macro view provides a structured look at the market, stripping away the distractions of lower timeframes to reveal the significant accumulation and pressure building within the triangle’s boundaries. This tiered roadmap is designed to guide investors through the potential breakout phases, offering a strategic perspective on how XRP is expected to unfold as it finally exits this historic consolidation pattern. Double Bottom Falters As Buyers Struggle To Follow Through According to a post by Umair Crypto, the market is still showing signs of hesitation, with the double-bottom structure failing to gain meaningful traction. On the 4-hour chart, the recent bounce from the $1.84 area aligns closely with the golden pocket of the $1.772–$1.962 Fibonacci retracement, which helps explain the temporary reaction seen so far. Related Reading: Why The Current XRP Valuation Doesn’t Make Sense For momentum to shift, price needs to start closing above the $1.96 level. A move beyond that zone would allow the daily RSI trendlines to flip, marking the first real step toward regaining bullish momentum. The next and more critical hurdle sits at the $2.00 mark, where a breakout would also mean reclaiming the daily 50 SMA, a key signal that bullish structure is returning. Until those resistance crucial levels are recovered, the broader outlook remains bearish. Thus, the altcoin is vulnerable to further downside, and the risk of printing lower lows stays on the table as long as buyers fail to assert control above these key thresholds.

For now, metals markets remain firmly in rally mode. The balance between gold and silver appears to shift. Whether that shift lasts remains the next test for investors. Silver trades near $75 per ounce as of writing, marking a historic breakout after a sharp surge on Friday. Gold follows close behind, hovering above $4,500 per ounce after setting fresh record highs earlier in the session. Source: CoinCodex On the sidelines, Platinum and palladium also posted strong gains, but silver and gold dominated investor focus. Markets pushed precious metals higher as traders priced in U.S. rate cuts, rising geopolitical tension, and thin year-end liquidity. Momentum intensified across trading desks. Could this mark a turning point in metals leadership? Gold Holds Strength as Silver Steals the Spotlight Gold rose to $4,516.50 per ounce during the session after touching a record $4,530.60, while U.S. gold futures climbed to $4,547.70. The metal now heads for its strongest annual gain since 1979, supported by Federal Reserve easing, steady central bank purchases, ETF inflows, and ongoing de-dollarisation trends. Investors continued to favor non-yielding assets as markets priced in two U.S. rate cuts next year. Physical demand showed mixed signals. Discounts in India widened to their highest level in more than six months, while discounts in China narrowed from last week’s extreme highs. Silver, however, captured attention. Prices jumped as high as $75.14 per ounce before settling slightly lower near $74.6. The metal now shows a year-to-date gain of roughly 158%, far ahead of gold’s nearly 72% rise. Supply deficits, strong industrial demand, and silver’s designation as a U.S. critical mineral drove the rally. Speculative inflows amplified the move during a period of low liquidity. Traders asked a key question. Has silver finally stepped out of gold’s shadow? A Long-Term Relationship Starts to Shift Silver and gold have tracked each other closely for more than six decades, yet gold dominated performance for much of that time. The gold-to-silver price ratio more than doubled from the 1960s through the 2000–2015 period and remained elevated after 2016. As of December 2024, the ratio stood 42% above its 2000–2015 average, reflecting gold’s long-term outperformance. Source: СoinCodex In 2025, the pattern shifted. Silver surged over 70% year-to-date through October, outpacing gold’s 53% gain during the same period. The recent breakout above $75 reinforced that reversal and signaled a notable change in relative momentum. Liquidity, Risk, and the Road Ahead Thin year-end liquidity magnified price swings across the metals complex. Speculative traders responded quickly to macro signals, while a weaker dollar added further support. Geopolitical risks strengthened demand for safe-haven assets, pushing capital toward gold and silver. Analysts pointed to structural tightness in silver markets and a smaller market size in platinum group metals as reasons behind sharp moves.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 18:44:06

Together, the visuals point to heavier network use as price trades at a decision area. Ethereum ecosystem activity jumps on growthepie chart A post from CryptoGoos on X said “Ethereum ecosystem activity is exploding now,” alongside a growthepie.com chart that tracks transaction count from mid 2020 through mid 2025. The graphic shows activity staying low for years, then turning higher through 2023 and accelerating in 2024 and 2025. Ethereum Ecosystem Transaction Count. Source: growthepie. com / X One line on the chart climbs sharply after early 2024, pushing past the 240 million mark and approaching the top of the scale near 480 million by 2025. Meanwhile, several other lines also trend upward, but they rise more gradually and remain far below the top line. The chart does not explain what drives the jump, but the shape fits a broader shift toward heavier onchain usage, especially across multiple Ethereum related networks that can process transactions outside mainnet and then settle back to Ethereum. Even so, transaction count alone does not show how many unique users participated or how much value moved, so the surge needs more context before it signals wider adoption. Ethereum weekly chart shows inverse head and shoulders setup near neckline Meanwhile, Bitcoinsensus said Ethereum is close to completing a macro inverse head and shoulders pattern on the weekly chart. The image marks a left shoulder in late 2024, a deeper “head” low in early 2025, and a possible right shoulder that formed after the mid 2025 peak and pullback. Ethereum Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern. Source: TradingView / X The chart also draws a rising neckline labeled as resistance, with price action repeatedly stalling near that zone before the larger move higher. If ETH holds the higher low structure on the right side and then pushes through the neckline, the pattern’s textbook signal would be a breakout that confirms the reversal from the earlier downtrend. Still, the right shoulder label includes a question mark, so the setup depends on follow through. If ETH fails to stay above the shoulder area and drops back toward the head region, the pattern loses structure and traders usually treat the neckline as unbroken resistance rather than a trigger. Ethereum trades near key moving averages as RSI steadies Ethereum price action shows a mixed technical setup, with the asset moving close to its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages. The chart places ETH below the shorter term average while it hovers near the longer term trend line, signaling a pause after the recent decline from earlier highs. Ethereum 50 Day SMA, 200 Day SMA, and 14 Day RSI. Source: CoinCodex The 50 day SMA has turned lower and now slopes toward the 200 day SMA, reflecting weaker momentum over recent weeks. At the same time, price has stabilized near the mid range, suggesting selling pressure has slowed rather than accelerated. Meanwhile, the 14 day RSI remains near neutral levels.

Samsung and other affected companies have recorded estimated losses of tens of trillions of won due to the technology theft. ChangXin Memory Technologies steals tech from Samsung South Korean authorities have charged 10 individuals with stealing and transferring critical semiconductor manufacturing technology to Chinese chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT). The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office announced that of the 10 individuals indicted, five suspects remain detained in custody and five were released on bail. The indictments involve violations of South Korea’s industrial technology protection law. Prosecutors revealed that a former Samsung researcher preparing to join CXMT painstakingly transcribed hundreds of manufacturing process steps for the company’s 1.6 trillion won technology by hand before leaving the company. These handwritten notes contained extremely detailed information about the specifications for the equipment, production sequencing, and yield optimization techniques. CXMT later used these notes to reconstruct Samsung’s manufacturing processes at its own facilities. South Korea opened eight technology leak cases in the first half of 2025 alone, with five of those cases involving China as the recipient of stolen information. The legal consequences for technology theft have been relatively lenient, but South Korea revised its prevention laws earlier in 2024 to impose harsher prison terms and increased fines for violators. What did CXMT do with the stolen technology? CXMT adapted and validated the stolen data to work with its own equipment and successfully achieved the production of its own 10-nanometer DRAM in 2023. Due to this theft, CXMT became the first Chinese chipmaker to produce such advanced node chips. Prosecutors found that CXMT also obtained additional DRAM technology from SK Hynix through an unnamed supplier. Earlier this year in May, an SK Hynix employee surnamed Kim received a five-year prison sentence plus a 30 million won fine for leaking advanced chip packaging and CMOS image sensor technology to Huawei’s HiSilicon division. Kim allegedly photographed approximately 11,000 pages of technical documents and removed confidentiality markings before sharing the sensitive information. In a separate 2024 case , authorities picked up a Chinese national at a Korean airport attempting to leave the country after printing over 3,000 pages of semiconductor defect analysis data before joining Huawei. The suspect had been with SK Hynix since 2013. Prosecutors explained that CXMT used the illegally obtained manufacturing processes from Samsung to come up with its own high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which is a hot commodity for customers building AI accelerators and graphics processing units used for machine learning and data center operations. South Korean authorities estimate that the financial damage to companies like Samsung Electronics, when things like potential lost market and research and development costs are considered, amounts to at least tens of trillions of won. At the time the technology was stolen, Samsung was the only company to have successfully commercialized 10-nanometer DRAM production. Last month, CXMT unveiled its latest generation of DRAM products, known as DDR5.

The analyst drew attention to a bullish divergence that has been developing for several months. His breakdown started well before recent price weakness. It began at the asset’s all-time high in July, when XRP surged to $3.65 and then stalled. According to ChartNerd, price action after that peak formed a clear technical structure. The asset created a descending resistance line while holding a flat horizontal support. The price continued to compress inside this descending triangle, printing lower highs as selling pressure increased. The decisive moment came in October. XRP lost that horizontal support and shifted into a new trend. ChartNerd said this breakdown marked the start of a lower low trend line that has remained intact since then. From that point forward, XRP price respected the downside structure, even during short-lived rebounds. $XRP Bullish Divergence Breakdown. https://t.co/VFezsKR8Tn pic.twitter.com/osC8y0NQdu — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 25, 2025 Rejection Levels Define the Downtrend ChartNerd highlighted the first major test after the breakdown. XRP rallied back into prior support but faced resistance at $2.70. He said the price failed there and quickly reversed lower. That rejection pushed the asset back to the lower low trend line and confirmed the structure. Since that moment, subsequent rallies have stayed weak. Each bounce produced a lower high. The price continued to rotate back down toward the trend line. ChartNerd described this as the process that allowed the bullish divergence to form, even while the price continued to fall. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 RSI Signals a Shift in Momentum ChartNerd said the importance of the setup comes from momentum. While XRP printed lower lows on the price chart, the RSI began printing higher lows. That divergence has been building since October. He explained that this is where traders should focus their attention. While XRP is trending down, the selling pressure is weakening. Momentum no longer confirms the downside. The divergence remains valid as long as the RSI holds its higher low trend and the price respects the lower boundary. Is XRP Headed Up? XRP now sits at a technical crossroads. The bullish divergence could give way to a sustained break above the descending resistance. If that happens, XRP could revisit the $2.7 zone that previously acted as resistance. Failure to hold the lower trend line would delay that outcome. The divergence would still exist, but XRP would need more time to stabilize before another breakout attempt.

The S&P 500 ended at a historic high of 6,932.05, while the Nasdaq Composite added modest gains. U.S. stock markets extended their rally for a fifth consecutive session during a holiday-shortened week, signaling strong investor confidence. Equity markets continued to attract capital as risk appetite favored traditional assets over alternatives. Does this strength suggest a lasting shift in market leadership? Broad-Based Gains Support the Rally All three major U.S. indices recorded steady advances throughout the week. The Nasdaq rose 0.22% in the latest session, while the S&P 500 gained 0.32%. The Dow outperformed both, driven by strength in blue-chip components. Year-to-date performance remains firm across the board. The Nasdaq posted gains of over 22%, the S&P 500 advanced nearly 18%, and the Dow climbed more than 14%. These moves reflect consistent upside momentum rather than a single-session surge. Large-cap technology stocks played a central role. Shares of Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and other tech leaders rebounded after last week’s valuation-driven selloff. AI-related names regained traction as investors refocused on long-term earnings growth rather than short-term cost concerns. Micron Technology stood out, rising 3.8% to a record close of $286.68 following a strong forward outlook. Financial stocks also contributed, with the sector rising 0.5%, while energy marked the only decline among S&P 500 sectors. Economic Signals and Policy Expectations Align Market participants responded positively to signs of economic resilience. Stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP growth reinforced confidence in the U.S. economic outlook. Investors also priced in the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026, easing pressure from higher borrowing costs. Treasury yields remained stable, helping equity valuations hold firm. Trading volumes stayed light ahead of the Christmas holiday, which amplified price movements during the shortened session. Despite mixed consumer sentiment data, optimism persisted. Wall Street strategists pointed to continued innovation in artificial intelligence and new technology models as catalysts for renewed interest. Volatility remained contained, with the market’s fear gauge holding near its lowest levels since December 2024. Equity markets navigated tariff-related headlines and shifting rate expectations without breaking trend. Bull Market Momentum Holds The current rally extended a bull market that began in October 2022 and now enters its fourth year. Investors drew confidence from earnings growth, technology sector leadership, and stable monetary conditions. Seasonal trends also supported sentiment, as markets entered the so-called Santa Claus rally period, which runs through early January. With all three major indices on track for a third consecutive annual gain, Wall Street closed the year with momentum intact.

This forecast, reported initially by Cointelegraph, signals a profound maturation of digital asset investment vehicles and underscores a pivotal shift in institutional portfolio strategy. The projection hinges on converging macroeconomic conditions and demonstrated investor behavior during recent market volatility. Crypto ETF Inflow Forecast: Decoding the $40 Billion Projection Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, provided a nuanced outlook for the coming year. He established a baseline expectation of approximately $15 billion in new capital flowing into cryptocurrency ETFs. However, Balchunas crucially noted this figure could surge toward $40 billion under favorable investment conditions. This analysis stems from a detailed examination of current flow data, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic indicators. The forecast represents a significant acceleration from the initial post-approval inflows witnessed in 2024, suggesting the market is moving past an initial adoption phase into a period of sustained, strategic allocation. Several key factors underpin this optimistic scenario. Firstly, the structural demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure via regulated, familiar vehicles has proven resilient. Secondly, the expanding suite of crypto ETF products provides investors with more targeted strategies. Finally, the gradual onboarding of larger, more conservative institutional players creates a longer runway for growth. This projection is not mere speculation but an extrapolation based on observable trends and institutional pipeline discussions. The Macroeconomic Catalyst: Federal Reserve Policy and Investor Psychology Balchunas explicitly linked the renewed investor interest to anticipated monetary policy shifts. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to initiate interest rate cuts in the coming year, a move that historically alters capital allocation strategies. Lower interest rates typically reduce the yield on traditional fixed-income assets, prompting investors to seek higher-growth alternatives. Consequently, cryptocurrency ETFs become a more attractive component for portfolio diversification. This dynamic creates a powerful tailwind. When risk-free rates decline, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding or volatile assets like Bitcoin decreases. Moreover, an easing monetary policy often weakens the US dollar, a trend that has previously correlated with strength in hard-asset alternatives like gold and, more recently, Bitcoin. Analysts therefore view the Fed’s policy pivot not as a direct cause, but as a critical enabling condition that unlocks latent demand from advisors and institutional mandates previously sidelined by a high-rate environment. Evidence from Market Stress: ETFs as a Stabilizing Force Perhaps the most compelling evidence supporting the long-term inflow thesis comes from recent market behavior. Balchunas highlighted that ETF flows have provided “medium- to long-term price support” during corrections. For instance, when Bitcoin’s price fell roughly 35% from its peak, the outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs represented only about 4% of their total assets under management. Notably, some weeks during the downturn even registered net inflows. This data reveals a crucial narrative: ETF investors are behaving differently than speculative traders on unregulated exchanges. The ETF structure, with its creation/redemption mechanism and adherence to traditional market hours, appears to attract a more patient, allocation-focused investor. This cohort views short-term volatility as a buying opportunity rather than a panic signal. The table below contrasts typical behaviors: Investor Type Typical Reaction to -35% Correction Impact on Market Speculative Retail Trader Rapid sell-off, margin calls Amplifies downward volatility ETF-Based Allocator Measured outflow or continued DCA inflow Provides liquidity, dampens volatility This stabilizing effect builds confidence among larger institutions considering entry. It demonstrates that the ETF wrapper can mitigate some of the extreme sentiment-driven swings historically associated with crypto markets. The Institutional On-Ramp: Pension Funds and Sovereign Wealth in Focus The next phase of growth, essential for reaching the upper bounds of the $40 billion forecast, depends on deep institutional capital. Balchunas identified this group as the “key source of capital that will have a real impact on the market.” The entities now scrutinizing crypto ETFs include: Pension Funds: Seeking non-correlated assets for long-term liability matching. Sovereign Wealth Funds: Diversifying national reserves beyond traditional currencies and bonds. Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs): Allocating small percentages of client portfolios for growth. Endowments & Foundations: Exploring digital assets for enhanced returns. These institutions move slowly but with immense force. Their investment committees require rigorous due diligence, regulatory clarity, and proven custody solutions—all criteria that spot Bitcoin ETFs now meet. The approval of these ETFs by the SEC provided a regulatory imprimatur that serves as a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for their involvement. The process is no longer about debating the asset’s legitimacy but about determining the optimal size and timing of the allocation. The Path to $40 Billion: A Scenario Analysis Reaching the high-end forecast requires a specific alignment of events. The $15 billion base case assumes continued adoption at the current pace by wirehouses, RIAs, and international investors. The path to $40 billion, however, involves several accelerants: Multiple Rate Cuts: A sustained Fed easing cycle throughout 2025-2026. Product Expansion: Approval of spot Ethereum ETFs and other single-asset or thematic crypto ETFs. Major Allocation Announcements: A few flagship pension funds publicly announcing 1-2% portfolio allocations, creating a “green light” effect for peers. Supportive Regulatory Framework: Clearer digital asset legislation from Congress, reducing regulatory overhang. If two or more of these conditions materialize, the capital floodgates could open. The sheer size of institutional balance sheets means that even microscopic portfolio allocations translate into billions of dollars. A 0.5% allocation from the top 100 global pension funds would far exceed the $40 billion mark. Conclusion The forecast for up to $40 billion in crypto ETF inflow by 2026 represents a watershed moment for digital asset integration into global finance. Eric Balchunas’s analysis, grounded in flow data and macroeconomic trends, points beyond speculative frenzy to a era of structured, institutional adoption. The resilience of ETF flows during market stress and the impending shift in Federal Reserve policy create a powerful confluence of factors. While the base case remains a substantial $15 billion, the potential for a $40 billion surge hinges on the deepening engagement of pension funds, sovereign wealth, and advisory firms. This projected crypto ETF inflow ultimately signals the normalization of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate, albeit specialized, asset class within the modern investment landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the main reason behind the $40 billion crypto ETF inflow forecast for 2026? The primary drivers are expected Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which make growth assets more attractive, and the ongoing entry of large institutions like pension funds seeking regulated exposure to digital assets. Q2: Who is Eric Balchunas and why is his analysis significant? Eric Balchunas is a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, a widely respected data and research firm. His forecasts are closely watched because they are based on deep analysis of fund flow data, regulatory developments, and direct conversations with industry participants. Q3: How did crypto ETFs perform during the recent Bitcoin price correction? They demonstrated remarkable stability. While Bitcoin’s price fell ~35%, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of only about 4% of total assets, with some weeks seeing net inflows, indicating holders are long-term allocators, not short-term traders. Q4: What types of institutions are looking at crypto ETFs? Major institutions now evaluating allocations include public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds (which manage national wealth), registered investment advisory (RIA) firms, and large university endowments. Q5: What needs to happen for inflows to reach the high end of the forecast ($40B)? Achieving the $40 billion scenario likely requires a combination of a sustained Fed easing cycle, the approval of new ETFs (like for Ethereum), and public allocation announcements from one or more major pension funds, creating a catalyst for wider institutional adoption.

Even the most active Ethereum and BNB Chain fell to positions 4 and 5. Ethereum achieved $524M in yearly revenues, while BNB Chain locked in $257M. The year 2025 marked a watershed for crypto platforms, where usage shifted from novelty and hype to established products. This also led to more predictable revenues from apps, with clear leaders emerging on the most active chains. The leading chains for 2025 also relied on app adoption, instead of only airdrop farming or incentives. Apps on Solana became key infrastructure and went beyond just novelty or point-farming hubs. Previous leaders from the past years, including Avalanche, Filecoin, and TON, did not re-enter the top 10 of the best revenue producers. The rankings showed a shift of apps to a new selection of L1 chains and L2, for both general and specialized usage. The EdgeX chain became a part of the top 10 based on its native DEX performance . Axelar, Bittensor, and Optimism joined the top 10 based on one or two outperforming leading apps. Hyperliquid ends its most active year Hyperliquid ended its most active year, when it emerged as a first mover, and as a leader after the creation of several competing perpetual futures DEXs. Hyperliquid had its first full year as a prominent perpetual futures DEX, also becoming the second-best chain in terms of app revenues. | Source: Hyperscreener The DEX drew in a total of $3.87B in deposits, with over 609K new users joining the platform. Based on the DEX self-reported results, the native HyperCore chain achieved over $908M in annual revenues. Over $848M came from the main activity in trading perpetual futures. The top 100 whales spent $5.7M on gas fees going to the protocol’s reserves. Hyperliquid became one of the platforms with predictable revenues as a result of maturing crypto markets. Builders on the Hyperliquid ecosystem shared the revenues, with over $46M received for the past year. The platform also raised additional revenues from ticker auctions, with nearly $1M in fees for the GOD ticker.

According to PBOC officials, UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF will stop accepting new subscriptions for its Class C shares from Monday. The decision was announced on Friday after repeated risk warnings failed to slow demand driven by social media trading. The manager said the gains were no longer stable and warned that losses could hit fast if prices turn. The move comes as China faces an intense rush into precious metals near year-end. Silver, gold, and platinum have all pushed toward record levels. Retail traders in China have poured into listed funds as limited local options funnel money into a small number of products. The silver fund’s market price surged to more than 60% above the value of its underlying assets, which are silver futures traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. The fund manager said this level exposed buyers to sharp downside risk. Retail trading and online guides fuel extreme premiums China is the world’s largest consumer of silver, but the metal has long been treated as an industrial input rather than an investment. That view changed this year as silver prices jumped about 150% on global markets. Social media amplified the move. Posts on Xiaohongshu, also known as Rednote, circulated step-by-step guides showing traders how to exploit price gaps between the fund’s exchange-traded units and its over-the-counter shares. Money flooded in. For three straight sessions, the fund hit its 10% daily limit. On Thursday, UBS SDIC Fund Management Co. cut the maximum Class C subscription to 100 yuan from 500 yuan, or roughly $14.26. The fund then fell by the same daily limit. Even after the drop, the premium stayed elevated. It slid to 44%, still far above the 7% level recorded at the start of December. On Friday, the manager announced the full closure of Class C subscriptions and also lowered the cap on Class A shares to 100 yuan, effective Monday. The firm said earlier measures failed to cool demand and described the price action as “unsustainable.” China has seen similar bursts of speculative trading in listed open-ended funds, known as LOFs, which trade like stocks but can also be subscribed to directly through fund companies. Tight supply and global policy pressure drive silver higher The silver fund is not alone. Several LOFs surged earlier this week as metals prices climbed. The UBS SDIC silver fund has gained 187% this year, compared with about 145% for Shanghai-listed silver futures. That gap narrowed sharply after Wednesday as restrictions took effect. China continues to play a major role as retail money hunts trends with few domestic channels. As you probably know, gold has dominated 2025 as investors and central banks sought protection under the economic approach of US President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House this year. Silver followed, supported by both investment demand and supply pressure. By early December, silver was up 100%, while gold had risen 60%. Investors bought both metals to hedge against inflation, currency weakness, and political stress. Unlike gold, silver also feeds directly into manufacturing. It is used in electronics, renewable energy equipment, and other industrial products. Inventories sit near record lows, raising the risk of shortages that could hit multiple sectors. Demand typically changes with factory output, interest rates, and energy policy. When growth picks up, industrial buyers push prices higher. When downturn fears rise, investors step in. Liquidity adds risk. The silver market is far smaller than gold. Daily turnover is thinner, and stocks are tighter. Silver held in London is valued at just under $50 billion, while gold stored there is worth about $1.2 trillion. Around $700 billion of that gold is held by central banks in the Bank of England and can be lent during stress. No such backstop exists for silver. China now sits at the center of that imbalance as retail demand meets limited supply.

Aptos is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain with a mature ecosystem comprising a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos network continues to build decentralized applications and tools for developers. But how about APT’s performance? How high will it go? Is APT a good investment? Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Symbol APT Current price $1.67 Aptos crypto market cap $1.25B Trading volume $98.07M Circulating supply 749.87M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $2.22 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $1.71 24-hour low $1.59 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 12.09% 50-day SMA $2.27 200-day SMA $4.12 Current APT crypto sentiment Bearish Green days 10/30 (33%) Fear and Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Aptos price analysis At press time, December 26, Aptos traded at $1.66, up 1.73% in the previous 24 hours but down 23.45% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 5.90% over the previous 24-hours. Aptos 1-day chart price APTUSD chart by TradingView Aptos formed a bearish harami candle pattern in October, resulting in a major 24-hour drop to $0.747 from $5.12. It then made a quick correction above the $2.50 support level. The coin, however, maintained a bearish stance and continues to drop. The histograms (0.046) indicate positive market momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is dropping. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis APTUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart, like the daily chart, shows a neutral market with rising volatility. The chart has formed short MACD histograms, indicating little momentum over the short term. Traders, however, are waiting to see if it breaks the $2.00 resistance level.

Aptos unlocked $19.8M tokens on December 12, releasing ~11.6M APT (1.5% of market cap) to core contributors, investors, and the community. New coins risk diluting the value of the coin. Recent news Binance Academy has launched a free online course in collaboration with Aptos Labs and the Aptos Foundation, designed for builders and enthusiasts of the network. Users who complete the course will share 3,500 APT in token vouchers. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2031. Will Aptos reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains unlikely that Aptos will get to $1000 before 2031. What is the long-term price prediction for Aptos? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, Aptos will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. How high can Aptos coin go? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach a high of $24.84 in 2031. Is Aptos worth investing in? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META.

Aptos historic price sentiment APT price history by CoinGecko Aptos raised seed funding in January 2022, led by a16z. Series A funding included Apollo, Dragonfly, Franklin Templeton, and others. Some members previously worked on the Diem blockchain proposed by Facebook. The Aptos mainnet launched in October 2022 with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. After the launch hype, Apt fell to its lowest in December 2022, at $3.09. A month later, the tables turned, as it peaked at a time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023.

Russia’s rocket program, despite being positioned as a competitor to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has faced several challenges, leading to years of delays. What is the launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket delayed? Roscosmos, Russia’s state space corporation, announced that Russia and Kazakhstan have delayed the first launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket, a potential competitor to SpaceX’s commercial space operations, due to the need for additional testing of its onboard systems and ground equipment. The Soyuz-5 was scheduled to lift off before the end of 2024 from the newly constructed Baiterek complex at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But now, a new launch date will be determined after all necessary tests are completed and program participants finalize coordination. The Baiterek project is a joint venture between Russia and Kazakhstan, which makes use of the facilities at Baikonur and has served as a primary launch site for the Russian space program for decades. The Soyuz-5 program encountered initial setbacks when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, resulting in international sanctions. These sanctions restricted access to certain technologies and components critical for space systems development. Russia then launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, resulting in even more sanctions from Western nations. These restrictions have affected not only the rocket’s development timeline but also hindered Russia’s space industry’s capacity to maintain its technological advancement. What other problems is Russia’s space program experiencing? In late November, a launch pad at Baikonur sustained damage during a rocket launch carrying crew members to the International Space Station. The incident temporarily halted crewed flights from that facility, and Roscosmos announced that the repairs will be completed by the end of February 2026, a one-year postponement from the initial February 2025 schedule. On November 27, the program suffered its most substantial challenge during the launch of the Soyuz MS-28 spacecraft to the ISS. A service module fairing malfunctioned, prompting Roscosmos to suspend all crewed launches. The suspension affects Russia’s commitments to the International Space Station and represents a critical blow to the country’s reputation as a reliable partner in human spaceflight. Additionally, a Proton-M launch vehicle that was scheduled for December 15 from Baikonur did not take place. The Proton-M series has been a workhorse for Russian commercial and government satellite launches. Despite these setbacks, on December 25, a Soyuz 2.1a launch vehicle successfully lifted off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, and another Soyuz launch is planned for December 28 from the Vostochny Cosmodrome.

Institutional Sell-Off? A detailed analysis by market expert NoLimit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) reveals that, at the time of the stock market opening, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT transferred hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Coinbase Prime wallets. This timing and location indicate a pattern that institutions often follow when selling their assets. As explained, these coins are not sent to Coinbase Prime merely to remain inactive; they are typically directed there for sale or liquidity management purposes. NoLimit asserts that when a major player like BlackRock needs to liquidate assets or meet redemption demands, the price of Bitcoin reacts rapidly. He suggests that this situation reflects a combination of factors: selling related to ETFs taking place during low liquidity, inventory management in anticipation of upcoming volatility, and risk reduction in light of a significant derivatives event. Bitcoin Faces Sharp Decline Compounding these concerns, technical analyst OxNobler highlighted further developments that contributed to the recent downturn, detailing significant sell-offs by various trading platforms. In a rapid succession of transactions, Binance reportedly sold 10,155 BTC, Wintermute let go of 5,354 BTC, Coinbase disposed of 10,113 BTC, BlackRock sold 4,945 BTC, and Kraken moved 4,630 BTC. Collectively, these actions amounted to over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sold within a mere 30 minutes, raising suspicions of coordinated market manipulation. According to analysts from Bull Theory, the situation has taken a dire turn, with Bitcoin plummeting by $2,300 and liquidating $66 million in long positions in just 45 minutes. Against this backdrop, $60 billion has been wiped from the crypto market without any negative news triggering such a drastic shift. This scenario has led them to assert that manipulation continues to be a significant concern within the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,340, down slightly more than 30% from its all-time highs set earlier in October.

They usually begin when familiar leaders pause and quieter contenders start gaining traction. That is the pattern many observers are noticing right now. As Solana trades under a key level, attention is gradually moving toward a $0.035 new cryptocurrency that is approaching full allocation. For those asking what crypto to buy now while large caps lose momentum, this contrast is becoming more visible by the week. The comparison between Solana and this emerging DeFi crypto highlights how different stages of growth can shape future price potential. Solana (SOL) Solana remains one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the market. Its ecosystem expanded rapidly during its early growth phase, delivering strong returns for early participants. SOL moved from relatively low levels to well above $200 at its peak, securing a place among top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Today, Solana faces a different reality. With a large valuation and wide distribution, price movement has slowed. The $150 level has acted as a resistance zone, where rallies often lose strength. Market commentators suggest that at this size, another explosive move would require massive capital inflows. Some analysts believe that while Solana can still grow, expectations need to be realistic. In a conservative scenario, projections show SOL struggling to deliver more than moderate gains in the near term unless broader market conditions shift dramatically. This is not a failure of the project, but a natural result of scale. For investors focused on crypto investing with higher upside potential, this is often the moment they begin exploring earlier-stage opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) That search has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into focus. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto designed around decentralized lending and borrowing. The protocol allows users to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system that adjusts rates based on real usage. The presale for Mutuum Finance began in early 2025 and has shown steady demand. The current token price is $0.035, and Phase 6 of the presale is now over 99% allocated. So far, the project has raised $19.45M, attracted 18,650 holders, and sold 825M tokens. From a total supply of 4B tokens, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to about 1.82B tokens. These figures point to consistent participation rather than sudden bursts of interest, which many market commentators view as a healthier signal. For those tracking crypto prices today and evaluating new cryptocurrency projects, this level of traction before launch often matters. Contrasting Price Outlooks for SOL and MUTM The difference between Solana and Mutuum Finance becomes clearer when comparing potential price paths. For SOL, its size creates limits. Even in a bullish scenario, analysts often point to resistance near $150 as a major hurdle. With a high market cap, another early-cycle style surge appears less likely in the near term. Some projections suggest SOL could remain range-bound unless new catalysts emerge across the broader ecosystem. Mutuum Finance sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. At $0.035, the token is still in its presale phase, with an official launch price set at $0.06. Some analysts believe that simply moving from the current level to launch represents meaningful upside. Early investor sentiment indicates that a 250% to 350% increase after launch is considered achievable if adoption unfolds as planned. In more optimistic scenarios, projections show even stronger outcomes over longer time frames. Analysts modeling usage growth, exchange visibility, and supply dynamics have outlined paths that point to 500% or higher growth as the protocol matures. These are not guarantees, but structured models based on timing and execution. This contrast explains why some investors see MUTM as offering asymmetrical potential compared to established assets like SOL. Security Signals and Community Engagement Trust and activity often matter as much as price. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score, adding a layer of confidence as development progresses. An independent audit with Halborn Security is also underway, reviewing finalized lending and borrowing contracts. The project has also introduced a $50k bug bounty focused on identifying code vulnerabilities. Market commentators suggest that proactive security measures often attract more serious capital, especially from participants accustomed to higher standards. Community engagement is another factor. A 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM, keeping activity high as the presale nears completion. This steady participation helps maintain visibility during a critical phase. Why Whale Allocations Matter at This Stage Whale allocations often increase during moments when supply tightens and milestones approach. With Phase 6 nearly sold out and Phase 7 ahead, some larger participants appear to be positioning early. Whales typically look for three things. Limited supply at current prices. Clear development milestones. And growing attention without excessive noise. Mutuum Finance currently checks all three boxes, according to several market commentators. Solana, by contrast, does not face the same supply dynamics. Its circulating supply is already well distributed, and price movement depends more on long-term ecosystem growth than near-term transitions. The Bigger Picture Solana’s current position reflects maturity rather than early expansion. Mutuum Finance represents the opposite. A project still building, still attracting new holders, and still priced at $0.035 as allocation tightens. For investors asking which crypto to buy today with an eye on long-term growth, this comparison highlights why attention is shifting. As SOL slows under $150, this new DeFi crypto is entering a stage where early demand, limited supply, and upcoming milestones begin to intersect. With Phase 6 approaching full allocation, Mutuum Finance is moving into the part of its story where early positioning often becomes more difficult to find.

Amid speculation and social media chatter, Hoskinson firmly denies the claims, insisting he did not personally contribute to the decline by offloading his assets. Cardano Founder Denies Claims Of Selling ADA Despite the festive holiday season, Hoskinson was bombarded with accusations of contributing to ADA’s 80% price crash over the past four years. Initially, the Cardano founder took to X on December 25 to share an optimistic message for 2026, encouraging holders and community members not to lose hope. Related Reading: What The New Mightnight Launch Means For The Cardano Network He emphasized that despite the challenges of the past years, there is much to look forward to in 2026. He extended holiday greetings and expressed appreciation for the Cardano community, including members like @injective_pie, who has been vocal about ADA’s price performance and its blockchain’s progress over the years. While many responded positively to Hoskinson’s messages and holiday greetings, @injective_pie confronted him directly, accusing him of dumping ADA. The community member questioned the Cardano founder about selling his ADA at $3 and not buying back at lower levels around $0.3, suggesting that such actions could undermine trust in the crypto project. Hoskinson swiftly dismissed these allegations, insisting that he did not dump his ADA and that false narratives do not change reality. The member’s response highlighted the tension between the Cardano founder and some skeptical segments of the community. It also underscored the ongoing dissatisfaction with the current price of ADA. Notably, frustration among ADA investors has been growing over the years, as the cryptocurrency has failed to regain its all-time highs. Since its 2021 peak, the Cardano price has steadily declined, most recently dropping toward $0.35 after crashing by over 3% this week. Year-to-date, the altcoin has fallen by more than 50%, underscoring the prolonged challenges facing the network despite its strong community support. Cardano’s underperformance stands in contrast to other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which reached new ATHs this year. Even with its surging daily trading volume of more than 96%, ADA has yet to show any significant upward momentum, declining even more as the broader market navigates ongoing bearish pressures. ADA Price Weakens Further As Open Interest Drops Amidst sluggish price action, data from Coinglass shows that ADA Futures Open Interest (OI) has declined from $1.72 billion in October 2025 to $651 million as of December 26. This massive change represents a steep decline of more than 62% in less than three months. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Reveals “Game Plan” For 2026, But Can ADA Price Still Recover? With key fundamentals deteriorating and market sentiment weakening, additional pressure has been placed on ADA’s price.

This sudden drop, caused by a severe lack of liquidity, marks one of the most extreme depegs for a major stablecoin this year. Market Strain and Rapid Response According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, which raised an alert about the event, the depeg was a direct result of a liquidity drain on trading platforms. The stablecoin’s developer, Solstice, responded quickly. In a statement posted on X, the team confirmed the issue was isolated to secondary markets, noting that the funds backing USX in its primary system were “entirely unaffected and >100% collateralized.” They emphasized that 1:1 redemptions through their primary market remained operational. The situation stabilized after Solstice and its market makers injected fresh liquidity, pulling the price back to approximately $0.94. Despite this recovery, the brief crash established a new all-time low of $0.8285 for USX, as recorded by CoinGecko. The stablecoin has since returned near its $1.00 target, currently trading around $0.995. While the 24-hour price change shows only a minor 0.3% decline, the dramatic intraday swing from $0.8285 to a high of $1.01 highlights the volatility triggered by the liquidity shortfall. A Recurring Challenge for Algorithmic Stablecoins This incident is a reminder of the persistent fragility of certain stablecoin designs when faced with secondary market pressures. It echoes other significant depegs in 2025; for example, the one in April where Synthetix’s sUSD stablecoin fell below $0.70 following protocol changes that altered its collateral mechanics. At the time, founder Kain Warwick darkly joked about the situation by renaming his social account to “kain.depeg.” More recently in November, Stream Finance’s XUSD stablecoin crashed to $0.30 after the protocol revealed a $93 million loss from an external fund manager. The USX event differs in that its underlying collateral was not compromised, framing it purely as a secondary market liquidity failure. Meanwhile, Solstice has committed to obtaining a third-party attestation report, in what some market observers believe is an attempt to rebuild trust. However, for investors and the wider crypto community, these repeated events serve as a stark reminder of the risks that remain even in stablecoins backed by verifiable assets, where market structure can sometimes fail before the fundamentals do.

The video opened with a broad market reset. Bitcoin slipped below $87,000, ETF outflows accelerated, and altcoins weakened across the board. Against that backdrop, BullRunners shifted focus to XRP, which he described as a decisive technical area while investor behavior sends mixed signals. He focused on short-term pressure, longer-term structure, and why XRP remains relevant despite the drawdown. Ripple #XRP $1.10 Warning! BEST WARNING to Save Your Crypto Portfolio NOW? pic.twitter.com/CZnWU3Z6q5 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) December 25, 2025 XRP Holds the Spotlight Amid Market Stress BullRunners acknowledged that XRP lost key support near $1.9 and slid into the $1.85 to $1.86 range. He noted that sellers remain active in the short term. However, he warned against panic reactions . He emphasized zooming out rather than reacting to intraday moves. According to him, XRP has failed several attempts to reclaim $2, but that failure does not invalidate the larger trend structure . He pushed back on aggressive downside targets circulating on social media. He said he does not see a fast collapse to $1.1 in the near term. Instead, he pointed to intermediate support zones near $1.51 to $1.52, in case selling pressure increases. Descending Wedge Defines the Technical Setup BullRunners spent significant time on XRP’s multi-month chart structure. He described XRP trading inside a descending, narrowing wedge that began after the July peak . He highlighted that the price fell below support in October and November but quickly recovered back into the range. According to his analysis, XRP has not produced a confirmed breakdown from this structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He identified the convergence of downward resistance and support as the key technical feature to watch. Based on his chart, that convergence aligns with late Q1 or early Q2 2026. He also pointed to the 1,100 moving average, approximately $1.54 to $1.55, and the 50 moving average moving lower. He said a crossover would confirm a bullish divergence. When combined with the wedge structure, it could signal a powerful move. Despite price weakness, BullRunners suggested continued XRP ETF inflows as a key divergence from the wider market. He contrasted those inflows with heavy Bitcoin ETF outflows, stating that capital rotation into XRP remains intact during volatility. He described the current phase as late-cycle deleveraging, not structural failure. He stressed that XRP has not broken its long-term trend support. While volatility may persist, he leaned bullish over the coming months if the descending wedge resolves to the upside.
