Is Loopring a good investment Loopring (LRC) could be a promising investment for those interested in Layer 2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, particularly due to its focus on zk-Rollups for fast and low-cost transactions. Its decentralized exchange (DEX) technology and commitment to security and efficiency make it a strong contender in the DeFi space. However, its success depends on broader Ethereum adoption, competition from other Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, and overall market trends. While Loopring has potential, investors should consider its volatility, ecosystem development, and market conditions before investing. Always conduct thorough research and risk assessment before making any investment decisions. Why is LRC up? The LRC/USD crypto pair price has spiked today as the buying influx has abruptly taken over the market, surging the price to $0.0570. The bulls are targeting the resistance of $0.0587 next, as overall, the coin’s value has increased significantly over the past week. Will LRC reach $0.5? According to the long-term predictions, LRC is projected to reach up to $0.44 by 2031. Will LRC reach $1? No, LRC may not reach $1 in the near future. By the year 2030, the highest price prediction is $0.44255, suggesting that LRC lacks the potential to achieve this milestone at the moment. Does LRC have a good long-term future? Loopring (LRC) has long-term potential as a Layer 2 solution using zk-Rollups for fast, low-cost Ethereum transactions. Its DEX technology supports the shift toward decentralized trading. However, strong competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet poses challenges. Success depends on adoption, partnerships, and innovation. While promising, risks like market volatility and regulatory changes should be considered before investing.

Loopring Price History Loopring price history Based on historical data, the Loopring token LRC suffered a significant knock in 2018. Prices fell in April after reaching a high of $1.4522 in January 2018, falling to an all-time low of $0.01986 in December 2019. By early 2020, the coin price had corrected to $0.0225. However, following the DEX’s beta debut, values started to rise significantly, and the LRC coin traded for $0.087895 at the start of June 2020, up almost 300 percent during the first half of 2020. LRC skyrocketed, breaking above $3 in December 2021, as the Crypto market capitalization increased. Loopring caught investors’ attention when it broke above $1 in October 2021. It continued to register its all-time high at $3.83 in November 2021. The reversal was swift in 2022, losing over 90% of its value. In 2023, it faced stiff resistance at the $0.25 mark. LRC continued its downward trend, staying within the $0.10-$0.50 range in the year 2023. LRC settled around $0.11-$0.12, maintaining a stable but low in December 2024 In January 2025, LRC traded around $0.11, showing little change from the previous months. As of early March 2025, LRC continues to trade around $0.11, showing a stable but weak trend. The altcoin showed high volatility in April and May, touching a bottom price of $0.0759 and a high of $0.1282. In June 2025, LRC observed a further low of $0.659, followed by a period of recovery, when the altcoin recovered back to $0.1030 in July and $0.1076 in September. LRC remained in decline till the start of December, observing the year’s lowest price of $0.0482, and has since slightly recovered to $0.0571 by the end of the year.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LRC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:00:00

The so called “coin of the cycle” is stuck in a boring range, and sentiment around it is at some of the lowest levels we have seen in a while. SOL ETFs still recorded about $1.4M in inflows on December 24, which is one of the few positive signs right now, but it has not been enough to change the bigger picture. Solana (SOL) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Looking ahead to 2026, analysts like Umair Crypto point out that the core problem is still on the chart. Price has failed to flip the $127 level into support. Every attempt to break and hold above that area has been cleanly rejected, forcing SOL to roll over and search for lower support. At the time of writing, Solana is holding around $123, which is now the key level bulls need to defend. Solana Price Prediction: What Is The Next Move For SOL Price? Source: JamesEaston There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI , which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. One big thing that is missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is still pretty weak, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully committing to this move yet. Without a clear spike in volume, any push above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What really changes the picture is a clean break above the $144 level with strong volume coming in. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Bitcoin Hyper Is Quietly Building While Solana Stalls While Solana chops sideways and sentiment keeps sinking, Bitcoin Hyper is moving in the opposite direction, quietly stacking momentum while most traders are distracted. This is usually how early cycle winners start, low noise, steady inflows, and no need for hype candles yet. Bitcoin Hyper is designed to capitalize on exactly this kind of market environment. When majors stall and confidence drops, capital slowly rotates into projects with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost always happens before the charts make it obvious. The project has already raised over $29.8M, showing serious conviction from early backers even while the broader market hesitates. On top of that, the 39% APY staking rewards incentivize holders to stay put rather than flip for short term moves, which helps build real supply pressure over time. While traders wait for Solana to finally flip resistance, Bitcoin Hyper is building its base. And when momentum returns to the market, the projects that were accumulated quietly during boredom phases are usually the ones that move first and hardest.

The pullback comes even as on-chain metrics point to easing sell pressure and a record build-up of stablecoin capital, leaving traders split between caution and the risk of sudden price swings. ETF Outflows and Holiday Liquidity Weigh on Prices XWIN Finance’s Trend Index, published on December 25, placed the market firmly in a “mild downtrend” with a score of 34 out of 100, citing persistent ETF withdrawals and U.S.-session selling as the main drags. It saw Bitcoin briefly dipping below $87,000 before bouncing, though repeated attempts to reclaim the $88,000 to $89,000 area have stalled, a zone XWIN described as heavy resistance shaped by options positioning. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see net withdrawals, with roughly 2,900 BTC, worth some $251 million, leaving funds in the latest session. That weakness lines up with figures reported by CryptoPotato on December 24, which showed cumulative BTC ETF inflows shrinking by nearly $6 billion since their October peak. Ethereum funds followed a similar pattern, remaining net negative on a weekly basis despite a small daily bounce. By contrast, diversification flows are visible elsewhere. For example, Solana products posted steady inflows, while XRP-related ETFs added about $8 million in the most recent session, extending a streak that has made XRP funds an outlier among crypto ETFs. Bitcoin’s price action reflects this uneasy balance, with the asset trading just under $88,000 at the time of writing, up about 1% on the day and week, but still nearly 20% lower over three months. Volatility has stayed compressed, with a 24-hour range between $87,000 and $88,000, while the past week saw swings between $85,000 and just over $90,000. Relative to the broader market, Bitcoin’s moves have been muted, with liquidity-driven wicks outweighing trend-following flows. On-Chain Signals Hint at Exhaustion, Not Panic Beneath the weak sentiment, on-chain data paints a more nuanced picture. XWIN noted that whale exchange inflows over the past 30 days sit near cycle lows, while Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is still falling, a sign that long-term holders are slowing their selling. At the same time, there appears to be a fair amount of caution, with spending from very old Bitcoin cohorts ticking higher, a pattern sometimes seen near major turning points. Network activity also remains soft, suggesting demand has not yet returned in force. According to the XWIN assessment, the current market tension is being reflected in sentiment gauges, particularly the Fear and Greed Index, which is in “Extreme Fear” at 24, while DeFi borrowing has dropped sharply since August, pointing to reduced leverage. Nonetheless, stablecoin supply has climbed to a record near $310 billion, signaling large pools of sidelined capital. With equities and gold both at record highs and January rate expectations tilted toward a pause, macro conditions are not overtly hostile. For crypto, however, XWIN suggested that the next move still hinges on ETF flows and post-expiry options dynamics. Until those shifts, the market may stay fragile, even as signs of seller fatigue quietly build beneath the surface.

Why Price Could Crash To $80,000",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-christmas-rally-80000/,"It’s the holiday season, and Bitcoin (BTC) is trading downwards after plunging toward the $87,000 region. Although the cryptocurrency has struggled for months, failing to reclaim key resistance levels, a crypto analyst believes Bitcoin could still stage a major Christmas rally . As the analyst outlines a potential roadmap for this projected upswing, he cautions that a further price crash to $80,000, or even lower, remains a strong possibility. Bitcoin Risks Crash To $80,000 Crypto analyst RBswingtrader shared a Bitcoin market outlook on X the day before Christmas, outlining multiple scenarios that could determine whether the cryptocurrency resumes an upward trend or faces further downside . The analyst noted that smart money is currently buying Bitcoin in a new zone and also cautioned that a final price crash, potentially driven by market manipulation , could occur before a trend reversal. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could still decline to a fresh local low around $80,000 before strong buyers enter the market. The analyst stressed the importance of patience, viewing this potential dip as part of a broader accumulation strategy. He shared a chart highlighting BTC trading under a declining orange Moving Average (MA) after a sharp selloff from the $108,519 resistance zone. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency’s price had previously failed at the upper range and rolled over into a strong downtrend that has persisted for weeks . RBswingtrader further pinpointed a clear Elliott Wave structure on the BTC chart, with waves labeled from one through five, followed by an ABC corrective pattern . Wave 3 accelerated Bitcoin’s selloff, while Wave 5 appears to be developing, with downside targets still open. Multiple key support levels were also highlighted, including $87,106, $86,169, and $83,986. The analyst warned that a deeper breakdown from these support levels could open the door to a potential crash toward $80,427, with an extended lower target near $74,185 if Bitcoin’s selling pressure intensifies. He also plotted multiple Fibonacci retracement levels that align with the lower support zones for the BTC price. Notably, the volume data at the bottom of the chart indicates a large accumulation trend through December. Increased trading activity supports the view that large players are taking advantage of dips and building positions despite Bitcoin’s weak price action. Is A Christmas Rally Still Possible For BTC? In RBswingtrader’s chart, a potential Christmas rally for Bitcoin was illustrated with an upward projection targeting the $108,519 region if the price recovers from its current lows. The chart indicated that growing accumulation volume this December and the Bullish Divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) could support upward momentum. RBswingtrader also noted that reclaiming key technical levels, including the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement near $96,690-$96,836, could support Bitcoin’s potential upward move.

As we go into the year, new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): Could Be Looking At Very Positive Year XRP ETFs have seen impressive inflows despite the “dead” price action in the market. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs recorded $1.13B in net inflows, with steady demand over the past 33 days. These funds have outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, holding positive momentum even while broader market conditions remain volatile. Add in the constant ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically strong chart, and 2026 could be shaping up to be a very interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Dogecoin And Shiba Inu: Memecoins Potential Revival? I know memecoins look mostly dead right now and hope feels pretty thin across the board. But for Shiba specifically, there is something big on the horizon. The team is planning a major network upgrade that would add privacy to the chain. That is a big deal, especially with privacy becoming one of the hottest topics in crypto right now. Source: SHIBUSD / TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling to build momentum as Christmas approaches, with market sentiment looking increasingly indecisive. The memecoin is down about 1.7% over the last 24 hours, trading in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of price action points to a dull, low-energy market, with SHIB currently sitting near the lower end of that range. For this bounce to mean anything, price needs to break above $0.00000800 and hold it to confirm a bullish shift. If it fails to do so, SHIB could slide back toward a new low, marked by the red projection, which is the same area where buyers stepped in last time. Dogecoin is in a similar spot, and there still looks like there is room for more downside before the next real move higher kicks in. Price just lost the $0.13 support, and that opens the door for a drop toward the $0.09 area. That would mean roughly a 31% downside move from here in the short term. The RSI is not helping the bull case either. It has been stuck below the 14-day moving average and the midline for weeks now, which is a clear sign that bearish momentum is still in control and sellers are dictating the price action. Bitcoin Hyper Is Building While Alts Chop Sideways While most altcoins are stuck grinding lower and sentiment feels drained, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite. This is usually how early cycle winners start forming, not during euphoric rallies, but during boredom, doubt, and sideways markets. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself for the next phase of the market, where capital rotates out of lagging majors and into projects with clear narratives and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost never waits for perfect charts, it happens while most traders are still distracted by short term weakness in names like XRP, DOGE, and SHIB. The project has already raised more than $29M, showing strong conviction from early participants even while the broader market struggles to find direction. On top of that, staking rewards hovering around 39% APY give holders a reason to sit tight and accumulate rather than chase quick flips. Historically, the biggest breakouts come from projects that were built quietly during consolidation phases like this. While the crowd waits for confirmation candles on altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper is laying its foundation. If 2026 really does shape up to be a bullish year, the projects accumulated during this low-interest phase are often the ones that move first and hardest.

Tech companies say these tools could transform how games get made. Leading research teams at Google DeepMind and a billion-dollar startup called World Labs, started by AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, are developing what they call “world models.” These are AI systems that can understand and recreate physical spaces, and experts think they’ll shake up the gaming business. Shlomi Fruchter helps lead DeepMind’s Genie 3 project , which builds these world models. He said game-making is going through major changes. “Creating software and games in particular is changing a lot, and I expect it to change, maybe entirely, over the next few years,” Fruchter explained to the Financial Times. He thinks the technology will help people who make games work faster and better, opening up new possibilities that don’t exist right now. But he doesn’t expect it to completely take over current methods. Other AI companies like Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia are testing these world models for robots and self-driving cars. However, the gaming world offers quicker opportunities for profit. Research firm Newzoo expects the gaming sector to bring in close to $190 billion this year. AI is already changing how studios work Game makers already use AI tools to design backgrounds and create characters. Back in May, Epic Games and Disney added an AI-powered Darth Vader to the game Fortnite. They built this Star Wars character using technology from Google and ElevenLabs, making him an interactive character that players could engage with. Alexander Vaschenko runs Game Gears studio, where AI has sped up work on titles like Aliens vs Zombies: Invasion by four times. “Based on my professional experience, I firmly believe that both the video game and film industries will soon be unable to function without AI,” Vaschenko said. AI firms believe newer, stronger world models will push more game companies to adopt this technology. These models can build 3D interactive spaces just from written descriptions. World Labs released a model called Marble last month. Another company, Runway, which partners with game studios, put out its first world model in December. Li said this technology will affect major game engines like Unity and Epic’s Unreal. “This is all up for disruption,” she stated, adding that simulation gaming engines need upgrades. Looking ahead, AI experts say regular players will be able to design their own game worlds. Developers won’t need pricey software or special training to make content. Eric Xing, who leads the Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi, explained the impact. “Now a gamer in front of this world model can put themselves into a virtual world,” Xing said. “That makes the game industry very different from today, because producing a personalised game is now a straightforward process.” Workers raise concerns about job security Not everyone sees this as progress. Critics worry AI will cost jobs for developers and artists, and flood games with cheap, low-quality content that people call “slop.” Six video game worker unions across Europe spoke out against AI use in their field this month. They said companies are forcing these tools on workers even though they make working conditions worse. Those who support AI use say it could lower costs, boost creativity, and prevent worker exhaustion. This matters in an industry where top games, called triple-A titles, can take multiple years and more than $1 billion to finish. Alexandre Moufarek at DeepMind used to work as an associate producer at French game company Ubisoft. He hopes world models will give developers room to “find the fun” and “try new ideas and take risks again.” “Often, that’s the time that’s missing at the end of the production. Christmas is coming, and you need to release the game, and you just don’t have time to polish the things that you wanted [or] debug things correctly,” Moufarek said. “The more we put those models in the hands of creatives, I’m sure we are going to discover new ways of working that we haven’t even anticipated yet.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|DeepMind,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:35:00

A Critical 1% Allocation Threshold Is Near for This $0.035 Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-for-q1-2026-a-critical-1-allocation-threshold-is-near-for-this-0-035-altcoin/,"In any market cycle there comes that short time, when positioning is more important than headlines. News Breaks do not necessarily cause price movements. They tend to shift once expectations change silently as a result of tightening of supply. This is normally when long term narratives emerge, long before the broader interest comes. Currently, numerous traders looking in crypto news and wondering what crypto to purchase are keeping an eye on one particular DeFi crypto. This is not due to hype but structural threshold is actually being met. After this has been closed, the set up changes. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto bank that is involved in lending and borrowing. In its simplest form, the protocol will enable users to deposit assets and get yield, and borrowers receive liquidity through collateral locking. This results in a usage cycle which can be multiplied with the increase in demand. As an illustration, a user is able to input stable assets in the protocol and receive mtTokens in their turn. These mtTokens are the position provided and the growth of value as the interests of the borrowers are earned. In this design, rather than using short term trading, the longer holding is used as a reward of actual activity. Borrowing side In the borrowing side, the user is able to get access to liquidity by pledging their assets based on specified rules. The interest rates and collateral requirements are designed in such a way that there is lesser uncertainty. It is this kind of system that renders the lending protocols relevant in the long run. The next V1 launch is an important event. V1 is where development is changed to live use. This is the point of transition between preparation and execution of the protocol, according to the official updates. Investor Base and Funding Growth The participation has increased and it is one of the most evident messages in the enquiry of Mutuum Finance. It has already raised more than $19.4M and has more than 18,500 holders in its portfolio. The fact that these figures came into being did not occur instantly. The steady growth has not been abrupt. This tends to single out accumulation and not speculation in the short term. Several of them have remained during various stages and this implies that they have faith in the roadmap and do not change direction. The token was initiated at a very low level on initial stages and is currently priced at $0.035. This is about an increment of 250% of the initial price. This increase did not happen in a single instance. It was preceded by a demand and diminishing supply. Supply and Distribution Signals and Access Signals The maximum supply of MUTM is 4B of tokens. 1.82B tokens or 45.5% of total MUTM supply is distributed through the presale phases. Quite a considerable part of such tokens has already been sold, and what remains is very scarce indeed. Behavior usually shifts when, at this point, there is tightening of supply. Customers will make decisions at a quicker pace and price increments will increase. This is the reason why the current stage is under strict monitoring. There is the 24 hour leaderboard that is an additional revelation. It also follows regular attendance rather than sporadic attendance. This is mostly indicative of persistent interest and not single purchases. Demand is increased with support of card payment as well. The more accessible it is, the more participation tends to occur, particularly among the users coming in and not via one of the traditional crypto channels. Security Reviews Any DeFi crypto will be primarily concerned with security. Mutuum Finance has already passed a CertiK scan with a score of 90/100. This is a critical background check that most investors, when dealing with a new cryptocurrency, would want to check. Besides CertiK, the protocol was being reviewed by Halborn Security . There is an active program of a $50K bug bounty program which allows outsourcing and testing to be done and issues found before full scale use. In addition to security, the roadmap contains intentions of a protocol supported stablecoin. Non-specialized assets will be able to add to the daily use and will decrease volatility in lending systems. Integrations with oracle are also scheduled and it helps in ensuring that collateral and interest are calculated accurately. These aspects are not short term characteristics. They provide long term supporting infrastructure layers. The reason Why Phase 6 Is Generating Urgency Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. This implies that only a very low percentage will be left at the prevailing price. Recent action Boasts of a $100k whale allocation that is frequent when institutional players can expect a transitional spot. Once a phase is closed, prices tend to come up. That is why the existing threshold is important. It is the last window before the circumstances transform. This step can be the determining element to individuals seeking the potential best crypto to purchase today. When the access is over, the market situation becomes not one of access, but scarcity. By Q1 2026, Mutuum Finance is going towards a stage where supply is constrained, infrastructure is prepared and usage is near. Such a combination is what is making it gain momentum as the best crypto to watch in the next cycle.

This is a big moment for our team and the WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started,” the company wrote. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., created USD1 earlier this year after Trump took back the White House, saying simply that “this one is for the retail users.” USD1 market cap has surpassed $3B. This is a big moment for our team and WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started. 🦅☝️📈 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) December 25, 2025 The so-called stable token first broke past the $1 billion mark in April, less than a month after it went live. From the beginning, the project called itself a tool for real-time crypto payments, pushing to build strong relationships with retail users and major U.S. exchanges. WLFI partnered with Coinbase and FalconX, setting up distribution channels to get USD1 into more wallets. It’s also trying to take over Solana’s stablecoin turf by teaming up with meme coin project Bonk and Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium. WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said , “This is just the beginning, we are building the future of finance driven by real world adoption of USD1.” Binance connects USD1 to its trading ecosystem The sudden jump in value followed Binance introducing a Booster Program tied to USD1. Users who hold the stablecoin on the exchange now get up to 20% APR through flexible earn products. Binance also confirmed it would swap all collateral backing its Binance-peg BUSD (B-Token) into USD1, at a 1:1 rate. This move embeds USD1 deeper into the exchange’s collateral system, effectively replacing BUSD in some areas. That’s not all. The stablecoin is also tied to bigger financial deals. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based MGX used USD1 to complete a $2 billion investment in Binance. This payment came just before President Trump granted a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, who co-founded Binance. At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported speculation that CZ may have used his influence to boost WLFI ahead of the pardon. Binance U.S. denied any coordination and claimed its listings of WLFI and USD1 were just “purely business decisions.” Despite that, Trump’s involvement and the WLFI-Binance link drew fire from Democrats. Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed to this connection while fighting against the GENIUS Act, which was later passed into law. Bitcoin flash crash reveals issues with USD1 trading pair Meanwhile, earlier this morning, the BTC/USD1 trading pair on Binance experienced a flash crash, briefly dragging Bitcoin down to $24,000 for a few seconds. The price then bounced above $87,000 before stabilizing, according to data gotten from the world’s largest exchange. Other pairs like BTC/USDT weren’t affected, but the incident exposed how fragile newer trading pairs can be when liquidity dries up. The crash came from a microstructure failure. There weren’t enough buy or sell orders near the current market price. On thin pairs, one aggressive order or a missing bid can wipe through the order book and cause a sharp drop. Once new bids enter or the order clears, the price jumps back up. Binance confirmed it was limited to the BTC/USD1 spot pair only. This kind of thing happens when a trading pair lacks depth. A shallow book means even one big trade can move prices way off course, even if just for a moment. USD1 may be scaling fast, but its liquidity structure still has holes that need to be watched.

56363569,https://cryptonews.com/?p=467844,1766700201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56363569.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana, Cardano by the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-cardano-by-the-end-of-2026/,"Chinese AI model DeepSeek, often called a serious rival to ChatGPT, just dropped a fresh set of price predictions for XRP, Cardano, and Solana as 2025 heads into its final week. According to the model, all three coins are entering a high-volatility window, with the potential for sharp moves in either direction before the year wraps up. The outlook is based on a mix of macro conditions, fundamentals, and technical signals. Below is a breakdown of DeepSeek AI two possible scenarios, showing both the bullish and bearish price paths it sees for each asset through the end of December. Ripple (XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts A Run Toward $6 Going Into The New Year DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Ripple’s XRP going into 2026 targets $4.50 to $6.00. The bullish case assumes a few big things go right: clear regulation after the SEC case, wider adoption of Ripple’s ODL for cross-border payments, and deeper involvement in CBDC projects. If all that lines up, DeepSeek thinks XRP could jump more than 80% and push into the $3 to $5 range. On the flip side, the bearish scenario is pretty rough. DeepSeek warns that if selling pressure ramps up and sentiment turns ugly, XRP could slide hard from around $1.86 down toward $1.00. That would be a massive drop and shows just how volatile things could get if the market flips negative. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. The recent launch of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. could bring in a new wave of institutional money, even during the slower holiday period. We have seen this playbook before with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where demand built quietly before bigger moves followed. With more ETF approvals likely in the coming months, the odds are rising that 2026 turns into a breakout year for XRP. For investors accumulating at current levels, the risk-reward could end up looking very attractive. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek Expects Solana Is Ready For 300% Jump DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 targets $275 to $350. Solana remains the coin of the cycle. DeepSeek AI predicts Solana could supercharge and lead scalable consumer applications, with ecosystem growth and rising institutional adoption potentially driving a 300% breakout by early 2026. If that fails, the bear case is not much worse than current conditions, with DeepSeek projecting a drop toward the $80-$95 support zone. There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI, which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. Cardano (ADA): Deepseek Says Its Finally Going Back Above The Dollar Mark? DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Cardano ADA going into 2026 targets $0.85 to $1.20. This hinges on Cardano actually delivering. A smooth rollout of the Chang hard fork would unlock on-chain governance and the community treasury, while real-world utility projects would finally prove the peer-reviewed approach works at scale. But if those pieces stall or disappoint, sentiment could flip fast and send the price back toward the $0.25–$0.28 bear case zone. To confirm a bullish rebound, ADA needs to break and hold above the $0.36 level in the short term. If it does, the next clear resistance sits at $0.38, where price has already failed twice over the past week. A move down toward the $0.30 zone is still possible if this level fails to break. The RSI is around 40 and not yet oversold, which leaves room for that scenario to play out. As long as the previous low near $0.27 is not broken, the bullish setup remains possible heading into the new year. Deepseek Best Choice Could Quietly Be Maxi Doge While DeepSeek is laying out extreme bull and bear cases for XRP, Solana, and Cardano, some traders are skipping the predictions altogether and focusing on where momentum is already quietly building. That is exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a pure high-beta memecoin play for the next cycle, built for the kind of volatility DeepSeek is warning about. When majors chop and sentiment stays divided, capital often rotates into aggressive meme narratives that do not need perfect macro conditions to move. The project has already raised over $4.28M, which is a strong signal considering how cautious the market has been lately. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting at a massive 71% APY , giving early holders a real incentive to lock in and wait rather than chase short-term price swings. While AI models argue whether SOL goes to $300 or XRP drops to $1, Maxi Doge is doing what early memecoin winners usually do, building quietly, attracting committed capital, and setting the stage before the broader market wakes up. If 2026 really does turn into the high-volatility year many expect, the tokens with strong communities, simple narratives, and aggressive tokenomics tend to outperform everything else. Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one of those plays. Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The change applies to platinum contracts PT2606, PT2608, PT2610, PT2612 and palladium contracts PD2606, PD2608, PD2610, PD2612, according to the exchange. Platinum prices hit an all-time high last week at $2,377.50 before pulling back, then later traded 2.4% lower at $2,220.44. Palladium fell even harder, dropping more than 9% to $1,683.58 after touching its highest level in three years earlier in the session. Both metals remain sharply higher on the year. Platinum is up about 145%, while palladium has gained more than 85%. Chinese spot and futures markets for precious metals have also traded at persistent premiums compared with London and COMEX prices, which have held even as global prices rallied. Silver surge and fund losses are the basis of China’s current market stress The GFEX decision landed as silver trading in China turned chaotic. Shanghai silver prices hit a record $80 per ounce, pushing year-to-date gains above 150%. Traders have pointed to a shortage of physical silver inside China. Globally, spot silver hovered near $72 per ounce, extending a rally that has lifted prices more than 120% in 2025. On Wednesday, spot silver reached $72.70, putting it on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Gold has surged by 60% year-to-date . China’s only pure-play silver fund, the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF, dropped by its maximum daily limit of 10% on Thursday. The fall ended a rapid rally that had triggered repeated warnings from the fund manager. The fund had risen nearly 220% this year, far outpacing the roughly 128% gain in Shanghai silver futures. By Wednesday, the premium over the fund’s underlying silver contracts stood at nearly 62%, up from 7% at the start of the month. After three straight days of hitting its 10% daily upside limit, the firm cut Class C subscription limits to 100 yuan from 500 yuan, effective December 26.

This came as the analyst also suggested that the altcoin may be forming a bottom in preparation for the next leg to the upside. Analyst Shares Why This Chart Is Interesting For The XRP Price In an X post, Steph highlighted the 3-week XRP price chart, stating that it was “interesting” for one reason. He revealed that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 0.00 on the 3-week timeframe, which is extremely rare and has only happened once before, which was the 2022 bear market bottom. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why This Changes Everything For XRP In The Long Term Steph further explained that on such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted, which is a positive for the XRP price. The analyst added that this means that momentum to the downside has dried up, although he warned that this doesn’t mean that price must instantly reverse. Steph noted that the last time this signal appeared, the XRP price entered a long accumulation phase before the next major move higher. As such, the analyst claimed that this again suggests that the downside risk is structurally limited and that long-term holders are absorbing supply rather than distributing. He further remarked that these signals tend to mark cycle lows rather than short-term trades. The XRP ETFs also mark a positive for the XRP price as these funds maintain their inflows streak. These funds have recorded daily inflows since the Canary’s fund launched on November 13. As a result, they now boast net assets of over $1.1 billion, even as XRP continues to see significant demand from institutional investors. XRP Remains Below Key Levels In an X post, CryptoXLarge stated that on the weekly chart, the XRP price remains below the descending trendline around the 8 to 21 EMA levels. He further remarked that this week, the price is attempting to break below the key support zone around $1.95, which aligns with the Fib 0.5 level and the 89-week EMA, which is a support that has held throughout the year. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing CryptoXLarge stated that a weekly close below this level could increase the probability of a move toward the $1.60 support, which is the Fib 0.618. Meanwhile, a weekly close above $1.95 may boost buying interest, which could trigger a relief XRP price rally toward $2.30 and then $2.70. Crypto analyst Crypto King also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that a reclaim of $1.98 could eventually send the altcoin to as high as $3.66. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.87, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

56365429,648586,1766703627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56365429.jpeg,"XRP Is At Its Best Potential Recovery Level Since 2022, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-best-potential-recovery-level/,"A crypto analyst has raised concerns about XRP’s underperformance , citing the cryptocurrency’s prolonged consolidation at lower price levels and its failure to reclaim former highs. Despite these struggles, the analyst notes that the altcoin is still positioned around its best potential recovery level since 2022. He suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a price rally , potentially paving the way for a recovery to new levels. XRP Approaches Strongest Recovery Zone Since 2022 Skipper, a crypto market expert on X, has released a new XRP update outlining the cryptocurrency’s potential recovery . He stated that the token has struggled in recent weeks, remaining stuck in a prolonged slump, marked by low trading activity and minimal price movement. Despite this sluggish performance, the analyst highlighted that the altcoin is now near its best potential recovery level since 2022. Skipper explained that the most significant factor supporting this recovery potential is the decline in bubble risk . According to his chart analysis, XRP’s bubble risk is now at one of its lowest points in years, indicating that excessive speculation and risky bets have largely been removed from the market. He stated that this cleanup makes a sudden price crash far less likely and establishes a more stable foundation for a recovery. The analyst made it clear that a low bubble risk does not guarantee an immediate price rally for XRP. Instead, he explained that this low-risk environment often creates the ideal conditions for a market bottom to form. Skipper also commented on its current dynamics, highlighting that conditions currently favor buyers waiting on the sidelines, as sellers are not aggressively driving prices lower. The analyst referenced historical performance, noting that the altcoin has often delivered stronger returns following extended periods of quiet price action. Another key point highlighted by the analyst is that when fewer traders are actively committed to XRP, price action becomes more responsive to positive developments. Under such conditions, factors such as improved liquidity or heightened network usage can exert a stronger influence on XRP, increasing its potential for a recovery. The analyst further stressed that a low bubble risk should not be confused with a promise of short-term gains. He stated that a surge should not be expected tomorrow or next week. However, he highlighted that the cryptocurrency is no longer sitting in a danger zone. Analyst Sets XRP Next Upside Target At $2.58 In another XRP update, market analyst Crypto King has stated that the cryptocurrency is holding firm above a critical support area around $1.85. He emphasized that a strong bounce at this support and a reclaim of the $1.98 level would signal a momentum shift for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks above this level, Crypto King predicts its next upside target is $2.58, which aligns with the Resistance 1 level on the price chart. Should bullish momentum persist, the analyst believes this could open the door to a powerful rally toward $3.18 at Resistance 2, followed by $3.66 at Resistance 3.",XRP|Altcoin|Crypto King|ripple|Skipper|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 23:00:27

They emerge through regulation, infrastructure, and the people capable of translating law into functional markets. As the United States moves closer to defining its long-awaited digital asset framework, one personnel move is drawing growing attention for its potential to reshape how capital enters and moves through crypto—particularly XRP. That move centers on Caroline Pham. A High-Impact Transition at a Critical Moment As highlighted by X Finance Bull, Caroline Pham, former Acting Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , has joined MoonPay as Chief Legal Officer. The timing is significant. WHAT @CarolineDPham DOES NEXT COULD SHIFT $XRP AND CRYPTO FLOWS FOREVER She helped save hundreds of millions in compliance costs. Now she’s in the driver’s seat of a platform @moonpay that moves $XRP and $RLUSD Repost if you trust her move pic.twitter.com/IQcGGY8xaE — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 25, 2025 Pham spent years inside the regulatory engine , most notably leading efforts to unwind layers of duplicative and costly rules left behind by early Dodd-Frank implementation. She has publicly estimated that these reforms saved market participants hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs. Her transition from regulator to infrastructure executive places that hard-earned expertise directly inside one of crypto’s most important access points. MoonPay’s Expanding Role in XRP and Stablecoins MoonPay is not a passive player in the digital asset ecosystem. As a leading fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, it enables direct access to assets like XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , which launched in December 2024. On-ramps increasingly define market behavior, especially as institutions demand compliant, low-friction entry into digital assets. With Pham guiding legal and regulatory strategy, MoonPay is positioned to anticipate regulatory expectations rather than react to them. That matters as capital flows become more selective and compliance-driven. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Structure, Rulemaking, and the 2026 Window In a video clip shared by X Finance Bull, Pham addressed the urgency surrounding U.S. market structure legislation, noting that 2026 is a decisive period. She emphasized that while Congress passes laws, agencies ultimately shape markets through rulemaking. Drawing from her experience at the CFTC, Pham warned that poorly designed rules can take decades to correct. She also stressed the importance of technical expertise within regulatory bodies, pointing out that writing durable rules requires hands-on legal precision, not political shortcuts. Her perspective reflects why implementation—not just legislation—will determine whether crypto innovation accelerates or stalls. Why XRP Is Uniquely Positioned XRP has long been designed for regulated financial environments, prioritizing liquidity efficiency and cross-border settlement. As regulatory clarity improves and compliant access points strengthen, assets aligned with institutional workflows stand to benefit disproportionately. Pham’s role at MoonPay does not guarantee policy outcomes, but it meaningfully improves the alignment between regulation and infrastructure—precisely where XRP operates best. A Structural Shift, Not a Headline Moment This development is not about short-term speculation. It is about financial plumbing. When regulatory architects move into transaction infrastructure, capital flows adjust quietly before transforming markets at scale. If executed well, this convergence could redefine how XRP—and crypto more broadly—moves through the global financial system for years to come.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $86,960.68. This movement has caught the attention of traders and investors worldwide, prompting questions about market stability and future trends. What Caused the Bitcoin Price Decline? Several factors typically influence cryptocurrency valuations. The recent Bitcoin price drop may relate to broader market corrections, regulatory news, or shifts in investor sentiment. Market analysts often point to these common triggers when explaining sudden movements in the Bitcoin price . Understanding these factors helps investors make informed decisions. However, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and prices can change rapidly based on global economic conditions and technological developments. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, consider these approaches: Review your investment strategy – Ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance Diversify your portfolio – Don’t put all your funds into one asset Stay informed – Follow reliable market analysis and news sources Avoid panic selling – Emotional decisions often lead to losses Remember that cryptocurrency investments require careful consideration and research. The current Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder of market unpredictability. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. When the Bitcoin price declines significantly, other digital assets frequently follow similar patterns. This correlation means that Bitcoin’s performance can impact entire market sectors. However, each cryptocurrency has unique fundamentals. Some may demonstrate resilience during Bitcoin downturns, while others might experience more pronounced effects. Market participants should analyze individual projects rather than making blanket assumptions based solely on the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The recent Bitcoin price movement below $87,000 highlights several important considerations for market participants. First, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, with prices capable of significant swings in short periods. Second, having a clear investment strategy becomes crucial during periods of price uncertainty. Finally, maintaining perspective helps navigate market fluctuations. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its existence, yet it has demonstrated remarkable resilience over longer timeframes. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin fall below $87,000? Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate due to various factors including market sentiment, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and trading volume changes. The specific combination influencing this particular Bitcoin price movement requires ongoing analysis. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Price drops can present buying opportunities, but they also indicate market uncertainty. Consult with financial advisors before making significant investment decisions. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels remains challenging even for experienced analysts. Cryptocurrency markets involve substantial uncertainty, and prices can move in unexpected directions based on unfolding developments. Will other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin’s decline? Historically, many cryptocurrencies have shown correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. However, individual projects may demonstrate different patterns based on their specific developments and market positions. How long do Bitcoin price corrections typically last? Correction durations vary significantly. Some last days, while others extend for weeks or months. Market conditions, news developments, and investor sentiment all influence how long price adjustments persist. Where can I track real-time Bitcoin prices? Numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and financial data platforms provide real-time price information. Always verify you’re using reputable sources for market data and analysis.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has just dropped to a worrying score of 20, firmly placing investor sentiment in the ‘extreme fear’ territory. This critical gauge, which many traders use to gauge market psychology, suggests that pessimism is currently dominating the digital asset space. But what does this extreme reading actually mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your investments? Let’s break it down. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Compiled by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents maximum fear and panic, while 100 signals unbridled greed and euphoria. The current reading of 20 is a clear warning sign that fear is the dominant force. This index matters because extreme emotions often signal potential turning points. Historically, periods of ‘extreme fear’ have sometimes preceded market recoveries, while ‘extreme greed’ has often marked market tops. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes six key market factors to generate its daily score: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume. Declining volume can indicate apathy or fear. Social Media (15%): Scans platforms like Twitter and Reddit for sentiment. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search volume for crypto-related terms. This multi-source approach helps paint a more accurate picture than any single metric could. What Does a Score of ‘Extreme Fear’ Signal for Traders? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 is a powerful contrarian indicator. For savvy investors, extreme fear can present opportunity. When the crowd is panicking and selling, asset prices often fall below their intrinsic value. However, this does not guarantee an immediate bounce. The market can remain fearful for extended periods. Therefore, this index should not be used in isolation. It is best combined with fundamental analysis (e.g., project health, adoption rates) and technical analysis (e.g., chart patterns, support levels) to make informed decisions. The key takeaway is to avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on prevailing sentiment. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market with the Fear & Greed Index How can you use this information? First, recognize that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Here are some practical steps: Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Extreme fear periods can be good times to systematically accumulate assets at lower prices. Re-evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation still matches your personal risk appetite during volatile times. Avoid Panic Selling: Selling into extreme fear often locks in losses. Review your investment thesis instead. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Monitor the index as part of a balanced news diet, but don’t let hourly fluctuations dictate your strategy. Remember, the goal is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful—a principle famously echoed by Warren Buffett. Conclusion: Beyond the Fear and Greed Cycle The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 20 is a stark reminder of the market’s cyclical nature. While it highlights significant short-term anxiety, long-term cryptocurrency adoption continues on its own trajectory. For investors, this moment underscores the importance of discipline, research, and a strategy that can withstand emotional extremes. By understanding the sentiment behind the numbers, you can make more rational decisions regardless of whether the index screams fear or whispers greed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? You can view the live index and its historical data on the website Alternative.me. Many popular cryptocurrency news and data platforms also feature it. Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index been accurate in the past? It has been a reliable contrarian indicator at major market extremes. For example, it showed extreme greed near the all-time highs in late 2021 and extreme fear during major sell-offs like in 2018 and March 2020. However, it is not a perfect timing tool. Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? Not necessarily. Extreme fear can indicate a potential buying zone, but it is not a standalone ‘buy’ signal. Always conduct your own research on the asset’s fundamentals and the overall market structure before investing. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily. The data is compiled once per day, usually in the morning (UTC). Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While the index’s components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin (through dominance and volatility), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Can the index remain in ‘extreme fear’ for a long time? Yes. Sentiment can be stuck in fear or greed for weeks or even months, as seen in prolonged bear markets or bull runs. The index measures current sentiment, not future price direction. Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

Today marks a historic moment as a staggering $23.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire. This unprecedented volume, reported by Deribit, shatters previous records and places immense focus on potential price volatility. For every trader and investor, understanding the mechanics and implications of this event is crucial. What Does This Record-Breaking Bitcoin Options Expiry Mean? To grasp the scale, this $23.347 billion expiry dwarfs last year’s peak of $14.3 billion. Essentially, a massive number of contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price are reaching their deadline. This convergence creates a focal point for market forces, often leading to increased trading activity and price discovery around the expiry time. Concurrently, $3.7 billion in Ethereum options will also expire. However, the spotlight remains firmly on the Bitcoin options market due to its sheer size. The key metrics to watch are the put/call ratio and the max pain price, which offer clues about market sentiment and potential price pressure points. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain Let’s break down the complex jargon into simple terms. The current data reveals two critical numbers: Put/Call Ratio (0.35 for BTC): This measures the volume of put options (bets on price dropping) versus call options (bets on price rising). A ratio below 1, like 0.35, indicates far more call options exist. This suggests a bullish bias among options traders leading into this expiry. Max Pain Price ($95,000 for BTC): This is the price at which the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, causing the most financial ‘pain’ to options buyers. It often acts as a theoretical magnet for the spot price as expiry approaches. How Could This Impact the Bitcoin Price? The immediate question for every investor is: will this cause a pump or a dump? The low put/call ratio implies many traders hold calls betting on higher prices. If Bitcoin’s price is below their strike prices at expiry, those calls become worthless. This dynamic can lead to increased selling pressure from market makers who hedged their positions. However, the high max pain price of $95,000 sits significantly above current levels. This creates a complex tug-of-war. While the bullish options bias is clear, the path of least resistance for maximum financial impact on options holders might pull the price. Therefore, traders should brace for potential volatility as large positions are closed or rolled over. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating such events requires a strategy. Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on expiry data. Consider these points: Monitor Liquidity: Watch for unusual volume spikes around the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiry time on Deribit and other major exchanges. Context is Key: This Bitcoin options expiry occurs within broader market trends. Assess overall sentiment, ETF flows, and macroeconomic factors. Risk Management First: Ensure your positions are protected with stop-losses. Expiry events can amplify normal market movements. In conclusion, today’s record Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While the bullish skew in options positioning is evident, the high max pain price introduces uncertainty. The ultimate outcome will depend on the interplay between these derivatives and the underlying spot market forces. Staying informed and disciplined is your best defense against unexpected volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin options? A1: Bitcoin options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. Q2: Why is a $23.3B options expiry significant? A2: It represents the largest single expiry of Bitcoin options in history. This massive volume can influence market maker hedging activity, liquidity, and short-term price volatility as positions are settled. Q3: What is a put/call ratio of 0.35? A3: A ratio of 0.35 means there are only 35 put contracts for every 100 call contracts. This indicates a strong majority of options traders are positioned for a price increase, reflecting bullish sentiment. Q4: What happens at the ‘max pain price’? A4: The max pain price ($95,000) is where the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized. It’s a theoretical level, but price often gravitates towards it near expiry due to the hedging actions of large institutions. Q5: Should I change my investment strategy because of this? A5: Not necessarily. While it’s critical to be aware of such events, long-term investors should focus on fundamentals. Short-term traders, however, should be prepared for potential volatility and manage risk accordingly. Found this analysis of the record Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

Net outflows on Christmas Eve reached a little over $175 million. That was part of a string of weak sessions: total net outflows for the prior five trading days added close to $826 million. Since December 15, every trading day closed with net selling except December 17, which drew inflows of $457 million. Institutional Outflows Market participants pointed to routine year-end moves as a major factor. Reports have disclosed that tax-loss harvesting — where traders sell positions to realize losses for tax purposes — has been heavy this month. One trader on X, using the name Alek, said most selling is tied to tax reasons and may fade within a week. Traders also flagged a record options expiry on Friday as a force that can sap appetite for risk ahead of large settlements. Pressure In US Trading Hours Data showed downside was strongest during US trading sessions. The Coinbase Premium — a measure comparing Coinbase’s BTC/USD price to Binance’s BTC/USDT — spent much of December below zero, signaling weaker buying in the US market. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows summed up the flow pattern, saying the US had become the biggest seller while Asia played the role of the main buyer. That split can limit how high Bitcoin holds during rallies if US demand doesn’t return. Liquidity Inactive Other traders contend that negative ETF flow numbers don’t mean the cycle is over. Based on reports shared on social channels, the path back usually goes price first, flows then. Price finds a base and then flows flatten, before fresh inflows appear. In this view, current liquidity looks inactive rather than broken. That leaves room for a bounce once seasonal selling subsides. Since early November, the 30-day moving average of US spot ETF net flows has stayed negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means that, on average, more capital has been leaving these ETFs than entering them for several weeks in a row. This is important because ETFs are… pic.twitter.com/qR1bMQNqxe — BitBull (@AkaBull_) December 24, 2025 On-Chain Signals On-chain metrics offer some comfort. Long-term holders are not rushing to sell at once. Realized gains show some profit-taking, but not the kind of extreme that marks a terminal peak. That pattern fits the idea that selling is being absorbed by other hands. If selling is near exhaustion, larger buyers could step in when ETFs turn neutral or positive. Outlook For The Coming Months Investors will watch ETF flows closely after the holidays. If flows move toward neutral, price could stabilize and then climb without needing huge new demand. The mix of tax selling and options-related positioning suggests some of the current weakness may be temporary. Still, traders should expect choppy moves while US buyers remain sidelined.

This collaboration aims to provide sophisticated asset management services, merging traditional financial expertise with digital asset innovation. For investors watching the crypto space, this partnership is a clear indicator of the maturing landscape in South Korea and beyond. What Does the Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU Mean? The core of this agreement is a strategic alliance. Korea Investment & Securities, a major traditional financial player, will join forces with Bithumb, a powerhouse in the Korean crypto market. Their goal is to develop and offer customized asset management solutions. This means clients could soon access hybrid portfolios that seamlessly blend conventional stocks and bonds with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This partnership is significant because it directly addresses a key demand: professional management of crypto assets. Many investors are interested in digital currencies but lack the time or expertise to manage them actively. Through this MOU, the two firms plan to create structured products and advisory services that bridge this gap. Why Is This Collaboration a Game-Changer? This partnership is more than just a business deal; it’s a validation of the crypto asset class. When a established securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities enters the arena, it brings legitimacy, rigorous risk management frameworks, and a vast client network. For Bithumb, it provides deeper access to traditional investors who have been cautious about entering the crypto market directly. The benefits for potential clients are substantial: Professional Guidance: Access to managed portfolios that combine traditional and digital assets. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the compliance and custodial expertise of a major securities firm. Simplified Access: A one-stop-shop for diversified investment strategies. Regulatory Confidence: Collaboration may help navigate the evolving regulatory environment more effectively. What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? Despite the exciting potential, the road ahead isn’t without hurdles. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea remains complex and is subject to change. Integrating the fast-paced, innovative world of crypto with the slower, highly regulated processes of traditional finance will require careful navigation. Furthermore, they must build products that truly meet client needs. This involves educating a traditionally conservative investor base about the risks and opportunities of crypto assets. Success will depend on their ability to create transparent, trustworthy, and high-performing solutions that stand out in a competitive market. What’s the Future of Such Institutional Partnerships? The Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU is likely a precursor to more collaborations. As cryptocurrency becomes an unavoidable part of the global financial system, traditional institutions are seeking safe and compliant entry points. We can expect to see more securities firms, banks, and asset managers forming similar alliances with regulated crypto exchanges. This trend points toward a future where digital assets are fully integrated into mainstream finance. For the everyday investor, it means more options, better protection, and professional management for their crypto holdings. It’s a crucial step in moving the market from speculative trading to long-term, strategic asset allocation. Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward The partnership between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb is a powerful signal of institutional adoption. It demonstrates a clear shift from viewing cryptocurrencies as a niche novelty to recognizing them as a legitimate component of a modern investment portfolio. This MOU has the potential to unlock new capital, improve market stability, and offer investors a safer, more guided path into the digital asset ecosystem. The collaboration’s success will be closely watched as a blueprint for future integration between traditional and decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the MOU between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb? A1: The primary goal is to collaborate on developing and providing customized asset management services that include both traditional financial products and cryptocurrencies. Q2: How will this partnership benefit average investors? A2: Investors may gain access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios that include crypto assets, along with the security and expertise of a major traditional securities firm. Q3: Does this mean Korea Investment & Securities is launching a crypto exchange? A3: No. The firm is partnering with the existing exchange, Bithumb, to create asset management products and services, not to operate its own trading platform. Q4: Is my money safer if I invest through this new service? A4: While any investment carries risk, the involvement of a regulated securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities suggests a strong focus on compliance, custody, and risk management frameworks that may enhance security compared to using an exchange alone. Q5: When will these new asset management services be available? A5: The announcement is for an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), which is an agreement to collaborate. Specific products and their launch dates have not yet been disclosed and will likely follow further development and regulatory review. Q6: Could this partnership influence crypto regulations in South Korea? A6: Potentially, yes. High-profile collaborations between traditional finance and crypto entities can encourage clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks by demonstrating serious, compliant business models.

The Altcoin Season Index has dipped to a mere 16, down from 17 just yesterday. This crucial metric suggests we are firmly in the grip of a Bitcoin-dominated market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Understanding this index is vital for navigating the volatile crypto seas. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? Simply put, the Altcoin Season Index is a thermometer for the crypto market’s risk appetite. Created by CoinMarketCap, it measures whether conditions favor altcoins or Bitcoin. The index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin’s performance. A score closer to 100 signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where most altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Conversely, a low score like 16 indicates a strong ‘Bitcoin season.’ Why Has the Altcoin Season Index Crashed to 16? The current low reading of the Altcoin Season Index is a clear symptom of broader market dynamics. Typically, when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising, and macroeconomic uncertainty is high, capital flows into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. This often comes at the expense of smaller altcoins. Several factors contribute to this trend: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors are prioritizing assets seen as less risky. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market share often increases during cautious periods. Liquidity Preference: Traders exit smaller altcoins for the easier entry and exit of Bitcoin. Therefore, the index acts as a confirmation tool, showing that the current environment is challenging for altcoin growth relative to the market leader. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? This isn’t just a number to glance at; it’s a strategic tool. A low Altcoin Season Index score suggests a specific market phase. Here’s how savvy investors might interpret it: For Accumulation: A low index can signal a potential buying opportunity for strong altcoin projects at discounted prices, though timing is crucial. For Portfolio Balance: It may be a reminder to ensure your portfolio isn’t overexposed to high-risk altcoins during a Bitcoin season. For Patience: It sets realistic expectations, indicating that broad altcoin rallies may not be imminent until the index trends upward. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator based on 90-day performance. It confirms a trend; it doesn’t predict an immediate reversal. When Will the Next Altcoin Season Begin? The million-dollar question. Historically, an altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, pushing the Altcoin Season Index above 75. For a sustained shift, we often need: A period of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Positive developments in blockchain technology and adoption. Improved overall investor sentiment and risk appetite. Watching for a consistent rise in the Altcoin Season Index from these lows can be one of the first signs that capital is rotating back into altcoins. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Tide The Altcoin Season Index at 16 delivers a clear, data-driven message: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For investors, this isn’t necessarily a time for panic but for perspective and preparation. By understanding what this metric reveals about market structure and sentiment, you can make more informed decisions—whether that means fortifying your core holdings or strategically planning your next altcoin entry. Keep a close watch on this index; its climb back up will be the early whisper of the next altcoin awakening. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that scores from 1 to 100. It measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score above 75 suggests an ‘altcoin season.’ Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to review your portfolio’s risk, consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects, and ensure you have a balanced strategy. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q4: Can the index predict the exact start of an altcoin season? A4: No, it is a lagging indicator. It confirms a trend that is already in place. A sustained move above 75 confirms an altcoin season has been occurring, but it doesn’t forecast the exact day it will begin. Q5: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A5: You can find the Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website, usually within their market research or data tools sections. Q6: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A6: It uses the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization but excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to focus on volatile, independent assets.

This New Altcoin Has Already Surged 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cheap-crypto-for-q1-2025-this-new-altcoin-has-already-surged-250/,"Each market cycle has an element of tokens that move very silently and most people are not aware of this until they realize. Price action can be first triggered many years before the general market takes action. Whenever a trend gains visibility, a considerable portion of the initial growth is lost. That is why most investors, who follow the news in the crypto-market and ask themselves, what crypto to buy now, have to be more concerned with the assets that are new. A good example of a new crypto that is following this trend is making recent headlines following a powerful move that took place in the absence of significant hype. Whether this stage is too early is the question many are asking; it is not why it moved. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is being built Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto that is being developed based on lending and borrowing. The protocol has two fundamental market structures that can cater to various user requirements. In the P2C market, assets are provided by the users into distribution pools. They, in their turn, are rewarded with mtTokens. These mtTokens increase due to repayment of interest by borrowers. As an illustration, a user providing stable assets has the opportunity to hold mtTokens and observe their increase in value with time. The model promotes long term possession or utilization rather than rapid trading. The P2P market involves borrowing that is made directly between users. Borrowers are able to select between fixed and variable rates, according to the situation in the market. There are strict LTV regulations on collateral. In case of collateral value that becomes lower than the requirement, liquidations become automatic. This puts the system on board and minimizes risk on the spur of the moment. Over $19M are already collected and the number of the holders has increased to over 18,500. These figures are important since its growth has been consistent. This is a good indication that there is aggregation as opposed to short term speculation. The next important step is V1, when the protocol can pass to live usage. Phase Progression and MUTM Price The price of MUTM at present is $0.035 and this is in presale Phase 6. The maximum supply is 4B tokens. Out of this value, it was assigned to early distribution and this corresponds to 45.5% and accounts to approximately 1.82B tokens. A great portion of these tokens already has been sold. The token has risen by up to 250% of the initial phase because of demand. It was not a single move toward this increase. It was gradual in phase by phase development. Phase 1 participants early on would yield a growth of about 500% the amount they entered at the official launch price of $0.06. The price of each token will go up, and the succeeding phase will see MUTM go up by almost 20%. This is why timing matters. Phases become more costly to access as their level increases, and the supply narrows. This is a structure of interest to people who seek the most advantageous cheap crypto to purchase. There are price steps built in the system rather than being arbitrary. Reviews and Risk Controls Any DeFi crypto and, in particular, lending protocols require security. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit which assists in verifying the token structure and contract logic. Moreover, Halborn Security has conducted the protocol design and risk structure. There is also a bug bounty program of $50K. This will open up the system to external researchers to test and report as pre preliminary adoption. Such layers diminish doubt and will contribute to the creation of trust in the participants having a long period of involvement. Definite collateral requirements, liquidations, and security review of third parties and so on will provide a more solid base. The Reason Why Investor Urgency is on The Increase There is heightened activity among the investors because of tightening of the allocation. The 24 hour leaderboard follows regular engagement as opposed to a single time purchase. This is usually an indication of increased user interest which intends to remain active. Being an Ethereum based protocol, Mutuum Finance is setting itself ahead of Q1 2026 with infrastructure, security, and usage skewed. To most observers of leading cryptocurrencies and those engaged in a question of which crypto one should invest in, this stage defines more of positioning and less speculation. It is this increasing price supply ratio and an imminent V1 launch that makes MUTM more and more popular as a next-big cryptocurrency that should be looked at.

56369809,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254317,1766711411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Correction: Why This Temporary Dip Signals a Powerful Buying Opportunity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-correction-temporary-dip-opportunity/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Correction: Why This Temporary Dip Signals a Powerful Buying Opportunity Is the recent Bitcoin price drop a cause for panic or a strategic opportunity? While headlines scream about market corrections, seasoned analysts point to underlying metrics that tell a different, more reassuring story. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be a temporary adjustment rather than the start of a major downturn, according to key on-chain data. Let’s explore why long-term investor behavior suggests strength, not weakness, in the market’s foundation. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About This Bitcoin Correction? Crypto analyst Arab Chain, in a recent CryptoQuant contribution, provides crucial insight. The analyst highlights that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—which tracks the movement of older, long-held coins—remains at moderate levels. This is a vital signal. Why? Because during genuine market tops, we typically see this metric spike as veteran investors cash out en masse. The current data shows no such aggressive selling from long-term holders. Furthermore, the Supply-Adjusted CDD is stable and far from the extreme levels witnessed at past bull market peaks. This combination strongly indicates that the recent Bitcoin correction was not triggered by a mass exodus of the most committed investors. Their coins are staying put, reflecting enduring confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. If Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling, What’s Causing the Dip? So, what’s behind the price pullback if the foundational holders are steadfast? The analysis points to two primary, short-term factors: Slowing Momentum: After a strong rally, markets often need to consolidate. This breather allows overheated conditions to cool and builds a healthier base for the next move. Weakening Liquidity: Shifts in macro liquidity or temporary outflows from short-term speculative traders can create downward pressure without altering the core bullish thesis. In essence, this looks like a routine market cleanse. It shakes out weak hands and resets leverage, all while the most significant cohort—the long-term believers—holds firm. This creates a potentially powerful setup for patient investors. Why Should You See This Bitcoin Correction as an Opportunity? History shows that periods of stability among long-term holders during price dips have often preceded strong rebounds. Their inactivity is a vote of confidence. When the ‘smart money’ isn’t fleeing, it suggests the asset’s fundamental story remains intact. For investors, this environment offers distinct advantages: Reduced Emotional Noise: Understanding the metric-driven reality helps avoid panic-driven decisions. Strategic Entry Points: Temporary corrections can provide better valuation opportunities compared to buying at peak FOMO. Market Health Check: Stable holder metrics act as a diagnostic tool, separating healthy pullbacks from unhealthy breakdowns. Therefore, viewing this phase through the lens of holder behavior transforms it from a threat into a potential strategic window. The current Bitcoin correction is more about market mechanics than a loss of faith. What’s the Bottom Line for Investors? The compelling takeaway is that on-chain data provides a deeper narrative than price charts alone. While volatility is inherent to crypto, the behavior of long-term holders serves as a critical anchor. Their current stability suggests this Bitcoin correction is a temporary phenomenon within a larger, ongoing cycle. For those with a long-term perspective, these moments test conviction but also reward it. In conclusion, the market’s foundation appears solid despite the surface-level turbulence. The dip, driven by momentum and liquidity shifts rather than core investor capitulation, may represent a moment of clarity. By focusing on holder metrics over headlines, investors can navigate volatility with greater confidence and purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) and why is it important? A: Coin Days Destroyed measures the movement of coins that have been held for a long time. A high CDD suggests long-term holders are selling, which can signal a market top. A moderate CDD, like now, suggests they are holding, indicating underlying strength. Q: How long might this Bitcoin correction last? A> Corrections are difficult to time precisely. However, if the cause is short-term liquidity and momentum issues—as the data suggests—it could be resolved relatively quickly compared to corrections driven by fundamental breakdowns. Q: Should I buy Bitcoin during a correction? A> This is a personal investment decision. The data suggests the sell-off is not driven by long-term holders, which is a positive sign. However, always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: What other metrics should I watch besides CDD? A> Key metrics include Exchange Net Flow (to see if coins are moving to sell), Miner Reserves, and the MVRV Ratio. Together, they provide a fuller picture of market sentiment and potential pressure points. Q: Could this analysis be wrong and the correction deepen? A> All market analysis involves probability, not certainty. While on-chain data is a powerful tool, external macro shocks or unforeseen events can always impact prices. The data suggests a temporary dip is more likely, but risk always exists. Found this analysis helpful in cutting through the market noise?
