Is Loopring a good investment Loopring (LRC) could be a promising investment for those interested in Layer 2 scaling solutions on Ethereum, particularly due to its focus on zk-Rollups for fast and low-cost transactions. Its decentralized exchange (DEX) technology and commitment to security and efficiency make it a strong contender in the DeFi space. However, its success depends on broader Ethereum adoption, competition from other Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, and overall market trends. While Loopring has potential, investors should consider its volatility, ecosystem development, and market conditions before investing. Always conduct thorough research and risk assessment before making any investment decisions. Why is LRC up? The LRC/USD crypto pair price has spiked today as the buying influx has abruptly taken over the market, surging the price to $0.0570. The bulls are targeting the resistance of $0.0587 next, as overall, the coin’s value has increased significantly over the past week. Will LRC reach $0.5? According to the long-term predictions, LRC is projected to reach up to $0.44 by 2031. Will LRC reach $1? No, LRC may not reach $1 in the near future. By the year 2030, the highest price prediction is $0.44255, suggesting that LRC lacks the potential to achieve this milestone at the moment. Does LRC have a good long-term future? Loopring (LRC) has long-term potential as a Layer 2 solution using zk-Rollups for fast, low-cost Ethereum transactions. Its DEX technology supports the shift toward decentralized trading. However, strong competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet poses challenges. Success depends on adoption, partnerships, and innovation. While promising, risks like market volatility and regulatory changes should be considered before investing.

Loopring Price History Loopring price history Based on historical data, the Loopring token LRC suffered a significant knock in 2018. Prices fell in April after reaching a high of $1.4522 in January 2018, falling to an all-time low of $0.01986 in December 2019. By early 2020, the coin price had corrected to $0.0225. However, following the DEX’s beta debut, values started to rise significantly, and the LRC coin traded for $0.087895 at the start of June 2020, up almost 300 percent during the first half of 2020. LRC skyrocketed, breaking above $3 in December 2021, as the Crypto market capitalization increased. Loopring caught investors’ attention when it broke above $1 in October 2021. It continued to register its all-time high at $3.83 in November 2021. The reversal was swift in 2022, losing over 90% of its value. In 2023, it faced stiff resistance at the $0.25 mark. LRC continued its downward trend, staying within the $0.10-$0.50 range in the year 2023. LRC settled around $0.11-$0.12, maintaining a stable but low in December 2024 In January 2025, LRC traded around $0.11, showing little change from the previous months. As of early March 2025, LRC continues to trade around $0.11, showing a stable but weak trend. The altcoin showed high volatility in April and May, touching a bottom price of $0.0759 and a high of $0.1282. In June 2025, LRC observed a further low of $0.659, followed by a period of recovery, when the altcoin recovered back to $0.1030 in July and $0.1076 in September. LRC remained in decline till the start of December, observing the year’s lowest price of $0.0482, and has since slightly recovered to $0.0571 by the end of the year.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|LRC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:00:00

The so called “coin of the cycle” is stuck in a boring range, and sentiment around it is at some of the lowest levels we have seen in a while. SOL ETFs still recorded about $1.4M in inflows on December 24, which is one of the few positive signs right now, but it has not been enough to change the bigger picture. Solana (SOL) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Looking ahead to 2026, analysts like Umair Crypto point out that the core problem is still on the chart. Price has failed to flip the $127 level into support. Every attempt to break and hold above that area has been cleanly rejected, forcing SOL to roll over and search for lower support. At the time of writing, Solana is holding around $123, which is now the key level bulls need to defend. Solana Price Prediction: What Is The Next Move For SOL Price? Source: JamesEaston There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI , which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. One big thing that is missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is still pretty weak, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully committing to this move yet. Without a clear spike in volume, any push above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What really changes the picture is a clean break above the $144 level with strong volume coming in. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Bitcoin Hyper Is Quietly Building While Solana Stalls While Solana chops sideways and sentiment keeps sinking, Bitcoin Hyper is moving in the opposite direction, quietly stacking momentum while most traders are distracted. This is usually how early cycle winners start, low noise, steady inflows, and no need for hype candles yet. Bitcoin Hyper is designed to capitalize on exactly this kind of market environment. When majors stall and confidence drops, capital slowly rotates into projects with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost always happens before the charts make it obvious. The project has already raised over $29.8M, showing serious conviction from early backers even while the broader market hesitates. On top of that, the 39% APY staking rewards incentivize holders to stay put rather than flip for short term moves, which helps build real supply pressure over time. While traders wait for Solana to finally flip resistance, Bitcoin Hyper is building its base. And when momentum returns to the market, the projects that were accumulated quietly during boredom phases are usually the ones that move first and hardest.

The pullback comes even as on-chain metrics point to easing sell pressure and a record build-up of stablecoin capital, leaving traders split between caution and the risk of sudden price swings. ETF Outflows and Holiday Liquidity Weigh on Prices XWIN Finance’s Trend Index, published on December 25, placed the market firmly in a “mild downtrend” with a score of 34 out of 100, citing persistent ETF withdrawals and U.S.-session selling as the main drags. It saw Bitcoin briefly dipping below $87,000 before bouncing, though repeated attempts to reclaim the $88,000 to $89,000 area have stalled, a zone XWIN described as heavy resistance shaped by options positioning. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see net withdrawals, with roughly 2,900 BTC, worth some $251 million, leaving funds in the latest session. That weakness lines up with figures reported by CryptoPotato on December 24, which showed cumulative BTC ETF inflows shrinking by nearly $6 billion since their October peak. Ethereum funds followed a similar pattern, remaining net negative on a weekly basis despite a small daily bounce. By contrast, diversification flows are visible elsewhere. For example, Solana products posted steady inflows, while XRP-related ETFs added about $8 million in the most recent session, extending a streak that has made XRP funds an outlier among crypto ETFs. Bitcoin’s price action reflects this uneasy balance, with the asset trading just under $88,000 at the time of writing, up about 1% on the day and week, but still nearly 20% lower over three months. Volatility has stayed compressed, with a 24-hour range between $87,000 and $88,000, while the past week saw swings between $85,000 and just over $90,000. Relative to the broader market, Bitcoin’s moves have been muted, with liquidity-driven wicks outweighing trend-following flows. On-Chain Signals Hint at Exhaustion, Not Panic Beneath the weak sentiment, on-chain data paints a more nuanced picture. XWIN noted that whale exchange inflows over the past 30 days sit near cycle lows, while Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is still falling, a sign that long-term holders are slowing their selling. At the same time, there appears to be a fair amount of caution, with spending from very old Bitcoin cohorts ticking higher, a pattern sometimes seen near major turning points. Network activity also remains soft, suggesting demand has not yet returned in force. According to the XWIN assessment, the current market tension is being reflected in sentiment gauges, particularly the Fear and Greed Index, which is in “Extreme Fear” at 24, while DeFi borrowing has dropped sharply since August, pointing to reduced leverage. Nonetheless, stablecoin supply has climbed to a record near $310 billion, signaling large pools of sidelined capital. With equities and gold both at record highs and January rate expectations tilted toward a pause, macro conditions are not overtly hostile. For crypto, however, XWIN suggested that the next move still hinges on ETF flows and post-expiry options dynamics. Until those shifts, the market may stay fragile, even as signs of seller fatigue quietly build beneath the surface.

Why Price Could Crash To $80,000",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-christmas-rally-80000/,"It’s the holiday season, and Bitcoin (BTC) is trading downwards after plunging toward the $87,000 region. Although the cryptocurrency has struggled for months, failing to reclaim key resistance levels, a crypto analyst believes Bitcoin could still stage a major Christmas rally . As the analyst outlines a potential roadmap for this projected upswing, he cautions that a further price crash to $80,000, or even lower, remains a strong possibility. Bitcoin Risks Crash To $80,000 Crypto analyst RBswingtrader shared a Bitcoin market outlook on X the day before Christmas, outlining multiple scenarios that could determine whether the cryptocurrency resumes an upward trend or faces further downside . The analyst noted that smart money is currently buying Bitcoin in a new zone and also cautioned that a final price crash, potentially driven by market manipulation , could occur before a trend reversal. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could still decline to a fresh local low around $80,000 before strong buyers enter the market. The analyst stressed the importance of patience, viewing this potential dip as part of a broader accumulation strategy. He shared a chart highlighting BTC trading under a declining orange Moving Average (MA) after a sharp selloff from the $108,519 resistance zone. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency’s price had previously failed at the upper range and rolled over into a strong downtrend that has persisted for weeks . RBswingtrader further pinpointed a clear Elliott Wave structure on the BTC chart, with waves labeled from one through five, followed by an ABC corrective pattern . Wave 3 accelerated Bitcoin’s selloff, while Wave 5 appears to be developing, with downside targets still open. Multiple key support levels were also highlighted, including $87,106, $86,169, and $83,986. The analyst warned that a deeper breakdown from these support levels could open the door to a potential crash toward $80,427, with an extended lower target near $74,185 if Bitcoin’s selling pressure intensifies. He also plotted multiple Fibonacci retracement levels that align with the lower support zones for the BTC price. Notably, the volume data at the bottom of the chart indicates a large accumulation trend through December. Increased trading activity supports the view that large players are taking advantage of dips and building positions despite Bitcoin’s weak price action. Is A Christmas Rally Still Possible For BTC? In RBswingtrader’s chart, a potential Christmas rally for Bitcoin was illustrated with an upward projection targeting the $108,519 region if the price recovers from its current lows. The chart indicated that growing accumulation volume this December and the Bullish Divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) could support upward momentum. RBswingtrader also noted that reclaiming key technical levels, including the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement near $96,690-$96,836, could support Bitcoin’s potential upward move.

As we go into the year, new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): Could Be Looking At Very Positive Year XRP ETFs have seen impressive inflows despite the “dead” price action in the market. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs recorded $1.13B in net inflows, with steady demand over the past 33 days. These funds have outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, holding positive momentum even while broader market conditions remain volatile. Add in the constant ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically strong chart, and 2026 could be shaping up to be a very interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Dogecoin And Shiba Inu: Memecoins Potential Revival? I know memecoins look mostly dead right now and hope feels pretty thin across the board. But for Shiba specifically, there is something big on the horizon. The team is planning a major network upgrade that would add privacy to the chain. That is a big deal, especially with privacy becoming one of the hottest topics in crypto right now. Source: SHIBUSD / TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been struggling to build momentum as Christmas approaches, with market sentiment looking increasingly indecisive. The memecoin is down about 1.7% over the last 24 hours, trading in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of price action points to a dull, low-energy market, with SHIB currently sitting near the lower end of that range. For this bounce to mean anything, price needs to break above $0.00000800 and hold it to confirm a bullish shift. If it fails to do so, SHIB could slide back toward a new low, marked by the red projection, which is the same area where buyers stepped in last time. Dogecoin is in a similar spot, and there still looks like there is room for more downside before the next real move higher kicks in. Price just lost the $0.13 support, and that opens the door for a drop toward the $0.09 area. That would mean roughly a 31% downside move from here in the short term. The RSI is not helping the bull case either. It has been stuck below the 14-day moving average and the midline for weeks now, which is a clear sign that bearish momentum is still in control and sellers are dictating the price action. Bitcoin Hyper Is Building While Alts Chop Sideways While most altcoins are stuck grinding lower and sentiment feels drained, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite. This is usually how early cycle winners start forming, not during euphoric rallies, but during boredom, doubt, and sideways markets. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself for the next phase of the market, where capital rotates out of lagging majors and into projects with clear narratives and asymmetric upside. That rotation almost never waits for perfect charts, it happens while most traders are still distracted by short term weakness in names like XRP, DOGE, and SHIB. The project has already raised more than $29M, showing strong conviction from early participants even while the broader market struggles to find direction. On top of that, staking rewards hovering around 39% APY give holders a reason to sit tight and accumulate rather than chase quick flips. Historically, the biggest breakouts come from projects that were built quietly during consolidation phases like this. While the crowd waits for confirmation candles on altcoins, Bitcoin Hyper is laying its foundation. If 2026 really does shape up to be a bullish year, the projects accumulated during this low-interest phase are often the ones that move first and hardest.

Tech companies say these tools could transform how games get made. Leading research teams at Google DeepMind and a billion-dollar startup called World Labs, started by AI researcher Fei-Fei Li, are developing what they call “world models.” These are AI systems that can understand and recreate physical spaces, and experts think they’ll shake up the gaming business. Shlomi Fruchter helps lead DeepMind’s Genie 3 project , which builds these world models. He said game-making is going through major changes. “Creating software and games in particular is changing a lot, and I expect it to change, maybe entirely, over the next few years,” Fruchter explained to the Financial Times. He thinks the technology will help people who make games work faster and better, opening up new possibilities that don’t exist right now. But he doesn’t expect it to completely take over current methods. Other AI companies like Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia are testing these world models for robots and self-driving cars. However, the gaming world offers quicker opportunities for profit. Research firm Newzoo expects the gaming sector to bring in close to $190 billion this year. AI is already changing how studios work Game makers already use AI tools to design backgrounds and create characters. Back in May, Epic Games and Disney added an AI-powered Darth Vader to the game Fortnite. They built this Star Wars character using technology from Google and ElevenLabs, making him an interactive character that players could engage with. Alexander Vaschenko runs Game Gears studio, where AI has sped up work on titles like Aliens vs Zombies: Invasion by four times. “Based on my professional experience, I firmly believe that both the video game and film industries will soon be unable to function without AI,” Vaschenko said. AI firms believe newer, stronger world models will push more game companies to adopt this technology. These models can build 3D interactive spaces just from written descriptions. World Labs released a model called Marble last month. Another company, Runway, which partners with game studios, put out its first world model in December. Li said this technology will affect major game engines like Unity and Epic’s Unreal. “This is all up for disruption,” she stated, adding that simulation gaming engines need upgrades. Looking ahead, AI experts say regular players will be able to design their own game worlds. Developers won’t need pricey software or special training to make content. Eric Xing, who leads the Mohamed bin Zayed University for Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi, explained the impact. “Now a gamer in front of this world model can put themselves into a virtual world,” Xing said. “That makes the game industry very different from today, because producing a personalised game is now a straightforward process.” Workers raise concerns about job security Not everyone sees this as progress. Critics worry AI will cost jobs for developers and artists, and flood games with cheap, low-quality content that people call “slop.” Six video game worker unions across Europe spoke out against AI use in their field this month. They said companies are forcing these tools on workers even though they make working conditions worse. Those who support AI use say it could lower costs, boost creativity, and prevent worker exhaustion. This matters in an industry where top games, called triple-A titles, can take multiple years and more than $1 billion to finish. Alexandre Moufarek at DeepMind used to work as an associate producer at French game company Ubisoft. He hopes world models will give developers room to “find the fun” and “try new ideas and take risks again.” “Often, that’s the time that’s missing at the end of the production. Christmas is coming, and you need to release the game, and you just don’t have time to polish the things that you wanted [or] debug things correctly,” Moufarek said. “The more we put those models in the hands of creatives, I’m sure we are going to discover new ways of working that we haven’t even anticipated yet.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|DeepMind,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-25 21:35:00

A Critical 1% Allocation Threshold Is Near for This $0.035 Altcoin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-for-q1-2026-a-critical-1-allocation-threshold-is-near-for-this-0-035-altcoin/,"In any market cycle there comes that short time, when positioning is more important than headlines. News Breaks do not necessarily cause price movements. They tend to shift once expectations change silently as a result of tightening of supply. This is normally when long term narratives emerge, long before the broader interest comes. Currently, numerous traders looking in crypto news and wondering what crypto to purchase are keeping an eye on one particular DeFi crypto. This is not due to hype but structural threshold is actually being met. After this has been closed, the set up changes. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto bank that is involved in lending and borrowing. In its simplest form, the protocol will enable users to deposit assets and get yield, and borrowers receive liquidity through collateral locking. This results in a usage cycle which can be multiplied with the increase in demand. As an illustration, a user is able to input stable assets in the protocol and receive mtTokens in their turn. These mtTokens are the position provided and the growth of value as the interests of the borrowers are earned. In this design, rather than using short term trading, the longer holding is used as a reward of actual activity. Borrowing side In the borrowing side, the user is able to get access to liquidity by pledging their assets based on specified rules. The interest rates and collateral requirements are designed in such a way that there is lesser uncertainty. It is this kind of system that renders the lending protocols relevant in the long run. The next V1 launch is an important event. V1 is where development is changed to live use. This is the point of transition between preparation and execution of the protocol, according to the official updates. Investor Base and Funding Growth The participation has increased and it is one of the most evident messages in the enquiry of Mutuum Finance. It has already raised more than $19.4M and has more than 18,500 holders in its portfolio. The fact that these figures came into being did not occur instantly. The steady growth has not been abrupt. This tends to single out accumulation and not speculation in the short term. Several of them have remained during various stages and this implies that they have faith in the roadmap and do not change direction. The token was initiated at a very low level on initial stages and is currently priced at $0.035. This is about an increment of 250% of the initial price. This increase did not happen in a single instance. It was preceded by a demand and diminishing supply. Supply and Distribution Signals and Access Signals The maximum supply of MUTM is 4B of tokens. 1.82B tokens or 45.5% of total MUTM supply is distributed through the presale phases. Quite a considerable part of such tokens has already been sold, and what remains is very scarce indeed. Behavior usually shifts when, at this point, there is tightening of supply. Customers will make decisions at a quicker pace and price increments will increase. This is the reason why the current stage is under strict monitoring. There is the 24 hour leaderboard that is an additional revelation. It also follows regular attendance rather than sporadic attendance. This is mostly indicative of persistent interest and not single purchases. Demand is increased with support of card payment as well. The more accessible it is, the more participation tends to occur, particularly among the users coming in and not via one of the traditional crypto channels. Security Reviews Any DeFi crypto will be primarily concerned with security. Mutuum Finance has already passed a CertiK scan with a score of 90/100. This is a critical background check that most investors, when dealing with a new cryptocurrency, would want to check. Besides CertiK, the protocol was being reviewed by Halborn Security . There is an active program of a $50K bug bounty program which allows outsourcing and testing to be done and issues found before full scale use. In addition to security, the roadmap contains intentions of a protocol supported stablecoin. Non-specialized assets will be able to add to the daily use and will decrease volatility in lending systems. Integrations with oracle are also scheduled and it helps in ensuring that collateral and interest are calculated accurately. These aspects are not short term characteristics. They provide long term supporting infrastructure layers. The reason Why Phase 6 Is Generating Urgency Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. This implies that only a very low percentage will be left at the prevailing price. Recent action Boasts of a $100k whale allocation that is frequent when institutional players can expect a transitional spot. Once a phase is closed, prices tend to come up. That is why the existing threshold is important. It is the last window before the circumstances transform. This step can be the determining element to individuals seeking the potential best crypto to purchase today. When the access is over, the market situation becomes not one of access, but scarcity. By Q1 2026, Mutuum Finance is going towards a stage where supply is constrained, infrastructure is prepared and usage is near. Such a combination is what is making it gain momentum as the best crypto to watch in the next cycle.

This is a big moment for our team and the WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started,” the company wrote. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., created USD1 earlier this year after Trump took back the White House, saying simply that “this one is for the retail users.” USD1 market cap has surpassed $3B. This is a big moment for our team and WLFI community. But milestones aren’t the goal — building the future of financial rails is. And we are just getting started. 🦅☝️📈 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) December 25, 2025 The so-called stable token first broke past the $1 billion mark in April, less than a month after it went live. From the beginning, the project called itself a tool for real-time crypto payments, pushing to build strong relationships with retail users and major U.S. exchanges. WLFI partnered with Coinbase and FalconX, setting up distribution channels to get USD1 into more wallets. It’s also trying to take over Solana’s stablecoin turf by teaming up with meme coin project Bonk and Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium. WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said , “This is just the beginning, we are building the future of finance driven by real world adoption of USD1.” Binance connects USD1 to its trading ecosystem The sudden jump in value followed Binance introducing a Booster Program tied to USD1. Users who hold the stablecoin on the exchange now get up to 20% APR through flexible earn products. Binance also confirmed it would swap all collateral backing its Binance-peg BUSD (B-Token) into USD1, at a 1:1 rate. This move embeds USD1 deeper into the exchange’s collateral system, effectively replacing BUSD in some areas. That’s not all. The stablecoin is also tied to bigger financial deals. Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based MGX used USD1 to complete a $2 billion investment in Binance. This payment came just before President Trump granted a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, who co-founded Binance. At the time, the Wall Street Journal reported speculation that CZ may have used his influence to boost WLFI ahead of the pardon. Binance U.S. denied any coordination and claimed its listings of WLFI and USD1 were just “purely business decisions.” Despite that, Trump’s involvement and the WLFI-Binance link drew fire from Democrats. Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed to this connection while fighting against the GENIUS Act, which was later passed into law. Bitcoin flash crash reveals issues with USD1 trading pair Meanwhile, earlier this morning, the BTC/USD1 trading pair on Binance experienced a flash crash, briefly dragging Bitcoin down to $24,000 for a few seconds. The price then bounced above $87,000 before stabilizing, according to data gotten from the world’s largest exchange. Other pairs like BTC/USDT weren’t affected, but the incident exposed how fragile newer trading pairs can be when liquidity dries up. The crash came from a microstructure failure. There weren’t enough buy or sell orders near the current market price. On thin pairs, one aggressive order or a missing bid can wipe through the order book and cause a sharp drop. Once new bids enter or the order clears, the price jumps back up. Binance confirmed it was limited to the BTC/USD1 spot pair only. This kind of thing happens when a trading pair lacks depth. A shallow book means even one big trade can move prices way off course, even if just for a moment. USD1 may be scaling fast, but its liquidity structure still has holes that need to be watched.

56363569,https://cryptonews.com/?p=467844,1766700201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56363569.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana, Cardano by the End of 2026",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-cardano-by-the-end-of-2026/,"Chinese AI model DeepSeek, often called a serious rival to ChatGPT, just dropped a fresh set of price predictions for XRP, Cardano, and Solana as 2025 heads into its final week. According to the model, all three coins are entering a high-volatility window, with the potential for sharp moves in either direction before the year wraps up. The outlook is based on a mix of macro conditions, fundamentals, and technical signals. Below is a breakdown of DeepSeek AI two possible scenarios, showing both the bullish and bearish price paths it sees for each asset through the end of December. Ripple (XRP): DeepSeek AI Predicts A Run Toward $6 Going Into The New Year DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Ripple’s XRP going into 2026 targets $4.50 to $6.00. The bullish case assumes a few big things go right: clear regulation after the SEC case, wider adoption of Ripple’s ODL for cross-border payments, and deeper involvement in CBDC projects. If all that lines up, DeepSeek thinks XRP could jump more than 80% and push into the $3 to $5 range. On the flip side, the bearish scenario is pretty rough. DeepSeek warns that if selling pressure ramps up and sentiment turns ugly, XRP could slide hard from around $1.86 down toward $1.00. That would be a massive drop and shows just how volatile things could get if the market flips negative. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. The recent launch of five spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. could bring in a new wave of institutional money, even during the slower holiday period. We have seen this playbook before with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, where demand built quietly before bigger moves followed. With more ETF approvals likely in the coming months, the odds are rising that 2026 turns into a breakout year for XRP. For investors accumulating at current levels, the risk-reward could end up looking very attractive. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek Expects Solana Is Ready For 300% Jump DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Solana SOL going into 2026 targets $275 to $350. Solana remains the coin of the cycle. DeepSeek AI predicts Solana could supercharge and lead scalable consumer applications, with ecosystem growth and rising institutional adoption potentially driving a 300% breakout by early 2026. If that fails, the bear case is not much worse than current conditions, with DeepSeek projecting a drop toward the $80-$95 support zone. There are several scenarios that could play out here, but overall the bullish structure remains intact. Analyst James Easton believes that as long as price stays above this wedge, the setup still supports a rally. What really stands out is the weekly RSI, which is actually lower now than it was at the bottom of the bear market, a condition that has historically lined up with strong upside moves. Cardano (ADA): Deepseek Says Its Finally Going Back Above The Dollar Mark? DeepSeek AI’s bull case for Cardano ADA going into 2026 targets $0.85 to $1.20. This hinges on Cardano actually delivering. A smooth rollout of the Chang hard fork would unlock on-chain governance and the community treasury, while real-world utility projects would finally prove the peer-reviewed approach works at scale. But if those pieces stall or disappoint, sentiment could flip fast and send the price back toward the $0.25–$0.28 bear case zone. To confirm a bullish rebound, ADA needs to break and hold above the $0.36 level in the short term. If it does, the next clear resistance sits at $0.38, where price has already failed twice over the past week. A move down toward the $0.30 zone is still possible if this level fails to break. The RSI is around 40 and not yet oversold, which leaves room for that scenario to play out. As long as the previous low near $0.27 is not broken, the bullish setup remains possible heading into the new year. Deepseek Best Choice Could Quietly Be Maxi Doge While DeepSeek is laying out extreme bull and bear cases for XRP, Solana, and Cardano, some traders are skipping the predictions altogether and focusing on where momentum is already quietly building. That is exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a pure high-beta memecoin play for the next cycle, built for the kind of volatility DeepSeek is warning about. When majors chop and sentiment stays divided, capital often rotates into aggressive meme narratives that do not need perfect macro conditions to move. The project has already raised over $4.28M, which is a strong signal considering how cautious the market has been lately. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting at a massive 71% APY , giving early holders a real incentive to lock in and wait rather than chase short-term price swings. While AI models argue whether SOL goes to $300 or XRP drops to $1, Maxi Doge is doing what early memecoin winners usually do, building quietly, attracting committed capital, and setting the stage before the broader market wakes up. If 2026 really does turn into the high-volatility year many expect, the tokens with strong communities, simple narratives, and aggressive tokenomics tend to outperform everything else. Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one of those plays. Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The change applies to platinum contracts PT2606, PT2608, PT2610, PT2612 and palladium contracts PD2606, PD2608, PD2610, PD2612, according to the exchange. Platinum prices hit an all-time high last week at $2,377.50 before pulling back, then later traded 2.4% lower at $2,220.44. Palladium fell even harder, dropping more than 9% to $1,683.58 after touching its highest level in three years earlier in the session. Both metals remain sharply higher on the year. Platinum is up about 145%, while palladium has gained more than 85%. Chinese spot and futures markets for precious metals have also traded at persistent premiums compared with London and COMEX prices, which have held even as global prices rallied. Silver surge and fund losses are the basis of China’s current market stress The GFEX decision landed as silver trading in China turned chaotic. Shanghai silver prices hit a record $80 per ounce, pushing year-to-date gains above 150%. Traders have pointed to a shortage of physical silver inside China. Globally, spot silver hovered near $72 per ounce, extending a rally that has lifted prices more than 120% in 2025. On Wednesday, spot silver reached $72.70, putting it on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Gold has surged by 60% year-to-date . China’s only pure-play silver fund, the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF, dropped by its maximum daily limit of 10% on Thursday. The fall ended a rapid rally that had triggered repeated warnings from the fund manager. The fund had risen nearly 220% this year, far outpacing the roughly 128% gain in Shanghai silver futures. By Wednesday, the premium over the fund’s underlying silver contracts stood at nearly 62%, up from 7% at the start of the month. After three straight days of hitting its 10% daily upside limit, the firm cut Class C subscription limits to 100 yuan from 500 yuan, effective December 26.

This came as the analyst also suggested that the altcoin may be forming a bottom in preparation for the next leg to the upside. Analyst Shares Why This Chart Is Interesting For The XRP Price In an X post, Steph highlighted the 3-week XRP price chart, stating that it was “interesting” for one reason. He revealed that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 0.00 on the 3-week timeframe, which is extremely rare and has only happened once before, which was the 2022 bear market bottom. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why This Changes Everything For XRP In The Long Term Steph further explained that on such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when selling pressure is fully exhausted, which is a positive for the XRP price. The analyst added that this means that momentum to the downside has dried up, although he warned that this doesn’t mean that price must instantly reverse. Steph noted that the last time this signal appeared, the XRP price entered a long accumulation phase before the next major move higher. As such, the analyst claimed that this again suggests that the downside risk is structurally limited and that long-term holders are absorbing supply rather than distributing. He further remarked that these signals tend to mark cycle lows rather than short-term trades. The XRP ETFs also mark a positive for the XRP price as these funds maintain their inflows streak. These funds have recorded daily inflows since the Canary’s fund launched on November 13. As a result, they now boast net assets of over $1.1 billion, even as XRP continues to see significant demand from institutional investors. XRP Remains Below Key Levels In an X post, CryptoXLarge stated that on the weekly chart, the XRP price remains below the descending trendline around the 8 to 21 EMA levels. He further remarked that this week, the price is attempting to break below the key support zone around $1.95, which aligns with the Fib 0.5 level and the 89-week EMA, which is a support that has held throughout the year. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing CryptoXLarge stated that a weekly close below this level could increase the probability of a move toward the $1.60 support, which is the Fib 0.618. Meanwhile, a weekly close above $1.95 may boost buying interest, which could trigger a relief XRP price rally toward $2.30 and then $2.70. Crypto analyst Crypto King also echoed a similar sentiment, stating that a reclaim of $1.98 could eventually send the altcoin to as high as $3.66. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $1.87, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

56365429,648586,1766703627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56365429.jpeg,"XRP Is At Its Best Potential Recovery Level Since 2022, Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-best-potential-recovery-level/,"A crypto analyst has raised concerns about XRP’s underperformance , citing the cryptocurrency’s prolonged consolidation at lower price levels and its failure to reclaim former highs. Despite these struggles, the analyst notes that the altcoin is still positioned around its best potential recovery level since 2022. He suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a price rally , potentially paving the way for a recovery to new levels. XRP Approaches Strongest Recovery Zone Since 2022 Skipper, a crypto market expert on X, has released a new XRP update outlining the cryptocurrency’s potential recovery . He stated that the token has struggled in recent weeks, remaining stuck in a prolonged slump, marked by low trading activity and minimal price movement. Despite this sluggish performance, the analyst highlighted that the altcoin is now near its best potential recovery level since 2022. Skipper explained that the most significant factor supporting this recovery potential is the decline in bubble risk . According to his chart analysis, XRP’s bubble risk is now at one of its lowest points in years, indicating that excessive speculation and risky bets have largely been removed from the market. He stated that this cleanup makes a sudden price crash far less likely and establishes a more stable foundation for a recovery. The analyst made it clear that a low bubble risk does not guarantee an immediate price rally for XRP. Instead, he explained that this low-risk environment often creates the ideal conditions for a market bottom to form. Skipper also commented on its current dynamics, highlighting that conditions currently favor buyers waiting on the sidelines, as sellers are not aggressively driving prices lower. The analyst referenced historical performance, noting that the altcoin has often delivered stronger returns following extended periods of quiet price action. Another key point highlighted by the analyst is that when fewer traders are actively committed to XRP, price action becomes more responsive to positive developments. Under such conditions, factors such as improved liquidity or heightened network usage can exert a stronger influence on XRP, increasing its potential for a recovery. The analyst further stressed that a low bubble risk should not be confused with a promise of short-term gains. He stated that a surge should not be expected tomorrow or next week. However, he highlighted that the cryptocurrency is no longer sitting in a danger zone. Analyst Sets XRP Next Upside Target At $2.58 In another XRP update, market analyst Crypto King has stated that the cryptocurrency is holding firm above a critical support area around $1.85. He emphasized that a strong bounce at this support and a reclaim of the $1.98 level would signal a momentum shift for XRP. If the cryptocurrency breaks above this level, Crypto King predicts its next upside target is $2.58, which aligns with the Resistance 1 level on the price chart. Should bullish momentum persist, the analyst believes this could open the door to a powerful rally toward $3.18 at Resistance 2, followed by $3.66 at Resistance 3.",XRP|Altcoin|Crypto King|ripple|Skipper|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-25 23:00:27

They emerge through regulation, infrastructure, and the people capable of translating law into functional markets. As the United States moves closer to defining its long-awaited digital asset framework, one personnel move is drawing growing attention for its potential to reshape how capital enters and moves through crypto—particularly XRP. That move centers on Caroline Pham. A High-Impact Transition at a Critical Moment As highlighted by X Finance Bull, Caroline Pham, former Acting Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , has joined MoonPay as Chief Legal Officer. The timing is significant. WHAT @CarolineDPham DOES NEXT COULD SHIFT $XRP AND CRYPTO FLOWS FOREVER She helped save hundreds of millions in compliance costs. Now she’s in the driver’s seat of a platform @moonpay that moves $XRP and $RLUSD Repost if you trust her move pic.twitter.com/IQcGGY8xaE — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 25, 2025 Pham spent years inside the regulatory engine , most notably leading efforts to unwind layers of duplicative and costly rules left behind by early Dodd-Frank implementation. She has publicly estimated that these reforms saved market participants hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs. Her transition from regulator to infrastructure executive places that hard-earned expertise directly inside one of crypto’s most important access points. MoonPay’s Expanding Role in XRP and Stablecoins MoonPay is not a passive player in the digital asset ecosystem. As a leading fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, it enables direct access to assets like XRP and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , which launched in December 2024. On-ramps increasingly define market behavior, especially as institutions demand compliant, low-friction entry into digital assets. With Pham guiding legal and regulatory strategy, MoonPay is positioned to anticipate regulatory expectations rather than react to them. That matters as capital flows become more selective and compliance-driven. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Structure, Rulemaking, and the 2026 Window In a video clip shared by X Finance Bull, Pham addressed the urgency surrounding U.S. market structure legislation, noting that 2026 is a decisive period. She emphasized that while Congress passes laws, agencies ultimately shape markets through rulemaking. Drawing from her experience at the CFTC, Pham warned that poorly designed rules can take decades to correct. She also stressed the importance of technical expertise within regulatory bodies, pointing out that writing durable rules requires hands-on legal precision, not political shortcuts. Her perspective reflects why implementation—not just legislation—will determine whether crypto innovation accelerates or stalls. Why XRP Is Uniquely Positioned XRP has long been designed for regulated financial environments, prioritizing liquidity efficiency and cross-border settlement. As regulatory clarity improves and compliant access points strengthen, assets aligned with institutional workflows stand to benefit disproportionately. Pham’s role at MoonPay does not guarantee policy outcomes, but it meaningfully improves the alignment between regulation and infrastructure—precisely where XRP operates best. A Structural Shift, Not a Headline Moment This development is not about short-term speculation. It is about financial plumbing. When regulatory architects move into transaction infrastructure, capital flows adjust quietly before transforming markets at scale. If executed well, this convergence could redefine how XRP—and crypto more broadly—moves through the global financial system for years to come.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $86,960.68. This movement has caught the attention of traders and investors worldwide, prompting questions about market stability and future trends. What Caused the Bitcoin Price Decline? Several factors typically influence cryptocurrency valuations. The recent Bitcoin price drop may relate to broader market corrections, regulatory news, or shifts in investor sentiment. Market analysts often point to these common triggers when explaining sudden movements in the Bitcoin price . Understanding these factors helps investors make informed decisions. However, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and prices can change rapidly based on global economic conditions and technological developments. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Market volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, consider these approaches: Review your investment strategy – Ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance Diversify your portfolio – Don’t put all your funds into one asset Stay informed – Follow reliable market analysis and news sources Avoid panic selling – Emotional decisions often lead to losses Remember that cryptocurrency investments require careful consideration and research. The current Bitcoin price movement serves as a reminder of market unpredictability. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. When the Bitcoin price declines significantly, other digital assets frequently follow similar patterns. This correlation means that Bitcoin’s performance can impact entire market sectors. However, each cryptocurrency has unique fundamentals. Some may demonstrate resilience during Bitcoin downturns, while others might experience more pronounced effects. Market participants should analyze individual projects rather than making blanket assumptions based solely on the Bitcoin price . Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The recent Bitcoin price movement below $87,000 highlights several important considerations for market participants. First, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, with prices capable of significant swings in short periods. Second, having a clear investment strategy becomes crucial during periods of price uncertainty. Finally, maintaining perspective helps navigate market fluctuations. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its existence, yet it has demonstrated remarkable resilience over longer timeframes. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin fall below $87,000? Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate due to various factors including market sentiment, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and trading volume changes. The specific combination influencing this particular Bitcoin price movement requires ongoing analysis. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. Price drops can present buying opportunities, but they also indicate market uncertainty. Consult with financial advisors before making significant investment decisions. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels remains challenging even for experienced analysts. Cryptocurrency markets involve substantial uncertainty, and prices can move in unexpected directions based on unfolding developments. Will other cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin’s decline? Historically, many cryptocurrencies have shown correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. However, individual projects may demonstrate different patterns based on their specific developments and market positions. How long do Bitcoin price corrections typically last? Correction durations vary significantly. Some last days, while others extend for weeks or months. Market conditions, news developments, and investor sentiment all influence how long price adjustments persist. Where can I track real-time Bitcoin prices? Numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and financial data platforms provide real-time price information. Always verify you’re using reputable sources for market data and analysis.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has just dropped to a worrying score of 20, firmly placing investor sentiment in the ‘extreme fear’ territory. This critical gauge, which many traders use to gauge market psychology, suggests that pessimism is currently dominating the digital asset space. But what does this extreme reading actually mean for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your investments? Let’s break it down. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Compiled by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 represents maximum fear and panic, while 100 signals unbridled greed and euphoria. The current reading of 20 is a clear warning sign that fear is the dominant force. This index matters because extreme emotions often signal potential turning points. Historically, periods of ‘extreme fear’ have sometimes preceded market recoveries, while ‘extreme greed’ has often marked market tops. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes six key market factors to generate its daily score: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trades and volume. Declining volume can indicate apathy or fear. Social Media (15%): Scans platforms like Twitter and Reddit for sentiment. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search volume for crypto-related terms. This multi-source approach helps paint a more accurate picture than any single metric could. What Does a Score of ‘Extreme Fear’ Signal for Traders? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 is a powerful contrarian indicator. For savvy investors, extreme fear can present opportunity. When the crowd is panicking and selling, asset prices often fall below their intrinsic value. However, this does not guarantee an immediate bounce. The market can remain fearful for extended periods. Therefore, this index should not be used in isolation. It is best combined with fundamental analysis (e.g., project health, adoption rates) and technical analysis (e.g., chart patterns, support levels) to make informed decisions. The key takeaway is to avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on prevailing sentiment. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market with the Fear & Greed Index How can you use this information? First, recognize that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. Here are some practical steps: Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Extreme fear periods can be good times to systematically accumulate assets at lower prices. Re-evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation still matches your personal risk appetite during volatile times. Avoid Panic Selling: Selling into extreme fear often locks in losses. Review your investment thesis instead. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Monitor the index as part of a balanced news diet, but don’t let hourly fluctuations dictate your strategy. Remember, the goal is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful—a principle famously echoed by Warren Buffett. Conclusion: Beyond the Fear and Greed Cycle The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hitting 20 is a stark reminder of the market’s cyclical nature. While it highlights significant short-term anxiety, long-term cryptocurrency adoption continues on its own trajectory. For investors, this moment underscores the importance of discipline, research, and a strategy that can withstand emotional extremes. By understanding the sentiment behind the numbers, you can make more rational decisions regardless of whether the index screams fear or whispers greed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? You can view the live index and its historical data on the website Alternative.me. Many popular cryptocurrency news and data platforms also feature it. Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index been accurate in the past? It has been a reliable contrarian indicator at major market extremes. For example, it showed extreme greed near the all-time highs in late 2021 and extreme fear during major sell-offs like in 2018 and March 2020. However, it is not a perfect timing tool. Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? Not necessarily. Extreme fear can indicate a potential buying zone, but it is not a standalone ‘buy’ signal. Always conduct your own research on the asset’s fundamentals and the overall market structure before investing. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily. The data is compiled once per day, usually in the morning (UTC). Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While the index’s components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin (through dominance and volatility), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Can the index remain in ‘extreme fear’ for a long time? Yes. Sentiment can be stuck in fear or greed for weeks or even months, as seen in prolonged bear markets or bull runs. The index measures current sentiment, not future price direction. Found this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helpful?

Today marks a historic moment as a staggering $23.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire. This unprecedented volume, reported by Deribit, shatters previous records and places immense focus on potential price volatility. For every trader and investor, understanding the mechanics and implications of this event is crucial. What Does This Record-Breaking Bitcoin Options Expiry Mean? To grasp the scale, this $23.347 billion expiry dwarfs last year’s peak of $14.3 billion. Essentially, a massive number of contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price are reaching their deadline. This convergence creates a focal point for market forces, often leading to increased trading activity and price discovery around the expiry time. Concurrently, $3.7 billion in Ethereum options will also expire. However, the spotlight remains firmly on the Bitcoin options market due to its sheer size. The key metrics to watch are the put/call ratio and the max pain price, which offer clues about market sentiment and potential price pressure points. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain Let’s break down the complex jargon into simple terms. The current data reveals two critical numbers: Put/Call Ratio (0.35 for BTC): This measures the volume of put options (bets on price dropping) versus call options (bets on price rising). A ratio below 1, like 0.35, indicates far more call options exist. This suggests a bullish bias among options traders leading into this expiry. Max Pain Price ($95,000 for BTC): This is the price at which the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, causing the most financial ‘pain’ to options buyers. It often acts as a theoretical magnet for the spot price as expiry approaches. How Could This Impact the Bitcoin Price? The immediate question for every investor is: will this cause a pump or a dump? The low put/call ratio implies many traders hold calls betting on higher prices. If Bitcoin’s price is below their strike prices at expiry, those calls become worthless. This dynamic can lead to increased selling pressure from market makers who hedged their positions. However, the high max pain price of $95,000 sits significantly above current levels. This creates a complex tug-of-war. While the bullish options bias is clear, the path of least resistance for maximum financial impact on options holders might pull the price. Therefore, traders should brace for potential volatility as large positions are closed or rolled over. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating such events requires a strategy. Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on expiry data. Consider these points: Monitor Liquidity: Watch for unusual volume spikes around the 8:00 a.m. UTC expiry time on Deribit and other major exchanges. Context is Key: This Bitcoin options expiry occurs within broader market trends. Assess overall sentiment, ETF flows, and macroeconomic factors. Risk Management First: Ensure your positions are protected with stop-losses. Expiry events can amplify normal market movements. In conclusion, today’s record Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While the bullish skew in options positioning is evident, the high max pain price introduces uncertainty. The ultimate outcome will depend on the interplay between these derivatives and the underlying spot market forces. Staying informed and disciplined is your best defense against unexpected volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin options? A1: Bitcoin options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. Q2: Why is a $23.3B options expiry significant? A2: It represents the largest single expiry of Bitcoin options in history. This massive volume can influence market maker hedging activity, liquidity, and short-term price volatility as positions are settled. Q3: What is a put/call ratio of 0.35? A3: A ratio of 0.35 means there are only 35 put contracts for every 100 call contracts. This indicates a strong majority of options traders are positioned for a price increase, reflecting bullish sentiment. Q4: What happens at the ‘max pain price’? A4: The max pain price ($95,000) is where the total financial loss for all options buyers is maximized. It’s a theoretical level, but price often gravitates towards it near expiry due to the hedging actions of large institutions. Q5: Should I change my investment strategy because of this? A5: Not necessarily. While it’s critical to be aware of such events, long-term investors should focus on fundamentals. Short-term traders, however, should be prepared for potential volatility and manage risk accordingly. Found this analysis of the record Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

Net outflows on Christmas Eve reached a little over $175 million. That was part of a string of weak sessions: total net outflows for the prior five trading days added close to $826 million. Since December 15, every trading day closed with net selling except December 17, which drew inflows of $457 million. Institutional Outflows Market participants pointed to routine year-end moves as a major factor. Reports have disclosed that tax-loss harvesting — where traders sell positions to realize losses for tax purposes — has been heavy this month. One trader on X, using the name Alek, said most selling is tied to tax reasons and may fade within a week. Traders also flagged a record options expiry on Friday as a force that can sap appetite for risk ahead of large settlements. Pressure In US Trading Hours Data showed downside was strongest during US trading sessions. The Coinbase Premium — a measure comparing Coinbase’s BTC/USD price to Binance’s BTC/USDT — spent much of December below zero, signaling weaker buying in the US market. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows summed up the flow pattern, saying the US had become the biggest seller while Asia played the role of the main buyer. That split can limit how high Bitcoin holds during rallies if US demand doesn’t return. Liquidity Inactive Other traders contend that negative ETF flow numbers don’t mean the cycle is over. Based on reports shared on social channels, the path back usually goes price first, flows then. Price finds a base and then flows flatten, before fresh inflows appear. In this view, current liquidity looks inactive rather than broken. That leaves room for a bounce once seasonal selling subsides. Since early November, the 30-day moving average of US spot ETF net flows has stayed negative for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means that, on average, more capital has been leaving these ETFs than entering them for several weeks in a row. This is important because ETFs are… pic.twitter.com/qR1bMQNqxe — BitBull (@AkaBull_) December 24, 2025 On-Chain Signals On-chain metrics offer some comfort. Long-term holders are not rushing to sell at once. Realized gains show some profit-taking, but not the kind of extreme that marks a terminal peak. That pattern fits the idea that selling is being absorbed by other hands. If selling is near exhaustion, larger buyers could step in when ETFs turn neutral or positive. Outlook For The Coming Months Investors will watch ETF flows closely after the holidays. If flows move toward neutral, price could stabilize and then climb without needing huge new demand. The mix of tax selling and options-related positioning suggests some of the current weakness may be temporary. Still, traders should expect choppy moves while US buyers remain sidelined.

This collaboration aims to provide sophisticated asset management services, merging traditional financial expertise with digital asset innovation. For investors watching the crypto space, this partnership is a clear indicator of the maturing landscape in South Korea and beyond. What Does the Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU Mean? The core of this agreement is a strategic alliance. Korea Investment & Securities, a major traditional financial player, will join forces with Bithumb, a powerhouse in the Korean crypto market. Their goal is to develop and offer customized asset management solutions. This means clients could soon access hybrid portfolios that seamlessly blend conventional stocks and bonds with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This partnership is significant because it directly addresses a key demand: professional management of crypto assets. Many investors are interested in digital currencies but lack the time or expertise to manage them actively. Through this MOU, the two firms plan to create structured products and advisory services that bridge this gap. Why Is This Collaboration a Game-Changer? This partnership is more than just a business deal; it’s a validation of the crypto asset class. When a established securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities enters the arena, it brings legitimacy, rigorous risk management frameworks, and a vast client network. For Bithumb, it provides deeper access to traditional investors who have been cautious about entering the crypto market directly. The benefits for potential clients are substantial: Professional Guidance: Access to managed portfolios that combine traditional and digital assets. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the compliance and custodial expertise of a major securities firm. Simplified Access: A one-stop-shop for diversified investment strategies. Regulatory Confidence: Collaboration may help navigate the evolving regulatory environment more effectively. What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? Despite the exciting potential, the road ahead isn’t without hurdles. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea remains complex and is subject to change. Integrating the fast-paced, innovative world of crypto with the slower, highly regulated processes of traditional finance will require careful navigation. Furthermore, they must build products that truly meet client needs. This involves educating a traditionally conservative investor base about the risks and opportunities of crypto assets. Success will depend on their ability to create transparent, trustworthy, and high-performing solutions that stand out in a competitive market. What’s the Future of Such Institutional Partnerships? The Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb MOU is likely a precursor to more collaborations. As cryptocurrency becomes an unavoidable part of the global financial system, traditional institutions are seeking safe and compliant entry points. We can expect to see more securities firms, banks, and asset managers forming similar alliances with regulated crypto exchanges. This trend points toward a future where digital assets are fully integrated into mainstream finance. For the everyday investor, it means more options, better protection, and professional management for their crypto holdings. It’s a crucial step in moving the market from speculative trading to long-term, strategic asset allocation. Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward The partnership between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb is a powerful signal of institutional adoption. It demonstrates a clear shift from viewing cryptocurrencies as a niche novelty to recognizing them as a legitimate component of a modern investment portfolio. This MOU has the potential to unlock new capital, improve market stability, and offer investors a safer, more guided path into the digital asset ecosystem. The collaboration’s success will be closely watched as a blueprint for future integration between traditional and decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the MOU between Korea Investment & Securities and Bithumb? A1: The primary goal is to collaborate on developing and providing customized asset management services that include both traditional financial products and cryptocurrencies. Q2: How will this partnership benefit average investors? A2: Investors may gain access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios that include crypto assets, along with the security and expertise of a major traditional securities firm. Q3: Does this mean Korea Investment & Securities is launching a crypto exchange? A3: No. The firm is partnering with the existing exchange, Bithumb, to create asset management products and services, not to operate its own trading platform. Q4: Is my money safer if I invest through this new service? A4: While any investment carries risk, the involvement of a regulated securities firm like Korea Investment & Securities suggests a strong focus on compliance, custody, and risk management frameworks that may enhance security compared to using an exchange alone. Q5: When will these new asset management services be available? A5: The announcement is for an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), which is an agreement to collaborate. Specific products and their launch dates have not yet been disclosed and will likely follow further development and regulatory review. Q6: Could this partnership influence crypto regulations in South Korea? A6: Potentially, yes. High-profile collaborations between traditional finance and crypto entities can encourage clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks by demonstrating serious, compliant business models.

The Altcoin Season Index has dipped to a mere 16, down from 17 just yesterday. This crucial metric suggests we are firmly in the grip of a Bitcoin-dominated market, leaving many altcoin investors wondering when the tide will turn. Understanding this index is vital for navigating the volatile crypto seas. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? Simply put, the Altcoin Season Index is a thermometer for the crypto market’s risk appetite. Created by CoinMarketCap, it measures whether conditions favor altcoins or Bitcoin. The index compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin’s performance. A score closer to 100 signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where most altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Conversely, a low score like 16 indicates a strong ‘Bitcoin season.’ Why Has the Altcoin Season Index Crashed to 16? The current low reading of the Altcoin Season Index is a clear symptom of broader market dynamics. Typically, when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising, and macroeconomic uncertainty is high, capital flows into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. This often comes at the expense of smaller altcoins. Several factors contribute to this trend: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors are prioritizing assets seen as less risky. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market share often increases during cautious periods. Liquidity Preference: Traders exit smaller altcoins for the easier entry and exit of Bitcoin. Therefore, the index acts as a confirmation tool, showing that the current environment is challenging for altcoin growth relative to the market leader. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? This isn’t just a number to glance at; it’s a strategic tool. A low Altcoin Season Index score suggests a specific market phase. Here’s how savvy investors might interpret it: For Accumulation: A low index can signal a potential buying opportunity for strong altcoin projects at discounted prices, though timing is crucial. For Portfolio Balance: It may be a reminder to ensure your portfolio isn’t overexposed to high-risk altcoins during a Bitcoin season. For Patience: It sets realistic expectations, indicating that broad altcoin rallies may not be imminent until the index trends upward. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator based on 90-day performance. It confirms a trend; it doesn’t predict an immediate reversal. When Will the Next Altcoin Season Begin? The million-dollar question. Historically, an altcoin season is officially declared when 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, pushing the Altcoin Season Index above 75. For a sustained shift, we often need: A period of Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Positive developments in blockchain technology and adoption. Improved overall investor sentiment and risk appetite. Watching for a consistent rise in the Altcoin Season Index from these lows can be one of the first signs that capital is rotating back into altcoins. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Tide The Altcoin Season Index at 16 delivers a clear, data-driven message: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For investors, this isn’t necessarily a time for panic but for perspective and preparation. By understanding what this metric reveals about market structure and sentiment, you can make more informed decisions—whether that means fortifying your core holdings or strategically planning your next altcoin entry. Keep a close watch on this index; its climb back up will be the early whisper of the next altcoin awakening. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that scores from 1 to 100. It measures how many of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score above 75 suggests an ‘altcoin season.’ Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low Altcoin Season Index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to review your portfolio’s risk, consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects, and ensure you have a balanced strategy. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the tracked cryptocurrencies. Q4: Can the index predict the exact start of an altcoin season? A4: No, it is a lagging indicator. It confirms a trend that is already in place. A sustained move above 75 confirms an altcoin season has been occurring, but it doesn’t forecast the exact day it will begin. Q5: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A5: You can find the Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website, usually within their market research or data tools sections. Q6: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A6: It uses the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization but excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to focus on volatile, independent assets.

This New Altcoin Has Already Surged 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-cheap-crypto-for-q1-2025-this-new-altcoin-has-already-surged-250/,"Each market cycle has an element of tokens that move very silently and most people are not aware of this until they realize. Price action can be first triggered many years before the general market takes action. Whenever a trend gains visibility, a considerable portion of the initial growth is lost. That is why most investors, who follow the news in the crypto-market and ask themselves, what crypto to buy now, have to be more concerned with the assets that are new. A good example of a new crypto that is following this trend is making recent headlines following a powerful move that took place in the absence of significant hype. Whether this stage is too early is the question many are asking; it is not why it moved. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is being built Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto that is being developed based on lending and borrowing. The protocol has two fundamental market structures that can cater to various user requirements. In the P2C market, assets are provided by the users into distribution pools. They, in their turn, are rewarded with mtTokens. These mtTokens increase due to repayment of interest by borrowers. As an illustration, a user providing stable assets has the opportunity to hold mtTokens and observe their increase in value with time. The model promotes long term possession or utilization rather than rapid trading. The P2P market involves borrowing that is made directly between users. Borrowers are able to select between fixed and variable rates, according to the situation in the market. There are strict LTV regulations on collateral. In case of collateral value that becomes lower than the requirement, liquidations become automatic. This puts the system on board and minimizes risk on the spur of the moment. Over $19M are already collected and the number of the holders has increased to over 18,500. These figures are important since its growth has been consistent. This is a good indication that there is aggregation as opposed to short term speculation. The next important step is V1, when the protocol can pass to live usage. Phase Progression and MUTM Price The price of MUTM at present is $0.035 and this is in presale Phase 6. The maximum supply is 4B tokens. Out of this value, it was assigned to early distribution and this corresponds to 45.5% and accounts to approximately 1.82B tokens. A great portion of these tokens already has been sold. The token has risen by up to 250% of the initial phase because of demand. It was not a single move toward this increase. It was gradual in phase by phase development. Phase 1 participants early on would yield a growth of about 500% the amount they entered at the official launch price of $0.06. The price of each token will go up, and the succeeding phase will see MUTM go up by almost 20%. This is why timing matters. Phases become more costly to access as their level increases, and the supply narrows. This is a structure of interest to people who seek the most advantageous cheap crypto to purchase. There are price steps built in the system rather than being arbitrary. Reviews and Risk Controls Any DeFi crypto and, in particular, lending protocols require security. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit which assists in verifying the token structure and contract logic. Moreover, Halborn Security has conducted the protocol design and risk structure. There is also a bug bounty program of $50K. This will open up the system to external researchers to test and report as pre preliminary adoption. Such layers diminish doubt and will contribute to the creation of trust in the participants having a long period of involvement. Definite collateral requirements, liquidations, and security review of third parties and so on will provide a more solid base. The Reason Why Investor Urgency is on The Increase There is heightened activity among the investors because of tightening of the allocation. The 24 hour leaderboard follows regular engagement as opposed to a single time purchase. This is usually an indication of increased user interest which intends to remain active. Being an Ethereum based protocol, Mutuum Finance is setting itself ahead of Q1 2026 with infrastructure, security, and usage skewed. To most observers of leading cryptocurrencies and those engaged in a question of which crypto one should invest in, this stage defines more of positioning and less speculation. It is this increasing price supply ratio and an imminent V1 launch that makes MUTM more and more popular as a next-big cryptocurrency that should be looked at.

While headlines scream about market corrections, seasoned analysts point to underlying metrics that tell a different, more reassuring story. The current Bitcoin correction appears to be a temporary adjustment rather than the start of a major downturn, according to key on-chain data. Let’s explore why long-term investor behavior suggests strength, not weakness, in the market’s foundation. What Do On-Chain Metrics Reveal About This Bitcoin Correction? Crypto analyst Arab Chain, in a recent CryptoQuant contribution, provides crucial insight. The analyst highlights that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—which tracks the movement of older, long-held coins—remains at moderate levels. This is a vital signal. Why? Because during genuine market tops, we typically see this metric spike as veteran investors cash out en masse. The current data shows no such aggressive selling from long-term holders. Furthermore, the Supply-Adjusted CDD is stable and far from the extreme levels witnessed at past bull market peaks. This combination strongly indicates that the recent Bitcoin correction was not triggered by a mass exodus of the most committed investors. Their coins are staying put, reflecting enduring confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. If Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling, What’s Causing the Dip? So, what’s behind the price pullback if the foundational holders are steadfast? The analysis points to two primary, short-term factors: Slowing Momentum: After a strong rally, markets often need to consolidate. This breather allows overheated conditions to cool and builds a healthier base for the next move. Weakening Liquidity: Shifts in macro liquidity or temporary outflows from short-term speculative traders can create downward pressure without altering the core bullish thesis. In essence, this looks like a routine market cleanse. It shakes out weak hands and resets leverage, all while the most significant cohort—the long-term believers—holds firm. This creates a potentially powerful setup for patient investors. Why Should You See This Bitcoin Correction as an Opportunity? History shows that periods of stability among long-term holders during price dips have often preceded strong rebounds. Their inactivity is a vote of confidence. When the ‘smart money’ isn’t fleeing, it suggests the asset’s fundamental story remains intact. For investors, this environment offers distinct advantages: Reduced Emotional Noise: Understanding the metric-driven reality helps avoid panic-driven decisions. Strategic Entry Points: Temporary corrections can provide better valuation opportunities compared to buying at peak FOMO. Market Health Check: Stable holder metrics act as a diagnostic tool, separating healthy pullbacks from unhealthy breakdowns. Therefore, viewing this phase through the lens of holder behavior transforms it from a threat into a potential strategic window. The current Bitcoin correction is more about market mechanics than a loss of faith. What’s the Bottom Line for Investors? The compelling takeaway is that on-chain data provides a deeper narrative than price charts alone. While volatility is inherent to crypto, the behavior of long-term holders serves as a critical anchor. Their current stability suggests this Bitcoin correction is a temporary phenomenon within a larger, ongoing cycle. For those with a long-term perspective, these moments test conviction but also reward it. In conclusion, the market’s foundation appears solid despite the surface-level turbulence. The dip, driven by momentum and liquidity shifts rather than core investor capitulation, may represent a moment of clarity. By focusing on holder metrics over headlines, investors can navigate volatility with greater confidence and purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) and why is it important? A: Coin Days Destroyed measures the movement of coins that have been held for a long time. A high CDD suggests long-term holders are selling, which can signal a market top. A moderate CDD, like now, suggests they are holding, indicating underlying strength. Q: How long might this Bitcoin correction last? A> Corrections are difficult to time precisely. However, if the cause is short-term liquidity and momentum issues—as the data suggests—it could be resolved relatively quickly compared to corrections driven by fundamental breakdowns. Q: Should I buy Bitcoin during a correction? A> This is a personal investment decision. The data suggests the sell-off is not driven by long-term holders, which is a positive sign. However, always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: What other metrics should I watch besides CDD? A> Key metrics include Exchange Net Flow (to see if coins are moving to sell), Miner Reserves, and the MVRV Ratio. Together, they provide a fuller picture of market sentiment and potential pressure points. Q: Could this analysis be wrong and the correction deepen? A> All market analysis involves probability, not certainty. While on-chain data is a powerful tool, external macro shocks or unforeseen events can always impact prices. The data suggests a temporary dip is more likely, but risk always exists. Found this analysis helpful in cutting through the market noise?

MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le recently made a compelling case for a fundamental shift in perspective. Instead of obsessing over every market dip and surge, he urges investors to focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value . This isn’t just advice from any executive; it’s the guiding principle of a company that has bet billions on this very belief. Let’s explore why this mindset is crucial for navigating the crypto landscape. Why Should You Ignore Bitcoin’s Daily Drama? Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast, Phong Le offered a refreshingly calm take. He stated he is “not concerned” with Bitcoin’s short-term price movements. This stance comes from a place of deep conviction. Le describes Bitcoin as an asset with inherently unpredictable short-term action. Therefore, trying to time the market is often a futile exercise. Instead, he advocates for a “systematic and mathematical approach.” This means judging the asset by its fundamental properties and potential over years and decades, not by its performance over days and weeks. The daily charts are just noise; the true signal is in the long-term trajectory. The Bullish Case for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value So, what builds this long-term conviction? Le highlights two transformative shifts creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s future. Government Sentiment is Warming: Le emphasized that the U.S. government is “more favorable toward BTC than ever before.” This evolving regulatory clarity, though gradual, reduces uncertainty and paves the way for broader integration. Institutional Floodgates Are Opening: Perhaps the most significant signal is the competitive entry of traditional financial giants. When banks and asset managers start offering Bitcoin products, it validates the asset class and unlocks trillions in institutional capital. These factors aren’t about tomorrow’s price. They are structural changes that reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term value as a decentralized, scarce digital asset entering the mainstream financial system. How Can You Adopt a Long-Term Bitcoin Strategy? Shifting your mindset is the first step. Here are actionable insights to build a strategy that mirrors this philosophy. Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This systematic approach involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. It automates the process and removes emotional, short-term decision-making. Secure Your Holdings: Long-term holding, or “HODLing,” requires robust security. Use hardware wallets for significant amounts and enable all available security features on exchanges. Educate Yourself on Fundamentals: Understand the core value propositions—decentralization, fixed supply, security, and growing network adoption. This knowledge will anchor you during volatile periods. The goal is to transition from a trader’s mentality to that of an investor. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption curve, not the fleeting sentiment on social media. What Are the Real Challenges of a Long-Term View? Adopting this perspective is simple in theory but challenging in practice. Volatility tests even the strongest convictions. Media narratives often amplify fear during downturns and greed during rallies, pushing investors toward reactive decisions. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the crypto space requires continuous learning to separate genuine innovation from hype. The key is to build a plan based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, then stick to it. Let the multi-year trend be your guide, not the hourly chart. Conclusion: Your Compass in the Crypto Storm Phong Le’s message is a vital reminder in a speculative market. The relentless focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value over short-term noise is what separates strategic investors from reactive speculators. With increasing institutional adoption and evolving regulatory landscapes, the foundational case for Bitcoin grows stronger. By adopting a disciplined, patient approach, you align yourself with these powerful macro trends. Remember, the most significant wealth in crypto has been built by those who understood the assignment: think in years, not minutes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did MicroStrategy’s CEO say about Bitcoin? MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le said investors should not be concerned with short-term Bitcoin price moves. He argues we should judge it by its long-term value and adopt a systematic investment approach. Why is a long-term view important for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile in the short term. A long-term view allows investors to focus on fundamental drivers like adoption, scarcity, and technological utility, which are better indicators of its potential value. What signals suggest a strong future for Bitcoin? Key signals include warming regulatory sentiment from governments like the U.S. and the competitive entry of major traditional financial institutions (banks, asset managers) into the cryptocurrency space. How can I practice a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy? Consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to invest consistently, use secure storage methods like hardware wallets, and continuously educate yourself on Bitcoin’s core technology and use cases. What is the biggest challenge of holding Bitcoin long-term? The primary challenge is psychological: resisting the urge to sell during sharp price drops (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or buy excessively during rapid rallies (FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out). Discipline is key. Did this perspective on Bitcoin’s long-term value help clarify your investment strategy?

On a typical afternoon, science and engineering students crowd the grounds. Badminton games run near the east gate. Inside the Laboratory of Brain and Intelligence, teams work quietly with whiteboards full of formulas and freshly painted walls while studying how the human brain processes thought. The rise of DeepSeek, an AI startup founded by alumni, gave students confidence that Chinese teams could compete directly with the world’s strongest labs. “DeepSeek showed that a Chinese team could lead in the LLM race,” said Yuyang Zhang, a PhD student in computational biology at Tsinghua. Government backing turns campus research into national priority The growing attention around Tsinghua is tied closely to Beijing’s technology (and specifically AI) agenda. President Xi Jinping, a graduate of the university, has urged private companies to help develop key technologies, with artificial intelligence at the top of that list. The government followed with tax breaks, subsidies, and policy support. Founders like Liang Wenfeng of DeepSeek raised large sums of venture capital and saw their images run alongside Xi’s in state media. Graduates from Tsinghua also hold senior AI roles at major companies such as Alibaba and ByteDance, and inside the university’s labs, researchers built an AI chip called Accel to compete with products from Nvidia. Same guys also created DrugCLIP, a system designed to speed drug discovery, and a training method known as Absolute Zero Reasoner, which allows AI models to train without human-provided data. Between 2005 and the end of 2024, Tsinghua filed 4,986 AI and machine learning patents, including more than 900 in 2024 alone, according to data from LexisNexis. The school holds more AI research papers among the 100 most cited globally than any other university.China now represents more than half of all active AI patent families worldwide. “This is a staggering shift in innovation in less than a decade, and it reflects China’s concerted drive to become an AI superpower,” said Marco Richter, senior director of IP analytics and strategy at LexisNexis. Students build new models as China widens the talent pipeline China’s AI instruction now starts in elementary schools alongside math and language, a pipeline feeds a large workforce. China produced 3.57 million STEM graduates in 2020, compared with 820,000 in the United States, based on figures from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. State media later reported that the annual number of STEM graduates reached five million. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, China’s only Turing Award winner, returned after years at Princeton, Stanford, and MIT to teach at Tsinghua. In 2023, undergraduates Guan Wang and William Chen created an AI model inspired by layered human reasoning, and it model outperformed larger systems from OpenAI and Anthropic on reasoning tests and complex Sudoku puzzles in early 2025. AI tools now appear across the Tsinghua campus, as research in many fields relies on AI models. Student competitions to build specialized agents run regularly and in September, the school launched a subsidized AI computing platform for all students, according to Bloomberg’s claims . The United States still leads in influential patents and top-performing models. Harvard and MIT rank higher on patent impact, and American institutions produced 40 notable AI models in 2024, compared with 15 from China, based on the Stanford AI Index Report. China’s share of the world’s top 2 percent AI researchers rose from 10 percent in 2019 to 26 percent in 2022, while the US share fell from 35 percent to 28 percent, based on figures from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

According to on-chain analytics, an address linked to Strong withdrew over $32 million in CBBTC and Ethereum from Aave and funneled it directly into Coinbase. This substantial Winslow Strong deposits event raises immediate questions about market sentiment and the strategies of influential players. What Does the $32.6M Winslow Strong Deposit Signal? The transaction, spotted by Lookonchain, is undeniably significant. It involved moving 307 CBBTC (worth approximately $27.03 million) and 1,900 ETH (worth around $5.6 million). Such a large-scale movement from a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol to a major centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase is a classic action that analysts watch closely. Therefore, it often precedes a potential sale or a strategic repositioning of assets for liquidity. Breaking Down the Crypto Transfer: From Aave to Coinbase To understand the impact, let’s unpack the mechanics. First, the assets were withdrawn from Aave, a leading lending and borrowing protocol. This means Strong was likely earning yield on these holdings. The subsequent deposit to Coinbase, a platform designed for easy trading and fiat conversions, suggests a shift in intent. Key details of the move include: Asset Composition: A mix of Bitcoin (via CBBTC, a wrapped version) and Ethereum. Timing: The transaction occurred just eight hours before reporting, making it a very recent market event. Scale: A $32.6 million transfer is large enough to potentially influence short-term market liquidity and perception. Why Do Major Deposits Like This Matter for Crypto Markets? Movements by known entities, often called “smart money” or “whales,” serve as important barometers. When a figure with a research background like Winslow Strong makes a move, the market takes note. This specific Winslow Strong deposits action could be interpreted in several ways. It might indicate a decision to take profits, a need for fiat currency, or simply a rebalancing of a portfolio. However, it also removes assets from the DeFi ecosystem, slightly reducing the liquidity available for lending and borrowing activities there. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers While you should never blindly follow any single transaction, you can use this event to refine your own market analysis. Here’s how: Monitor Exchange Flows: Large inflows to exchanges can sometimes signal selling pressure, while outflows to private wallets suggest accumulation. Context is Key: Consider broader market conditions. Is this part of a larger trend of whales moving to exchanges? Research the Actor: Understanding Winslow Strong’s historical patterns could provide clues, though past performance is no guarantee. The Final Takeaway on This Major Crypto Movement Ultimately, the Winslow Strong deposits of $32.6M into Coinbase is a powerful reminder of the transparent yet complex nature of blockchain markets. It highlights the continuous strategic maneuvering of major holders. For the average investor, it underscores the importance of staying informed through reliable on-chain data sources and maintaining a long-term strategy that isn’t swayed by any single transaction, no matter how large. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Winslow Strong? Winslow Strong is the former head of Qualia Research, a cryptocurrency research firm. He is a known figure in the crypto analytics and investment space. What is CBBTC? CBBTC is a wrapped Bitcoin token. It represents Bitcoin on other blockchains (like Ethereum), allowing it to be used in DeFi protocols such as Aave. Why move funds from Aave to Coinbase? Moving funds from Aave (DeFi) to Coinbase (a CEX) typically makes them more readily available for trading, selling for fiat, or simply holding in a custodial wallet. It often suggests a change from an earning strategy to a liquidity or exit strategy. Does this mean Winslow Strong is selling his crypto? Not necessarily. A deposit to an exchange makes selling easier, but it doesn’t confirm a sale has occurred. He could be preparing to trade, secure the assets differently, or even use other Coinbase services. How can I track transactions like this? On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Etherscan allow users to track large wallet movements and identify trends from smart money wallets. Should I be worried about this large deposit? One transaction should not dictate your investment strategy. It is a single data point. Always consider it within the wider context of market news, technical analysis, and your own financial goals. Found this analysis of the Winslow Strong deposits insightful?

Bitcoin Correlation To Nasdaq & Gold Has Changed Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Correlation that Bitcoin has to the Nasdaq and Gold . The “ Correlation ” here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about how tied together the prices of any two given assets are. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the price of one asset is responding to movements in the other by moving in the same direction. The closer the value is to 1, the stronger this relationship is. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests a negative correlation exists between the assets. That is, the two are going in the opposite directions. The extreme level for this region lies at -1. A third case also exists for the metric, where its value becomes exactly equal to zero. When this happens, the prices don’t hold any relationship with each other whatsoever. In statistics, the variables are said to be “independent” under this condition. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Correlation to Nasdaq and Gold over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Correlation indicator was at notable positive levels for both Nasdaq and Gold in mid-2025, implying the cryptocurrency was strongly bound to traditional markets. As the year went on, however, a shift began to take shape, with the indicator declining for both assets. Today, the metric is sitting at a nearly neutral level for Nasdaq, a sign that Bitcoin is now trading independently from the US stock market. The story is a bit different when it comes to Gold, however, as the Correlation has actually plummeted into the negative territory. With an indicator value of about -0.5, BTC can be considered to have a significant inverse relationship to Gold. Bitcoin is popularly thought of as the digital analogue to Gold’s “safe haven,” but given the latest Correlation, the cryptocurrency doesn’t appear to be behaving like one right now. “BTC is no longer trading like a tech stock or a safe haven,” noted the analyst. “It’s carving out its own market regime.” It now remains to be seen whether the new Correlation behavior will maintain or if the cryptocurrency will face another shift soon. BTC Price Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways since its decline at the start of the week as its price is still trading around $87,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin gold|Bitcoin Stocks|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 02:00:48

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,092.68 on the Binance USDT market. This powerful move has captured the attention of traders and investors worldwide, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. But what’s fueling this impressive rally, and is it sustainable? Let’s dive into the details behind Bitcoin’s latest price action. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? Several key factors are converging to push the BTC price to new heights. First, increased institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not only holding Bitcoin but are actively integrating it into their investment products. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are driving investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in major economies are reducing uncertainty and building confidence in the asset class. Finally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate of new supply, is creating a sense of scarcity that historically precedes major price increases. How Significant is the $88,000 BTC Price Level? Breaking above $88,000 is more than just a number; it’s a critical psychological threshold for the market. This level often acts as a key resistance point, and surpassing it can trigger a wave of automated buying from algorithmic traders. For long-term holders, it reinforces the bullish narrative surrounding Bitcoin’s digital gold thesis. However, it’s crucial to understand the market dynamics at play. The current BTC price reflects a complex interplay of: Spot Market Demand: Real buying from investors seeking to own the asset. Derivatives Activity: Futures and options trading that can amplify price movements. On-Chain Metrics: Data showing accumulation by large holders, known as whales. Global Liquidity: The overall availability of capital in the financial system. What Should Investors Consider at This BTC Price? While the surge is exhilarating, a prudent approach is essential. The volatility inherent to cryptocurrency markets means the BTC price can experience sharp corrections. Therefore, investors should base decisions on their individual risk tolerance and investment horizon, not just short-term momentum. Key considerations include portfolio diversification and having a clear strategy for both potential gains and downturns. Remember, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and the market can change direction quickly based on news or macroeconomic shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bullish BTC Price Trend Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $88,000 marks a pivotal moment, showcasing its resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. The current BTC price rally is supported by a mix of institutional interest, macroeconomic trends, and positive market structure. For the informed participant, this environment presents opportunities but also demands caution. Staying updated with reliable analysis and understanding the underlying fundamentals will be key to navigating the next phase of the market. The journey for Bitcoin continues to be a fascinating one, blending technology, finance, and a new vision for value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does BTC price mean? The BTC price refers to the current market value of one Bitcoin, quoted against a fiat currency like the US Dollar (USD) or a stablecoin like USDT. It is determined by supply and demand on global cryptocurrency exchanges. Why did the BTC price jump above $88,000? The price increase is likely due to a combination of factors including positive institutional inflows, anticipation of the next Bitcoin halving, and broader macroeconomic conditions favoring alternative assets. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment timing depends entirely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. While the trend is positive, Bitcoin remains volatile. It’s generally advised to research thoroughly, consider dollar-cost averaging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Could the BTC price fall after this surge? Yes, price corrections are a normal part of any financial market, especially cryptocurrencies. Profit-taking by traders after a strong rally can lead to short-term pullbacks. Where can I track the live BTC price? You can track the live price on major cryptocurrency data websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, as well as directly on exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. How does the BTC price on Binance USDT market work? The Binance USDT market pairs Bitcoin (BTC) with Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The price shown is how much USDT is needed to buy one BTC, providing a stable quote against dollar value. Found this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

According to Bitcoin World market data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,043.34 on the Binance USDT market. This rally marks a significant milestone, capturing the attention of traders and investors worldwide. But what’s fueling this impressive ascent? Let’s dive into the dynamics behind Bitcoin’s latest price action. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s powerful breakout. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to build a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their offerings, providing a layer of legitimacy and attracting new capital. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value like Bitcoin. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in key markets has also created a sustained inflow of institutional money, applying consistent upward pressure on the BTC price . Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking through the $89,000 resistance is a technically bullish signal. Traders often watch these round-number levels closely. Therefore, a sustained hold above this point could pave the way for a test of even higher thresholds. Market sentiment, as measured by various fear and greed indices, has shifted notably toward optimism. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While the trend is positive, prudent investors monitor key support levels in case of a pullback. For active traders and long-term holders alike, understanding these levels is vital: New Resistance: The $90,000 and $92,000 levels are the next major hurdles for the BTC price . Key Support: A fall below $87,000 might indicate a short-term consolidation phase. Trading Volume: High volume accompanying the rise confirms strong buyer conviction. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? This rally presents both opportunities and reminders. For investors, it reinforces the importance of having a clear strategy. Are you a day trader looking to capitalize on volatility, or a long-term believer in Bitcoin’s underlying technology? Your approach should dictate your actions. Moreover, a rising BTC price often has a ‘halo effect,’ lifting the broader altcoin market. This can create opportunities in other cryptocurrencies, but due diligence is always required. Navigating the Challenges of a Volatile Market Excitement must be tempered with caution. The very volatility that creates profit potential also carries risk. Prices can reverse quickly based on regulatory news, macroeconomic data, or shifts in global liquidity. The key is not to let fear of missing out (FOMO) drive impulsive decisions. Instead, consider dollar-cost averaging or setting clear profit-taking and stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively around the fluctuating BTC price . Conclusion: A Milestone in Bitcoin’s Journey Bitcoin’s climb above $89,000 is more than just a number; it’s a testament to its growing maturity and adoption within the global financial landscape. While short-term fluctuations are guaranteed, this milestone highlights the enduring interest and confidence in the world’s premier cryptocurrency. The journey ahead will likely see both breakthroughs and corrections, but for now, the market is celebrating a decisive victory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the BTC price jump above $89,000? A: The rally is likely driven by a combination of sustained institutional investment via ETFs, positive macroeconomic sentiment, and breaking key technical resistance levels, which triggered further buying. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at this price? A: “Too late” is subjective in crypto markets. While buying at a local high carries risk, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest regularly regardless of price, mitigating timing risk over the long term. Q3: Could the BTC price fall back down quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Profit-taking at new highs is common, which can lead to pullbacks. It’s essential to invest only what you can afford to lose and have a risk management plan. Q4: How does Bitcoin’s price affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A strong rising BTC price generally boosts investor confidence and capital inflow into the sector, benefiting many altcoins. Q5: Where can I safely track the live BTC price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price charts and market data. Q6: What’s the next major target if Bitcoin holds above $89,000? A> The next significant psychological and technical resistance levels are at $90,000 and then the all-time high region. A clean break above $89,000 with strong volume is the first step toward testing those levels. Did you find this analysis of the surging BTC price helpful?

A woman in her 30s now faces prison time after being convicted of laundering over 269 billion won through cryptocurrency transactions. This case highlights the growing challenges regulators face in tracking illicit crypto flows across borders and platforms. What Exactly Happened in This Cryptocurrency Laundering Case? The appeals court delivered a decisive verdict against a South Korean woman accused of orchestrating one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency laundering operations. According to News1 reports, she sold more than 260 billion won worth of cryptocurrency that authorities suspect originated from criminal activities. The scale of this operation demonstrates how cryptocurrency laundering has evolved into sophisticated, high-value criminal enterprises. The defendant reportedly connected with the cryptocurrency source through a group chat, where she was promised substantial commissions for her services. This digital meeting point shows how criminals increasingly use encrypted communication channels to arrange cryptocurrency laundering schemes away from traditional banking oversight. How Did the Cryptocurrency Laundering Operation Work? The mechanics of this cryptocurrency laundering scheme followed a pattern common in digital asset crimes but on an unprecedented scale. After acquiring the suspicious cryptocurrency, the woman executed a multi-layered laundering strategy: Initial Conversion : She sold the cryptocurrency for traditional currency Fragmentation Strategy : The funds were divided into smaller amounts Distribution Network : Money moved to hundreds of different accounts Obfuscation Layer : Multiple transactions masked the money trail This approach to cryptocurrency laundering creates significant challenges for investigators trying to follow the digital paper trail across numerous transactions and accounts. Why Is This Cryptocurrency Laundering Case Significant? This cryptocurrency laundering conviction sends a powerful message about South Korea’s commitment to fighting financial crime in the digital age. The case represents several important developments: First, it demonstrates that authorities are developing the technical expertise to trace complex cryptocurrency laundering operations. Second, the prison sentence establishes that courts take cryptocurrency crimes seriously. Third, the international community watches such cases closely as they set precedents for global cryptocurrency regulation. The sheer volume—269 billion won—makes this one of Asia’s most substantial cryptocurrency laundering cases to reach conviction. This scale indicates that criminal organizations view cryptocurrency as a viable channel for moving enormous sums while attempting to avoid detection. What Challenges Does Cryptocurrency Laundering Present? Cryptocurrency laundering presents unique obstacles for law enforcement and regulators. Unlike traditional banking systems with centralized oversight, cryptocurrency transactions can span multiple jurisdictions and platforms. The pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrency transactions further complicates investigation efforts. However, this case proves that cryptocurrency laundering leaves traces. Blockchain analysis tools have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing investigators to follow transaction patterns despite attempts at obfuscation. The conviction resulted from combining traditional financial investigation techniques with cutting-edge cryptocurrency tracking technology. How Are Governments Responding to Cryptocurrency Laundering? South Korea has implemented stringent cryptocurrency regulations in recent years, including: Real-name verification for cryptocurrency exchanges Enhanced reporting requirements for suspicious transactions International cooperation on cryptocurrency crime investigations Specialized training for financial crime units These measures aim to prevent cryptocurrency laundering while supporting legitimate innovation in the digital asset space. The successful prosecution in this cryptocurrency laundering case validates the effectiveness of these regulatory approaches. What Can We Learn From This Cryptocurrency Laundering Conviction? This cryptocurrency laundering case offers crucial insights for investors, regulators, and the general public. It underscores that cryptocurrency markets, while innovative, are not immune to criminal exploitation. The conviction demonstrates that legal systems worldwide are adapting to address cryptocurrency crimes with appropriate seriousness. For legitimate cryptocurrency users, this case highlights the importance of: Understanding regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction Using reputable, compliant cryptocurrency exchanges Maintaining proper transaction records Reporting suspicious cryptocurrency activities The prison sentence delivers a clear warning that cryptocurrency laundering carries severe consequences, regardless of the technological sophistication employed. Frequently Asked Questions What was the sentence for the cryptocurrency laundering? The appeals court sentenced the South Korean woman to prison, though the specific length wasn’t detailed in initial reports. The conviction itself represents a significant legal outcome in cryptocurrency crime prosecution. How was the cryptocurrency laundering discovered? Authorities likely detected the scheme through financial monitoring systems that flag unusual transaction patterns, combined with blockchain analysis tools that trace cryptocurrency movements across wallets and exchanges. Why is cryptocurrency attractive for money laundering? Cryptocurrency can facilitate cross-border transfers with relative speed and pseudonymity. However, as this case shows, cryptocurrency laundering leaves investigatable trails on public blockchains. What measures prevent cryptocurrency laundering? Preventive measures include Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, transaction monitoring systems, international regulatory cooperation, and blockchain surveillance tools that identify suspicious patterns. How common is cryptocurrency laundering? While exact statistics vary, cryptocurrency represents a small but growing portion of money laundering cases globally. High-profile convictions like this one demonstrate increasing enforcement effectiveness. Can cryptocurrency be completely anonymous? Most cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous rather than anonymous. While wallet addresses don’t directly identify individuals, sophisticated analysis can often connect transactions to real-world identities, especially when funds move to regulated exchanges.

This single transaction, worth a quarter of a billion dollars, is more than just a number on a screen. It represents a significant injection of liquidity and a powerful signal from within the digital asset ecosystem. But what does it actually mean when such a vast amount of stablecoin is created? Let’s dive into the implications of this whale-sized event. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC minted , we refer to the creation of new USDC stablecoin tokens. Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens when demand increases. This typically happens when individuals or institutions deposit US dollars into Circle’s reserve accounts. In return, they receive an equivalent amount of USDC on the blockchain. Therefore, a minting event of this scale strongly suggests that a substantial amount of traditional capital—$250 million worth—is being prepared to enter the crypto markets. Why Would Someone Mint 250 Million USDC? The sheer size points to institutional activity. Retail users don’t move quarters of billions. This USDC minted event likely serves one of several strategic purposes: Providing Liquidity for Trading: Exchanges or large trading firms often mint USDC to ensure sufficient stablecoin liquidity for high-volume trading pairs, facilitating smoother large trades. Preparing for Investment: A venture capital fund or institution may mint USDC to have dry powder ready for deploying into various crypto projects, token purchases, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Facilitating Cross-Border Transactions: Corporations use stablecoins like USDC for fast, global settlements. This mint could back a major international trade or treasury operation. Ultimately, it signals confidence and an expectation of activity. Someone is positioning a significant war chest within the crypto economy. The Ripple Effect: How a Large USDC Mint Impacts the Market Such a substantial USDC minted transaction doesn’t occur in a vacuum. It creates subtle but important ripples across the ecosystem. Primarily, it increases the overall supply of a key stablecoin, which is the lifeblood of crypto trading. More available USDC can lead to increased buying pressure on other assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum if that capital is deployed. Furthermore, it reinforces USDC’s position as a leading dollar-backed stablecoin, showcasing robust demand and institutional trust in its underlying reserves and regulatory compliance. Should Retail Investors Care About USDC Minting? You might wonder if this technical treasury activity matters to the average investor. The answer is yes, but indirectly. While you don’t need to track every mint, large-scale events like this 250 million USDC minted serve as a vital market health indicator. They are a pulse check on institutional sentiment. A flurry of minting activity can precede bullish market movements, as it shows money is poised to enter. Conversely, large-scale redemptions (burning USDC) can signal capital exiting. Therefore, understanding these flows provides context for broader market trends. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The report of 250 million USDC minted is a powerful piece of on-chain intelligence. It cuts through speculation and shows real, measurable action. This event underscores the growing maturity of crypto markets, where institutional players execute sophisticated treasury management strategies using stablecoins. For the observant investor, it’s a reminder to watch not just price charts but also the fundamental flows of capital on the blockchain. These flows often tell the story before the headlines do. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who can mint USDC? A> Only the issuer, Circle, can mint new USDC tokens. They do so upon receiving equivalent U.S. dollar deposits from verified customers into their reserve accounts. Q: Does minting USDC affect its price? A> No. USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Minting new tokens based on dollar deposits ensures the peg remains stable by fully backing the new supply. Q: Is a large USDC mint always bullish for crypto prices? A> Not always, but it is generally seen as a positive signal. It indicates capital is being positioned within the crypto ecosystem, which can lead to increased buying activity for other assets. Q: How can I track USDC minting and burning events? A> You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDC or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which report large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A> Minting is the primary creation of new tokens by the issuer. Buying is acquiring existing USDC tokens from someone else on the secondary market, like an exchange. Found this breakdown of the major USDC minted event helpful?

The Topix index is finishing 2025 with a 23% rally, despite taking hits from trade tariffs, two Bank of Japan rate hikes, and a full change in political leadership. This year’s rally has already pushed Japan past the S&P 500 in relative performance for the first time since 2022. Takaichi’s administration is funneling trillions of yen into domestic programs, with traders eyeing upside in infrastructure, construction, and energy names. Robot manufacturers are also getting attention, as the tech spotlight turns away from virtual AI toward robotics and hardware. Banks, which already had a strong 2025 due to higher interest rates, are expected to build on their gains. Takaichi’s cabinet approves ¥112 trillion fiscal package Takaichi’s fiscal package, unveiled in November, includes ¥18 trillion, or about $115 billion, in additional stimulus focused on 17 government-backed sectors, such as nuclear fusion and quantum computing. On top of the stimulus, the government approved a record ¥112 trillion ($785 billion) budget for the next fiscal year. While that’s expected to help hold up consumer spending, it also increases the strain on the country’s massive public debt. But the focus in the markets is on the cash hitting the real economy. Japan’s policymakers are using this funding to try and take the lead in technologies that are still up for grabs globally. Inflation numbers coming out of Tokyo are giving the BOJ more cover to tighten policy. The core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food, rose 2.3% in December. That’s down from 2.8% in November and also lower than economists expected. A second inflation gauge, the one the BOJ tracks most closely, removing both fuel and food, showed a 2.6% increase in December. That also eased from the prior month. The BOJ’s next policy meeting is scheduled for January 22–23, where members will update their growth and inflation projections. Just last week, the bank raised its main interest rate to 0.75%, the highest in 30 years. Ueda Kazuo, the bank’s governor, told reporters on Thursday that they are seeing “steady progress” in trying to meet the 2% inflation goal, with wage growth now backing that effort. “We’re making steady progress in durably achieving our price target,” Ueda said. Weaker yen benefits exporters while risks build at the edge The yen is finishing 2025 much weaker than predicted, giving a big lift to exporters like car companies and commodity traders. As of December 25, the yen has only climbed less than 1% against the dollar year-to-date. This is giving companies that sell abroad higher profits when their dollars come back home. Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust, said the yen is likely to stay around the 150–160 range in 2026. “The BOJ’s hikes don’t really impact the yen, as the market has already priced in two hikes a year,” he said. That view has been widely echoed among large-cap investors, who expect export-heavy sectors to keep beating the broader market next year. But not everyone is optimistic. Rie Nishihara, a strategist at JPMorgan , warned that if the yen slips too far, the boost turns into a threat. “Excessive yen depreciation” could hurt real income growth, she said, adding that 165 per dollar is the red line where it starts causing damage.

Osaka Prefecture has launched a public-private consortium that will experiment with AI Agents designed to provide clerical support and multilingual services. The prefecture will pool expertise from a consortium, which includes Google Cloud Japan, telecom provider NTT West, Microsoft Japan, and Osaka Metropolitan University. The trial will assess whether AI can streamline administrative processes accurately and independently under predefined rules. Osaka governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said the initiative moves to create “a society that is more convenient and prosperous.” In Silicon Valley AI agents are a technology to be scaled, but in Japan, the main concern is minimizing chaos through standardization. Japan’s AI agent boom Osaka prefecture’s new consortium follows a host of major household companies that are starting to embrace AI agents. Itochu Corporation, one of Japan’s largest food and drink manufacturers, and automaker Mazda are testing AI agents in autonomous payments, internal audits, as well as customer service. Japanese software testing firm SHIFT and data analytics firm TDSE are also exploring a payment ecosystem powered by autonomous AI agents. TDSE said its proof of concept seeks to initiate transactions, verify requirements, and coordinate with other systems to execute settlement without direct human intervention. In fact, a recent industry survey found that 35% of Japanese companies have already adopted AI agents in some form and 44% plan to adopt them. Japan’s corporate ambitions to develop AI agents is a largely reactionary and ‘defensive’ measure. It represents an economic acceptance of autonomous AI as a productivity tool amid a labor shortage, rural depopulation, and waning tolerance towards foreigners. Innovation hotbed? Think again. Japan isn’t trying to win a race for the biggest AI agent models. It’s taking a slower, deliberate, and more risk averse path. Tokyo-based provider of accounting software, Rakus isn’t convinced that AI can be left to do everything. Chatbots have emerged as the latest sales and customer facing tools in big tech and fintech. But the current capabilities of back-end chatbots hasn’t made life easier, according to Shinichiro Motomatsu, the company’s director and chief AI officer. “If you were to try and handle expense reimbursements entirely through a chatbot workflow it would probably turn into a hellish experience,” said Motomatsu. Their main worry is adopting a system that increases operational burdens on teams which are already at capacity. Accountability grey zone Japan wants to implement AI agents safely inside real organizations. The focus is on minimizing mistakes so as not to undermine trust. According to Rakus’s chief AI office, Japan’s approach is not a failure of imagination but a deliberate response to how organizations really work. “At each stage you need to evaluate whether the technology is genuinely helping users. If it isn’t, we shouldn’t hesitate to pull back,’” said Motomatsu. Motomatsu said that AI agents should be treated as goal driven tools as opposed to a stand alone technological goal. He believes it’s far more realistic for AI agents to serve as partially autonomous actors since accountability is a major grey area. “If something goes wrong, you can’t just simply explain that AI decided it,” said Motomatsu. “Someone in the organization must be able to take responsibility for the outcome.” Human-centric AI agents Rakus’s chief AI officer stresses that AI doesn’t eliminate the need for well designed workflows as well as checks and balances. He argues their real value lies in playing a supporting role, rather than replacing structures that make organizations function. “AI agents are not magic. They won’t eliminate the need for rules, processes, or human judgement,” said Motomatsu. Osaka prefecture’s push to adopt AI agents reflects a governance first approach taking roots across corporate Japan. It plans to formulate practical guidelines that can be replicated by local governments across Japan by the end of fiscal 2026. The prefecture aims to produce a framework that outlines clear rules regarding what AI agents are allowed to do, how their actions are monitored, and when human intervention is needed. There are also gains beyond efficiency. Hitachi’s chief AI transformation officer, Jun Yoshida suggests that AI agents can take over repetitive tasks making way for cognitive space. “If AI simply allows us to do even more work at a faster pace, that’s not necessarily progress,” he said. “What matters is how people use the space that opens up.” He describes this as “white space” which he argues can become a source of innovation, reflection and decision making. Japan is designing AI agents that address corporate problems, not showcase technological development. In a business culture that traditionally prioritize control and standardization, companies are wary of systems that obscure human judgment in mission-critical processes.

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a significant injection of liquidity that signals major activity in the digital asset space. For anyone tracking market sentiment and capital flows, understanding why this happens is crucial. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC was minted , it means new USDC stablecoin tokens were created and issued into circulation. Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens when there is sufficient demand, typically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars held in reserve. Therefore, a mint of this scale—250 million dollars’ worth—points directly to substantial incoming capital or anticipated demand within the crypto ecosystem. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? Such a large-scale mint doesn’t happen without reason. It often precedes major moves by institutional players or large trading firms, commonly called ‘whales.’ Here are the most likely scenarios behind this event: Institutional Entry: A large entity is preparing to move significant capital into cryptocurrencies. USDC offers a stable on-ramp before purchasing assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. DeFi and Trading Activity: The capital could be destined for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, yield farming, or providing liquidity, which often requires stablecoins. Market Making and Liquidity: Exchanges or market makers may need to bolster their USDC reserves to ensure smooth trading pairs and sufficient liquidity for users. Essentially, this mint acts as a precursor to action. It shows confidence and preparation for significant financial activity on the blockchain. How Does a USDC Mint Impact the Broader Market? The immediate effect of 250 million USDC being minted is an increase in available stablecoin liquidity. However, the real impact depends on what happens next. If this capital flows into Bitcoin or Ethereum, it can create buying pressure and potentially influence prices. Conversely, if it remains parked in stablecoins or moves into DeFi, it signals a focus on yield and ecosystem growth rather than direct speculation. For everyday investors, monitoring these mints provides a valuable, real-time indicator of institutional sentiment. A surge in minting can suggest that sophisticated players are gearing up for a bullish move or securing positions in a volatile market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Don’t just watch the event; understand its context. Track where the funds go using blockchain explorers. Is the USDC that was minted moving to a central exchange like Coinbase? Is it being deposited into a Compound or Aave smart contract? This follow-through data is more telling than the mint itself. Remember, while a large mint is notable, it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Always combine this data with broader market trends, news, and technical analysis before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The minting of 250 million USDC is a powerful signal of institutional movement and liquidity preparation within crypto markets. It underscores the growing role of stablecoins like USDC as the essential plumbing for the digital economy. By paying attention to these on-chain events, you gain a clearer window into the strategies of major market participants, allowing you to make more informed decisions in your own crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who exactly mints USDC? A1: USDC is minted by Circle, the regulated financial company that issues the stablecoin, through its USDC Treasury. The process is permissioned and requires compliance with financial regulations. Q2: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? A2: No, it does not cause monetary inflation. Each new USDC token is supposed to be backed 1:1 by a corresponding US dollar held in reserve, making it a fully collateralized stablecoin. Q3: How can I track where the minted USDC goes? A3: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan. By looking up the transaction hash from the Whale Alert report or the treasury address, you can follow subsequent transfers to exchanges or DeFi protocols. Q4: Is a large USDC mint always a bullish sign? A4: Not always. While it often indicates incoming capital, it can also be for risk management or to meet redemption demands. The key is to observe the subsequent flow of the funds. Q5: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A5: “Minting” refers to the creation of new tokens by the issuer. “Buying” USDC is what users do on an exchange after those tokens are in circulation. A large mint supplies the tokens that are then bought. Q6: Can anyone mint USDC? A6: No. Only Circle and its licensed partners can mint and redeem USDC directly, following strict know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.

Daily trading volume is looking pretty strong at $24.3 billion and the world’s biggest cryptocurrency is still sitting pretty at top spot in market capitalisation, valued at roughly $1.78 trillion. There’s 19.97 million Bitcoin in circulation out of a total supply of 21 million. Despite the bounce, overall market mood is still pretty cautious. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is stuck at 27, firmly in ‘fear’ territory, and the Altcoin Season Index is down to 16, which means Bitcoin Season is well and truly in the driving seat. It’s clear that everyone is playing it safe, focusing on just a few choice assets and keeping a tight rein on risk. Market Sentiment is all About Bitcoin Over Altcoins The overall crypto market cap is sitting at $2.99 trillion and daily volume is around $73 billion. Ethereum (ETH) is trading round $2,970, while Solana (SOL) is just nudging over $123 – not exactly a glowing endorsement of the altcoins. It looks like everyone’s still spooked by Bitcoin’s relative strength. Just a few key indicators show how the market is feeling: Bitcoin’s dominance is still pretty high because loads of people are avoiding the high-risk assets. Historically, when investors are feeling genuinely fearful it’s a great chance to start buying up some stocks. Institutional investors and all those fancy ETFs remain convinced that the smart money should be on BTC. That explains why, at the moment, Bitcoin is just cruising along while the altcoins are really struggling to get any momentum. Bitcoin Technical Chart is Sort of Looking The Business On the 4 hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction has stabilised at around $89,200 after bouncing back from that mid-December low of $83,800. The price action is currently playing out within a pretty well-defined descending channel from the $94,600 peak, but you can see that momentum is definitely starting to come back. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin has also reclaimed the $88,000 to $88,600 pivot zone, where the 50-EMA is at $88,000 and the 100-EMA is at $88,600 – and now that zone is actually helping to prop the price up. That’s a nice technical sign. The recent candle patterns are looking pretty solid, with solid green closes followed by a bit of a consolidation afterwards – that suggests people are genuinely interested in buying, not just panicking out of a short squeeze. That makes the chart start to look a bit like a descending triangle – there are higher intraday lows and the RSI is back up at about 60. And, you know, there’s no obvious bearish divergence to upset the applecart. Overall momentum is coming back without getting too carried away, and there’s no obvious bearish divergences to knock that recovery. Key Levels and What’s Next If we look at TradingView’s predictions, a confirmed break above $90,500 would suddenly open up some very promising prospects: $92,650 as the next major resistance Even a retest of $94,600 might be in the cards, where the sellers last took control But if you do get a failure to hold $88,000, that could trigger a bit of a pullback towards $86,300, with another opportunity to buy in again near $83,800. Right now, the technical outlook is suggesting that it could be a good time to buy – let’s keep our eye out for a clean break above $88,000 – that would really give the crypto market a bit of a confidence boost. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.39 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012112 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

To make matters worse, that difference is the biggest miss since 2018, and Beijing’s decision came right after the offshore yuan dipped below ¥7 per dollar on Thursday for the first time since September 2024. Naturally, that freaked out a few folks in Beijing who’ve been pushing for a stronger yuan to please trading partners, but not so strong that foreign money floods in like crazy. On the same day, the National Bureau of Statistics dropped another number: China’s economy in 2024 was worth 134.8 trillion yuan ($19.23 trillion). That’s ¥101.8 billion lower than their earlier figure. It’s not great timing. Back in July, officials had said the economy would top ¥140 trillion in 2025. China was forced to react when offshore yuan gained surprising strength Even though the fix was set weaker than market estimates, it was still higher than the previous day’s fix. At the same time, the offshore yuan is around ¥7.0024 as of press time, showing strength from the past week’s trading sessions. Meanwhile, analysts from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are betting that the yuan will push well past ¥7 per dollar in 2026. Inside China, local economists and even ex-central bank officials have started pushing for a stronger currency too. Their logic is a firmer yuan helps move the economy away from its dependence on exports and eases up on trade fights with other countries. But China ’s central bank doesn’t seem interested in making any fast decisions, as even Wall Street traders have noticed that state-owned banks have been buying dollars here and there to cool things down. That, along with this unexpected fix, looks like an effort to stop speculators from getting too confident. A research note from China Minsheng Bank said that the yuan could get a bit of support early next year thanks to seasonal foreign exchange flows, and analysts Wen Bin and Li Xin said the central bank’s strategy is clearly set up to keep gains modest. With the U.S. dollar not falling as quickly, the analysts expect the yuan to stay under ¥6.9 per dollar for now. Get seen where it counts.

With market sentiment shifting and new projects emerging, timing and early access are becoming critical for strategic investors. In the evolving landscape of digital assets, established names like Litecoin and Tron show resilience and utility, while projects like APEMARS present rare early‑stage entry points investors can’t ignore. Litecoin and Tron have captured attention with robust networks and steady adoption, even amid market pressures. But for those seeking explosive upside with structured early access, the best altcoin picks include not just established tokens but also emerging opportunities like APEMARS ($APRZ). Its live whitelist presents a chance to secure allocation before wider exposure, combining community growth with powerful reward mechanics. APEMARS: Claim Early Access Before the Next Altcoin Breakout APEMARS ($APRZ) represents one of the most compelling opportunities for early‑stage participation in the altcoin space. Designed to reward long‑term engagement, it blends utility and community focus with a strategic upcoming crypto presale structure. Whitelist access is the key entry point. With the whitelist now live, early participants can position themselves for Stage 1 access, the lowest-price window of the entire presale, and Stage 1 only lasts one week before the price steps up and token allocation per dollar shrinks. For anyone aiming to capture the earliest upside runway, the whitelist is where that positioning begins. Two standout features distinguish APEMARS from typical token launches: 63% APY staking, which enables investors to earn significant passive yield on held tokens, and an integrated referral system that rewards community growth by incentivizing participants who introduce new holders. This combination doesn’t just add perks; it creates dynamic participation pathways that turn simple token holding into an interactive, growth‑driven experience. The staking mechanism allows early supporters to compound rewards, while the referral program effectively multiplies network effects, rewarding both referrers and referees as APEMARS grows. With the whitelist live, you’re getting insider access to strong utility before public market pricing locks in. 3000x Gains Potential: APEMARS Stage 1 Investment Scenario APEMARS launched Stage 1 tokens at $0.00001699 with a projected listing price of $0.0055, a price that implies up to 32,269% ROI if the project follows through on roadmap expectations. That means potential 3000x‑plus gains for early entry participants. If you invest $1,500 at Stage 1, you would receive approximately 88.3 million $APRZ tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.0055, that position could surge to approximately $485,000, not including staking rewards or referral bonuses, potentially transforming early faith into extraordinary returns. With the APEMARS whitelist open for a limited time and presale stages coming soon (and often closing early), acting now ensures access to the most favorable entry point before prices rise further. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the APEMARS whitelist is easy and takes minutes. Simply visit the official APEMARS website, head to the “Whitelist Now” section, enter your email, and submit. You’ll receive a confirmation email; verify it to secure your Stage 1 allocation. Join the whitelist today to grab $APRZ at Stage 1 pricing! Litecoin: Steady Network Strength Meets Ongoing Development Legacy in Motion: Litecoin’s Position in a Changing Market ATH: $413 | ATL: $1.15 Litecoin remains one of the enduring names in the altcoin world. Built as a lighter, faster alternative to Bitcoin, it has attracted steady adoption over time. According to recent market coverage, sentiment around Litecoin continues to evolve as developers focus on broader ecosystem integration and user‑friendly enhancements. This resilience through market cycles highlights why Litecoin is considered among the best altcoin picks for diversified, long‑term portfolios. While Litecoin doesn’t offer a presale gap like APEMARS, its proven track record and ongoing development efforts offer context for why early access opportunities, like APEMARS’s live whitelist, are so compelling. Participants in the APEMARS upcoming presale can capture a structured, early‑stage position while traditional altcoins like Litecoin continue to demonstrate utility and stability. Tron: Resilient Network with DeFi and Stablecoin Momentum Tron Continues to Impress with Activity and DeFi Integration ATH: $0.17 | ATL: $0.001 According to the best crypto to buy now , Tron has maintained strong on‑chain activity, driven by stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance integrations. Recent market reports highlight that Tron’s network remains a hub for stablecoin transfers, DApps, and cross‑chain engagement, underscoring its role as a practical altcoin in heavy use. Such sustained network engagement reinforces Tron’s utility and relevance despite broader market volatility. For investors weighing the best altcoin picks, Tron exemplifies a project with mature use cases and ecosystem depth. Yet, even as Tron delivers on real‑world utility, upcoming presales like APEMARS offer an additional dimension, structured access with growth incentives that traditional networks don’t typically provide. Conclusion: Finding the best altcoin picks in a Dynamic Market APEMARS, Litecoin, and Tron each offer unique perspectives on what investors consider worthwhile in the altcoin space. Litecoin brings a legacy of performance and adoption; Tron showcases ecosystem resilience and utility; APEMARS delivers structured early‑stage access with a live whitelist and growth mechanics designed for participation and reward. For those exploring the best crypto to join now, APEMARS combines early entry, staking rewards, referral incentives, and Stage 1 scarcity, features that add up to a persuasive case for early involvement. While established altcoins like Litecoin and Tron continue delivering network utility, early positioning through APEMARS’s live whitelist could capture growth that traditional exposure alone cannot. Don’t wait, the APEMARS whitelist is live and moving fast.

56374206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254337,1766718911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive BTC Short Squeeze Obliterates $116M in Crypto Futures,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-short-squeeze-futures-liquidations/,"BitcoinWorld Explosive BTC Short Squeeze Obliterates $116M in Crypto Futures The cryptocurrency market just experienced a classic and powerful squeeze play. A fierce BTC short squeeze erupted over a 24-hour period, violently reversing bearish bets and triggering a staggering $116 million in forced liquidations across perpetual futures markets. This event serves as a stark reminder of the high-stakes, leveraged nature of crypto trading. What Exactly Was This BTC Short Squeeze? Simply put, a short squeeze occurs when an asset’s price rises rapidly. Traders who had borrowed and sold Bitcoin, betting its price would fall (short sellers), are forced to buy it back to close their positions and limit losses. This wave of buying fuels further price increases, creating a feedback loop that squeezes more short sellers out of the market. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price acted as the catalyst for this domino effect. The $116M Liquidation Breakdown: Who Got Hit? The data reveals a clear narrative of pain concentrated on specific assets and trade directions. Let’s break down the numbers: Bitcoin (BTC): The epicenter. A massive $75.68 million was liquidated, with a overwhelming 75.95% coming from short positions. This confirms the BTC short squeeze was the primary driver. Ethereum (ETH): Saw $29.66 million in liquidations. Interestingly, here long positions (bets on price increases) made up 52.48% of the losses, suggesting a mixed or corrective move for ETH. Solana (SOL): Experienced $10.75 million in liquidations, with a crushing 82.5% from long positions. This indicates SOL’s price movement may have disappointed bullish traders during this period. Why Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Matter? Forced liquidations are not just numbers on a screen; they have real market impacts. Firstly, they can amplify price volatility. The cascade of automatic sell orders from long liquidations (or buy orders from short liquidations) can push prices further in their current direction. Secondly, they represent significant capital being wiped from the market, which can affect trader sentiment and liquidity. Understanding these events is crucial for assessing market health and risk. How Can Traders Navigate Such Volatility? While squeezes and liquidations are inherent risks, traders can adopt strategies to manage exposure. Using sensible leverage, setting stop-loss orders (while being aware of potential slippage), and diversifying beyond highly correlated assets are fundamental practices. Moreover, monitoring aggregate liquidation levels across exchanges can provide early warning signs of excessive leverage building up in the market, potentially foreshadowing a sharp move. The Bottom Line on the Market Shakeout The recent BTC short squeeze and its accompanying liquidation wave delivered a brutal lesson in market mechanics. It highlighted the dangers of over-leverage, especially during periods of low liquidity or ahead of major price catalysts. For the broader market, such events can help reset excessive speculation, creating a healthier foundation. However, they also underscore the need for robust risk management for every participant, from retail traders to institutions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What causes a short squeeze in crypto? A: A short squeeze is caused by a rapid price increase in an asset. This forces traders who bet on a price drop (short sellers) to buy back the asset to close their losing positions, which drives the price up even further. Q: Are liquidations bad for the crypto market? A: They have mixed effects. While they cause losses for specific traders and increase short-term volatility, liquidations can also flush out excessive leverage and over-speculation, which may lead to a more stable market afterward. Q: How can I avoid getting liquidated? A> To avoid liquidation, use lower leverage, fund your margin account sufficiently, set prudent stop-loss orders, and avoid putting all your capital into a single, highly leveraged trade. Q: Did this event only affect Bitcoin? A: No. While the BTC short squeeze was the main event, it caused ripples across the market. Major altcoins like Ethereum and Solana also saw significant liquidations, though the bias (long vs. short) differed based on their individual price action. Q: Where can I track futures liquidation data? A> Several crypto analytics websites like Coinglass, Bybit, and Binance provide real-time and historical data on futures market liquidations across various exchanges. Q: Is a short squeeze always followed by a price drop? A> Not necessarily. While a squeeze can exhaust buying pressure and lead to a pullback, the subsequent price direction depends on broader market fundamentals, sentiment, and new catalysts. It doesn’t guarantee an immediate reversal. Found this breakdown of the explosive BTC short squeeze helpful?

With several Asia Pacific exchanges shut for the holiday, investors took cues from the last full session, when MSCI’s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.35%. Crypto traders framed the quieter tape as a liquidity story as much as a macro one. Gabriel Selby, head of research at CF Benchmarks, said Bitcoin remained pinned under a key level as markets drift into the seasonal lull. “Bitcoin has struggled to break above the $90k level during a busy schedule of macroeconomic data releases, and price action appears to be forming a bearish wedge with downside risk,” he said. “As we head into the holiday period, trading volumes are following their usual seasonal lull, which typically reinforces the choppy, high-resistance environment currently observed.” Market snapshot Bitcoin : $89,127, up 1.5% Ether : $2,965, up 0.6% XRP : $1.87, up 0.00% Total crypto market cap: $3.07 trillion, up 0.9% Wall Street Records Fuel Year-End Risk Appetite Wall Street’s late-week run kept the mood constructive. The Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record highs on Wednesday in a holiday-shortened session, with the Dow up 0.60% and the S&P 500 up 0.32%. Silver rose to a record and gold traded near an all-time high https://t.co/3PXxMDYg4W — Bloomberg (@business) December 25, 2025 That same rally fed the seasonal narrative traders keep calling the Santa Claus rally, a window that often draws positioning flows into the final sessions of the year. In commodities, silver continued to shine after pushing deeper into uncharted territory earlier in the week. Spot silver rose to an all-time high of $74.89 on Friday, driven by strong industrial demand and a supply deficit that has left the market tighter than traders expected. Defensive Trades Boost Gold And Silver Analysts tied the move to heavy usage in solar panels, electric vehicles and data centres, while mine supply struggled to keep up, and the metal also drew fresh safe haven demand as geopolitical risks flared. Gold tracked the same flight to hedges, trading around $4,480 an ounce after setting a record above $4,500, with traders still pricing in a friendlier rate outlook next year. Geopolitics kept the backdrop tense, with Washington’s pressure on Venezuelan oil flows feeding a wider bid for defensive assets.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced its pivotal support for the Frax Share (FXS) token swap and rebrand to Frax (FRAX). This move is a significant endorsement of the Frax Finance ecosystem’s evolution. If you hold FXS tokens on Binance, understanding the timeline and process for this FXS token swap is absolutely critical to managing your assets smoothly. What is the Binance FXS Token Swap All About? In simple terms, Frax Finance is upgrading and consolidating its token system. The existing FXS token, which represents governance and utility within the Frax protocol, is being rebranded and migrated to a new token called FRAX. This isn’t a typical fork or airdrop; it’s a direct, one-to-one replacement. Binance’s involvement means they will handle the technical complexities for users holding FXS on their platform, making the transition seamless for millions. Your Action Plan: Critical Dates for the Swap To ensure you don’t face any trading interruptions, mark these key dates in your calendar. Binance has provided a clear schedule for the FXS token swap process. January 13, 3:00 a.m. UTC: All existing FXS spot trading pairs (like FXS/USDT) will be delisted and trading will stop. January 13, 3:30 a.m. UTC: Deposits and withdrawals for the old FXS token will be suspended. Do not send FXS to Binance after this time. January 15, 7:00 a.m. UTC: Deposits for the new FRAX token will open. January 15, 8:00 a.m. UTC: Trading for the new FRAX/USDT spot trading pair will officially launch. The most important detail? All existing FXS balances on Binance will be automatically migrated to FRAX at a 1:1 ratio . You don’t need to manually request the FXS token swap ; Binance will do it for you. Why is This FRAX Rebrand a Big Deal for Crypto? This move is more than just a name change. It represents Frax Finance’s ambition to streamline its identity and strengthen its position in the competitive stablecoin market. FRAX aims to be a more recognizable and unified brand, potentially improving its liquidity and integration across decentralized and centralized finance platforms. Binance’s support lends immense credibility and ensures massive, immediate liquidity for the new token from day one of trading. What Should You Do Next? For Binance users, the process is largely hands-off. However, here are some proactive steps for peace of mind: Stop FXS Trading Before Deadline: Conclude any FXS trades well before the delisting time on January 13th. Do Not Deposit FXS: Avoid depositing FXS tokens to Binance once withdrawals are suspended on the 13th to prevent loss. Verify Your Balance: After the migration is complete around January 15th, log in to your Binance account to confirm your new FRAX balance. Explore the New Pair: With the launch of FRAX/USDT, assess the new trading dynamics and market sentiment. Conclusion: A Seamless Transition Backed by a Giant The FXS token swap to FRAX, facilitated by Binance, is a textbook example of how major exchanges can enable smooth ecosystem upgrades. By managing the technical migration, Binance removes significant risk and friction for the average holder. This collaboration highlights the growing synergy between innovative DeFi protocols and centralized exchanges, ultimately creating a more robust infrastructure for all cryptocurrency participants. The successful execution of this swap could set a precedent for future token migrations and rebrands within the industry. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Do I need to do anything to swap my FXS for FRAX on Binance? A: No. If your FXS tokens are in your Binance spot wallet, the exchange will automatically convert them to FRAX at the 1:1 ratio. No manual action is required. Q2: What happens if I send FXS to my Binance deposit address after January 13th? A: Do not do this. Deposits will be suspended, and you may permanently lose those tokens. Only deposit the new FRAX token after its deposit window opens on January 15th. Q3: Will the value of my holdings change after the swap? A: The number of tokens changes 1:1, but the market will determine the new price of FRAX. The value of your holding in USD terms will depend on FRAX’s market price post-launch. Q4: I hold FXS in my own private wallet (like MetaMask). What should I do? A: This Binance process is for tokens on their exchange. You must follow the official migration instructions provided by the Frax Finance team for tokens held in self-custody wallets. Check their official website and social channels for guidance. Q5: Will there be a new contract address for FRAX? A: Yes, the new FRAX token will have a new smart contract address. Always verify the official contract address from Frax Finance’s official channels before interacting with it on-chain. Q6: Can I trade FRAX immediately after the migration? A: Trading for the FRAX/USDT pair will begin at 8:00 a.m. UTC on January 15th, shortly after deposits open. You cannot trade it before this specified time.

The community rejected a plan to absorb the intellectual property and equity of its core developer, Aave Labs. This rejection highlights the ongoing tension between foundational development teams and the decentralized autonomous organizations they serve. Let’s break down what this Aave DAO proposal entailed and why it failed. What Was the Controversial Aave DAO Proposal? The Aave DAO proposal was a significant governance vote with two main objectives. First, it sought to formally absorb Aave Labs’ intellectual property and equity, making the developer a subsidiary of the DAO. Second, it included a clause requiring Aave Labs to transfer all profits generated from the Aave brand to the DAO treasury. This measure was introduced following community allegations that Aave Labs was privately collecting swap fees from Aave’s interface on CowSwap, a decentralized exchange aggregator. Why Did the Aave Community Vote No? The proposal ultimately failed, with 55.29% of votes cast against it. This outcome wasn’t arbitrary. Several key concerns likely influenced the community’s decision: Operational Complexity: Absorbing a full development team and its assets creates immense legal and operational burdens for a DAO. Innovation Risk: There were fears that making Aave Labs a subsidiary could stifle its agility and innovative capacity. Precedent Setting: The move could set a risky precedent for how DAOs interact with their founding entities, potentially leading to centralized control. Trust Deficit: The proposal arose from allegations of fee appropriation, indicating a trust issue that a forced merger wouldn’t necessarily solve. Therefore, the community chose to maintain a more arm’s-length, service-provider relationship with Aave Labs. What Are the Broader Implications for DeFi Governance? This vote is more than an internal Aave matter. It’s a landmark case study in DAO governance . The rejection signals that token holders are thinking critically about long-term structure, not just short-term revenue. It underscores a mature understanding that simply centralizing assets isn’t always the best path for a decentralized project. The decision preserves Aave Labs’ independence to innovate while keeping the DAO’s treasury and governance focused on protocol incentives and ecosystem growth. This balance is crucial for sustainable development in the DeFi space. What’s Next for Aave After This Proposal? So, where does Aave go from here? The failure of this Aave DAO proposal doesn’t mean the underlying issues vanish. The community and Aave Labs must now address the trust concerns transparently. Future proposals may focus on creating clearer, more equitable revenue-sharing agreements for front-end interfaces. Furthermore, this event will likely lead to more rigorous proposal frameworks and discussions about the legal boundaries between DAOs and their service providers. The path forward requires rebuilding alignment without resorting to a full absorption. In conclusion, the rejection of this Aave DAO proposal is a powerful testament to the community’s vigilance. It demonstrates a preference for sustainable, decentralized governance over a quick fix that could centralize control. The Aave ecosystem has affirmed that its strength lies in collaborative checks and balances, not in vertical integration. This decision sets a prudent precedent for other DeFi projects navigating the complex relationship between developers and decentralized communities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly was the Aave DAO proposal about? A1: The proposal aimed to have the Aave DAO absorb the intellectual property and equity of Aave Labs, its development company, and make it a subsidiary. It also required Aave Labs to send all Aave-brand profits to the DAO treasury. Q2: Why did the proposal fail? A2: It failed because 55.29% of voting participants voted against it. Concerns included added complexity, potential harm to innovation, and setting a poor governance precedent. Q3: What sparked this proposal in the first place? A3: It was introduced after allegations surfaced that Aave Labs was privately collecting swap fees generated through Aave’s interface on the CowSwap platform. Q4: Does this mean Aave Labs is acting against the DAO? A4: Not necessarily. The proposal and its failure highlight a governance dispute and a need for clearer agreements, not necessarily malicious action. The community voted to maintain a separate but aligned relationship. Q5: What does this mean for Aave token holders? A5: It shows the DAO is actively engaged in complex governance and is willing to reject proposals it deems risky. It maintains the current development structure, which the majority believes is more beneficial for long-term growth. Q6: Will there be another similar proposal? A6> While possible, the decisive rejection makes an identical proposal unlikely. Future discussions will probably focus on specific revenue-sharing terms rather than full absorption.

56374796,648612,1766719828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56374796.jpeg,Why You Should Pay Attention To XRP’s Exchange Netflows This Month,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-exchange-netflows-this-month/,"XRP’s price has spent recent weeks moving without a clear directional breakout. The price action has been mostly bearish, but activity beneath the surface is telling a more interesting story. On-chain data shows XRP leaving Binance at a rapid pace, pushing the exchange’s reserves down to around 2.66 billion XRP, the lowest level recorded this year . This movement has garnered the interest of market participants because it is not reflective of the current price action of XRP. Insights from market commentator Stellar Rippler on X help explain why investors should pay attention to the netflows. XRP Leaving Binance Means Positioning, Not Panic Exchange netflows often give a clearer picture of market intent than short-term price movements. When reserves drop consistently, it usually reflects strategic decisions by holders. This month, XRP’s netflows are flashing signals that are worth watching closely. The steady decline in Binance’s XRP reserves points to deliberate withdrawals instead of emotional reactions. According to commentary shared on X by Stellar Rippler, this type of movement does not correspond with retail panic selling. Retail-based fear typically shows up as sudden deposits to exchanges as traders rush to exit positions. What the data shows instead is a controlled and sustained reduction in available exchange liquidity. This pattern points to holders choosing custody outside exchanges, a behavior commonly associated with long-term allocations. Crypto history has shown that prolonged exchange outflows often occur when investors are confident in long-term demand , not when they anticipate a prolonged downward price action. You don’t drain liquidity before bad news. In this context, XRP’s exchange netflows suggest preparation, not speculation. Why Falling Binance Reserves Matter For Market Structure Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, meaning its XRP reserves represent the most readily available supply for a large portion of active traders. As more and more XRP continues to leave the exchange, the amount of XRP immediately available for spot trading keeps shrinking, gradually tightening liquidity even though the price has not reacted yet. Speaking of price not reacting, XRP’s price action has struggled over the past few weeks, repeatedly failing to hold above the $2.00 price level and spending most of the period trading lower around the $1.80 to $1.95 range. Despite this, the data shows that the weak price performance is largely due to broader market outflows across every crypto, not a surge in XRP-specific selling. The outflows in XRP exchange reserves are more meaningful when viewed alongside the steady inflows into Spot XRP ETFs, which are yet to record a day of net outflows since their launch. Those ETF inflows suggest institutional demand is increasing under the surface, even though it has so far been outweighed by capital leaving the wider crypto market.",XRP|binance|ripple|Spot XRP ETFs|Stellar Rippler|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-26 03:30:28

This decision by the third-largest U.S. exchange provides new opportunities for traders and signals a shifting competitive landscape. The announcement, made on December 23rd, means users can now trade and securely store BNB on Gemini’s regulated platform. Why Did Gemini Add BNB Now? Gemini’s decision to support BNB trading and custody comes at a pivotal time. The exchange is strategically expanding its asset offerings to meet growing investor demand. While Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, still does not list BNB, its competitor Kraken began offering the token earlier this year. Therefore, Gemini’s move positions it as a more comprehensive platform for traders seeking access to major cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This development highlights the intense competition among top U.S. exchanges. By adding BNB, Gemini directly challenges its rivals and caters to a segment of the market eager for Binance’s native token. The move could attract new users and increase trading volume on the platform. What Does This Mean for BNB and Investors? For the BNB ecosystem, gaining support from a major regulated U.S. exchange like Gemini is a vote of confidence. It enhances the token’s legitimacy and accessibility for American investors. Users now have a new, compliant on-ramp to acquire and hold BNB. For investors, the benefits are clear: Regulated Access: Trade BNB on a platform known for its regulatory compliance and security standards. Integrated Custody: Store BNB alongside other cryptocurrencies in Gemini’s insured custodial wallet. Simplified Portfolio Management: Manage a diverse crypto portfolio from a single, trusted interface. How Does This Change the U.S. Exchange Landscape? The race to list popular assets is a key battleground for crypto exchanges. Gemini adds BNB to its roster, creating a clear point of differentiation. Kraken listed BNB in April and added custody in July. Coinbase’s continued absence is notable, with industry observers often linking it to the direct competition between Coinbase and Binance globally. This three-way dynamic creates distinct choices for users. Gemini and Kraken now offer BNB services, while Coinbase does not. Consequently, traders who want exposure to BNB within a U.S.-regulated environment have two strong options. This competition ultimately benefits users through better services and more asset choices. What Are the Potential Challenges? While the listing is positive, it’s not without considerations. BNB remains closely tied to the Binance ecosystem, which has faced significant regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Gemini, known for its proactive regulatory approach, must ensure its implementation of BNB services meets all compliance standards. Furthermore, the token’s performance is still influenced by Binance’s fortunes, adding a layer of external risk for investors. Conclusion: A Calculated Step Forward Gemini’s support for BNB trading and custody is a calculated and strategic expansion. It fills a gap in the U.S. market, provides investors with more choice, and intensifies competition among top exchanges. This move underscores the ongoing maturation of the crypto industry, where access to major digital assets through regulated channels is becoming the norm. For savvy investors, it represents another tool for building a diversified and secure cryptocurrency portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can I now buy BNB on Gemini? A: Yes. As of the December 23rd announcement, Gemini supports both trading and custody services for BNB. Q: Why hasn’t Coinbase listed BNB yet? A: While not officially confirmed, widespread speculation suggests Coinbase’s hesitation is due to Binance being its main global competitor. Listing a competitor’s native token involves complex strategic and potentially regulatory considerations. Q: Is it safe to store BNB on Gemini? A: Gemini offers custodial services with insurance coverage. It is generally considered a secure platform, but as with any custodial service, you are trusting a third party with your assets. Q: What are the trading pairs for BNB on Gemini? A: The initial announcement did not specify trading pairs. Typically, new assets on U.S. exchanges first pair with the US Dollar (USD) or stablecoins like Gemini Dollar (GUSD). Check Gemini’s official trading interface for the latest pairs. Q: How does this affect BNB’s price? A: Increased accessibility through a major regulated exchange can positively influence demand, which may impact price. However, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors beyond a single listing. Q: Should I move my BNB to Gemini? A: This depends on your individual strategy. If you value the security and convenience of a regulated custodian and already use Gemini, it could be a good option. If you prefer self-custody or use other exchanges for trading, you may choose to keep your assets where they are. Found this analysis of Gemini adding BNB helpful?

Coinone, one of the country’s leading trading platforms, has officially flagged Trust Wallet Token (TWT) with an investment warning . This decisive action stems from a confirmed security vulnerability within the Trust Wallet ecosystem, raising immediate concerns about potential price instability for TWT holders. For anyone involved with this asset, understanding the details of this Coinone investment warning for TWT is now crucial. Why Did Coinone Issue This TWT Investment Warning? The core reason for the alert is a confirmed security flaw. According to Coinone’s announcement, the vulnerability was identified and validated through the Trust Wallet project’s own official communication channels. When a foundational component of a crypto service like a wallet has a weakness, it doesn’t just risk user funds—it can severely shake investor confidence. Therefore, the exchange is proactively warning users that this situation could lead to unusually high price volatility for the TWT token. Exchanges issue these warnings to protect their users from unexpected market swings triggered by such fundamental news. What Does This Mean for TWT Investors? If you hold TWT, this Coinone investment warning is a signal to pause and assess your position. An official warning from a regulated exchange is a significant event. Here are the immediate implications: Increased Scrutiny: The token will likely face heightened scrutiny from other exchanges and the broader investment community. Potential for Volatility: As Coinone stated, the primary risk is sharp, unpredictable price movements as the market reacts to the security news. Reputational Impact: Trust is paramount in crypto. A security issue in the core wallet service can impact the perceived value of its associated token. This is not necessarily a prediction of a price crash, but a clear advisory that the trading environment for TWT has become riskier and more unpredictable. How Should You Respond to a Crypto Investment Warning? Seeing an official warning against an asset you own can be alarming. However, a calm, informed response is your best defense. Follow these steps: Do Not Panic Sell: Rash decisions during volatile periods often lead to losses. Gather information first. Seek Primary Sources: Go directly to the Trust Wallet Foundation’s official announcements to understand the vulnerability’s scope and their remediation plan. Review Your Strategy: Re-evaluate your investment thesis for TWT. Does this new risk factor change your long-term outlook? Secure Your Assets: Ensure your tokens are stored securely. If you use Trust Wallet, check for any urgent updates or advisories from the team. This Coinone investment warning for TWT serves as a perfect reminder that in cryptocurrency, technical fundamentals and security are directly tied to market value. The Bigger Picture: Security and Market Stability This event highlights a critical link in the crypto world. The Coinone TWT warning isn’t about market manipulation or hype; it’s a reaction to a tangible technical risk. It shows that reputable exchanges are monitoring project health and acting to inform their users. This kind of transparency is essential for building a safer, more mature market. For the ecosystem, while painful in the short term, addressing such vulnerabilities openly is healthier than letting them fester unseen. Conclusion: Navigating Warnings with Wisdom The Coinone investment warning for TWT is a sobering example of how security events ripple through cryptocurrency markets. It underscores the importance of investing in projects with robust, audited technology and demonstrates the role exchanges play in risk communication. For investors, the key takeaway is vigilance—treat official warnings as serious risk indicators and always prioritize the security of your holdings alongside their potential returns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is the Coinone investment warning for TWT? Coinone has issued a formal notice to its users cautioning them about increased investment risk associated with the Trust Wallet Token (TWT) due to a confirmed security vulnerability in the Trust Wallet service, which may lead to high price volatility. 2. Should I immediately sell my TWT tokens? An investment warning is not an automatic sell signal. It is a recommendation to exercise high caution. You should assess the situation, read official updates from Trust Wallet, and make a decision based on your risk tolerance and updated research. 3. Where can I find the original announcement about the security vulnerability? Coinone states the vulnerability was confirmed through the Trust Wallet foundation’s official community channels, such as their Twitter/X account, Discord, or blog. Always refer to these primary sources for accurate details. 4. Will other exchanges issue a similar warning for TWT? It is possible. Other exchanges monitor such events and may take similar protective actions for their users if they perceive a significant risk to market stability or asset security. 5. Does this warning affect Trust Wallet itself, or just the TWT token? The warning specifically concerns the TWT token’s market risk. However, the root cause is a security issue within the Trust Wallet service, so users of the wallet app should also pay close attention to official guidance regarding the safety of their funds. 6. How long do such investment warnings typically last? There is no set timeframe. The warning will likely remain until Coinone determines the underlying security concern has been adequately resolved and market conditions have stabilized.

At first, the extension appeared legit, however, hackers masqueraded the code address, extracting users’ seed phrases and draining wallets. “Reports indicate that importing a seed phrase into the extension can result in immediate wallet draining,” wrote one user . Browser extensions operate with elevated access to web pages, cookies, storage, and browsing activity. When abused, they provide a near-perfect avenue for credential theft – without triggering traditional endpoint defences.

Renowned crypto analyst Ben Cowen presents a cautious outlook, suggesting the path to a new Ethereum all-time high in 2026 is fraught with significant challenges. His analysis, reported by Cointelegraph, hinges on a critical market dynamic: Ethereum’s fate remains deeply tied to Bitcoin’s cycles. Why is a New Ethereum All-Time High in 2026 Considered Unlikely? Cowen’s central thesis is straightforward. He argues that if Bitcoin has entered a bear market phase, it becomes “very difficult” for Ethereum to stage an independent, sustained rally powerful enough to smash its previous record of $4,878. This interconnectedness means Ethereum often lacks the momentum to decouple from Bitcoin’s broader market sentiment during downturns. Therefore, the analyst casts doubt on a fresh Ethereum all-time high materializing in the next couple of years. His perspective challenges the more bullish narratives, introducing a note of realism based on historical cycle patterns and dominance flows. The Bull Trap Scenario: A False Dawn for ETH? Perhaps the most compelling part of Cowen’s warning involves a potential bull trap. He suggests that even if Ethereum manages to claw its way back to its former peak, that achievement might be a mirage. Recovery to $4,878: This could happen, but Cowen views it as a probable trap for bullish investors. Sharp Reversal: Following such a recovery, he anticipates a “sharp reversal” that could send the price tumbling back toward the $2,000 support level. Investor Caution: This scenario underscores the need for vigilance, as a return to old highs doesn’t guarantee a sustained breakout. This pattern would represent a painful setback for those buying at the top, expecting a continued surge toward a new Ethereum all-time high . Is Ethereum Still the Altcoin Leader? Despite the grim forecast for a 2026 record, Cowen offers a crucial silver lining that sets Ethereum apart from the crowded altcoin field. He asserts that ETH is “the only altcoin that still has a chance of reclaiming its all-time high” in future cycles. This distinction is vital. His assessment of the broader altcoin market is far more pessimistic. He believes most other altcoins have “exhausted their momentum” in the current cycle, making it unlikely they will ever set new price records. This positions Ethereum not just as a cryptocurrency, but as the singular altcoin with enduring, long-term value proposition and recovery potential. Actionable Insights for Ethereum Investors So, what does this mean for your portfolio? Cowen’s analysis isn’t just a prediction; it’s a framework for risk management. Monitor Bitcoin: Keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s market phase. A Bitcoin bear market severely limits Ethereum’s upside potential. Beware of Quick Peaks: If ETH approaches $4,878, evaluate the strength of the rally and Bitcoin’s condition. It could be a selling opportunity, not a buying one. Long-Term Perspective: If you believe in Ethereum’s fundamentals, view potential dips toward $2,000 as strategic accumulation zones for a cycle beyond 2026. Altcoin Selection: This analysis reinforces Ethereum’s unique status. Chasing smaller altcoins for new highs in this cycle may carry substantially higher risk. In essence, patience and disciplined capital allocation become key virtues for those targeting a future Ethereum all-time high . Conclusion: A Call for Cautious Optimism Ben Cowen’s forecast paints a picture of delayed gratification for Ethereum maximalists. While the thrilling sprint to a new Ethereum all-time high in 2026 appears unlikely, the long-term narrative isn’t broken. Ethereum retains its crown as the altcoin with the best chance of eventual recovery, standing alone in a sea of exhausted projects. For savvy investors, this period may represent a strategic buildup phase rather than a time for explosive gains. The dream of a new peak isn’t dead; it’s simply waiting for a more favorable macroeconomic and crypto market wind. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason an Ethereum all-time high in 2026 is considered unlikely? A1: The primary reason is Ethereum’s strong correlation with Bitcoin. Analyst Ben Cowen believes if Bitcoin is in a bear market, it is very difficult for Ethereum to rally independently with enough strength to set a new record. Q2: What is a “bull trap” in this context? A2: A bull trap refers to a scenario where Ethereum’s price rises back to its old high of around $4,878, leading investors to believe a breakout is imminent. However, this could be followed by a sharp reversal downward, trapping bullish buyers at a peak. Q3: Does this analysis mean Ethereum is a bad investment? A3: Not necessarily. Cowen highlights Ethereum as the ONLY altcoin with a realistic chance of reclaiming its all-time high in the future. It suggests a longer timeframe for growth and emphasizes strategic buying during potential dips. Q4: What price level does Cowen mention as a potential reversal point? A4: Following a potential bull trap at the old highs, Cowen suggests Ethereum could experience a sharp reversal down to the $2,000 support level. Q5: What is the outlook for other altcoins according to this analysis? A5: The outlook for most other altcoins is more pessimistic. Cowen assesses that they have likely exhausted their momentum in the current cycle and are unlikely to ever set new all-time highs, making Ethereum a unique case. Q6: What should an investor do based on this forecast? A6: Investors should practice caution, monitor Bitcoin’s trend closely, avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) if ETH nears its old high, and consider long-term accumulation strategies during deeper market corrections.

The platform has officially announced the upcoming YieldBasis (YB) listing , scheduled for December 26th. This strategic addition of YB trading pairs against both Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) signals a significant vote of confidence in the project and opens new avenues for traders. Let’s explore what this development means for the market and for your portfolio. What Does the YieldBasis YB Listing Entail? Upbit’s announcement is specific and time-bound. The YieldBasis YB listing is set to go live at 06:00 UTC on Thursday, December 26th. Trading will commence immediately for the YB/BTC and YB/USDT pairs. This dual-pair approach is crucial. It provides flexibility for different types of traders: those who prefer to trade against the crypto benchmark (BTC) and those who seek stability against a dollar-pegged asset (USDT). The listing on a major, compliant exchange like Upbit inherently boosts the token’s liquidity, accessibility, and legitimacy in the eyes of both retail and institutional participants. Why is Upbit’s Endorsement a Big Deal? Upbit is not just any exchange; it’s a dominant force in the South Korean market, known for its rigorous due diligence. Therefore, a YieldBasis YB listing here acts as a powerful validator. It suggests the project has passed stringent checks related to security, legal compliance, and technical integrity. For existing YB holders, this means enhanced market exposure. For new investors, it offers a trusted and regulated gateway to acquire the token. This move often triggers a positive market reaction, as seen with previous high-profile listings, due to increased demand and trading volume. What Are the Immediate Opportunities and Considerations? With any new listing, especially one as prominent as the YieldBasis YB listing , traders should be prepared for volatility. The initial hours can see significant price discovery. Here are key points to consider: Increased Volatility: Expect sharp price movements as the market finds equilibrium. Enhanced Liquidity: Upbit’s large user base will provide deeper order books. Regulatory Clarity: Trading on a compliant platform reduces counterparty risk. Market Sentiment: The listing itself is a bullish catalyst, but long-term value depends on the YieldBasis project’s fundamentals. How Does This Fit into the Broader Crypto Landscape? The decision for a YieldBasis YB listing reflects a continuing trend of major exchanges diversifying their offerings beyond the top 10 cryptocurrencies. It highlights a growing appetite for innovative DeFi and yield-generating protocols. By providing a secure trading venue for such assets, Upbit is bridging the gap between traditional crypto trading and the decentralized finance ecosystem. This not only benefits YB but also sets a precedent for other promising altcoins seeking mainstream exchange support. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors If you’re planning to engage with the YieldBasis YB listing , a measured approach is wise. Conduct your own research on the YieldBasis protocol’s use case, tokenomics, and roadmap. Monitor the order book depth in the first few days to understand support and resistance levels. Remember, while a listing is a major milestone, it is one event in a project’s lifecycle. Sustainable growth is tied to adoption and utility, not just exchange availability. Conclusion: A Significant Step for YieldBasis Adoption The upcoming YieldBasis YB listing on Upbit is a transformative event. It catapults the token onto a major stage, enhancing its credibility, liquidity, and reach. For the crypto market, it underscores the maturation of infrastructure supporting diverse digital assets. While opportunities for profitable trading arise, the core takeaway is the validation of a project now accessible to a vast, security-conscious audience. This listing could very well be the catalyst that propels YieldBasis into its next phase of growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will YieldBasis (YB) start trading on Upbit? A1: Trading for the YB/BTC and YB/USDT pairs will begin at 06:00 UTC on Thursday, December 26th. Q2: Why is the listing on both BTC and USDT pairs important? A2: It caters to different trading strategies. BTC pairs appeal to those benchmarking against crypto, while USDT pairs offer stability against the US dollar, which is often preferred for short-term trading and risk management. Q3: Does a listing on Upbit guarantee the token’s success? A3: No. While a major exchange listing provides liquidity and exposure, the long-term success of YieldBasis (YB) depends on the adoption, utility, and development of its underlying protocol. Q4: What should I do before trading YB on December 26th? A4: Research the YieldBasis project thoroughly, ensure your Upbit account is funded and verified, and be prepared for high volatility during the initial listing period. Q5: Is Upbit available to international traders? A5: Upbit primarily services South Korea, and access for international users can be restricted. Always check the exchange’s terms of service and your local regulations before attempting to trade. Q6: Could this listing affect the price of YB on other exchanges? A6: Yes, typically. A listing on a high-volume exchange like Upbit can create arbitrage opportunities and influence the token’s price across all trading platforms due to increased overall demand and visibility.

56377584,https://cryptonews.com/?p=467870,1766724174,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56377584.jpeg,Uniswap Governance Approves UNIfication Proposal in Near-Unanimous Vote,https://cryptonews.com/news/uniswap-governance-approves-unification-proposal-in-near-unanimous-vote/,"Uniswap governance has approved the UNIfication proposal, marking a major shift in the protocol’s economic model and setting UNI on a more explicitly deflationary path. Key Takeaways: Uniswap approved UNIfication with near-unanimous support, putting UNI on a deflationary path. The fee switch redirects trading fees to ongoing UNI burns tied to protocol usage. The proposal also streamlines governance and funding to support long-term growth. Voting concluded on Thursday with 99.9% support, according to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams . More than 125 million UNI tokens were cast in favor of the proposal , compared with just 742 tokens voting against, underscoring broad consensus among token holders. Uniswap Proposal Activates Long-Awaited Protocol Fee Switch The proposal, introduced in November by Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation, activates the long-anticipated protocol fee switch. Under the new structure, a portion of trading fees, previously distributed entirely to liquidity providers, will now be directed to the protocol itself. Those fees will be used to burn UNI tokens on an ongoing basis, reducing total supply over time. In addition, net sequencer fees from Unichain will be routed into the same burn mechanism. Together, the changes create a direct link between usage and supply reduction. As trading activity increases across Uniswap, more UNI will be removed from circulation, effectively tying the token’s economics to the protocol’s growth. Beyond fee mechanics, UNIfication also streamlines Uniswap’s operational structure. The proposal transitions Uniswap Foundation teams and responsibilities into Uniswap Labs, removes fees from Labs’ interface, wallet, and API services, and establishes a recurring growth budget funded by UNI. Voting has concluded on Unification 125,342,017 YES 742 NO Unified, true to the name After a ~2day vote timelock, 100m UNI will be burned, fee switches will be flipped, labs will turn off frontend fees and focus on the protocol, and more Merry Christmas everyone https://t.co/wpsEC8udlW pic.twitter.com/P0rJmLN9Cc — Hayden Adams (@haydenzadams) December 25, 2025 That budget is designed to support long-term development and ecosystem expansion rather than short-term incentives. Following approval, the proposal enters a two-day timelock, after which Uniswap will execute a one-time burn of 100 million UNI. The figure represents an estimate of how much UNI might have been burned had the fee switch been active since the token’s launch. The governance package also introduces a Protocol Fee Discount Auctions system designed to improve returns for liquidity providers while aligning Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and on-chain governance under a single legal structure using Wyoming’s DUNA framework. Several influential figures in decentralized finance backed the UNIfication proposal, including Variant founder Jesse Waldren, Synthetix and Infinex founder Kain Warwick, and former Uniswap Labs engineer Ian Lapham, all of whom hold substantial voting power. Uniswap Cites Shift in Regulatory Climate as It Moves Toward Value Capture The move comes after years of regulatory pressure on DeFi under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. In the proposal, Uniswap argued that the regulatory landscape has shifted and that decentralized finance has reached a stage of broader acceptance, making it possible to implement protocol-level value capture. “I believe Uniswap protocol can be the primary place tokens are traded,” Adams said, adding that the proposal “sets the stage for the next decade of its growth.” UNI was trading at $5.92 as of late Thursday, up 18.9% over the past week. Uniswap has generated more than $1.05 billion in fees so far this year, highlighting the scale of activity now feeding into its new economic model.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are watching Polygon (MATIC) with intense interest. The burning question on everyone’s mind: can MATIC achieve the elusive $1 milestone in the coming years? With its position as a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Polygon has transformed from a promising project to a fundamental infrastructure component of the blockchain ecosystem. This comprehensive analysis examines MATIC’s potential trajectory through 2026, 2027, and beyond to 2030, providing you with data-driven insights and expert perspectives on whether this ambitious price target is within reach. Understanding Polygon’s Current Market Position Polygon has established itself as a critical player in solving Ethereum’s scalability challenges. The network processes transactions faster and at significantly lower costs than the Ethereum mainnet, making it attractive for developers and users alike. As of current market conditions, MATIC faces both opportunities and challenges. The broader crypto market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the Polygon ecosystem will all influence its price trajectory. The network’s active development, including Polygon 2.0 upgrades and zero-knowledge technology integration, positions it for potential growth if adoption continues to accelerate. Polygon Price Prediction for 2026: The Foundation Year Looking toward 2026, several factors will shape MATIC’s price movement. Analysts consider multiple scenarios based on market conditions, adoption rates, and technological milestones. A conservative estimate suggests gradual growth if current trends continue, while bullish scenarios depend on widespread institutional adoption and successful implementation of Polygon’s roadmap. Key considerations include: Ethereum ecosystem integration and dependency Competition from other Layer 2 solutions Developer activity and dApp migration to Polygon Overall cryptocurrency market capitalization trends Scenario 2026 Price Range Key Drivers Conservative $0.45 – $0.65 Moderate adoption, steady market growth Moderate $0.65 – $0.85 Strong developer growth, Ethereum scaling needs Bullish $0.85 – $1.10 Mass adoption, major partnerships, market surge MATIC Price Analysis for 2027: The Acceleration Phase By 2027, Polygon’s technological advancements should be more fully realized. The implementation of Polygon 2.0, featuring a unified liquidity layer and enhanced zero-knowledge proofs, could significantly boost network efficiency and appeal. If Ethereum maintains its dominant position and Polygon continues to capture scaling demand, MATIC could experience substantial appreciation. However, investors must remain aware of potential headwinds including regulatory changes, technological disruptions from competitors, and macroeconomic factors affecting all cryptocurrency investments. The MATIC surge potential in 2027 depends heavily on whether the network can maintain its competitive advantages while expanding its use cases beyond simple transaction scaling. Polygon 2030 Forecast: Long-Term Vision and Potential The 2030 outlook for Polygon represents the most speculative but potentially rewarding timeframe. By this point, blockchain technology should be more integrated into mainstream applications, and scaling solutions will be essential infrastructure. Polygon’s success in establishing itself as the go-to Layer 2 solution could position MATIC for significant value appreciation. Long-term crypto forecast models suggest that if Polygon captures even a moderate percentage of the projected global blockchain transaction volume, its token economics could support substantially higher valuations. However, this distant horizon requires considering technological obsolescence risks, the evolution of Ethereum itself, and potential paradigm shifts in blockchain architecture. Will MATIC Surge to $1? Critical Factors to Consider The $1 price point represents both a psychological milestone and a significant valuation increase from current levels. Achieving this target depends on several converging factors: Network Adoption: Increased daily active users and transaction volume Developer Growth: More applications building on Polygon versus competitors Token Utility: Expanded use cases for MATIC beyond network fees Market Conditions: Overall cryptocurrency bull market support Technological Execution: Successful delivery of Polygon’s development roadmap Historical patterns suggest that MATIC tends to perform well during periods of Ethereum network congestion, as users seek cheaper alternatives. However, sustained growth requires more than temporary congestion-driven demand. Risks and Challenges in MATIC’s Price Trajectory No investment comes without risks, and Polygon faces several significant challenges. The competitive landscape for Layer 2 solutions is intensifying, with projects like Arbitrum , Optimism , and emerging zero-knowledge rollups vying for market share. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency tokens, particularly those classified as securities, could impact MATIC’s trading and adoption. Additionally, technological risks include potential vulnerabilities in Polygon’s architecture or failure to keep pace with Ethereum’s own scaling improvements through initiatives like Proto-danksharding . Expert Insights and Market Sentiment Industry analysts offer varied perspectives on Polygon’s future. Some emphasize its first-mover advantage and established ecosystem, while others caution about increasing competition.

He warns that a rally toward the $4,878 level could turn into a bull trap, followed by a sharp reversal back toward $2,000. Ethereum Upside Limited Ethereum is unlikely to reach new all-time highs over the coming year if Bitcoin remains under pressure. This is according to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, who shared his outlook during a recent appearance on the Bankless podcast . Cowen said that if Bitcoin is indeed in what feels like a broader bear market, it would be difficult for Ethereum to sustain a meaningful breakout. In his view, the macro conditions that typically allow Ethereum to surge to new highs are closely tied to Bitcoin’s market structure, and without a strong foundation from BTC, upside momentum for ETH may be limited. The comments also follow a bearish projection from veteran trader Peter Brandt , who warned in mid-December that Bitcoin could fall as low as $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026. That outlook added to growing caution among analysts who believe the market may be transitioning into a longer consolidation or downturn phase rather than a renewed bull cycle. Cowen suggested that even if Ethereum were to reclaim its previous all-time high close to $4,878, such a move could ultimately prove to be a bull trap rather than the start of a sustained rally. Ethereum briefly pushed back to its 2021 peak in late August before entering a prolonged decline that dragged the price below $3,000 by November. At current levels, a return to that all-time high would require a gain of more than 40%, based on pricing data from CoinCodex . ETH’s price action over the past 6 months (Source: CoinCodex ) While Cowen acknowledged that such a move is technically possible, he still warned that it will likely be followed by a sharp reversal, potentially sending Ethereum back toward the $2,000 level. He also explained that even a renewed ETH rally will probably not spill over into a broader altcoin resurgence. According to Cowen, Ethereum is the only major altcoin that still appears capable of revisiting previous highs this cycle, while many others may already be past their peak. This view aligns with warnings from Fundstrat Global Advisors, which reportedly told investors to prepare for a “meaningful drawdown” in 2026 that could push Ethereum into the $1,800 to $2,000 range.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 05:30:00

Key Takeaways: Keonne Rodriguez shared a personal account of his first days in federal prison. His case has renewed debate over criminal liability for open-source crypto developers. A growing clemency campaign highlights concerns over free speech and innovation. In a letter shared by The Rage , Rodriguez described surrendering himself to a federal prison camp and navigating the intake process, which included searches, medical checks and assignment to housing. The letter, dated Wednesday, marked his seventh day at the facility and reflected on the emotional toll of entering custody just days before Christmas. Rodriguez Describes First Days in Prison as “Manageable” “While not at all comfortable, it is manageable,” Rodriguez wrote. “While I rather be at home with my wife and family, there are far worse places I could have ended up.” He added that he was thankful the other prisoners had been “respectful and downright friendly,” a detail that appeared to offer some reassurance amid an otherwise difficult transition. Rodriguez said he was scheduled to receive his wife as his first visitor on Christmas Day. He also noted that the timing of his incarceration forced his family to celebrate the holiday early this year, underscoring the personal cost of his sentence beyond the legal consequences. The imprisonment of Rodriguez has drawn attention within the crypto community, where it has become a flashpoint in the broader debate over the criminal liability of open-source developers. Privacy advocates argue that his case, alongside the prosecution of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm, raises unresolved questions about whether writing and maintaining code can constitute a crime when third parties use that software for illicit purposes.

Supporters say the prosecution sets a dangerous precedent for developers building privacy-focused tools, while authorities have maintained that the case centers on facilitating illegal activity rather than protected speech. A petition calling for clemency for Rodriguez has gathered more than 12,000 signatures, reflecting continued concern among developers and digital rights advocates. The petition describes the case as “a chilling attack on free speech and innovation,” warning that it could deter open-source development in the United States. Trump Says He Will Review Samourai Wallet Co-Founder’s Case The possibility of executive clemency has also entered the conversation. US President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he would review Rodriguez’s case , telling reporters on Dec. 16 that he had heard about it and would “take a look,” though he acknowledged he was not familiar with the details. The comments came after Rodriguez had begun serving his sentence. In a subsequent social media post, Rodriguez publicly appealed to Trump for a pardon, characterizing his prosecution as an example of “lawfare” carried out under the previous administration. He argued that his case involved no direct victims and accused regulators and judges of targeting him as part of a broader anti-innovation push.

As the metaverse continues to capture global attention, investors are asking a crucial question: What does the future hold for Decentraland’s MANA token? With virtual real estate transactions making headlines and major brands establishing digital presences, understanding the potential trajectory of this pioneering metaverse cryptocurrency becomes essential for anyone navigating the Web3 landscape. This comprehensive analysis explores Decentraland price predictions from 2026 through 2030, examining whether MANA can realistically achieve the psychological milestone of $1 and what factors will determine its journey. Understanding Decentraland and the MANA Token Decentraland represents one of the earliest and most established metaverse platforms, built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can purchase virtual land parcels as NFTs using MANA tokens, create interactive experiences, attend virtual events, and monetize their digital assets. The platform’s native cryptocurrency, MANA, serves multiple functions: it’s the primary currency for transactions within the virtual world, used for governance voting through the Decentraland DAO, and required for purchasing LAND parcels and other digital assets. This utility foundation creates inherent demand for the token beyond speculative trading. Current MANA Price Analysis and Market Position Before exploring future predictions, understanding MANA’s current market position provides essential context. As of [current year], MANA maintains its position among the top metaverse cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, though it faces increasing competition from newer platforms. The token’s price history shows significant volatility, with notable peaks during previous crypto bull markets and metaverse hype cycles. Several factors currently influence MANA’s valuation: Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price movements Adoption rates within the Decentraland platform itself Competition from other metaverse projects like The Sandbox and newer platforms Technological developments and platform upgrades Regulatory developments affecting virtual assets globally Key Factors Influencing Decentraland Price Prediction Accurate price prediction requires examining multiple variables that could impact MANA’s future value. These factors create both opportunities and challenges for the token’s growth trajectory. Metaverse Adoption and Platform Growth The single most significant driver for MANA’s price will be actual adoption and usage of the Decentraland platform. Key metrics to watch include: Metric Current Status Impact on MANA Price Daily Active Users Varies significantly Higher consistent usage increases transaction volume Virtual Land Sales Volume Seasonal fluctuations Directly correlates with MANA demand Brand Partnerships Several major brands established Increases platform credibility and user attraction Developer Activity Active but could expand More experiences increase platform utility Technological Developments and Roadmap Decentraland’s development team continues to improve the platform, with several planned upgrades that could significantly impact user experience and, consequently, MANA demand. These include enhanced graphics capabilities, improved mobile accessibility, better creation tools for users, and potential layer-2 scaling solutions to reduce transaction costs. Successful implementation of these features could drive renewed interest and investment in the platform. Market Competition and Differentiation The metaverse space has become increasingly crowded since Decentraland’s launch. The platform must maintain its first-mover advantage while innovating to stay relevant. Key competitive factors include: User experience and graphical quality compared to newer platforms Transaction costs and speed on the Ethereum network Unique features that differentiate Decentraland from competitors Community engagement and creator support systems Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 By 2026, several technological and market developments could significantly impact MANA’s valuation. Assuming broader cryptocurrency market recovery and continued metaverse concept development, analysts project a potential price range of $0.45 to $0.85 for MANA in 2026. The lower end of this prediction assumes moderate platform growth and continued market competition, while the higher end requires substantial increases in daily active users and virtual land transactions. Key factors for 2026 include potential Ethereum network upgrades reducing transaction costs, increased institutional interest in metaverse assets, and possible integration with emerging technologies like enhanced VR hardware. MANA Price Forecast for 2027 The 2027 forecast builds upon 2026 developments, with additional consideration for macroeconomic factors and technological adoption curves. Conservative estimates place MANA between $0.55 and $0.95, while optimistic scenarios suggest potential to approach or briefly exceed $1 during market peaks. Critical developments that could push MANA toward the higher end of predictions include: Mainstream adoption of VR/AR technologies reaching critical mass Significant corporate investment in virtual headquarters and marketing Clear regulatory frameworks providing investor certainty Interoperability developments allowing assets to move between metaverse platforms Decentraland 2030: Long-Term Price Projection Looking further ahead to 2030 requires considering both technological evolution and potential paradigm shifts in how people interact with digital spaces. Long-term Decentraland price prediction models vary widely based on underlying assumptions about metaverse adoption rates. Three potential scenarios emerge: Conservative Scenario ($0.70 – $1.20) Assumes moderate metaverse adoption with Decentraland maintaining but not significantly expanding its current market position. Competition limits growth potential, and technological advancements occur gradually rather than disruptively. Moderate Scenario ($1.50 – $3.00) Assumes steady growth in metaverse adoption with Decentraland capturing a significant portion of the virtual real estate and experience market. Platform improvements successfully address current limitations, and brand partnerships drive consistent user growth. Optimistic Scenario ($3.50 – $7.00+) Assumes rapid, widespread metaverse adoption becoming integral to social interaction, commerce, and entertainment. Decentraland emerges as a leading platform through continuous innovation, and MANA becomes a standard currency for virtual transactions beyond the platform itself. Will MANA Price Hit $1? The Critical Analysis The $1 threshold represents both a psychological milestone and a significant market capitalization achievement for MANA. Based on current circulating supply, reaching $1 would give Decentraland a market capitalization of approximately [current circulating supply] billion dollars. Analysis suggests several pathways to this target: Sustained platform growth increasing transaction volume and token utility Broader cryptocurrency bull market lifting all major assets Strategic partnerships or developments that significantly increase demand Tokenomics adjustments such as burning mechanisms or reduced inflation While challenging, the $1 target remains within plausible reach given appropriate market conditions and platform development. However, investors should recognize that this achievement would likely require both internal platform success and favorable external market factors. Risks and Challenges for MANA Price Growth No investment comes without risks, and MANA faces several significant challenges that could impact its price trajectory: Technological Obsolescence: Rapid innovation could make current platforms seem primitive Regulatory Uncertainty: Changing global regulations could impact virtual asset markets Market Saturation: Increasing competition could fragment the metaverse user base Adoption Hurdles: Technical barriers may limit mainstream metaverse adoption Economic Factors: Broader economic conditions affect discretionary spending on virtual assets Investment Considerations for MANA For those considering MANA as part of their investment portfolio, several strategic approaches merit consideration: Diversification: Treat MANA as a speculative portion of a diversified portfolio Research-Based Allocation: Allocate only what you can afford to lose completely Active Monitoring: Track platform metrics, not just price movements Long-Term Perspective: Consider multi-year holding periods given the developmental timeline Platform Engagement: Actually use Decentraland to understand its strengths and weaknesses Conclusion: The Future of Decentraland and MANA The journey toward $1 and beyond for MANA represents more than just price speculation—it reflects the evolving narrative of digital ownership and virtual experiences. While predictions provide helpful frameworks, the actual trajectory will depend on execution, adoption, and innovation. Decentraland’s established position gives it advantages, but maintaining relevance requires continuous evolution. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the coming years will reveal whether virtual worlds become integral to our digital lives or remain niche experiences. The potential is undeniable, but the path forward requires navigating both technological challenges and market realities.

This expiry event is huge, being the end of the quarter and end of the year, so there may be some impact on spot markets, which have been sideways for most of the week. Trading has been subdued over the Christmas period, as investors look ahead to 2026 with renewed hope that the four-year cycle has been broken. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.37, meaning that there are a lot more calls (longs) expiring than puts (shorts). Max pain is around $96,000, according to Coinglass, which means that most of the contracts will be worthless on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $100,000, which has $2.2 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There remains around $2.2 billion in OI at $85,000. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at $52 billion, according to Coinglass. “Post-expiry flows will matter more than price. Watch positioning. How would the market react to an expiry this big?” asked Deribit. Year-End Options Expiry This Friday, a massive $28.5B in BTC and ETH options expire on Deribit, the largest expiry on record -representing over half of total open interest – $BTC : $23.4B+ notional | Put Call: 0.36 | Max Pain: $96K $1.2B in put OI clustered at $85K, with… pic.twitter.com/c1l3r7Ac6U — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) December 23, 2025 “When a large volume of options expires, many institutions roll over positions early to mitigate pin-prick risk. At this point, picking up the leftover positions discarded by institutions offers exceptional value — prices are extremely favorable,” explained crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live. In addition to today’s big batch of Bitcoin options, around 1.25 million Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $3.4 billion, max pain at $3,100, and a put/call ratio of 0.45. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $11 billion and has been falling since late August. Ether options positioning “reflects caution, not capitulation,” said Deribit. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $27 billion. Spot Market Outlook Spot markets have remained relatively flat, with total cap hovering just above $3 trillion. Bitcoin had a little jump to $89,000 but could not make any momentum above this level and retreated to $88,850 at the time of writing. The asset remains range-bound and flat on the week. Ether prices have remained weak, below $3,000 over the past 24 hours, and most altcoins are in the red as usual.

According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin traded around $88,750 at the time of recent reports, down about 27% from its all-time high of $125,100 hit on Oct. 5. Reports have disclosed that a record-sized Bitcoin options expiry landed on Friday, Dec. 26, and several analysts say that event effectively “pinned” price into a narrow range — at least until volatility returns. Market Flows And Options Pressure According to multiple sources, outflows from major spot ETFs removed a key support for price that helped push Bitcoin higher earlier this year. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been in “Extreme Fear” since Dec. 12, which shows how fragile sentiment remains despite product and policy gains. Options expiries of this size can concentrate bets and push price toward strike clusters. When those contracts roll off, the market often needs a new catalyst to move beyond the band it’s been stuck in. Strong Fundamentals Executives managing large Bitcoin treasuries argue fundamentals are solid even as price drops. Strategy CEO Phong Le told a podcast that the market’s long-term picture looks strong and that short-term moves “do what they do.” “The fundamentals of the market for Bitcoin couldn’t be better this year,” Le said, pointing out that he doesn’t care too much about its short-term performance. Reports note that Strategy’s market value relative to its Bitcoin holdings, mNAV, has fallen below 1 and sits at 0.93 according to Saylor Tracker. The company’s balance shows 671,268 Bitcoin, with an estimated value of about $58 billion. Those figures underline how a decline in spot price can quickly reshape the math for firms that hold Bitcoin on their books. Traditional Banks Trying To Catch Up Le and Strategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor have been meeting with banks across the US and the UAE, based on his comments, as institutions seek how to adjust to growing client demand and new product types. According to reports, Galaxy Digital researcher Alex Thorn had said earlier in the year there was a “strong chance” the US government would signal a formal reserve move. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile, although a fully detailed plan has not been released. Policy Signals And Market Reaction Policy support is a clear positive, yet markets do not always respond immediately to regulatory shifts. Signals can lower legal risk and widen access, but they do not always create instant buying. The mNAV reading below 1, plus ETF outflows and a fear reading stuck at “Extreme Fear,” shows there is skepticism about when that demand will arrive. Some players remain methodical, building dollar and Bitcoin treasuries and relying on model-based rules rather than emotion. Based on reports and market indicators, the picture is mixed. Long-term commitments from firms and clearer policy language point to stronger structural backing. At the same time, short-term flows, options dynamics, and entrenched fear mean price can stay volatile and range-bound. Investors watching both the fund flows and policy calendar will likely decide which signal matters more next.

The cryptocurrency that promised to revolutionize mobile mining has seen significant volatility, leaving investors wondering: is this the end of Pi Coin’s journey, or just a temporary setback before massive gains? This comprehensive analysis dives deep into Pi Network price predictions from 2026 through 2030, examining the fundamental reasons behind Pi Coin’s recent drop and what it means for your investment strategy. Understanding Pi Network’s Current Market Position Pi Network represents one of the most ambitious projects in cryptocurrency history. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that require expensive hardware for mining, Pi Network enables users to mine coins directly from their smartphones. This innovative approach has attracted millions of users worldwide, creating one of the largest cryptocurrency communities ever assembled. However, the transition from testnet to mainnet has presented significant challenges that directly impact Pi Coin’s current valuation. Why Is Pi Coin Dropping? Key Factors Explained The recent decline in Pi Network’s perceived value stems from several interconnected factors. First, the prolonged development timeline has tested investor patience. While the core team continues to build infrastructure, market expectations often outpace actual development progress. Second, regulatory uncertainty surrounding mobile-mined cryptocurrencies creates hesitation among institutional investors. Third, the sheer size of the Pi Network community means that even small percentages of users selling their holdings can create significant downward pressure on perceived value. Consider these critical elements affecting Pi Coin’s current trajectory: Mainnet migration delays and technical challenges Regulatory scrutiny of novel mining mechanisms Market saturation with competing layer-1 solutions Community expectations versus development reality Limited exchange listings and liquidity constraints Pi Network Price Prediction 2026: The First Major Test By 2026, Pi Network should have completed its mainnet transition and established clearer utility pathways. Our analysis suggests that if the project successfully implements its proposed ecosystem—including decentralized applications, smart contracts, and real-world partnerships—Pi Coin could establish a more stable valuation foundation. However, this depends entirely on execution quality and market adoption rates. Scenario Price Range Probability Optimistic Adoption $5 – $15 25% Moderate Growth $2 – $5 50% Limited Progress $0.5 – $2 25% Pi Coin Price Prediction 2027-2028: Maturation Phase The period between 2027 and 2028 represents a crucial maturation phase for Pi Network. By this time, the cryptocurrency should have established clearer use cases beyond speculative trading. Key factors to watch include merchant adoption rates, developer activity within the Pi ecosystem, and regulatory clarity across major markets. If Pi Network successfully transitions from a mining experiment to a functional blockchain platform, we could see significant valuation adjustments. Pi Network 2030 Price Prediction: Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030, Pi Network’s success will depend on several fundamental achievements. First, the platform must demonstrate sustainable decentralization beyond its initial mining phase. Second, it needs to establish competitive advantages over established layer-1 blockchains. Third, the project must navigate the evolving regulatory landscape for mobile-based cryptocurrencies. If these challenges are met successfully, Pi Coin could establish itself as a significant player in the digital currency space. Actionable Insights for Pi Network Investors Navigating Pi Coin’s volatility requires strategic thinking. First, diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio to mitigate Pi Network-specific risks. Second, monitor development milestones rather than daily price fluctuations. Third, participate in the Pi Network community to understand platform developments firsthand. Fourth, establish clear entry and exit strategies based on fundamental progress rather than speculative hype. Remember that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and Pi Network’s novel approach introduces additional variables to consider. The Future of Cryptocurrency and Pi Network’s Role Pi Network represents an important experiment in cryptocurrency accessibility and mass adoption. Its success or failure will provide valuable insights into whether mobile-based mining can sustainably support blockchain networks. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, projects like Pi Network test the boundaries of what’s possible in digital currency creation and distribution. The current drop in Pi Coin’s perceived value reflects both legitimate concerns and market overreactions. While development challenges are real, the project’s fundamental vision remains intact. The coming years will determine whether Pi Network can translate its massive user base into genuine blockchain utility. For investors, this represents both significant risk and potential reward—a characteristic shared by many innovative cryptocurrency projects.

President Vladimir Putin allegedly announced the collaboration at a pre-New Year meeting of the State Council on Christmas. Putin said the discussions are taking place with American officials rather than with Kyiv. He said U.S. representatives showed interest in using electricity from Zaporizhzhia for crypto mining operations. He also reportedly said electricity supplies to Ukraine are being discussed at the American initiative. When asked whether Ukrainian specialists could work at the plant, Putin said they were already working there but now hold Russian passports, placing them under Russia’s jurisdiction. The Industrial Mining Association had said in a report from September that Russia ranked second globally for crypto mining during the summer, accounting for more than 16% of global hashrate. Putin confirms talks with the US over plant control and mining – Russian Media Putin’s State Council meeting reportedly focused on personnel training, but Putin apparently openly spoke about Zaporizhzhia, though the talks exclude Ukraine from decision-making and place Russia and Washington at the center of operational planning for the nuclear site. Crypto mining already plays a role in Russia’s financial system. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said mining could be an additional factor behind ruble strengthening. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, she said it is hard to measure the effect because a large part of the sector operates in a gray zone. Earlier last week, Maxim Oreshkin, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office, had said forum that 2026’s ruble price forecasts were off because financial flows linked to crypto and mining were underestimated. Maxim said this sector has turned into a new export channel and now influences foreign exchange markets. Oreshkin said the Bank of Russia is assessing these flows so they can be included in the balance of payments, noting that many of these transactions bypass standard reporting routes. Mining is now regulated in Russia, thanks to a notice by the country’s central bank on November 1st 2024, which said that retail entrepreneurs and companies registered with the Federal Tax Service can legally mine crypto in Russia. Private individuals can mine without registration if they stay within a 6,000 kilowatt-hour energy limit and report income, while companies that run mining infrastructure, including data centers and hosting services, must register with the tax authority.

Imagine a platform that revolutionized meme coin creation on Solana, turning viral ideas into market movements overnight. That’s Pump.fun, and its native PUMP token has captured the attention of the entire cryptocurrency community. As Solana’s DeFi ecosystem experiences unprecedented growth, investors are asking one crucial question: Can PUMP lead this explosive revolution? Our comprehensive Pump.fun price prediction for 2026-2030 examines whether this token has what it takes to become a cornerstone of Solana’s decentralized finance future. What is Pump.fun and Why Does It Matter for Solana DeFi? Pump.fun emerged as a groundbreaking platform that simplified meme coin creation on the Solana blockchain. Unlike traditional token launch methods that required technical expertise and significant capital, Pump.fun democratized the process, allowing anyone to create and launch tokens with minimal barriers. This innovation tapped into the explosive growth of meme coins while leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure. The platform’s success stems from several key features: Simplified token creation process requiring no coding knowledge Integration with Solana’s fast and affordable transaction network Built-in bonding curve mechanism for fair launches Community-driven approach to meme coin discovery As Solana’s DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, platforms like Pump.fun play a crucial role in onboarding new users and driving network activity. The PUMP token serves as the governance and utility token within this ecosystem, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value. PUMP Token Fundamentals: Understanding the Value Proposition Before diving into our Pump.fun price prediction, it’s essential to understand what drives the token’s value. The PUMP token operates within a carefully designed ecosystem with multiple utility functions: Utility Function Description Impact on Value Governance Rights Token holders can vote on platform upgrades and fee structures Creates long-term holding incentive Fee Discounts Reduced fees for token creation and transactions Drives platform usage and token demand Revenue Sharing Portion of platform fees distributed to stakers Provides passive income opportunities Ecosystem Access Early access to featured tokens and platform features Creates exclusive benefits for holders The tokenomics model includes mechanisms to balance supply and demand, with a portion of transaction fees being burned to create deflationary pressure. This careful design positions PUMP as more than just another meme token—it’s a fundamental piece of infrastructure within Solana’s growing DeFi landscape. Solana DeFi Growth: The Rising Tide That Lifts All Boats Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth, with total value locked (TVL) increasing dramatically over recent years. This expansion creates a favorable environment for platforms like Pump.fun to thrive.

Pump.fun’s position as a leading meme coin creation platform gives it unique exposure to retail interest and viral trends within the ecosystem. Pump.fun Price Prediction 2026: The Short-Term Outlook Looking ahead to 2026, several factors will influence PUMP’s price trajectory. Our analysis considers both technical indicators and fundamental developments: Key drivers for 2026 include: Platform adoption rates and user growth metrics Solana network performance and DeFi TVL expansion Regulatory developments affecting meme coins and DeFi platforms Competitive landscape and platform innovation Based on current growth patterns and assuming continued Solana ecosystem expansion, we project that PUMP could establish stronger support levels while testing new resistance zones. The token’s performance will closely track both platform-specific metrics and broader Solana DeFi trends. 2027-2028: Mid-Term Growth and Ecosystem Maturation The 2027-2028 period represents a crucial phase for Pump.fun’s development.

Successful execution of the development roadmap could position the token for significant appreciation. 2029-2030: Long-Term Vision and Market Leadership Potential Looking toward the end of the decade, our Pump.fun price prediction considers several long-term scenarios. The most optimistic outlook assumes: Solana establishes itself as a top-tier DeFi blockchain Pump.fun maintains leadership in meme coin creation and trading Successful expansion into complementary DeFi services Strong community governance and decentralized development In this scenario, PUMP could evolve from a platform token to a fundamental component of Solana’s DeFi infrastructure. However, investors should also consider potential challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, technological competition, and market volatility. Risks and Challenges: What Could Derail the Pump.fun Price Prediction? While our analysis presents an optimistic outlook, several risks could impact PUMP’s trajectory: Primary concerns include: Regulatory crackdowns on meme coins and DeFi platforms Technological issues or security vulnerabilities on Solana Increased competition from similar platforms Market saturation in the meme coin space Broader cryptocurrency market downturns Successful navigation of these challenges will require continuous platform innovation, strong community management, and adaptive business strategies. Investors should monitor these risk factors alongside positive developments.

This zkPass listing is not just another token addition; it’s a powerful endorsement of privacy-enhancing technology within a major regulated market. Scheduled to go live at 9:00 a.m. UTC today, this event signals growing institutional interest in projects that prioritize user data sovereignty. For traders and blockchain enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where advanced cryptographic concepts meet mainstream financial accessibility. Why is the zkPass Listing on Bithumb Such a Big Deal? Bithumb is one of South Korea’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, its decision to list a token like ZKP carries substantial weight. This move provides zkPass with immediate access to a vast pool of liquid capital and a sophisticated investor base. Moreover, it validates the project’s underlying technology—zero-knowledge proofs—in a market known for its rigorous compliance standards. The zkPass listing effectively bridges the gap between cutting-edge privacy protocols and everyday traders seeking exposure to this innovative sector. What is zkPass (ZKP) and How Does It Work? For those new to the concept, zkPass is a protocol built around zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). In simple terms, this technology allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any underlying information. Imagine proving you are over 18 without showing your birthdate. zkPass applies this to digital identity and data verification. The zkPass listing on a major fiat gateway like Bithumb highlights a growing real-world application for ZKPs beyond theoretical use cases. Enhanced Privacy: Users can verify credentials without exposing sensitive data. Security: Reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft. Interoperability: Aims to work across various Web2 and Web3 platforms. What Does This Mean for the South Korean Crypto Market? The South Korean market is a powerhouse, known for its high retail participation and tech-savvy population. Listing ZKP for direct won trading simplifies the investment process, removing the need for USDT or BTC pairs. This direct fiat on-ramp could lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for zkPass. Furthermore, it sets a precedent. Other exchanges may follow suit, and more privacy-focused projects might seek listings, thereby diversifying the offerings available to Korean investors. The zkPass listing could be the catalyst for a new wave of sophisticated digital asset adoption in the region. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? While the announcement is bullish, investors should proceed with informed caution. The regulatory environment for privacy-enhancing tokens remains complex and can change rapidly. Price volatility is often high following a new listing as the market seeks equilibrium. Additionally, the success of zkPass will ultimately depend on the widespread adoption of its protocol, not just its token’s trading activity. Therefore, while the zkPass listing is a monumental step, its long-term impact hinges on the project’s execution and broader market trends. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Privacy Tech The listing of zkPass (ZKP) on Bithumb is a landmark event that transcends a simple exchange announcement. It represents a growing convergence between institutional crypto platforms and fundamental blockchain values like privacy and self-sovereignty. This move provides legitimacy, liquidity, and visibility to a crucial technological innovation. For the crypto community, it’s a clear signal that privacy is not a niche concern but a mainstream demand, now accessible through one of Asia’s most important trading venues. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly does zkPass (ZKP) start trading on Bithumb? A1: Trading for the ZKP/KRW pair is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. UTC on the announcement date. Q2: Can I deposit ZKP tokens to Bithumb before trading starts? A2: Typically, exchanges open deposits a few hours before trading begins. You should check the official Bithumb announcement for the exact deposit start time. Q3: What is the main purpose of the zkPass project? A3: zkPass is a decentralized protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow for private and secure verification of personal data without revealing the data itself. Q4: Why is listing on Bithumb specifically important? A4: Bithumb is a top-tier South Korean exchange with high volume and a large user base. A won trading pair provides easy access for Korean investors and signifies regulatory and market confidence. Q5: Are there any risks associated with trading a newly listed token? A5: Yes. New listings often experience high volatility. It’s crucial to do your own research, understand the project’s fundamentals, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q6: Does this mean privacy tokens are becoming more accepted? A6: The listing by a major, compliant exchange like Bithumb is a positive indicator of growing acceptance for the underlying technology, though the regulatory landscape is still evolving.

One of the most powerful, real-time gauges of this sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . This metric reveals whether traders are leaning bullish or bearish on the world’s leading cryptocurrency at any given moment. Let’s decode the latest data from the world’s top exchanges and uncover what it truly means for your next move. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Tell Us? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a simple yet profound indicator. It shows the percentage of traders holding long positions (betting the price will rise) versus those holding short positions (betting the price will fall) on perpetual futures contracts. Therefore, a ratio above 50% long suggests bullish sentiment, while below 50% indicates bearish leanings. However, interpreting this data requires looking beyond a single number. Breaking Down the Latest Market Sentiment Current data paints a fascinating picture of a market in near-perfect equilibrium, but with subtle nuances. The overall 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across major platforms shows a market almost perfectly balanced between fear and greed. Overall: 49.34% long, 50.66% short Binance: 48.99% long, 51.01% short OKX: 49.95% long, 50.05% short Bybit: 48.69% long, 51.31% short This collective data reveals a market that is cautiously bearish in the very short term. The slight edge towards short positions suggests traders are hedging or anticipating potential downward pressure. Why Should You Care About This Ratio? Monitoring the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers actionable insights. First, extreme readings can act as a contrarian indicator. For instance, when an overwhelming majority are long, it might signal a market top is near. Conversely, extreme short positioning can hint at a potential bounce. Secondly, divergences between exchanges can reveal where different trader demographics (retail vs. institutional) are placing their bets, offering a deeper layer of analysis. Actionable Insights for Traders So, what can you do with this knowledge? Don’t just observe—strategize. The current neutral-to-bearish BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio suggests a few things. It may indicate a period of consolidation is underway before the next significant price move. Traders should watch for a decisive shift in this ratio, as it could precede strong momentum. Furthermore, use this data in conjunction with other indicators like funding rates and open interest for a more complete picture. The Final Verdict on Current Market Sentiment In conclusion, the latest BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data reveals a market at a crossroads. The slight dominance of short positions across Binance, OKX, and Bybit points to short-term caution among derivatives traders. However, the closeness of the numbers also shows a lack of strong conviction, leaving the door open for a rapid sentiment shift. For the astute observer, this equilibrium is a watchful waiting game, where the next tilt in the ratio could signal the direction of Bitcoin’s next major move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a perpetual futures contract? A perpetual futures contract is a derivative tool that allows traders to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date, using a funding rate mechanism to tether it to the spot price. How often does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio update? The data typically updates in real-time or at very short intervals (e.g., every few minutes or hourly), providing a near-live pulse of market sentiment. Is a high long ratio always bullish for the price? Not necessarily. Extremely high long ratios can indicate over-optimism or “crowded trades,” which sometimes precede sharp price corrections as positions are liquidated. Which exchange’s ratio is most important? Binance often holds the most weight due to its largest open interest, but analyzing all major exchanges together provides a more robust view of global sentiment. Can this ratio predict Bitcoin’s price? It is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It shows trader positioning, which can influence price, but should be used alongside technical and fundamental analysis.

He described it as one of the clearest interviews he has heard during his time investing in XRP. Hougan said XRP appeals to financial advisors for simple reasons. He called it “one of the Mount Rushmore assets in crypto.” He said advisors want assets that will persist, saying XRP’s long track record gives confidence it is “not going away.” He added that advisors understand use cases like cross-currency liquidity and stablecoins. Hougan also highlighted ETF inflows. He said it is rare for multiple XRP ETFs to succeed at the same time . He attributed that to XRP appealing to many communities at once. Coach JV viewed that as confirmation of depth rather than speculation. Diverging From the Crypto Cycle McClurg discussed market cycles and said the 4-year cycle still matters. However, some assets can diverge. He pointed to XRP holding up while other assets declined and said inflows continued daily. He said XRP could see another peak in 2026 , even if much of the market remains down.

This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the fragility inherent in even collateralized digital assets when market liquidity evaporates. What Caused the Solana-based Stablecoin USX to Depeg? Blockchain security firm PeckShield first flagged the alarming price movement. The Solana-based stablecoin USX, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, plummeted on secondary markets. The core issue wasn’t a failure of its underlying collateral but a severe shortage of immediate liquidity on exchanges. When sell orders overwhelmed available buy-side depth, the price disconnected from its intrinsic value, creating a temporary but severe market dislocation. How Did the USX Team Respond to the Crisis? The team behind the Solana-based stablecoin USX moved quickly to address concerns. They issued a statement clarifying a critical point: the stablecoin’s underlying and custodial assets remained secure and untouched. They emphasized that USX maintains a 100% collateralization ratio, meaning for every token in circulation, equivalent value is held in reserve. Therefore, the depegging was purely a market-driven liquidity event, not a solvency problem. Their immediate plan involves collaborating with market makers to inject continuous liquidity and prevent such volatility spikes in the future. Why is Liquidity So Vital for a Stablecoin? This event highlights a fundamental truth in cryptocurrency markets: collateral alone isn’t enough. A stablecoin’s health depends on two key pillars: Collateralization: The assets backing the token’s value. Liquidity: The ease of buying or selling the token at its intended price. The Solana-based stablecoin USX crisis was a failure of the second pillar. Without sufficient liquidity on trading venues, even a fully-backed asset can trade at a irrational discount, eroding user trust and causing panic. What Does This Mean for the Future of Solana DeFi? While the Solana-based stablecoin USX has recovered to $0.98, the incident leaves a lasting impression. It acts as a stress test, revealing a potential vulnerability. For the broader Solana decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, it underscores the need for: Robust Liquidity Protocols: Enhanced incentives for deep, resilient liquidity pools. Transparent Communication: Rapid, clear updates from projects during market stress. User Education: Understanding the difference between technical depegs and insolvency. The proactive response from the USX team is a positive step toward rebuilding confidence and strengthening the ecosystem’s infrastructure against similar shocks. Conclusion: Resilience Tested, Lessons Learned The brief depegging of the Solana-based stablecoin USX was a stark lesson in market mechanics. It proved that design and collateral are only part of the stability equation. The true test lies in maintaining robust liquidity across all market conditions. For investors and users, this event is a reminder to scrutinize both the backing and the market depth of any stablecoin. For projects, it’s a call to prioritize liquidity partnerships as a core component of operational security. The swift recovery shows resilience, but the path forward requires building even stronger safeguards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Solana-based stablecoin USX still safe to use? A: According to the team, its underlying assets are secure and it remains 100% collateralized. The depeg was a market liquidity issue, not a loss of funds. However, users should monitor its price stability on exchanges. Q: What exactly does ‘depegging’ mean? A: Depegging occurs when a stablecoin’s market price significantly deviates from its intended value (e.g., $1). In this case, the Solana-based stablecoin USX traded as low as $0.10 before recovering. Q: Did the USX protocol lose its collateral? A> No. The team confirmed that custodial assets were unaffected. The problem was isolated to trading venues lacking enough buy orders to absorb sells. Q: How can such a depegging be prevented in the future? A> Prevention relies on ensuring deep, continuous liquidity on exchanges, often through agreements with professional market makers who provide constant buy and sell orders. Q: Are other Solana stablecoins at risk? A> While this event is specific to USX, it highlights a universal risk for all stablecoins: low liquidity. The risk depends on each project’s individual liquidity arrangements and market depth. Q: Has the USX price fully recovered? A> At the time of the report, it had recovered to approximately $0.98, very close to its $1.00 peg. Found this analysis of the Solana-based stablecoin USX depegging insightful?

This zkPass listing is more than just another asset addition; it signals growing institutional interest in zero-knowledge proof technology and its real-world applications. What Does the zkPass Listing Mean for Investors? The immediate impact of this zkPass listing is increased accessibility. South Korean traders, who form a massive and active crypto market, can now easily buy, sell, and hold ZKP. Listing on multiple trading pairs (BTC, USDT, KRW) provides flexibility and reduces friction for both local and international users. This move typically brings heightened liquidity and visibility to a project, often leading to increased trading volume and price discovery. For the zkPass protocol, this endorsement from a top-tier exchange like Upbit serves as a major credibility boost, validating its technological premise in a competitive market. Why is Upbit’s Endorsement of zkPass a Big Deal? Upbit is not just any exchange; it’s a regulatory-compliant powerhouse in one of the world’s most crypto-engaged nations. Their listing process is known for being rigorous. Therefore, this zkPass listing implies that Upbit’s due diligence team sees substantial value and legitimacy in the zkPass project. It highlights a strategic shift towards supporting infrastructure projects that solve core Web3 issues, like privacy and secure data verification, rather than just speculative assets. This could pave the way for similar privacy-enhancing technologies to gain mainstream exchange support. What Challenges Could This zkPass Listing Face? However, every new listing comes with potential hurdles. The primary challenge will be market reception. While the technology is promising, the token’s price will face immediate volatility as it finds its footing on a major exchange. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny around privacy-focused tokens remains intense globally. Upbit’s compliance-focused approach mitigates this risk for now, but it’s a sector-wide concern. Finally, the project must now deliver on its roadmap under the spotlight of a much larger, more demanding investor base expecting tangible utility and adoption. Key Takeaways from the zkPass Listing Announcement Let’s break down the most actionable insights from this development: Enhanced Legitimacy: An Upbit listing acts as a strong signal of a project’s technical and operational soundness. Market Access: Korean and global investors gain direct, compliant access to a leading privacy protocol’s token. Focus on Utility: This move underscores a growing exchange preference for tokens with clear, functional use cases beyond speculation. Volatility Warning: New listings are notoriously volatile; investors should approach initial trading with caution and research. The Future of Privacy Tokens After This Listing This strategic zkPass listing by Upbit could be a watershed moment. It demonstrates that major, regulated platforms are willing to embrace complex privacy technologies when they offer genuine solutions. This could encourage other exchanges to broaden their listings beyond the usual suspects, fostering a more diverse and innovative crypto ecosystem. For developers in the zero-knowledge proof space, it provides a clearer pathway to market and user adoption. The success of ZKP on Upbit will be closely watched as a bellwether for the entire privacy token category. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Crypto Privacy The listing of zkPass on Upbit is a compelling development that merges high-grade exchange infrastructure with cutting-edge cryptographic technology. It provides a crucial bridge for a sophisticated privacy tool to reach a vast audience.

This zkPass listing is a confident step in that direction, offering investors not just a new token, but a stake in the evolving architecture of a more private and secure internet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is zkPass (ZKP)? zkPass is a privacy-preserving protocol that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It allows users to verify personal data (like KYC information) without revealing the underlying data itself, enabling secure and private transactions and interactions in Web3. When does the zkPass listing go live on Upbit? Trading for the ZKP token on Upbit is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m. UTC on the announcement date, against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Korean Won (KRW) trading pairs. Why is listing on Upbit important for a cryptocurrency? Upbit is South Korea’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchange. A listing there provides massive liquidity, legitimacy, and direct access to one of the world’s most active retail crypto trading markets. Are privacy tokens like ZKP safe from regulatory crackdowns? Privacy tokens face heightened regulatory scrutiny globally. However, Upbit’s compliance-focused listing suggests they have conducted due diligence. The regulatory landscape remains fluid, so this is a key risk factor for investors to monitor. What should I do before trading ZKP on Upbit? Conduct thorough research on the zkPass project, its technology, team, and roadmap. Understand the high volatility associated with new exchange listings. Only invest capital you are prepared to lose, and consider using limit orders to manage entry points. Does this mean other exchanges will list zkPass soon?

This signals a potential seismic shift in how traditional institutions view digital assets. Let’s unpack what this means for the future of banking and cryptocurrency. What Are Crypto-Backed Loans and Why Do They Matter? Simply put, crypto-backed loans allow you to use your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to borrow cash. You don’t sell your crypto; you lock it up to secure a loan. This provides liquidity without triggering a taxable event. For a giant like Sberbank to consider this, it’s a powerful endorsement of cryptocurrency’s value as a financial asset. Anatoly Popov, Sberbank’s deputy chairman, confirmed the bank’s readiness to develop this with regulators. However, Russia’s crypto regulation remains a work in progress. This creates a fascinating dance between innovation and compliance. What’s Driving Sberbank’s Crypto Ambition? Sberbank isn’t acting on a whim. Several strategic factors are at play. First, there’s significant demand from clients who hold digital assets but need traditional currency. Second, it positions Sberbank as a forward-thinking leader. Finally, it taps into a growing global trend of institutional crypto adoption. The potential benefits are substantial: Access to Capital: Crypto holders unlock the value of their assets without selling. Bank Expansion: Sberbank attracts a new, tech-savvy customer segment. Market Legitimacy: This move further legitimizes cryptocurrencies as collateral. What Are the Major Hurdles for Crypto-Backed Loans? Despite the excitement, the path isn’t smooth. The primary challenge is Russia’s evolving regulatory framework. Clear rules on custody, valuation, and liquidation are essential. Furthermore, cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility poses a real risk. A sudden price drop could leave loans under-collateralized. Therefore, Sberbank must build robust infrastructure. This includes secure custody solutions and reliable pricing oracles. The bank’s statement about cooperating with authorities is a crucial first step to navigate these waters safely. How Could This Change the Global Financial Landscape? Sberbank’s exploration is a bellwether. If successful, other major banks in emerging markets may follow. It bridges the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional banking. This could lead to more hybrid financial products that offer the best of both worlds. For the everyday person, it means more options. Imagine a small business owner using Bitcoin holdings to fund expansion. Or an individual accessing funds during a cash crunch without selling their long-term crypto investments. The possibilities are transformative. In conclusion, Sberbank’s consideration of crypto-backed loans is a landmark moment. It highlights the accelerating convergence of traditional and digital finance. While regulatory and technical hurdles remain, the direction is clear. The future of finance is becoming more inclusive, flexible, and digitally native. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto-backed loans? A: They are loans where you pledge your cryptocurrency as collateral to receive traditional currency (like rubles or dollars). You retain ownership of your crypto, but it is locked until you repay the loan. Q2: Why would someone use a crypto-backed loan instead of selling? A: To avoid capital gains taxes and maintain exposure to potential future price appreciation of their cryptocurrency. It provides immediate cash without a sale. Q3: Is Sberbank offering these loans right now? A: No. The bank has stated it is “considering” the service and is ready to work with regulators to develop the necessary framework and infrastructure. Q4: What are the biggest risks for the borrower? A: The main risk is volatility. If the value of your collateral falls significantly, you may face a “margin call” and need to add more crypto or risk having it liquidated to cover the loan. Q5: How does this help cryptocurrency adoption? A: When a major, state-owned bank treats crypto as legitimate loan collateral, it signals trust and utility to the broader market, encouraging more institutional and mainstream acceptance. Q6: Could other banks offer this soon? A: Sberbank’s move could pressure competitors. If they establish a successful model, banks in other regions with clearer crypto regulations might accelerate their own plans. Found this insight into the future of banking fascinating?

56383087,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254401,1766732111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japan’s Bold Move: Pioneering a New Era of Crypto and Stablecoin Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-new-crypto-regulation-division/,"BitcoinWorld Japan’s Bold Move: Pioneering a New Era of Crypto and Stablecoin Regulation In a decisive step that signals its commitment to becoming a global digital asset hub, Japan is set to overhaul its financial oversight framework. The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will establish a dedicated division for Japan crypto regulation next summer, specifically targeting virtual assets and stablecoins. This move underscores Japan’s proactive approach to balancing innovation with investor protection in a rapidly evolving market. Why is Japan Creating a Special Crypto Division? Japan has long been a frontrunner in establishing clear rules for digital assets. However, the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the global rise of stablecoins have created new complexities. The current regulatory structure, while robust, needed more specialized focus. Therefore, the FSA’s decision to create a standalone division is a direct response to these market developments. It aims to provide sharper oversight and foster a more secure environment for both businesses and consumers engaging with cryptocurrencies. What Does This Mean for Japan Crypto Regulation? The new division will concentrate its efforts on two primary areas: virtual assets (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) and payment-focused stablecoins. This specialized focus is crucial. It means regulators can develop deeper expertise, craft more nuanced policies, and respond faster to emerging trends than a general financial bureau could. The plan is part of a broader organizational reshuffle that also creates an Asset Management and Insurance Supervision Bureau, showing a comprehensive upgrade of Japan’s financial watchdog capabilities. The implications are significant for the industry: Clearer Guidelines: Companies can expect more tailored and predictable regulatory frameworks. Enhanced Security: Increased oversight aims to reduce fraud and protect users. Boosted Innovation: Legal certainty often attracts investment and encourages responsible technological development. How Will Stablecoins Be Affected by Japan’s New Rules? Stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the yen or dollar, are a key target for the new division. Japan passed a groundbreaking law to regulate stablecoins in 2022, restricting their issuance to licensed banks, trust companies, and money transfer agents. The new FSA division will be the primary body enforcing these rules, ensuring stablecoin issuers operate with the same rigor as traditional financial institutions. This could set a powerful global precedent for how nations oversee these pivotal payment instruments. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While the move is widely seen as positive, challenges remain. Regulators must avoid stifling innovation with overly restrictive rules. They also need to coordinate with international bodies to manage cross-border crypto activities effectively. However, the opportunities are immense. By building a reputation for strong yet sensible Japan crypto regulation , the country positions itself as a safe harbor for legitimate crypto businesses. This could attract significant foreign investment and talent, solidifying Tokyo’s status as a leading financial technology center. In summary, Japan’s creation of a dedicated crypto and stablecoin division is a landmark development. It reflects a mature, forward-thinking strategy to integrate digital assets into the formal economy. This structured approach not only mitigates risks but also actively cultivates a thriving and secure ecosystem for the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will Japan’s new crypto regulatory division start operating? A1: The division is scheduled to be established in the summer of 2024 as part of the FSA’s approved organizational restructuring. Q2: What is the main goal of this new division? A2: Its primary goal is to provide specialized oversight and develop tailored policies for the virtual asset and stablecoin markets, enhancing both consumer protection and market innovation. Q3: How does this affect existing crypto exchanges in Japan? A3: Existing licensed exchanges will engage with this new, more specialized regulator. It may lead to clearer operational guidelines and potentially more efficient licensing processes for new services. Q4: Will this make Japan a more attractive market for crypto companies? A4: Yes, likely. Clear and expert regulation reduces legal uncertainty, which is a major factor for businesses considering where to establish operations. Japan’s move signals stability and long-term commitment. Q5: Does this mean Japan is banning any crypto activities? A5> No, quite the opposite. This move is about creating a structured, safe environment for crypto activities to grow, not to ban them. It’s an endorsement of the sector’s importance. Q6: How does Japan’s stablecoin regulation compare to other countries? A6: Japan is among the first major economies to enact specific laws regulating stablecoin issuance, placing it at the forefront of global regulatory efforts in this area.

The clip featured comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on financial regulation, capital markets, and payment systems. In the clip, Bessent spoke about reviewing regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems. He also discussed reforms aimed at strengthening American capital markets and improving access. Adding to his comments, Rietveld stated that XRP is built to fit that role Bessent described. $XRP Is Built For This! pic.twitter.com/WNDUoeFPC4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 22, 2025 A Focus on Removing Regulatory Barriers Bessent spoke directly about the need to confront outdated rules. “We will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems,” he said. That statement is crucial for assets built around real-world use cases and payments. XRP was created to move value quickly, at low cost, and across borders. Regulatory friction has limited adoption in key markets. A push to reassess those barriers signals a shift away from restrictive frameworks that slow innovation. Bessent also tied reform to market strength. He said policymakers would “consider reforms to unleash the awesome power of the American capital markets.” XRP operates at the intersection of payments and capital flows. A system that clears transactions faster supports deeper liquidity and more efficient settlement . Stablecoins and Payment Infrastructure Bessent’s reference to stablecoins and new payment systems also aligns with the XRP ecosystem. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is built for regulated payments and settlement, targeting institutional and compliant use cases. RLUSD settles in seconds on the XRP Ledger with low and predictable fees. As transaction volume grows, network activity increases, and XRP is used for transaction fees, directly linking stablecoin adoption to demand for XRP .

The money didn’t come from product launches or economic growth. It came from people betting big on chips, servers, and promises. By Christmas Eve, the top 10 tech founders and CEOs controlled nearly $2.5 trillion, up from $1.9 trillion at the beginning of the year, according to Bloomberg. The massive jump came as the S&P 500 climbed more than 18%, and the hype around AI infrastructure kept stocks like Tesla, Nvidia, and Oracle inflated. “This is all speculative and correlated to the success of AI,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and OpenAI consultant. “There’s a huge question mark over whether this is all going to pay off, but investors are betting that it will.” Musk retakes top spot as Oracle and Meta stumble Elon Musk ended the year back on top, with a net worth now sitting at $645 billion, a 49% jump. Cryptopolitan had reported that Elon briefly fell behind Larry Ellison in September, but a $1 trillion Tesla pay deal helped pull him ahead again. His rocket company SpaceX, now worth $800 billion, also added to his stack. Larry, who runs Oracle, had hit $251 billion this year after announcing a $300 billion data center contract with OpenAI. That deal gave his net worth a 31% lift. But after reaching that high, Oracle’s stock dropped 40%, as investors started asking questions about how he planned to fund such a huge build-out. Mark Zuckerberg, who oversees Meta, saw his rank drop after the company’s stock slipped. Investors weren’t thrilled about how much Meta has been spending on AI servers and big-name talent. Zuckerberg’s net worth still grew 14% to $236 billion, but that wasn’t enough to keep him in the top five. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded Google, both shot up the ladder this year. Page is now worth $270 billion, up 61%, while Brin hit $251 billion, with a 59% gain. Their push into building AI models and chips gave them the edge they needed to leap ahead of Zuck and Larry El. Nvidia’s Huang cashes out as Gates drops off Jensen Huang, who founded Nvidia, saw his wealth grow 37%, ending the year at $156 billion. Nvidia became the most valuable public company in the world this year, now worth over $4 trillion, though Jensen has also sold over $1 billion worth of stock, this year. Jeff Bezos wasn’t quiet either. He offloaded $5.6 billion worth of Amazon shares, ending the year at $255 billion, up 7%. Michael Dell sold more than $2 billion in Dell stock and now holds $141 billion, a 14% increase. At the bottom of the pile sits Billy Gates. He’s the only one in the top 10 whose net worth dropped. He sold off chunks of his Microsoft stock throughout the year to keep funding his charity work, bringing his total down 26% to $118 billion.

All eyes are fixed on one economic indicator that could send shockwaves through currency markets: the Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI). This isn’t just another data release—it’s a potential catalyst that could force the Bank of Japan to abandon its ultra-loose monetary policy stance, reshaping the entire regional currency dynamic. For cryptocurrency traders watching traditional finance signals, this moment represents a crucial intersection where inflation data meets central bank credibility. Why Tokyo CPI Data Holds the Key to Asia FX Direction In the world of currency markets , Tokyo’s inflation numbers serve as the most reliable leading indicator for nationwide Japanese price trends. Unlike other economic reports that might offer mixed signals, the Tokyo CPI provides the first concrete evidence each month of whether inflationary pressures are building or receding in Japan’s economy. This makes it particularly significant for the Bank of Japan , which has maintained negative interest rates while other major central banks have been aggressively tightening policy. The upcoming release isn’t just about numbers—it’s about whether Japan’s central bank can maintain its current stance or will be forced into a policy pivot that could trigger massive currency movements across Asia FX pairs. The Thin Volume Trap: Navigating Dangerous Currency Markets Current currency markets present a particularly treacherous environment for traders. With many Western participants away for holiday periods and Asian markets operating with reduced staffing, liquidity has evaporated from several key pairs. This creates a dangerous scenario where even moderate-sized trades can trigger exaggerated price movements. Consider these critical factors affecting Asia FX trading conditions: Reduced Market Depth: Order books are thinner than usual, meaning support and resistance levels may not hold as expected Increased Volatility Risk: The combination of thin volumes and pending economic data creates perfect conditions for sudden price spikes Liquidity Concentration: Trading activity has concentrated in fewer currency pairs, primarily USD/JPY and AUD/USD Algorithmic Dominance: With human traders less active, algorithmic systems may dominate price action, potentially creating erratic movements Bank of Japan’s Dilemma: Inflation Versus Economic Stability The Bank of Japan faces what might be its most challenging policy decision in decades. On one hand, Governor Kazuo Ueda has repeatedly emphasized the need to maintain accommodative conditions to support Japan’s fragile economic recovery. On the other hand, persistent inflation above the 2% target threatens to undermine the central bank’s credibility and could trigger a disorderly yen depreciation. The upcoming Tokyo CPI data will provide crucial evidence about which pressure is winning. For Asia FX traders, understanding this dilemma is essential—a hawkish pivot from the BOJ would strengthen the yen and potentially weaken other Asian currencies, while continued dovishness could trigger further yen weakness and boost regional export competitors. Currency Pair Current Level Key Resistance Key Support Tokyo CPI Impact Scenario USD/JPY 148.50 150.00 147.00 Above-forecast CPI could trigger break below 147.00 AUD/JPY 97.80 99.00 96.50 Higher inflation may push pair toward 96.00 support EUR/JPY 160.25 162.00 158.50 Strong CPI data could test 158.00 level CNY/JPY 20.45 20.70 20.20 BOJ policy shift might strengthen cross to 20.00 Monetary Policy Crossroads: How Asian Central Banks Are Reacting The Bank of Japan ‘s impending decision doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it comes at a time when regional central banks are already navigating complex monetary policy challenges. South Korea’s central bank has maintained a hawkish bias despite economic headwinds, while the Reserve Bank of Australia has paused its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing inflation. China’s People’s Bank of China continues to provide targeted stimulus to support economic recovery. This creates a fascinating dynamic for Asia FX markets: a BOJ policy shift could either trigger coordinated regional responses or create divergent paths that increase currency volatility. The Tokyo CPI data will provide the first clue about whether Asian central banks will face renewed pressure to align their policies or can continue on independent paths. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Tokyo CPI Release Trading the Tokyo CPI release requires more than just watching the headline number. Savvy currency markets participants should consider these strategic approaches: Focus on Core Measures: The Bank of Japan pays closest attention to core-core CPI (excluding fresh food and energy). This measure provides the clearest signal about underlying inflation trends Watch Yield Curve Control: Any hint that the BOJ might adjust its yield curve control parameters could be more significant than interest rate changes themselves Monitor Currency Intervention Levels: Japanese authorities have previously intervened around the 152 level in USD/JPY. Current levels are approaching this danger zone Consider Correlation Plays: A stronger yen typically pressures other Asian currencies. Consider how USD/JPY movements might affect AUD/USD, USD/CNH, and USD/KRW Prepare for False Breaks: Thin volumes mean initial reactions might be exaggerated. Wait for confirmation before committing to new positions The Cryptocurrency Connection: How Traditional FX Moves Impact Digital Assets For cryptocurrency traders, developments in Asia FX markets might seem distant, but they create important ripple effects. A significant yen movement can influence broader risk sentiment, which directly affects cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, any shift in Bank of Japan policy could change capital flows between traditional and digital assets. Japanese investors have been active participants in cryptocurrency markets, and changes in domestic monetary conditions could alter their investment behavior. Furthermore, as regulatory frameworks evolve, the relationship between traditional currency markets and digital assets continues to strengthen, making events like the Tokyo CPI release relevant to a broader spectrum of financial market participants. FAQs: Understanding the Tokyo CPI and Asia FX Dynamics What exactly is the Tokyo CPI and why is it so important? The Tokyo Consumer Price Index measures price changes for goods and services in Japan’s capital city. It’s released about a month before the national CPI, making it the earliest reliable indicator of Japanese inflation trends. For the Bank of Japan , this data provides crucial evidence about whether inflationary pressures are becoming entrenched in the economy. How might the Bank of Japan react to stronger-than-expected inflation data? The Bank of Japan faces a delicate balancing act. Strong inflation could force Governor Kazuo Ueda to consider several options: adjusting yield curve control parameters, ending negative interest rates, or simply signaling a more hawkish future path. Any of these actions would likely strengthen the yen and create volatility across Asia FX markets. Which Asian currencies are most sensitive to Bank of Japan policy changes? The South Korean won (KRW) and Australian dollar (AUD) typically show the strongest reactions to yen movements, as these economies compete with Japan in key export markets. The Chinese yuan (CNY) also responds, though often through managed channels. Emerging market currencies throughout Southeast Asia can experience secondary effects as capital flows adjust to changing interest rate differentials. How do thin trading volumes affect market reactions to economic data? Reduced liquidity means that price movements can be exaggerated and less reflective of fundamental value. Stop-loss orders may be triggered more easily, and spreads between bid and ask prices can widen significantly. This creates both danger and opportunity in currency markets , as initial reactions may reverse once normal liquidity returns. What should cryptocurrency traders watch during this period? Cryptocurrency traders should monitor USD/JPY as a key risk sentiment indicator. Significant yen strength often corresponds with reduced risk appetite, which can pressure cryptocurrency prices. Additionally, watch for any statements from Japan’s Financial Services Agency regarding digital asset regulation, as policy coordination between traditional and crypto markets continues to evolve. Conclusion: The Calm Before the Currency Storm The current subdued trading in Asia FX markets represents the calm before a potential storm. The Tokyo CPI release isn’t just another economic statistic—it’s a trigger that could force the Bank of Japan to confront reality after years of extraordinary monetary accommodation. For traders across all currency markets , this moment requires careful positioning, disciplined risk management, and awareness that thin volumes can transform ordinary data releases into market-moving events. The decisions made in Tokyo will reverberate through Asian trading desks, influence global capital flows, and potentially reshape currency relationships for months to come. In this environment, information isn’t just power—it’s profit.

Major exchange Bithumb will delist EVZ , ceasing all trading support for the token on January 26. This decision highlights the rigorous standards exchanges enforce and serves as a crucial reminder for token holders. Let’s break down exactly what happened and what you need to do next. Why is Bithumb Delisting EVZ? The core reason for the Bithumb delist EVZ action stems from compliance and transparency issues. According to the exchange’s official notice, the EVZ project foundation failed to provide sufficient explanatory materials after being flagged as an “investment warning” item. Furthermore, Bithumb reviewed the damage from a past security incident involving the token and the foundation’s subsequent public statements. The exchange concluded that EVZ no longer meets its criteria for maintaining a listing, leading to the scheduled removal. What Does the Bithumb EVZ Delisting Timeline Look Like? Bithumb has set a clear schedule for the Bithumb delist EVZ process. All trading support for EVZ will end precisely at 06:00 AM UTC on Friday, January 26. Therefore, token holders have a limited window to take action. Here is the critical timeline: Trading Halt: EVZ/KRW trading stops at 06:00 AM UTC, Jan 26. Withdrawal Deadline: Users must withdraw their EVZ tokens from Bithumb before a specified future date (to be announced). Post-Delisting: After the deadline, withdrawals will be suspended, and unclaimed tokens may be handled according to the exchange’s policy. This decisive action underscores that exchanges like Bithumb continuously monitor listed projects. Failure to meet ongoing requirements for communication, security, and regulatory cooperation can result in removal. How Should EVZ Holders on Bithumb Respond? If you hold EVZ tokens on Bithumb, immediate action is required. You cannot afford to be passive. First, you must decide whether to sell your EVZ holdings before the trading halt or withdraw them to a private, self-custody wallet that supports the token. The safest course is often to move your assets off the exchange before the deadline to maintain control. Always double-check the destination wallet address to avoid irreversible loss. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Listings Overall? The Bithumb delist EVZ event is not an isolated case. It reflects a broader trend of increasing scrutiny in the crypto industry. Exchanges are tightening their listing standards to protect users and comply with evolving regulations. For investors, this means: Due Diligence is Key: Research a project’s team, communication history, and security record before investing. Listing is Not Permanent: A token’s presence on a major exchange is not a guarantee of its long-term viability. Compliance Matters: Projects must maintain transparent and cooperative relationships with trading platforms. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that the market is maturing. Accountability from both projects and exchanges is becoming the new norm. Conclusion: A Lesson in Market Accountability The decision for Bithumb to delist EVZ is a clear signal of the exchange’s commitment to its operational standards. While disruptive for current holders, such actions are essential for a healthy ecosystem. They filter out projects that fail to meet basic requirements for transparency and security, ultimately protecting the broader investor community. As the market evolves, both investors and projects must prioritize robust fundamentals and clear communication. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What time exactly will Bithumb stop EVZ trading? A: Trading for EVZ on Bithumb will cease at 06:00 AM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on January 26. Q: Can I still withdraw my EVZ from Bithumb after January 26? A: Yes, Bithumb typically provides a withdrawal period after trading stops. However, you must complete your withdrawal before their announced final deadline to avoid losing access to your tokens on the platform. Q: Why did Bithumb decide to delist EVZ? A: Bithumb cited the EVZ foundation’s failure to submit sufficient materials regarding its “investment warning” designation and concerns stemming from a past security incident and the project’s public statements. Q: Will EVZ be traded on other exchanges after this? A: The Bithumb delisting does not automatically affect EVZ listings on other exchanges. However, the reasons for delisting may prompt reviews by other platforms. You should check the status on any other exchange where EVZ is listed. Q: What is the safest action for me as an EVZ holder on Bithumb? A: The most prudent action is to either sell your EVZ before the deadline or securely withdraw it to a compatible private wallet that you control, ensuring you maintain custody of your assets. Q: Does this mean EVZ is a scam? A: Bithumb’s announcement indicates EVZ failed to meet the exchange’s specific listing criteria, particularly around communication and compliance. It is a serious mark against the project but does not independently classify it as a scam. Investors should conduct their own thorough research.

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was captured by Russian troops in March 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed a joint operation of the Plant with the US. He said the issue of Zaporizhzhia remains one of the most challenging points of the US peace plan for Ukraine. International communities, including the IAEA, have repeatedly stressed that any decisions regarding the plant without Ukraine’s participation are illegal. Ukraine Power Grid Crisis The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is currently not generating electricity for the grid due to its seizure by Russia in March 2022. Its six reactors are in a safety shutdown and depend solely on emergency diesel generators for essential cooling, with frequent cuts. Besides, more Russian drones and missiles than in previous years have left energy supplies at a tipping point. Per a WSJ report , Russia launched more than 5,000 missiles and long-range drones into Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure. Analysts at the private intelligence agency Molfar said in a study that three active crypto mining pools with six miners in Ukraine likely consumed 33 kW per hour. The data was collected from July 2023 to June 2024 using various open sources.

According to the technical indicators, SUI has recorded 12 bullish days in the last thirty, signalling a bearish market. The charts also indicate that it now trades below $1.45 and is bearish. Its volatility is waning on the shorter timeframes. Why is SUI down?

Solana withstood a record 6 Tbps DDoS attack on December 14 without downtime. In contrast, Sui suffered delayed block production and degraded performance during a similar attack. While the 24h move was mild, the lack of bullish catalysts keeps the trend bearish. Recent news SUI was included in Bitwise’s Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, which holds 10 major cryptocurrencies. This ETF attracted $1.5B in assets, offering institutional investors regulated exposure to SUI alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Will SUI reach $10?

They tend to emerge as supply contracts, time evaporates, and interest has begun to cluster privately. That is our current position of this altcoin, which is priced at $0.035. With its ongoing stage heading towards the completion end, analysts and first movers are on the lookout. It is a setup that is starting to get used to those questioning what crypto they need to get currently before the next shift. The focal point of this focus is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is a DeFi crypto that has been organizing steadily. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is developing as a decentralized protocol of lending and borrowing, wherein two models are considered. The peer to contract lending is the first one. Users deposit assets to liquidity pools and are given back mtTokens. These mtTokens are a part of their portion of the pool and get valuable with accruing interests. As an illustration, a user who deposits into a pool with the value of $6,000 in ETH, at a 7% APY, would observe an increase in the value of his or her mtTokens over time. The yield is automatic and reflects directly on the token balance. The second one is peer to peer borrowing. Under specified terms, borrowers borrow money under collateralized terms. The borrow rates will vary according to utilization or can be fixed or fixed according to the asset. The loan to value limits are established as per volatility. The less risky assets will be enabled to have greater LTVs, whereas the greater the risk of the token, the lower the limit. In case the collateral value is too low, the liquidations take place to ensure survival of the system and keep it liquid. Mutuum Finance is frequently remarked by analysts as having the flexibility to balance risk like traditional applications, as the majority of newer projects in DeFi have not. Momentum Presale and Supply Structure One of the best indicators in and around this new cryptocurrency has been Presale demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $19.45M and 18,650 current holders. There are 825M tokens that have been sold. The supply on the network is capped at 4B tokens, of which 45.5% are distributed to the presale, amounting to approximately 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is already over 99% allocated, i.e. supply at its current price is nearly exhausted. The course of price speaks for itself. Phase 1 investors joined at $0.01. MURM’s present presale value is at $0.035, which has increased by 250% in the presale only. The formal introduction price is pegged at $0.06 which puts the first movers in a good position compared to the present point. There has been a high level of community activity. A 24 hour leaderboard supports the highest daily depositor with $500 in MUTM making it a key motivating factor to maintain the engagements and so to speak cut the allocation. Market commentators commonly observe that a long-term involvement may be taken as a sign of confidence, and not a sign of short term frenzy. V1 Launch, Security and Analyst Outlook The milestones of development are looming soon. In the official statements posted on X , V1 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending and borrowing protocol will be available on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Main elements will consist of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and an automated liquidator robot. The first assets supported will be ETH and USDT. Security has been tackled at the onset. Mutuum Finance has now undergone a CertiK audit of 90/100 token scan rating. Moreover, there is an ongoing independent audit of Halborn security , which evaluates completed contracts. The early adoption of audited code and working protocol can have a major impact on early adoption according to some analysts. In the bullish scenarios, it has been projected that increasing the current level of around $0.035 to and above launch price of $0.06 would help to sustain 200% to 300% growth over time provided that utility centers in the case of usage develop as anticipated. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Plans In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance is going to launch a stablecoin which is pegged to various assets according to the official roadmap. This enables the borrowers to resort to a variety of collateral instead of having only one token. The system is able to distribute risks thus making it more stable amidst unstable market conditions. The roadmap also includes layer 2 integration. Reduced charges and quicker processing is paramount to lending conditions in which customers and clients conduct transactions regularly. Lower prices make access easier and wider involvement is possible which analysts have been credited with as a defining factor in long term adoption. Everything will be based on reliable pricing. The protocol architecture projects decentralized oracle feeds like Chainlink, which are backed by fallback sources. Precise pricing holds critical importance in collateral valuation and liquidations particularly in nimble movements in the market. Final Thoughts With Phase 6 close at hand of fulfillment, this is an altcoin that is coming to a critical juncture. The presale demand, the stipulated supply restrictions, and future development targets are also on the same page convergence. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto that represents the potential best cheap cryptocurrency to monitor prior to the next step instead of being a hype-driven investment project. The window of early positioning is closing rapidly, with allocation almost in place, and V1 almost ahead.

According to a report from The Block, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison is scheduled for release from custody on January 21, 2026 . This date marks a significant moment, arriving one month earlier than her originally scheduled release. For those following the fallout from the FTX implosion, the Caroline Ellison release represents a pivotal point in the ongoing story of accountability and consequence in the crypto world. What Led to the Caroline Ellison Release Date? Ellison’s path to this early release began with her cooperation in the massive case against FTX and Alameda Research. She was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy. Her testimony was crucial in the trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The judicial system often reduces sentences for substantial cooperation, which explains her transfer to a halfway house in mid-December and this accelerated Caroline Ellison release timeline. Why Was Caroline Ellison a Central Figure in the FTX Saga? To understand the weight of her release, we must look at her role. As CEO of Alameda Research, Ellison was at the helm of FTX’s sister trading firm. Prosecutors proved that she, under direction, used billions in FTX customer funds to prop up Alameda’s risky bets. This direct link between the exchange and the hedge fund was the core of the fraud. Her admission of guilt and detailed court testimony painted a clear picture of the mechanisms behind the collapse. Key Admission: Ellison confessed to creating misleading financial documents to hide Alameda’s massive debt from lenders and investors. Central Role: She managed the day-to-day operations where FTX customer funds were improperly funneled. Cooperation: Her decision to plead guilty and work with prosecutors was a turning point in the government’s case. What Does an Early Release Signal for the Crypto Industry? The Caroline Ellison release is more than a personal milestone; it’s a symbol. For the industry, it closes a chapter on one of its darkest periods. However, it also serves as a permanent reminder of the need for robust oversight and ethical leadership. Her case demonstrated that individuals face real consequences for fraud, even in the innovative and fast-moving crypto space. The conclusion of her sentence allows the market and its observers to continue focusing on building more transparent and trustworthy systems. What Comes After Prison for Caroline Ellison? With her release imminent, questions naturally turn to the future. What will life after prison look like for the former executive? While she has fulfilled her legal sentence, the professional and personal repercussions are lifelong. She is likely to face years of scrutiny and a drastically changed career landscape. Furthermore, her story will remain a case study in corporate governance failures for years to come. The Caroline Ellison release on January 21, 2026, draws a definitive line under a major part of the FTX narrative. It underscores a simple truth in finance, whether traditional or digital: accountability follows misconduct. Her early departure from custody concludes the penal portion of her journey, but the lessons from her actions continue to resonate powerfully across the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Trading firm QCP Capital executed a substantial QCP Capital deposit of Bitcoin and Ethereum to Binance, a move often scrutinized for its potential market implications. This transaction, involving tens of millions in value, provides a real-time case study in institutional behavior and its ripple effects. What Does the QCP Capital Deposit to Binance Mean? On-chain analytics provider OnchainLenz reported the transaction. A wallet linked to QCP Capital transferred 400 BTC (worth ~$35.7M) and 200 ETH (worth ~$597K) to the Binance exchange. In the crypto ecosystem, large deposits from private wallets to centralized exchanges are frequently interpreted as preparatory steps for selling. This QCP Capital deposit therefore acts as a potential indicator of near-term selling pressure, offering a glimpse into the strategic moves of a major player. Why Do Large Exchange Deposits Matter for Crypto Prices? Understanding this flow is crucial for market sentiment. When assets move to an exchange, they typically become more liquid and readily available for sale. Consequently, the market often views such movements with caution. However, it’s not a definitive sell signal. The deposit could also precede other activities like: Collateralization for trading derivatives or loans. OTC (Over-the-Counter) desk facilitation for a large private sale. Simple portfolio rebalancing between cold storage and active trading accounts. Therefore, while the QCP Capital deposit is a significant data point, it requires context alongside other market factors. How Can Traders Interpret Institutional Moves Like This? For individual investors, reacting to single transactions is risky. The key is to integrate this information into a broader analysis. This specific QCP Capital deposit highlights the importance of monitoring on-chain data. By watching the flows of large holders, often called “whales,” traders can gauge potential shifts in supply and demand. The actionable insight here is vigilance, not immediate action. Watch for follow-up on-chain activity, such as if the funds are withdrawn back to cold storage or if large sell orders appear on Binance’s order books. What Are the Broader Implications for Bitcoin and Ethereum? This event underscores the mature, institutional nature of today’s crypto markets. Firms like QCP Capital manage enormous portfolios, and their operational moves can influence short-term volatility. For Bitcoin and Ethereum, such deposits test market depth and resilience. A successful absorption of potential selling pressure from a $36.3 million QCP Capital deposit would demonstrate strong underlying demand. Conversely, it could trigger a brief downturn if the market sentiment is already fragile. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The recent QCP Capital deposit to Binance is a powerful reminder that crypto markets are transparent ledgers. Major moves are visible to all, providing valuable, if sometimes ambiguous, signals. While it suggests a potential increase in sell-side liquidity, smart traders will use it as one piece of a larger puzzle, combining it with technical analysis, macroeconomic trends, and other on-chain metrics before making decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the QCP Capital deposit a guaranteed sign they will sell? A: Not guaranteed. While often a precursor to selling, large exchange deposits can also be for collateral, OTC trades, or fund management. Q2: How was the wallet identified as belonging to QCP Capital? A: Analytics firms use clustering heuristics, past transaction patterns, and known addresses to label wallets, though it’s often an educated presumption. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this news? A> Making a trading decision based on a single transaction is not advisable. Use it as contextual data within your overall strategy. Q4: What is the difference between an exchange deposit and a transfer? A: A deposit to an exchange moves funds into its custodial wallet for trading. A transfer between two private wallets does not directly increase immediate sell pressure. Q5: Where can I track similar on-chain transactions? A: Platforms like Etherscan, Blockchain.com explorers, and dedicated analytics services like Glassnode or Nansen provide this data. Found this analysis of the QCP Capital deposit insightful?

The trading halt is set for 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 26, 2026. This decision sends a clear message about the exchange’s commitment to rigorous asset standards and directly impacts DICE holders. Let’s break down the reasons and repercussions. Why is Bithumb Delisting Klaydice (DICE)? The core reason for the Bithumb delist Klaydice action stems from unresolved regulatory concerns. Bithumb had previously flagged DICE as an “investment warning asset.” The Klaydice foundation submitted materials to address these issues, but the exchange found them insufficient. Therefore, after a comprehensive review of the token’s trading activity and overall market adoption, Bithumb concluded DICE no longer meets its criteria for continued support. What Does This Delisting Mean for Investors? If you hold DICE on Bithumb, immediate action is required. The exchange will suspend all trading pairs for DICE at the specified time. After that, you will not be able to buy, sell, or trade the token on their platform. However, you can still withdraw your DICE tokens to a private wallet that supports them. Here is a quick checklist for affected users: Stop Trading: Cease all DICE trading activity on Bithumb before the deadline. Withdraw Funds: Move your DICE tokens to a compatible external wallet if you wish to retain them. Explore Alternatives: Research other exchanges that may still support DICE trading, understanding the risks involved. How Do Exchanges Like Bithumb Decide to Delist a Token? The decision to delist Klaydice wasn’t made lightly. Exchanges like Bithumb constantly monitor listed assets against a set of strict criteria. These often include: Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to local and international financial regulations. Trading Volume & Liquidity: Sustained healthy market activity. Project Development & Communication: Active development and transparent communication from the project team. Community & Market Stability: Avoiding assets associated with excessive volatility or manipulation. In the case of DICE, the failure to resolve the “investment warning” status was the critical failing point. What’s Next for the Klaydice (DICE) Project? Being delisted from a major exchange like Bithumb is a serious challenge for any cryptocurrency project. It typically leads to reduced liquidity, lower visibility, and can shake investor confidence. The onus is now on the Klaydice foundation to demonstrate stronger compliance and project viability to other platforms and its community. This event serves as a stark reminder of the importance of regulatory diligence in the crypto space. Conclusion: A Lesson in Crypto Due Diligence The Bithumb delist Klaydice announcement underscores a vital trend: major exchanges are tightening their listing standards to protect users and ensure market integrity. For investors, it reinforces the need for thorough research, focusing on projects with clear utility, strong governance, and proactive compliance. Always remember that in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, exchange support is not guaranteed and can change based on evolving standards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When exactly will Bithumb delist DICE? Bithumb will suspend all trading for Klaydice (DICE) at 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 26, 2026. Can I still withdraw my DICE tokens after delisting? Yes, Bithumb will allow users to withdraw their DICE tokens to a private wallet for a period after trading is suspended. Check their official announcement for the specific withdrawal deadline. Why was DICE given an “investment warning” status? While Bithumb’s full report isn’t public, “investment warning” status is typically assigned due to concerns over regulatory compliance, low liquidity, or issues with the project’s transparency and development activity. Will DICE be traded on other exchanges? It may still be available on other, smaller exchanges. However, investors should carefully research the reputation and security of any alternative platform. What should I do if my DICE tokens are on Bithumb? You should either trade them for another asset or withdraw them to your own non-custodial wallet before the delisting deadline to maintain control over your assets. Does this mean the Klaydice project is shutting down? Not necessarily. Delisting from one exchange does not mean the project ceases operation. However, it is a significant setback that the project team must address. Share Your Thoughts Delistings are pivotal moments that affect entire communities. Did this decision surprise you?

The sharp wick appeared isolated to BTC/USD1, a market quoted in USD1, a stablecoin launched by Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial. Within seconds, the pair snapped back toward prevailing bitcoin prices above $87,000, according to exchange data cited by traders sharing the screenshot. CZ’s explanation was straightforward: on an illiquid order book, a single aggressive order can print an extreme price before arbitrage closes the gap. “This actually shows the exchange is NOT involved in trades. Low liquidity on new pairs means one large market order can spike prices, but arbitrageurs quickly corrected it. No liquidations occurred, as this pair isn’t included in any index.” The Binance founder shared a breakdown from Head of Business Development of Solv Protocol Catherine Chan who said the move was “a liquidity event,” not a bitcoin collapse. She tied the dislocation to a Binance-and-USD1 promotion offering a 20% fixed APY deposit deal that, she claimed, pushed users to swap USDT into USD1 and briefly drove USD1 to a premium. “Many users swapped USDT → USD1, pushing USD1 to a 0.39% premium: huge for a stablecoin. Smart money borrowed USD1 on @lista_dao against SolvBTC or SolvBTC-BTCB smart lending markets (~0.5% APY). They either deposited USD1 directly or sold it slowly on spot to meet demand. Then someone thought: ‘Why not just sell via BTC/USD1?’ They used a market order. Problem: BTC/USD1 has very thin liquidity. That market order wiped out most buy orders, briefly causing a very low price,” Catherine explained. “Arbitrage bots instantly bought it back,” she wrote. “No fundamentals changed. No mass liquidations.” The episode also picked up a familiar edge of crypto paranoia. One user, Bera (@doomsdart), framed it as a coordinated signal: “Cz and Trump family are telling us what they’re gonna do to our coins. Get ready.” CZ’s reply, by contrast, suggested the opposite — that the speed of arbitrage, and the absence of cascading liquidations, is evidence the venue wasn’t “printing” a market-wide price at all. For traders, the takeaway is less dramatic than the screenshot implied, but still relevant: new quote-asset pairs can be structurally fragile, and promotions that rapidly concentrate flow into a single stablecoin can leave unusually thin order books in their wake. In that kind of market, a single market order can create a headline before it creates a trend.

This move has begun to reshape the market’s perception of the asset. His post focused on holder profitability, a metric that often reveals pressure building beneath the surface before major moves occur. According to Steph, almost 50% of XRP’s circulating supply is now underwater. He noted that the share of supply in profit has dropped to 52% after weeks of steady decline .

As XRP’s price weakened, the profitable supply fell. This signals that more tokens last moved at higher prices than current levels. In past cycles, this metric has worked as a stress gauge for the market. When most holders sit in profit, selling pressure rises as investors lock in gains. When profitability compresses toward the middle or lower range, selling often slows. Fewer holders want to realize losses. Supply tightens, and XRP’s price becomes more sensitive to new demand . The current reading places XRP in that compression zone. Nearly half of all circulating XRP now reflects unrealized losses. That condition tends to increase emotional risk during further downside, but it also removes a large portion of immediate sell pressure from profit-takers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Repeating History? Steph pointed out that XRP last reached similar profitability levels in November 2024. At that time, the market showed the same deterioration in holder profit before price reversed sharply. XRP then rallied more than 500% in the months that followed. The comparison relies on structure, and not sentiment or narrative shifts. In November 2024, XRP moved from a state where losses dominated supply into a rapid repricing phase once demand returned. The current setup mirrors that earlier period in terms of supply positioning. Markets never offer certainty, but the historical parallel strengthens the bullish case. If demand stabilizes or increases, even modest inflows can have a huge effect on XRP. With fewer holders in profit, resistance from overhead supply weakens. Downside risk may already be well distributed across holders, and we could see XRP repeat history if buyers step in forcefully.

BLOX provides indirect exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, blending ETPs, crypto-related equities, and active options trading for income generation. Distributions are largely classified as return of capital, offering tax deferral benefits for taxable accounts, though recent payouts have declined with crypto weakness. BLOX may outperform in a prolonged crypto downturn by providing steady income, but will lag pure-play crypto funds if the sector rebounds sharply. For anyone that's been living under a rock, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other major cryptocurrencies have not been doing so well as of late. While gold and stocks notch new highs, Bitcoin is over 5% lower than where it was at the start of the year. Data by YCharts While we're still above the April lows, Bitcoin peaked in October and has been on a consistent downtrend since then, with some stabilization around current levels, although it's unclear how long this will hold. This article isn't about Bitcoin per se, but about the average crypto investor and what they can do to weather these kinds of moments. For my regular readers, the answer is usually the same from me: try to earn some income while you wait. With crypto, it's little different. Enter the Nicholas Crypto Income ETF (BLOX), which debuted back in June this year. Inception 6/16/25 Price $18.60 Distribution Rate 36% Dividend Amount (TTM) $3.84 Dividend Frequency Weekly Return of Capital Estimate ~54% Assets Under Management $219.49M Expense Ratio 1.03% BLOX ETF Overview The fund, on its website , promises: BLOX is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that provides exposure to blockchain technology to enhance income and provide portfolio diversification. The fund blends digital asset-related investments and traditional income-generating securities to capture growth potential in emerging technologies while maintaining a focus on risk-adjusted returns. And it should be of note that ""digital asset-related investments"" is a key phrase here, and a little nebulous (likely on purpose). Here's another excerpt from the website on this note: The Fund does not invest directly in bitcoin, ether or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of bitcoin, ether or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of bitcoin or ether. This may be a bit confusing, but I think this wording is supposed to exclude holding cryptocurrencies directly on the ETF balance sheet. Instead, they invest through exchange-traded products (""ETPs""). They definitely invest in Bitcoin and ether ETPs, as evidenced by their holdings in HODL , FBTC , and ETHA . To be clear, while the above quoted statement is true, the fund does have exposure to the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum. When looking at the holdings, here's what we see: Seeking Alpha Over 25% of the fund's holdings are ETPs that directly track cryptocurrency price changes. The rest of the fund is spread out across related companies, some directly engaged in cryptocurrency mining operations like HUT and IREN; others in the manufacture of the chips that can be used to mine cryptocurrencies like TSM and NVDA ; those engaged in cryptocurrency finances like COIN ; and those engaged in crypto-treasury operations like MSTR and BMNR . These holdings are subject to change day-to-day, and so keep in mind that the fund will not always look like this, as it is actively managed. The number of holdings is rather high because the fund also owns a lot of options, which are used to generate the income the fund kicks out. Most of these companies pay little to no dividends. In fact, most pay nothing at all. So options are bought and sold to generate income for the fund, which is then distributed to shareholders. The options portion of the portfolio looks like this and is a tangled mess that only the active managers really understand the purpose of. This is one of the catches to investing in funds like BLOX because one needs in management's ability to run these options and do so profitably. XFunds/Nicholas Wealth BLOX ETF Dividends The BLOX ETF pays weekly, which is not necessarily a plus from my perspective because I see the frequency of dividends as mostly irrelevant -- I'd even go so far as to say that a tighter frequency may put pressure on the manager to take aggressive positions that they otherwise might not if they had more time to generate the income necessary for distributions -- but it is absolutely a pro for some income investors who prefer the faster turnaround on distributions. Here are its past two months of distributions: XFunds/Nicholas Wealth And here they are visualized over time: Data by YCharts Dividends have fallen to all-time low levels, largely because of the recent sell-off in cryptocurrencies. I would imagine that when these kinds of things sell off, the managers tend to reduce their short exposure with the options providing for more upside in a recovery, but lowering distributions for current shareholders. So this is to be expected to some degree. So I wouldn't expect dividends to continue this trend unless cryptocurrencies continue their trend lower as well. If the sector bounces back, which would be a positive for the BLOX ETF because of its holdings, then we should expect dividends to kick back up towards the $0.15 range. A positive note on the dividend side is that distributions are largely counted as return of capital (""RoC""). This is due to an IRS accounting rule that allows for options income generated inside the ETF structure and then returned to shareholders to be counted as ROC. This reduces one's cost basis when distributed instead of producing taxable events in the year that it is earned. This is largely favorable to investors in taxable accounts, as they can defer the taxes until they sell their shares. If your cost basis hits zero, all future distributions do create taxable events, but they're taxed at your long-term capital gains tax rate, which is typically higher than the income tax rate. Still making this preferable to ordinary income producing funds. For the year so far, BLOX estimates that over 50% of their distributions are ROC, with 39% in the last distribution. This can be found in the latest 19A1 form, but note that this is an estimate and not a full and complete total that should be relied upon for tax reporting. 19a-1 form (XFunds/Nicholas Wealth) BLOX Performance One thing I found interesting is that BLOX has a variety of investments, some with more exposure to cryptocurrencies than others. NVIDIA, for example, has a much larger exposure to the AI trade and to cloud computing than it does to cryptocurrency. This varied exposure that indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies means that BLOX's performance does not track directly to cryptocurrencies at large. Here are a few charts showing BLOX's performance since its inception against various other instruments: BLOX vs. BTC & ETH ETFs, where we can see that BLOX has kept up with Ethereum and managed to, since its inception, avoid the losses that Bitcoin has generated despite its high allocation to Bitcoin ETFs. That allocation may have been different a while back because the funds' holdings are liable to change day-to-day. Data by YCharts BLOX vs. Crypto-Treasury Companies, where we can see BLOX vastly outperform pure-play Bitcoin adopters and convertible bond funds. While BLOX has an allocation to these assets, they are a smaller portion of the holdings and are likely the target for a lot of the short exposure via the options trading since they have very high volatilities. Data by YCharts BLOX vs. Broad Crypto ETF, where we can see how capping the upside with covered calls could cause the fund to underperform at times. NODE, by contrast, has no income component and is long-only with a very similar basket to BLOX. Both funds have different holdings but follow a similar ethos. Data by YCharts All told, BLOX seems to be a great way to diversify among crypto-related endeavors and is certainly better than a concentrated bet in times like this, where crypto is down and very volatile. For those not seeking income, NODE may be the better option, but that would be for another article, as I haven't covered VanEck's offering before. They're not a perfect one-to-one comparison. This underperformance may be due to the income, my best guess, but may also be due to the differences in holdings. More time is needed to tell on that front. The Crypto Bull Thesis Is it true that what goes down must come back up? If you are bullish on crypto, the answer seems to be yes. I understand why one would be bullish on crypto right now. Conservative institutions like Vanguard and Bank of America, who have long told customers that they were unable to purchase cryptocurrencies through them, have changed their minds. Bank of America is now recommending up to 4% exposure , and Vanguard is allowing their customers to buy crypto-related assets like Bitcoin ETFs and even the BLOX ETF itself. This change in institutions is very bullish for crypto, as is the current administration's stance on cryptocurrency, which is that they believe in deregulation and even adding Bitcoin to a future U.S. sovereign wealth fund . Less regulation for crypto treasury companies as well as less regulation for the crypto world at large allows for more adoption, more leverage to be taken, and more gains to be had. That is a very bullish look on the situation, of course, and doubters of cryptocurrencies should stay far away from this ETF and any like it. While the income could provide some padding for the downside, it is in no way going to make up for losses if cryptocurrencies continue to slide as dramatically as they have over the last few months. For a more complete take, I recommend this article from my colleague, Mandela Amoussou, that discusses the institutional adoption trends in more depth. Conclusion Ultimately, I was interested when I was first recommended from a reader to take a look at the BLOX ETF. It is not a fund that I am personally interested in investing in (as my crypto bets are more singularly focused, not broad), though it certainly has its merits, and I can see how someone looking for income and crypto exposure could benefit from this fund. What remains to be seen is if this recent drop is setting a new floor or has become the new ceiling.

On-chain researcher ZachXBT identified over $6M in drained funds. Trust Wallet announced a security incident, only connected to the browser extension version 2.68. The wallet producer warned users should disable the extension and move to version 2.69. Mobile users are not impacted. We’ve identified a security incident affecting Trust Wallet Browser Extension version 2.68 only. Users with Browser Extension 2.68 should disable and upgrade to 2.69.

Previously, the wallet was used as a one-stop hub for all Web3 activity. Binance’s founder and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao immediately reacted to the incident, stating all users would be compensated. The Trust Wallet team is still investigating how the exploiters managed to submit a flawed version to the app store, for downloads under the official wallet brand. The supply chain attack is still investigated. The initial wallet draining was noted soon after the update from December 24. The exploit has continued for days before ZachXBT noted the unusual outflows. Initially, users were urged not to use the extension, while salvaging funds via the desktop or mobile versions. The problems emerged only when inputting private seeds into the flawed extension. The attack comes at a time when crypto exploits are slowing down, as projects increase their security. Recently, Binance Wallet was also tackling a wave of address poisoning , as attacks shifted from platforms to private holders. ZachXBT discovers affected Trust Wallet addresses On-chain researcher ZachXBT identified Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana wallets affected by the exploit. According to his data, hundreds of wallets were affected. Trust Wallet has announced the losses will be compensated. Over $6M in crypto was taken from draining the vulnerable wallets. ZachXBT has not mentioned if the exploit has compromised the private keys themselves, but users may have to generate new wallets. Some of the affected addresses lost small amounts of BTC after years of holding. On ETH, the exploiter aggregated tokens into several intermediary addresses . Later, some of the Trust Wallet exploiter wallets sent out the funds to exchanges. The exploiter used ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, as well as high-profile exchanges like KuCoin and HTX. Most of the destination wallets have been flagged. Some of the addresses contain only a few hundred dollars, while others have accumulated as much as $49,000. In the end, the hack estimates reached $6.77M, with around $2.35M remaining in all of the exploiter’s known addresses after moving and swapping funds. Phishing redirect targeted new downloads Wallet infrastructure has proven to be one of the most reliable elements of crypto usage. There are only rare instances of compromised wallets or private keys, usually through insider infiltration. The nature of the Trust Wallet exploit involved a hidden redirect injected into the compromised version. The private key technology remains reliable, if not exposed to the malicious app. The malicious redirect creates a malicious version of the Trust Wallet. Users are urged not to input their private seeds to activate old wallets. Even newly created wallets from the flawed version may be compromised and lose assets in the future.

Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov told TASS the bank stands ready to collaborate with regulators on developing infrastructure for such services, potentially expanding Russia’s crypto ecosystem beyond trading into collateralized finance. The announcement builds on Sberbank’s broader digital asset strategy, which has already produced over 160 tokenized issues this year, spanning real estate, oil, and commodity-linked products. “ I hope we will be able to announce such deals soon ,” Popov expressed optimism, though the timing depends on the regulatory framework, currently in its infancy. Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of Sber Anatoly Popov. | © Reuters Exchanges Prepare Infrastructure as Regulatory Countdown Begins Just yesterday, Moscow Exchange and St. Petersburg Exchange confirmed readiness to launch regulated crypto trading once Russia’s legislative framework takes effect by July 1, 2026. The exchanges’ December announcements followed the Bank of Russia’s release of a regulatory concept outlining comprehensive timelines and enforcement mechanisms for crypto legislation. Moscow Exchange stated it is “ actively working on solutions to service the cryptocurrency market .” St. Petersburg Exchange also mentioned that it has “ the necessary technological infrastructure for trading and settlements. “ Russia's major stock exchanges confirm readiness for regulated crypto trading by mid-2026 as legislative framework approaches implementation deadline. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/rZhcnzIhjn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 25, 2025 The regulatory framework divides market access between qualified and non-qualified investors under sharply different conditions. Non-qualified participants are limited to purchasing liquid cryptocurrencies from defined lists after passing mandatory knowledge tests and are subject to an annual cap of 300,000 rubles through a single intermediary. Qualified investors face no volume restrictions but must demonstrate understanding of crypto risks through testing and remain barred from purchasing anonymous tokens that conceal transaction data. Amid these growing regulatory and technological developments, State Duma Committee Chairman Anatoly Aksakov reiterated earlier this month that cryptocurrencies “ will never become money within our country ,” functioning only as investment instruments, with all domestic payments required in rubles. Transaction Volumes Drive Policy Evolution From Resistance to Regulation Russia recorded $376.3 billion in crypto transaction receipts between July 2024 and June 2025, surpassing the United Kingdom’s $273.2 billion and establishing Russia as Europe’s largest crypto market by transaction volume . Large-scale transfers exceeding $10 million grew 86% during this period, nearly double the 44% growth across the rest of Europe, while DeFi activity surged eightfold in early 2025 before stabilizing at 3.5 times the mid-2023 baseline. Much of this growth is tied to A7A5, a ruble-pegged stablecoin that has reached over $500 million in market capitalization despite Western sanctions , making it the world’s largest non-dollar stablecoin. Looking beyond trading and investment, Senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin recently argued that crypto mining should be classified as export activity in Russia, since the mined assets effectively flow abroad. Crypto mining should be treated as a form of export in Russia’s official trade accounts, according to senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/FGxF9Q3knm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2025 According to past reports, the country produces tens of thousands of Bitcoins annually , generating approximately 1 billion rubles in daily revenue and accounting for over 16% of global hashrate during summer months. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina also recently acknowledged that crypto mining contributes to the ruble’s strength. However, she noted quantifying its exact impact remains difficult as much of the industry operates in gray areas. Illegal mining costs Russia billions of dollars annually through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes, prompting the November 1, 2024, legalization requiring legal entities to register with the Federal Tax Service. Sberbank Builds Digital Asset Platform Ahead of 2026 Deadline Sberbank has already begun offering regulated crypto-linked investments totaling 1.5 billion rubles in structured bonds and digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto portfolios. The bank launched blockchain-powered tokens that track global cocoa prices in March and continues to build proprietary blockchain infrastructure supporting smart contracts and tokenization tools for corporate clients, with each token representing 1 kilogram of cocoa and available to qualified investors for up to 4 months. Deputy Chairman Popov confirmed “ active dialogue ” with the Bank of Russia on integrating crypto services within regulated frameworks while the lender positions itself as a potential liquidity provider and market maker on regulated platforms. Russia’s Central Bank ( @bank_of_russia ) targets 2026 for a unified crypto regulation framework, allowing controlled trading for investors while planning penalties for illegal intermediaries from 2027. #CryptoRegulation #BankOfRussia #Russia https://t.co/DjLAmMqsCb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 The regulatory timeline calls for legislative frameworks to be completed by July 1, 2026, with liability for illegal crypto intermediary activities taking effect from July 1, 2027.

This substantial amount of ETH transferred from the South Korean exchange Bithumb to an unknown private wallet represents approximately $264 million at current valuations. Such significant movements often serve as critical indicators of larger market trends and institutional behavior. What Does This Major ETH Transfer Mean? When we see this volume of ETH transferred in a single transaction, it immediately raises important questions about market dynamics. Whale transactions typically signal one of several possibilities: institutional accumulation, exchange management, or preparation for strategic moves. The fact that the destination is an unknown wallet adds an intriguing layer of mystery, as it prevents immediate identification of the recipient’s intentions. Blockchain analysts pay close attention to these movements because they can influence market sentiment and potentially affect Ethereum’s price stability. A transfer of this magnitude from an exchange to a private wallet generally suggests the holder plans to hold the assets rather than sell them immediately, which some interpret as a bullish long-term signal. Understanding Whale Transactions in Cryptocurrency Whale transactions refer to large-volume movements that exceed typical trading amounts. These substantial transfers of digital assets often belong to: Institutional investors managing cryptocurrency portfolios Early adopters moving holdings between storage solutions Exchange operations managing liquidity and cold storage Investment funds executing strategic positions The transparency of blockchain technology allows services like Whale Alert to monitor these movements in real-time, providing valuable data points for market analysts and traders. However, the anonymous nature of wallet addresses means we can only speculate about the specific motivations behind each transaction. Potential Implications for the Ethereum Market This particular ETH transferred event carries several potential implications for market participants. First, removing such a significant amount from an exchange reduces immediately available selling pressure, which could support price stability. Second, the movement demonstrates continued institutional-level interest in Ethereum despite market fluctuations. Historical patterns suggest that accumulation in private wallets often precedes periods of reduced volatility or gradual appreciation. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation, and multiple factors influence cryptocurrency prices simultaneously. How Should Investors Interpret Such Movements? For everyday investors and traders, whale transactions provide context rather than direct trading signals. Consider these perspectives when evaluating significant ETH transferred events: Context matters: Is this part of a larger pattern of accumulation or distribution? Timing is key: Does this coincide with other market developments or news? Scale perspective: How does this volume compare to daily trading volumes? Source significance: Does the originating entity have a track record of strategic moves? While fascinating, these transactions represent just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. Savvy market participants combine whale-watching data with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and broader economic factors when making investment decisions. The Bottom Line on Major Cryptocurrency Movements The recent alert about 89,312 ETH transferred from Bithumb serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency markets’ dynamic and transparent nature. These substantial movements highlight how blockchain technology enables unprecedented visibility into asset flows while maintaining participant privacy through pseudonymous addresses. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, we can expect more institutional-scale transactions as traditional finance increasingly interacts with digital assets. The key takeaway is that significant ETH transferred events warrant attention but should be considered alongside comprehensive market analysis rather than as standalone signals. Frequently Asked Questions What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, typically those exceeding certain value thresholds that might impact markets. Why do unknown wallets matter? Unknown wallets are private addresses not immediately associated with known entities like exchanges or public figures. Their anonymity makes the holder’s intentions speculative, adding intrigue to large transfers. Could this ETH transferred event affect Ethereum’s price? While large movements can influence market sentiment, direct price impact depends on numerous factors including overall market conditions, trading volume, and subsequent actions by the wallet holder. How common are transfers of this size? Multi-million dollar transfers occur regularly in cryptocurrency markets, though the 89,312 ETH transferred represents a particularly substantial movement that stands out even among whale transactions. Should I change my investment strategy based on whale movements? Whale transactions provide useful market context but shouldn’t alone dictate investment strategy. Consider them alongside fundamental analysis, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Can anyone track where the ETH goes next? Yes, blockchain explorers allow anyone to follow the movement of these assets to subsequent addresses, though the ultimate beneficiary often remains anonymous if they use privacy techniques.

Key Takeaways: Former Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison is set for release on Jan. 21, 2026, about 10 months earlier than her full sentence. Ellison pleaded guilty over the FTX collapse and cooperated with prosecutors, helping secure Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction. Her early release reflects cooperation and good conduct, though she faces a 10-year ban and ongoing supervision. Ellison, 31, has been in community confinement since October 2025 after being transferred from a federal prison in Connecticut , Business Insider reported earlier this month. Her release date places her exit from custody roughly 10 months earlier than the full two-year sentence imposed by the court. Ellison Pleaded Guilty in FTX Collapse That Wiped Out Billions Ellison pleaded guilty in December 2022 to fraud and conspiracy charges connected to the collapse of FTX, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. The failure of FTX triggered billions of dollars in customer losses and marked one of the most significant scandals in the history of the digital asset industry. As part of her plea agreement, Ellison cooperated extensively with federal prosecutors and served as a key witness during Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial. Her testimony detailed how Alameda and FTX commingled customer funds and concealed financial shortfalls, evidence that contributed to Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple counts of fraud. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Ellison in September 2024, ordering her to forfeit $11 billion and serve a two-year prison term beginning in November of that year.

In a filing submitted ahead of sentencing, John J. Ray III, the CEO overseeing the FTX bankruptcy estate, said Ellison provided “valuable assistance” that helped recover hundreds of millions of dollars in assets for creditors. Those efforts played a role in ongoing attempts to return funds to customers affected by the collapse. Earlier this month, Ellison also agreed to a 10-year ban on serving as an officer or director of public companies or cryptocurrency exchanges. Following her release, she will remain under supervised release, limiting her future involvement in regulated financial businesses. Bankman-Fried Seeks Trump Clemency, Claims FTX Case Was Politically Motivated Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried continues to pursue post-conviction relief . He is seeking clemency from US President Donald Trump, who has previously issued high-profile crypto-related pardons, including for former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao . Bankman-Fried has argued that his prosecution was politically motivated, a claim prosecutors have rejected. According to Bureau of Prisons records, Bankman-Fried is currently scheduled for release in September 2044 , underscoring the stark contrast in outcomes between the two former executives.

Peter Schiff, the prominent gold advocate and longtime cryptocurrency skeptic, has labeled this movement as a critical Bitcoin exit opportunity —a Christmas gift for holders looking to escape. His perspective challenges the optimism of many investors and presents a controversial roadmap for the coming year. Is This Rebound Really a Bitcoin Exit Opportunity? Peter Schiff’s latest commentary cuts directly against prevailing market sentiment. He described the recent price increase not as the start of a new bull run, but as a seasonal anomaly. According to Schiff, this is Santa offering a final chance to sell before potential declines. This framing turns typical holiday market cheer on its head, suggesting the rally many hoped for has already failed to materialize. Schiff had previously noted the absence of a true “Santa rally” in crypto markets this December. Therefore, he interprets this limited rebound as deceptive—a trap for the unwary rather than a genuine recovery. His analysis suggests that while Bitcoin has stalled, other assets have delivered substantial returns, making this an ideal moment to reconsider allocations. Why Schiff Sees Silver as the 2025 Alternative The gold bull doesn’t just criticize Bitcoin; he offers a specific alternative. Schiff has explicitly recommended selling Bitcoin to buy silver as the “best trading opportunity for 2025.” This recommendation comes from his observation of precious metals outperforming cryptocurrencies throughout the year. Consider these key points from Schiff’s argument: Bitcoin has failed to meet bullish price expectations set at year’s beginning Precious metals like gold and silver have demonstrated stronger upward momentum The current rebound lacks fundamental support and represents a technical bounce Seasonal patterns suggest this may be a temporary phenomenon rather than a trend reversal This perspective challenges the core narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold. Schiff essentially argues that the original precious metals remain superior stores of value and growth vehicles. Understanding the Broader Market Context To evaluate Schiff’s warning properly, investors must consider the broader financial landscape. The cryptocurrency market has faced significant headwinds throughout 2024, including regulatory pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty. Meanwhile, precious metals have benefited from geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns. However, cryptocurrency advocates counter that Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Adoption continues growing, institutional interest persists, and the upcoming halving event historically precedes major rallies. This creates a classic clash of narratives between traditional and digital asset philosophies. The critical question for investors becomes: Is this truly a Bitcoin exit opportunity , or merely a skeptic’s misinterpretation of normal market volatility? The answer depends largely on one’s time horizon and risk tolerance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Regardless of whether you agree with Schiff’s perspective, his warning provides valuable considerations for portfolio management. Every investor should periodically reassess their positions against changing market conditions. Here are practical steps to consider: Review your investment thesis for Bitcoin—has anything fundamentally changed? Compare performance across asset classes in your portfolio Consider rebalancing if any position has become disproportionately large Evaluate both technical indicators and fundamental developments Remember that extreme opinions—whether bullish or bearish—often miss nuance. The reality likely lies somewhere between “Christmas gift exit” and “guaranteed rally.” Conclusion: Navigating Conflicting Signals Peter Schiff’s characterization of Bitcoin’s rebound as a Bitcoin exit opportunity presents a provocative counter-narrative to mainstream crypto optimism. While his perspective aligns with his longstanding skepticism, it raises important questions about asset allocation and timing. Ultimately, investment decisions should reflect individual goals rather than reacting to any single commentator’s views. The market will reveal whether this rebound represents a genuine recovery or indeed a final exit chance. What remains certain is that 2025 will bring new challenges and opportunities across all asset classes. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Peter Schiff say about Bitcoin? Peter Schiff called Bitcoin’s recent price rebound a “Christmas gift” offering holders an exit opportunity. He suggested selling Bitcoin to buy silver represents the best trading opportunity for 2025. Why does Schiff prefer silver over Bitcoin? Schiff observes that while Bitcoin has stalled, precious metals like silver have shown strong upward momentum. He believes traditional commodities offer better value and growth potential than cryptocurrencies. Should I sell my Bitcoin based on Schiff’s advice? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. While Schiff’s perspective is worth considering, it represents one viewpoint among many in the financial community. Has Bitcoin really underperformed compared to precious metals? In recent months, silver and gold have shown significant gains while Bitcoin has experienced volatility. However, performance varies across different timeframes, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. What is a “Santa rally” in financial markets? A Santa rally refers to a seasonal increase in stock prices that typically occurs in the last week of December through the first two trading days of January. Schiff argues this phenomenon hasn’t materialized for cryptocurrencies this year. How reliable are seasonal patterns for cryptocurrency investing? Seasonal patterns in cryptocurrency markets are less established than in traditional markets. While some patterns may emerge, they shouldn’t form the sole basis for investment decisions given crypto’s volatility and relative novelty.

The issue was first flagged publicly by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, who issued a community alert warning that multiple Trust Wallet users had experienced unauthorized outflows from their addresses within hours. Sudden Wallet Drains While the exact cause was initially unclear, ZachXBT noted that the reports coincided with a recent update to the Trust Wallet Chrome extension. Shortly thereafter, blockchain security firm SlowMist issued a security alert confirming a vulnerability in Trust Wallet Browser Extension version 2.68, and urged users to immediately disable the extension and upgrade to version 2.69 through the official Chrome Web Store. According to SlowMist’s preliminary findings, the incident may involve a supply chain attack, where malicious code was potentially injected into the extension. This possibly allowed attackers to exfiltrate users’ seed phrases when the wallet was unlocked and transmit them to a malicious website. Based on early estimates, hundreds of wallets are believed to be affected. Trust Wallet later acknowledged the incident on X, confirming that version 2.68 of its browser extension was impacted. The company said that mobile-only users and all other browser extension versions were not affected by the vulnerability. Trust Wallet also advised users who had not yet upgraded to avoid opening the extension until the update was completed. The company warned that continued use of the affected version could expose them to further risk. ZachXBT subsequently provided another update stating that affected users would be compensated. CZ Addresses The “Hack” Meanwhile, Binance founder and Trust Wallet owner Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also addressed the situation publicly and said that Trust Wallet would cover the losses linked to the incident. He also said that user funds remain secure. CZ estimated that around $7 million had been impacted and described the incident as a hack. He also hinted at an insider involvement, which could mean that the breach may have included internal access or knowledge. The episode adds to growing concerns around browser-based wallet security, particularly as supply chain attacks and malicious updates have become an increasingly common vector for crypto theft. The Trust Wallet incident comes amid a broader rise in high-profile exploits, hacks, and phishing campaigns across the crypto sector. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimated more than $3.4 billion in cryptocurrencies has been stolen from January through early December, slightly higher than the $3.38 billion recorded over the same period last year. Interestingly, compromises related to personal wallets have witnessed a significant growth over recent years. The figure rose from just 7.3% of total stolen value in 2022 to 44% in 2024.

A prominent crypto analyst with a massive following has just made a bold declaration: Bitcoin is on a path that eerily mirrors 2020, and it’s poised to smash its previous Bitcoin all-time high in 2025. This prediction isn’t just about a price target; it suggests a fundamental shift in how the entire market cycle might unfold. Let’s dive into the analysis that’s sparking conversation across the crypto community. Why Does This Analyst See a 2025 Bitcoin All-Time High? Crypto analyst Kaleo, followed by over 728,000 people on X, recently laid out a compelling comparison. He suggests Bitcoin’s current price action and market sentiment are strikingly similar to the autumn of 2020. Back then, Bitcoin was recovering from the brutal March 2020 crash. It had broken below a key long-term trend line, and U.S. tech stocks were vastly outperforming it. The altcoin market was quiet, and overall sentiment was so negative that many declared Bitcoin dead. Sound familiar? Of course, what followed was a legendary bull run that catapulted Bitcoin to its current Bitcoin all-time high . Kaleo believes we are in a similar setup now, setting the stage for a powerful move upward. Beyond the Halving: Is a “Supercycle” Coming? This forecast challenges a core belief held by many in crypto: the traditional four-year cycle tied to Bitcoin’s halving events. Instead, Kaleo proposes a different outcome. He argues that Bitcoin remains in a long-term bull market and that the next Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 will kickstart something new—a “supercycle.” What would this supercycle look like? According to the analyst, it would feature: A more prolonged uptrend compared to previous cycles. A true altcoin season where alternative cryptocurrencies see explosive growth. A massive wave of new retail investor enthusiasm , bringing fresh capital into the market. This theory implies the potential for greater gains but also acknowledges that a longer bear market would likely follow such an extended peak. The key, Kaleo notes, is for investors to understand and navigate this entire cycle to endure the subsequent downturn. What This Means for Crypto Investors Today Predictions like this are valuable not for their certainty, but for the perspective they provide. They encourage us to look at historical patterns and current data. If the 2020 parallel holds any weight, it suggests we might be in a period of accumulation before a significant upward move. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance never guarantees future results. The idea of a Bitcoin all-time high in 2025 hinges on several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and continued adoption. While the analysis is insightful, every investor must conduct their own research and never risk more than they can afford to lose. Conclusion: A Compelling Roadmap for Bitcoin’s Future The prediction of a new Bitcoin all-time high in 2025, built on parallels to the 2020 bull run, offers a fascinating and optimistic narrative for the crypto market. It challenges conventional cycle thinking and paints a picture of a more mature, yet still explosive, phase for Bitcoin. Whether this “supercycle” thesis plays out remains to be seen, but it provides a crucial framework for understanding potential market trajectories. Staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals are the best strategies for any investor watching this space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Kaleo, and why should I trust his prediction? A1: Kaleo is a pseudonymous crypto analyst with a substantial following (over 728,000) on social media platform X. His analysis is respected by many in the community for its technical and historical depth, but like all forecasts, it should be considered one perspective among many, not financial advice. Q2: What exactly is a Bitcoin “supercycle”? A2: A supercycle refers to the theory that Bitcoin’s bull market could be longer and more sustained than the typical four-year cycles observed in the past, potentially driven by increased institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors. Q3: Does this mean the traditional Bitcoin halving cycle is irrelevant? A3: Not necessarily. The halving is a fundamental, supply-driven event. This prediction suggests its effects might be expressed differently this time, potentially elongating the bullish period rather than strictly adhering to the old timeline. Q4: What are the biggest risks to this 2025 all-time high prediction? A4: Major risks include a severe global economic recession, unexpected harsh regulatory crackdowns in key markets, or a major security failure within the crypto ecosystem that shatters investor confidence. Q5: How can an average investor prepare if this prediction is correct? A5: Focus on education, consider a disciplined dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate volatility, secure your assets in a non-custodial wallet, and avoid making investment decisions based purely on fear of missing out (FOMO).

This article dives into the factors influencing Aptos' price and highlights which other coins show potential for growth in the evolving landscape. Aptos Price on the Move: Can It Rebound? Source: tradingview Aptos (APT) is bouncing between $1.43 and $1.71. Recently, its price grew about 16% in a week, suggesting some upward movement. But taking a wider view, APT has dipped heavily over the last month and six months. If APT can push past the nearest resistance at $1.85, it might aim for $2.13, which would be about a 25% increase from its recent peak in this range. Yet, its recent history shows significant drops, reminding us that the path to higher prices might be bumpy. Sentiment is upbeat with a strong RSI, but it needs to maintain momentum to reach those higher targets. Conclusion APT's potential to reclaim $2 is closely tied to the overall market momentum in layer 1 coins. When Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Cardano show strong performance, it often boosts confidence in similar platforms. Institutional interest and broader adoption can also drive APT's value. The coin's ability to stay competitive depends on its development team’s efforts and community support. Ultimately, supportive trends in top-tier blockchain projects would likely aid APT in reaching and maintaining the $2 level. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The exchange is hosting a major BABY token airdrop event, distributing a massive pool of 3 million tokens. This move celebrates strategic partnerships and offers a tangible reward for active traders. If you’re looking to potentially earn free crypto, understanding the details of this limited-time event is crucial. What is the Bithumb BABY Token Airdrop Event? Bithumb’s latest promotional campaign centers on the BABY token airdrop . BABY is the native token of the Bitcoin staking protocol, Babylon. The exchange is distributing 3 million BABY tokens, worth approximately 73 million Korean won ($52,700), to eligible participants. This event is not just a giveaway; it’s a celebration of Bithumb’s new collaborations with the decentralized lending protocol Aave and an unnamed BTC financial firm. The event window is short, running for just two days from December 26th to December 27th. How Can You Qualify for This Airdrop? Participation requires meeting specific criteria set by Bithumb. The rules are straightforward but require action during the event period. Here are the key steps to qualify: Deposit Requirement : You must deposit more than 500,000 Korean won (roughly $361) worth of BABY tokens into your Bithumb account. Trading Activity : You need to execute at least one trade involving the BABY token on both days of the event (December 26th and 27th).

Second, it brings attention to the Babylon protocol, which focuses on Bitcoin staking—a growing sector aiming to bring yield-generating capabilities to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. For users, it represents a chance to acquire tokens of a promising project through active participation rather than direct purchase. What Should Potential Participants Consider? While the opportunity is enticing, a smart approach is necessary. Always remember that cryptocurrency trading and airdrop participation involve risk. The value of the BABY token can fluctuate between now and the distribution date in 2026. Furthermore, ensure you understand the tax implications of receiving airdropped tokens in your jurisdiction. This BABY token airdrop is a promotional event with clear rules, so read Bithumb’s official announcement thoroughly to avoid any misunderstanding about eligibility.

Crypto commentator Amonyx (@amonyx) posted an update that captured this shift. He revealed that Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF has crossed a key threshold, now holding 101.55 million XRP valued at $192.7 million. The milestone marks the first time the fund has exceeded 100 million XRP in holdings. While the headline figure appears simple, the context behind it carries weight. JUST IN: Franklin Templeton’s $XRP spot ETF has crossed 100M $XRP in holdings for the first time, now holding 101.55M $XRP worth $192.7M. Bullish pic.twitter.com/6UAAI0U7q4 — Amonyx (@amonyx) December 23, 2025 A Key Institutional Milestone Amonyx’s post focused on scale. Crossing 100 million XRP signals more than steady inflows. It shows sustained accumulation from regulated capital. ETFs do not chase momentum intraday. They reflect allocation decisions made by asset managers, advisers, and institutions seeking long-term exposure . Franklin Templeton operates as one of the world’s largest asset managers. Its decision to join the XRP ETF race and continued expansion of XRP holdings indicate conviction in the asset. The ETF has also shown consistent performance since launch. Holdings did not spike in a single session, but increased over time, suggesting methodical inflows rather than speculative bursts. ETF Performance Signals Growing Institutional Adoption The performance of the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF strengthens the bullish case. Growing assets under management require constant sourcing of XRP from the open market. Each new unit purchased removes liquid supply from circulation. This is where institutional adoption becomes a central driver. ETFs operate within regulatory frameworks. They attract capital that previously could not access XRP directly. Retirement accounts, traditional brokers, and compliance-focused investors now participate. As more institutions choose this route, demand becomes less sensitive to daily price fluctuations. That creates a different market dynamic compared to retail-driven rallies. It also reduces the likelihood of sudden liquidations tied to leverage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply Dynamics Tighten as XRP Leaves Exchanges Beyond demand, supply conditions add another layer. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) summed it up clearly. “101M $XRP locked up. The walls are closing in on supply, and most still don’t see it.” Exchange balances for XRP continue to trend lower . Tokens are quickly moving into long-term storage, institutional custody, and ETF vehicles. Once inside an ETF, that supply effectively exits the liquid market unless redemptions occur. XRP has a fixed supply, and when the circulating supply tightens while demand remains steady or grows, price pressure builds naturally. ETFs accelerate this process by removing large amounts of XRP. This shrinking balance increases the risk of a supply shock if demand accelerates. This could kickstart a major XRP rally.

With experts debating its potential, many are questioning if ZEC can soar to the $500 mark. This article explores the factors driving this renewed interest and identifies other coins poised for significant growth. Zcash Shows Mixed Signals: Price Hesitation Amidst Past Surge Source: tradingview Zcash is dancing within a range, with its price hovering between around $390 and $480. After a strong surge of more than 1000% over the last six months, it now faces hurdles around $510. If it manages to overcome this, it could aim for nearly $600, marking a rise of over 20% from its high range. However, if it falters, support lies in the mid-$300s. Despite a recent 13% dip over the month, a weekly jump of almost 15% suggests there's still lively interest. With its ten-day average higher than the hundred-day, some traders spot a potential uptrend, waiting to be confirmed by further moves. Conclusion Zcash could see a significant rise in its value if the renewed interest continues. With other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin showing stability or upward trends, Zcash may benefit from increased investor confidence. The growing focus on privacy and anonymity can also favor Zcash in the long run. If the market trends remain positive, Zcash has the potential to reach new heights.

The platform raised $600M in a sale that ended in under a minute, after years of waiting. PUMP is down 70% since its launch, with an even deeper loss from peak levels of $0.008. | Source: CoinGecko . Initially, PUMP expected to launch as an airdrop token. Instead, the platform chose a token sale for a $4B valuation. PUMP had a volatile journey since July, peaking at $0.008. Toward the end of the year, PUMP extended its slide to $0.0017, down from the initial IPO price of $0.004. Following the token sale, PUMP was pressured by direct whale selling. The token ended the year with a market cap of $1B, with $1.7B in fully diluted value. PUMP was also depressed by the slowdown in meme trading, new launches, and creator activity. The token slid despite regular buybacks, in which Pump.fun poured all trading fees. For now, Pump.fun still achieves significant daily revenues as a Solana DEX, though this has also not helped the token’s performance. PUMP tokens retail a relatively high mindshare of 5.9%, though token fatigue and market weakness are still preventing a rally. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the ICO, PUMP was one of the warning examples in 2025. Other projects stuck to airdrops or remained tokenless. World Liberty Fi token sale leaves buyers with losses World Liberty Fi reported $550M from its WLFI token sale, including both retail rounds and pledges from high-profile investors. The token sale also included Justin Sun’s buy-in for $30M. The Trump family crypto project was highly active in 2025, with multiple investments in crypto. However, the WLFI token was also limited by the lack of an altcoin market. WLFI became transferable and tradeable after months of holding. WLFI fell from a peak of $0.24, down to $0.14 in late 2025. The project got a boost from the usage of USD1 tokens, but WLFI still underperforms. High-profile token sales faced bear market conditions While PUMP and WLFI still saw some liquid trading, other token sales failed more dramatically. Monad (MON) caused some of the biggest losses, after a rally to $0.04. In the past month, MON erased 50% of its value, down to $0.02. The project caused investor discontent, despite raising $217M. L2 projects MegaETH and Aztec are yet to generate their tokens. The projects are still expected to launch, although the conditions for new tokens remain unfavorable. The ICO model and other token sales were mostly used for small-scale projects. High-profile events ended up destroying sentiment, as some projects stayed away from tokenization and moved to the IPO model . Even long-term projects with a wide support network like Berachain (BERA) fared worse once they created their token and launched it during a hostile market.

After months of consolidation, analysts are now pointing to clear technical signals suggesting a major Bitcoin breakout could be imminent. The key level to watch? A decisive push above a critical downtrend line that could propel BTC toward $95,000 and beyond. Let’s examine the data and expert opinions shaping this optimistic forecast. Why Are Analysts Bullish on a Bitcoin Breakout Now? Several converging factors are giving market watchers confidence. First, a significant options expiry event has passed. Trader BitBull, with a substantial following, noted that the expiration of roughly $24 billion in options could remove a major source of selling pressure. This ‘hedging overhang’ often suppresses spot prices. Its removal typically allows for cleaner price discovery, potentially clearing the path for a sustained Bitcoin breakout . Furthermore, the broader sentiment suggests the crypto market remains undervalued. Prominent analyst Michaël van de Poppe has echoed this, stating that the current landscape could set the stage for new all-time highs in the coming months. This foundational belief in underlying value adds weight to the technical setup currently forming on the charts. The Technical Case for a Move to $95K The most compelling evidence comes from the price chart itself. Analysis firm Crypto Ideology has highlighted a crucial pattern. Bitcoin’s daily price candle is currently testing a two-month resistance line that has capped every rally since October. This line represents the dominant downtrend. The Resistance Line: A diagonal trendline connecting the lower highs since Bitcoin’s peak. The Breakout Signal: A daily close convincingly above this line on significant volume. The Initial Target: A successful Bitcoin breakout sets a first price target near $95,000. The Next Milestone: A move to $95K significantly increases the probability of a final push to the symbolic $100,000 level. Therefore, the $95,000 mark isn’t just a random number; it’s a calculated projection based on chart structure and becomes the pivotal level for confirming a true trend reversal. What Could Fuel or Hinder the Rally? While the setup is promising, traders should consider both sides. The potential fuel for a rally is clear: reduced derivatives pressure, positive market structure, and a general sense that prices have consolidated enough. A clean Bitcoin breakout could trigger a wave of algorithmic and momentum buying. However, challenges remain. The broader macroeconomic environment, including interest rate decisions and traditional market volatility, still influences crypto. Additionally, the resistance line is a formidable barrier. A rejection here could see Bitcoin fall back into its established trading range, delaying the anticipated surge. The key is sustained buying pressure at the critical moment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Watchers How should you process this information? First, monitor the daily chart for a strong close above the descending trendline. Volume is a critical confirmation—a breakout on low volume is less trustworthy. Second, understand that a move toward $95,000 would likely be a process, not a single event, possibly involving pullbacks to test the newfound support. For long-term investors, this analysis reinforces the importance of viewing volatility as part of the journey. For active traders, the $95K level serves as a clear intermediate target and a zone to watch for either continuation or consolidation signals. The overarching message from analysts is one of cautious optimism, with a defined technical roadmap. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin The coming days and weeks could be defining for Bitcoin’s 2024 trajectory. Analysts have laid out a clear narrative: a successful Bitcoin breakout from its multi-month downtrend, catalyzed by shifting derivatives dynamics and technical momentum, with $95,000 acting as the crucial pivot point. While never guaranteed in markets, this confluence of factors presents one of the more compelling bullish setups seen in recent months. The market now waits to see if Bitcoin has the strength to seize this opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing the potential Bitcoin breakout now? The primary drivers are the removal of significant options-related selling pressure and Bitcoin’s price testing a key multi-month resistance line for a potential breakout. Why is $95,000 considered a pivotal level? Analysts from Crypto Ideology identify $95K as the initial technical target following a confirmed breakout above the current downtrend, based on chart measurements. What happens if Bitcoin fails to break the resistance? A rejection at the trendline would likely mean continued consolidation or a move back into the previous trading range, delaying the bullish scenario. Is the $100,000 target still realistic? Analysts view $100K as a high-probability target after a successful hold above $95,000, making the $95K level the critical hurdle to clear first. Should I invest based on this analysis? This is market analysis, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and understand that cryptocurrency investments are volatile.

56389025,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=870255,1766740500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56389025.jpeg,"Dogecoin Is Repeating Its 2020 Accumulation Cycle, Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-is-repeating-its-2020-accumulation-cycle-analyst-says/,"Crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica on X) is arguing that Dogecoin’s weekly chart is doing that familiar thing again: carving out a rounded base, bleeding off volatility, resetting momentum and quietly setting up what he frames as the “calm before the storm.” Or, at least, that’s the pitch. In a Dec. 23 TradingView analysis titled “DOGE: The Cycle Repeats (1W Timeframe),” Cryptollica calls the current structure a “textbook fractal setup,” pointing to four prior “structural points (1, 2, 3, 4)” across DOGE’s longer-term history and claiming the market is now sitting at “Point 4.” The core claim is less about a single indicator and more about pattern recognition: “the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past.” Will Dogecoin Repeat History? Cryptollica frames Zones 1 and 2 as prior “boredom phases” — the type of long, dead-feeling stretches that, in hindsight, look like accumulation. “Zones 1 & 2: These were the ‘boredom phases’ where volatility died, and smart money accumulated,” the post reads. Zone 2, in particular, is described as “the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run.” The current period, which the analyst labels Zone 4, is presented as a near-mirror: “We are seeing the exact same rounding bottom formation. The price is stabilizing, forming a heavy base just like it did before the previous explosions.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Rally If It Reclaims This Fibonacci Level That’s the structural argument. The momentum argument is RSI, and Cryptollica is unusually direct about how they’re treating it: “Look at the RSI indicator at the bottom. The red line (~32. level) acts as a historical floor.” They add that “every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline (Points 1, 2, and 3), it marked a macro bottom.” Right now, in their read, “the RSI has reset back to this critical support level,” which they interpret as seller fatigue: “It indicates that the sellers are exhausted and the momentum is primed to flip.” If you’ve been around crypto markets long enough, you’ve seen this exact rhetorical move: the past as a template, the present as a rhyme, the future as a pending punchline. Cryptollica tries to pre-empt the eye-roll by insisting the setup isn’t coincidence: “This isn’t just random noise; it’s a cyclical reset.” The post argues DOGE is sitting in what they call “the ‘Golden Pocket’ for accumulation,” and suggests that if the 2020-era analog holds “like it did in 2020 (Zone 2)” then today’s price action is basically quiet loading time. The editorial machinery at TradingView itself leaned in. The platform responded publicly on Dec. 23 that the publication “has been selected as one of our Editor’s Picks and will be featured on the Home Page,” adding a line that reads like the house style for community encouragement: “Good trading plans are valuable, regardless of their outcomes, and particularly rewarding when they succeed.” Cryptollica replied in kind: “TradingView, thank you.” Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention Still, one of the more useful parts of this whole thread is a cautionary comment from another user, ZarinSyed, who essentially says: yes, the fractal is interesting, no, that doesn’t mean it’s fate. “The fractal analysis is compelling,” they wrote, “however, while the setup does resemble prior accumulation phases, it’s worth noting that fractals are not deterministic — macro conditions and liquidity flows can alter outcomes.” They put a practical marker on what “confirmation” would look like in their view: “Watching DOGE’s weekly close above the $0.15–$0.17 range could validate the bullish thesis.” And they don’t let RSI off the hook, either. The ~32 level may signal exhaustion, they concede, but “momentum confirmation often requires a sustained move above the midline (50). Until then, the risk of prolonged sideways action remains.” They add a market-structure wrinkle that matters for 2026-style crypto narratives: “Unlike 2020, DOGE now trades in a more mature market with ETF-driven institutional flows. Retail-driven fractals may play out differently.” So what does it mean, in plain trader terms, without pretending the chart is prophecy? Cryptollica is making a high-conviction, weekly-timeframe claim that DOGE is back in an accumulation “buy zone,” with RSI near a historical floor and a rounded base that resembles prior cycle setups. ZarinSyed is basically saying: fine, now prove it, ideally with a breakout and follow-through, and keep an eye on relative metrics like DOGE/BTC dominance if you want to know whether this is a DOGE story or just another alt wobble.

Meanwhile, BTC stayed stuck in a narrow $85,000 to $92,000 band after a sharp drop from above $110,000. On chain data shows large Bitcoin holders boosted balances in late 2025 On-chain data from Glassnode showed a sharp jump in net buying by entities holding 100 BTC to 1,000 BTC, a cohort often tracked as “sharks.” The move came as Bitcoin’s price stayed near cycle highs, while the group’s total supply line climbed to a new peak on the chart. A post from “That Martini Guy” claimed “whales” accumulated about $23.5 billion worth of Bitcoin over recent weeks and called it the fastest pace since 2012. The Glassnode chart does show one of the strongest positive spikes in the cohort’s net position change in years, alongside a steep rise in the amount of BTC held by these addresses. Still, the chart tracks a specific bracket, not every whale sized wallet, and the dollar figure depends on the price used for the estimate. In addition, on-chain cohorts can shift when exchanges reshuffle wallets, when custody providers consolidate addresses, or when entities get re labeled over time. Even so, the late 2025 surge signals renewed demand from larger holders, and it points to aggressive accumulation rather than steady distribution in that period. Precious metals surge as Bitcoin lags over six month window Meanwhile, Gold and Silver posted strong gains over the past six months, while Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction, according to the price comparison data. Gold rose about 38 percent over the period, and silver more than doubled, climbing roughly 107 percent. By contrast, Bitcoin fell about 17 percent, despite holding a market capitalization near $1.8 trillion. BTC/XAU/XAG Price Comparison. Source: CoinCodex The chart shows a clear divergence that developed from late summer into year end. Gold advanced steadily, with limited pullbacks, reflecting sustained demand. Silver accelerated even faster, with sharper rallies in October and November that pushed returns well above gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trended lower through the same period, with several failed rebounds and deeper drawdowns into December. This split highlights how capital rotated toward traditional safe haven assets during the period, while Bitcoin underperformed both metals. Even so, the gap between assets has widened to levels not seen earlier in the year. The data shows metals leading decisively, while Bitcoin remains compressed near the lower end of its six month range, setting a clear contrast in relative performance. Bitcoin compresses into tight range after sharp pullback Bitcoin traded sideways in late December after a steep decline from its recent highs, according to the daily BTC USDT chart from TradingView. Price moved into a narrow consolidation band near the mid to high $80,000s, following a breakdown from a broader distribution zone that capped advances earlier in the year. The chart shows Bitcoin falling from above $110,000 before stabilizing between roughly $85,000 and $92,000. Multiple candles printed long wicks on both sides of the range, signaling active two way trading rather than a clear trend. This structure suggests the market is absorbing prior selling pressure after the sharp drop. Crypto Rover said a decisive move could follow once Bitcoin exits this range. The chart supports that view, as prolonged compression often precedes expansion. For now, price remains trapped between short term support and resistance, leaving direction unresolved until a clear breakout or breakdown occurs.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 09:29:20

These are the ones that creep up and supply narrows and schedules get synchronized. That is the arrangement that most analysts are following today. One of these cryptocurrencies has already made a 2.5x move at a price of $0.035, although it is at an early maturity against the initiations of its roadmap. In the view of people interested in what crypto to invest in now before 2026, this is more of a positioning than a chasing move. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the project that attracts this attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The initial presale distribution of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was at a price of $0.01. After that, the token has gone to increase to $0.035, indicating an increase of 250% during its presale stages. This expansion has not happened in an abrupt way but has developed over a period and this development has been attributed by many market commentators as an indication of long lasting interest. Phase 6 is already assigned over 99% and that is, availability at the present price is almost over. The official launch price is fixed at $0.06, and current investors are positioned for a significant discount in comparison to the launch. There is a growth in participation together with price. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $19.45M, and has 18,650 holders to date. The total sold tokens have been 825M. Out of a fixed presale supply of 1.82B MUTM or 45.5% of the amount is designated to the early distribution. What is Being Built at Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance has one objective. Creating a decentralized lending protocol, where on-chain capital is useful. The site will be built on a dual lending model where people can provide assets to get yield and borrowers can use collateral to obtain liquidity. Users that provide assets get mtTokens. Such tokens signify their status in the protocol and are more valuable the more interest they earn. Yield is captured empirically in the balance of the mtTokens without the need to take any actions. The other important component is the buy-and-distribute model. Part of the protocol fees is utilized in buying MUTM over the counter. The computers obtain MUTM in the open market and resell it to users in the safety module by staking their mtTokens. This may relate platform usage directly with token demand that some analysts feel relevant after the launch. Security has been realized at the outset. Mutuum Finance has gone through an audit of CertiK with an audit score of 90/100 with a token scan, and is currently in an independent audit with Halborn Security , reviewing finalised contracts. Stablecoin Plans, Oracles and Price Outlook In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance is going to launch a multi-asset-backed stablecoin. This enables the borrowers to use various forms of collateral instead of using one token. The system will be able to be more stable in the market fluctuations by diversifying the risks. Any lending protocol is based on accurate pricing. The architectural design of Mutuum Finance expects that oracle feeds, like Chainlink, will be decentralized, but that they will also have fallback sources. These oracles are used to facilitate just values of collaterals and proper liquidations. Other observers even reckon that with a mixture of lending business, a sound currency, and a good price framework, a company can then grow robustly after launch. In a bullish case, the estimates indicate that transitioning between the present level with the introduction and initial adoption would help in sustaining 500% growth over time. These are results of models depending on execution. Why Whales Are Watching As per the official statements on X , V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol will run on the Sepolia testnet in the Q4 2025. Its main entities will consist of liquidity pools, mpTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. Early assets will be ETH and USDT. This timing is critical. A workable version before the launch time is an advantage that can enhance credibility and presence. According to market commentators, live infrastructure projects stand better chances of receiving broader attention after their launch. Phase 6 is also closing out in a hurry. The bigger buyers will do so due to tighter allocation. Six-figure whale allocations over the past two years have been reported by analysts as an indication larger players are setting the groundwork before the next level commences. Whales tend to seek opportunities that are characterized by scarcity and milestones. This setup fits that pattern. The Reason Why Q1 2026 is a Part of The Conversation The reason why this new crypto could be a first mover in Q1 2026, is a matter of timing. Presale allocating of the work coming to completion. A defined launch price. A V1 protocol is planned. Audits in place. These are now converging just in time when the wider market interest is all there. To investors who follow the potential best cheap cryptocurrency to keep a long-term position, Mutuum Finance remains at a crossroads where there are already instances of growth but the bigger picture might be yet to be seen. With Phase 6 approaching completion and development milestones, the window of early entry is closing at prices as of $0.035. Provided that the adoption process happens in accordance with the setup, it may become one of the new cryptocurrencies that characterizes the first half of the next cycle.

That surge put derivatives back at the center of crypto activity and left a clear imprint on markets worldwide. Market Concentration And Exchange Share Binance handled roughly $25 trillion of that volume, or about 29% of global derivatives trading. OKX, Bybit and Bitget each posted between $8 trillion and $10 trillion, and the four of them together controlled about 62% of the market. Based on reports , that level of concentration means a handful of platforms still drive most of the action, and any major hiccup at one of them can ripple through other venues fast. Crypto: Institutional Pathways Expanded Trading moved beyond retail bets. Spot ETFs listed in the US, options desks and compliant futures helped mainstream venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange gain ground. The CME had already overtaken Binance in Bitcoin futures open interest in 2024, and it consolidated that position through 2025. More institutions started using derivatives for hedging and basis trades rather than pure speculation. That change pushed pricing patterns to look more like traditional markets, even as new risks built up under the surface. Open Interest And Market Swings Open interest began the year near a low of about $87 billion after a broad round of deleveraging in the first quarter. It then climbed through the middle of the year and reached a record $236 billion on October 7. An abrupt reset in early Q4 wiped out more than $70 billion in positions — roughly one-third of the open interest at the time. Even after that shock, year-end open interest stood at $145 billion, a 17% rise from where the year began. Bitcoin Price Action Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has yet to breach the $90k level, trading at $89,950 at the time of writing. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, recorded net outflows, weakening what some had called the institutional bid. A record-sized Bitcoin options expiry landed on Friday, Dec 26, and several analysts argued it kept price pinned in a tighter band — at least for a while. Sentiment gauges stayed on the gloomy side, with many investors showing caution despite broader product access and more regulated routes to trade. Forced Liquidations Total forced liquidations across the year were estimated at about $150 billion. A big portion of the pain came on Oct. 10 and Oct. 11, when more than $19 billion was erased in just two days. The data for 2025 shows a market that has grown in size and in institutional involvement, while also carrying structural tensions. Trading volumes and product variety have increased, but so have the paths that can transmit shocks.

According to remarks attributed to the SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, the long-anticipated Crypto Clarity Act and the Market Structure Bill are now heading to Congress , a move that could dramatically reshape the digital asset landscape. If passed, these reforms are expected to reduce market manipulation by as much as 80%, restoring confidence to a sector long plagued by regulatory uncertainty. At the heart of both bills is a push to clearly distinguish between digital assets that qualify as securities and those that function more like commodities or payment tokens. For years, the lack of clear definitions has created confusion for crypto firms, investors, and regulators alike. The proposed legislation aims to allocate oversight responsibilities more precisely between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), reducing enforcement-by-litigation and replacing it with rule-based clarity. Therefore, this clarity could be especially meaningful for XRP. Ripple’s token has been one of the most high-profile examples of regulatory ambiguity, spending years entangled in legal disputes over whether XRP should be classified as a security. While recent court rulings have already offered partial relief by differentiating between retail and institutional sales, comprehensive legislation could further solidify XRP’s regulatory status. If the Crypto Clarity Act provides explicit criteria under which tokens like XRP are deemed non-securities when used for payments or network utility. On the other hand, the Market Structure Bill could also benefit XRP by establishing standardized rules for trading venues, custody, and settlement. XRP’s use case as a bridge asset for cross-border payments aligns well with a regulated market structure that emphasizes transparency, compliance, and efficiency. Clear rules could accelerate partnerships between Ripple and traditional financial institutions, particularly banks seeking blockchain-based payment solutions that meet regulatory standards. Beyond XRP specifically, these bills could boost overall market sentiment. Regulatory certainty tends to reduce risk premiums, attract institutional capital, and foster innovation. For XRP, which already has an established infrastructure and real-world utility, being on the right side of regulatory clarity could translate into renewed demand and long-term growth. Conclusion The SEC Chairman’s confirmation that the Crypto Clarity Act and Market Structure Bill are headed to Congress signals a pivotal shift for U.S. crypto regulation. By replacing long-standing uncertainty with clear, enforceable rules, the legislation could unlock stalled growth across the industry with XRP expected to be a major beneficiary. Clear statutory definitions for digital assets and market oversight could finally lift the regulatory overhang, opening the door to deeper liquidity, broader exchange support, and increased institutional participation. If passed, these bills could not only legitimize XRP’s status as a compliant, utility-focused asset but also position it at the forefront of a more transparent, mature, and innovation-friendly crypto market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 09:44:19

Market experts predict pain ahead. In fact, prominent crypto analyst Doctor Profit believes the asset could bottom out in September-October 2026. Long Bear Market for Bitcoin In a recent tweet, he explained that he has moved all remaining USDT back into the banking system and currently holds no liquid crypto assets, while citing the ongoing bear market as the reason. Doctor Profit said that the current market conditions do not warrant staying liquid in crypto, and he believes the bear phase will continue for a long period. He also disclosed his largest positions, including a BTC short from the $115,000-$125,000 range and a medium-sized BTC holding purchased around 85,000. He intends to ride a potential short-term upswing toward $107,000 before the next downward leg in February-March. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $89,259 after a 2% daily gain. While the asset did show some short-term upward movement, it continues to hover below crucial resistance levels. According to CryptoQuant, $100,000 is a major short-term resistance for BTC, largely due to the concentration of cost bases among recent whale investors and Binance users. New whales, who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days, have an average cost basis of roughly $100,500. This makes it a critical break-even zone where profit-taking or fresh accumulation could determine the near-term price trend. On the other hand, Binance spot users average around $56,000, providing a significant support level in a potential extended bear phase. Long-term whales with holdings over 155 days have an average cost basis of around $40,000, which means that they remain significantly profitable and are likely contributing to recent profit-taking activity. $40K Drop Risk Supporting the broader bearish narrative, analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted Bitcoin’s behavior around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). He explained that in past cycles, losing this level has typically led to an average decline of about 54%. When applied to current prices, such a move would mean a potential drop toward $40,000. The analyst did not call for an immediate selloff, but did warn that failure to reclaim this level could expose the crypto asset to extended downside pressure.

This is the ambitious vision behind the Midnight blockchain , a new project from the Cardano ecosystem that its founder, Charles Hoskinson, is calling nothing less than the “Manhattan Project” for privacy technology. But what does this dramatic comparison mean for the future of crypto and data security? What is the Midnight Blockchain Project? Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano (ADA), has set his sights on a monumental challenge: building the ultimate privacy-preserving blockchain. He has dubbed this new spin-off project, Midnight , the “Manhattan Project” for privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). This historical reference signals a focused, intensive, and groundbreaking effort to solve one of digital society’s core dilemmas—how to balance transparency with personal privacy. Hoskinson is deeply immersed in the technical work, reportedly writing 80 to 100 pages of documentation daily. An internal workshop is planned for January to accelerate development. The goal is clear: to create a foundational technology that redefines how data is handled on-chain. Why is Midnight Being Called a Privacy Revolution? The core innovation of the Midnight blockchain lies in its use of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Simply put, PETs are cryptographic tools that allow for computation and verification without exposing the underlying raw data. For example, you could prove you are over 18 without showing your birthdate, or verify a transaction’s validity without revealing the amount or parties involved. Midnight aims to integrate these technologies at its core, focusing on three critical pillars: Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs): The bedrock for confidential computation. Chain Abstraction: Simplifying user interaction across different blockchains. Smart Compliance: Enabling regulatory requirements to be met automatically and privately. This triad addresses the major pain points of current public blockchains: data exposure, complexity, and regulatory uncertainty. What Challenges Will the Midnight Blockchain Face? Labeling a project the “Manhattan Project” sets incredibly high expectations. The original was a secretive, state-funded mission with a single, clear objective. Replicating that intensity in the open-source, decentralized world of crypto presents unique hurdles. Firstly, achieving robust, scalable, and user-friendly privacy is a formidable technical challenge. Secondly, the project must navigate the complex global landscape of financial regulations. “Smart compliance” is an elegant concept, but its practical implementation will be closely watched by regulators worldwide. Finally, it must gain adoption and trust from developers and users who are cautious of new, unproven networks. How Could Midnight Reshape the Crypto Landscape? If successful, the Midnight blockchain could unlock transformative use cases. Consider supply chain tracking where companies can prove ethical sourcing without exposing sensitive supplier data. Envision financial services where loans are approved based on private credit scores, or digital voting systems that are both verifiable and anonymous. For the Cardano ecosystem, a successful Midnight sidechain could drive significant utility and value to ADA, positioning it as a hub for secure, enterprise-grade decentralized applications. It represents a strategic move beyond pure currency into the realm of confidential data infrastructure. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Data Privacy? Charles Hoskinson’s comparison of Midnight to the Manhattan Project is a powerful statement of intent. It is not merely an upgrade; it is a dedicated mission to build a new paradigm for privacy on the blockchain. While the path ahead is steep, the potential reward—a world where individuals and businesses can operate with both transparency and confidentiality—is profound. The crypto community will be watching closely as this ambitious project moves from intense documentation to a working reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the Midnight blockchain? A: Midnight is a privacy-focused blockchain and sidechain project from the Cardano ecosystem, designed to be a foundational platform for privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Q: Why is it called the “Manhattan Project”? A: Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson uses the term to emphasize the project’s intense, focused, and groundbreaking mission to solve core challenges in data privacy and blockchain technology. Q: How does Midnight protect privacy? A: It uses Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), which are cryptographic methods that allow data to be verified and computed without ever exposing the original, sensitive information. Q: Is Midnight a separate cryptocurrency from Cardano’s ADA? A: Midnight is a separate blockchain project (a sidechain) within the Cardano ecosystem. It will have its own tokenomics and rules but is designed to interoperate with the main Cardano chain. Q: What are the main goals of the Midnight blockchain? A: Its three main pillars are advancing Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), enabling seamless chain abstraction for users, and building tools for smart, automated compliance with regulations. Q: When will Midnight launch? A: There is no official public launch date yet. Development is in active stages, with an internal workshop planned for January to advance the technical groundwork.

Over 1 billion OZ tokens have been bought by investors, and the fund size is now reached the $5 million target. The growth momentum and both numbers could increase higher upon listing. OZ and SOL Solana tokens, for a broader reference, were around $0.6893 on April 17, 2020. SOL then surged to $27.82 on April 16, 2021. Thereby marking a 40.35x gain in a single year. The token is now listed at $142.59, up by 28176.58% from the all-time low value of $0.5052, which was recorded on May 12, 2020. The early-stage momentum of OZ is demonstrated by the fact that investors have bought more than 1.03 billion tokens and have pumped over $5.12 million in funds. More tokens are being bought every day, and funds are inching closer to the $5.5 million milestone. The growth momentum is also demonstrated by the price uptick of 14x. OZ has surged from $0.001 to $0.014. It is next estimated to rise by 71x and reach the target price of $1 upon listing. Longer projections forecast that the token may generate 300x ROI months after getting listed on exchange platforms. Ozak AI Ecosystem Boosting its Growth The growth momentum of Ozak AI is mainly credited to its ecosystem, which houses a fusion of AI tools, tokenized growth, and decentralized infrastructure. These collectively enable the community to earn auto-optimized yields and make real-time informed financial decisions. A deeper dive brings out components like DePIN and cross-chain functionality. The latter is critically essential because it facilitates long-term sustainable growth. Cross-chain functionality boosts operations of Ozak AI across multiple blockchains by enhancing its compatibility in the Web3 sphere. DePIN, an acronym for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, prevents malicious manipulation of the data structure. It distributes the data across a network of nodes - simultaneously supporting redundancy for scalability and resilience. Growing Interest in Ozak AI Ozak AI accumulating strongest early-stage momentum is further on the grounds of strategic alliances established to this point, like the one with Openledger. An association between Ozak AI and Openledger encompasses bringing together Prediction Agents and on-chain data/model tools. The objective is to create better ways to handle AI training and boosting datasets driven by the community. Ozak AI has entered into similar partnerships with Meganet, Phala Network, and SINT, among many others. Key Takeaways Ozak AI is approaching the $5 million milestone. It has sold over 1 billion OZ tokens to mark the strongest early-stage momentum since Solana. Contributing to this pace are its technical components and growing interest of AI crypto market players in the Ozak AI ecosystem.

More than 18,600 holders have joined across all phases, reflecting growing confidence in the project’s direction. In the current phase, 98% of the 170 million token allocation has already been sold, signaling tightening availability as demand continues to rise. A major accessibility update has further strengthened presale momentum. Investors can now purchase MUTM tokens using a card, with no purchase limits. This change will remove barriers for new participants and will accelerate onboarding as the presale approaches later stages. As Bitcoin (BTC)’s upward trajectory continues to draw new capital into the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will already be positioned with a strong base of holders and limited remaining supply at early pricing. A Lending Platform Built for Real Market Use Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed around two complementary models that address different risk profiles. In simple terms, the platform will allow users to lend assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing more collateral than they borrow, ensuring system stability. The first model, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), will focus on well-known and liquid assets. Lenders will pool assets such as stablecoins and established cryptocurrencies into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access these pools by providing overcollateralized positions. Interest rates will automatically adjust based on pool usage, rising as demand increases and easing when liquidity is abundant. This dynamic structure will create balance, encouraging deposits while discouraging excessive borrowing. Depositors in P2C will receive mtTokens, which will represent their share of the pool along with accumulated interest. These mtTokens will also function as collateral, unlocking additional flexibility within the system. Borrowers will be able to choose between variable rates that respond to market conditions or stable rates that offer predictable repayment costs. Stable rates will begin at a higher level to reflect added certainty and will rebalance under defined conditions to protect liquidity. For assets that carry higher volatility or lower liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a separate Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model. This environment will isolate riskier tokens such as meme coins from the core liquidity pools. In P2P lending, borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, including interest rates and loan duration. Since there will be no shared pool, lenders will accept greater risk in exchange for higher returns. This structure will preserve overall protocol safety while expanding earning opportunities across different market segments. Audit and Protocol Announcement on X and Impact Security remains a central focus. An independent audit by Halborn Security thoroughly testing Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing contracts for vulnerabilities and errors. With the code finalized, this review will ensure reliability, correct functionality, and strong protection for users, reinforcing trust as the platform approaches launch. The protocol’s first version is expected to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Version 1 will include core components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. All loans will require overcollateralization, monitored through a Stability Factor. When collateral values fall below required thresholds, liquidations will activate automatically, preventing bad debt from affecting the wider system. Deploying V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the platform before the mainnet rollout. This phased launch promotes openness, supports early user involvement, and allows the team to gather actionable feedback to refine the protocol. As participation expands and awareness grows, confidence in the ecosystem may strengthen, helping to support long-term interest and demand for the MUTM token. One of the strongest selling points of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its expected simultaneous platform launch and token listing. Instead of releasing a token without functionality, the project is expected to debut with live lending and borrowing modules on day one. This coordinated rollout will create immediate utility, encouraging active participation from traders and lenders alike. The presence of a working product will also support faster consideration from Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchanges, driving visibility and volume. As Bitcoin (BTC) approaches 150K, attention will increasingly shift toward projects that combine timing with substance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will enter the market with capped supply, strong presale traction, audited contracts, and an in process dual lending system designed for real demand. With phase 6 nearing full allocation and accessibility expanding through card purchases, the window for early positioning is narrowing fast.

The talks did not include Ukraine, Putin added, even though the plant remains on Ukrainian territory under international law. Putin said U.S. representatives showed interest in directing excess electricity from the facility toward cryptocurrency mining operations. At the same time, he claimed Washington also raised the idea of supplying electricity from the plant to Ukraine. Kyiv has not confirmed any such discussions and has repeatedly opposed arrangements that bypass Ukrainian authorities. The Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been under Russian control since March 2022. Its status remains one of the most sensitive issues in the war, touching on energy security, nuclear safety, and sovereignty. Control Talks Sideline Ukraine According to Putin, discussions with the United States focused on “joint management” of the plant without Ukraine’s involvement. He said Ukrainian technical staff continue to work at the facility but now hold Russian passports, a claim Ukrainian officials have previously rejected as illegitimate. Ukrainian authorities have instead promoted alternative frameworks. In recent comments reported by RBC Ukraine , Kyiv proposed a model of joint operation that would involve Ukraine and international partners, not bilateral talks between Moscow and Washington. Ukrainian officials argue that any governance arrangement must restore Ukrainian control and ensure demilitarization of the site. The International Atomic Energy Agency has maintained a presence at Zaporizhzhia and continues to warn about safety risks linked to military activity near the plant. Power disruptions and reliance on backup systems have kept the facility in a fragile operating state. Energy Crisis and Crypto Angle The comments come as Ukraine enters winter with a strained power grid. A recent report by The Wall Street Journal described ongoing attacks on energy infrastructure that have forced rolling outages across the country, increasing pressure to secure stable electricity supplies. Against that backdrop, the idea of using nuclear-generated power for crypto mining adds a new dimension to the dispute. Bitcoin mining requires large, steady energy inputs, and nuclear plants provide consistent baseload power. However, critics argue that raising crypto mining in talks about a war-zone nuclear facility highlights how far negotiations have drifted from Ukraine’s priorities. Kyiv has said it will not recognize any agreements over Zaporizhzhia made without its consent. For now, claims of U.S. interest in crypto mining remain unconfirmed by Washington, while the plant’s future stays tied to broader negotiations over territory and security.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 10:00:28

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-next-xrp-explosive-rally-is-coming-soon-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) has returned focus to XRP’s long-term structure, pointing to a recurring behavior that has defined its biggest historical moves. His analysis centers on XRP’s tendency to spend extended periods consolidating inside wedge formations before resolving with sharp upward expansions. The weekly chart he shared highlights this pattern across multiple market cycles, raising questions about whether XRP is nearing another decisive phase. #XRP loves to consolidate in wedges. Next explosive move up coming soon pic.twitter.com/8cRL98elUX — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 23, 2025 Repeating Consolidation Phases on the Weekly Chart At first glance, XRP’s recent price action appears uneventful. However, consolidation has often preceded major trend changes in XRP’s history. The chart outlines several large wedge structures stretching back more than a decade. Each wedge formation indicates a period where price action tightened between converging trendlines. The first wedge began in 2014, and XRP remained within this formation until it began a rapid ascent in 2017. However, it paused and entered another wedge for a few months before resuming its climb. This move culminated in its previous peak of $3.36 in January 2018. Recently, XRP entered the longest wedge in its history. It attempted to break out of this formation, but its price was held back by the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The 2024 Breakout and the Current Wedge In late 2024, the crypto market began a massive rally after Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. election. XRP rode this wave, breaking out of that multi-year consolidation and rising by over 500%. Following this move, XRP continued that climb in 2025, reaching a new peak of $3.65 in July . However, the asset’s momentum has stalled, and CryptoBull’s chart shows it trading within another wedge. The rallies that followed the previous wedges were not marginal. They defined XRP’s most aggressive upside periods. A repeat of this pattern could send XRP to new heights. Where XRP May Be Headed Next CryptoBull suggests that XRP is approaching another inflection point. The chart shows XRP near the apex of the current wedge, and he believes the surge is imminent. Many analysts are convinced that XRP will rise significantly in 2026 , and CryptoBull’s chart supports that idea. While the analyst does not provide a specific price target, the context of the chart implies a quick transition from consolidation to expansion. A sustained break above long-term resistance would mark a structural shift rather than a short-term breakout.

The Bank of Lithuania said crypto service providers that fail to secure the required license by December 31 will be treated as operating illegally and may face enforcement action. The message targets firms offering crypto exchange services and custodial wallets to Lithuanian users. According to the regulator, only companies licensed under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets framework, known as MiCA , will be allowed to continue operating after the transition period ends. The announcement places pressure on dozens of firms that registered in Lithuania during earlier, lighter regulatory regimes. Many now face a hard deadline to either comply with EU wide rules or exit the market. The regulator stressed that licensing can be obtained either directly from Lithuania or from another EU member state. However, firms must hold an approved MiCA authorization to operate across the bloc. Registration alone will no longer be sufficient. While it did not list specific sanctions, Lithuanian law allows for fines, orders to cease operations, and removal from the national crypto register. Users Urged to Check Providers Early Alongside the warning to firms, the Bank of Lithuania issued guidance to crypto users. It urged customers to check whether their service provider has applied for or obtained a MiCA license before the end of the year. If a provider plans to exit the market, users should act before December 31. The regulator said clients can request transfers of crypto assets to licensed providers or to self hosted wallets under their own control. For fiat balances, customers may instruct providers to move funds to personal bank accounts or to other payment institutions, depending on contract terms. The central bank said early action reduces the risk of service disruptions or delays. Part of a Broader EU Regulatory Shift Lithuania was once a popular hub for crypto firms due to its fast registration process. However, EU regulators have since moved to tighten oversight following market collapses and consumer losses in recent years. MiCA introduces unified rules on licensing, governance, capital requirements, and consumer protection across the EU. National regulators, including the Bank of Lithuania, now play a supervisory role only over licensed entities. As the deadline approaches, Lithuania’s message is direct. Crypto companies must meet EU standards or leave the market. Users, meanwhile, are being told not to wait until the final days to secure their assets.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-26 10:05:25

The event closed with record $28B in notional value. Deribit options reached the peak day of expiry, combining the monthly, quarterly, and yearly event. Historically, large-scale options repositioning has led to market volatility. Deribit is also closely watched for a hint on trader sentiment and the potential to determine the future direction of BTC. gm to everyone who knows that the largest options expiry day of the year is here — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) December 26, 2025 On Friday, 267,000 BTC options expire, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.35. The notional value of yearly BTC options is a total of $23.6B, with maximum pain above current prices at $95,000. On the Ethereum market, a total of 1.28M options expired, with a nominal value of $3.71B and maximum pain at $3,100. Deribit marks the largest options expiry in history The options market in 2025 gained influence, as a way to protect from the downside to BTC trading. The yearly event with $28B in total options is the largest in trading history, reflecting the increasing scale of cryptocurrency activity and the effect of institutions and whales. The event will affect more than half the open options positions on Deribit. Ahead of the settlement, trading volumes also rose due to repositioning. After the settlement, March options are the most influential, accumulating 30% of open interest. Deribit awaits a record options expiry event, with $28B in notional positions expiring, out of a total open interest of $42B. | Source: CoinGlass . The options expire at a time when the crypto fear and greed index is at 27 points , slightly up from last week’s 21 points. The options accumulation followed an increasingly volatile market for BTC and ETH. The leading coins are also pressured by multiple factors, including slow trading during the year-end period, as well as a general loss of positive sentiment. The fourth quarter of 2025 is also one of the worst in crypto history, despite expectations for a year in the green. BTC reached new price records, but quickly broke down, following unexpected market volatility. As a result, the options market reflected seller strategies and attempts to protect from a bear market downside. Deribit options point to ongoing fears of BTC dip After repositioning, Deribit options are signaling further expectations of a downside for BTC . During previous options expiry events, most Deribit traders set up put options at $85,000 to $80,000. Currently, the most numerous options by strike price are at $75,000, with high levels still available at $80,000 and $85,000. Call options start growing above $90,000, where traders are signaling a return to a potential bull market. BTC traded at $88,701.51, remaining in a narrow range for the past month. Despite this, any attempt to break out above $90,000 has invited more selling and long liquidations. The yearly options expiry is also expected to bring more volatility, with some price range anomalies during the low-volume trading period.
