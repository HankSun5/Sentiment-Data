For example, Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Bitcoin and Ethereum, you may be familiar with – but what about Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic? What are these? Why do they share such similar names with the two largest cryptocurrencies? BCH, ETC are spin-offs of their original blockchain, and in crypto terms, these are known as “forks.” You’re probably already wondering: what is a fork in crypto, and how do crypto forks work? In this guide, we’ll break down what a fork is in cryptocurrency, why it happens, the different types of forks, and the risks and opportunities it brings for investors. Understanding the Basics of Blockchain Forks The Definition of a Fork in Blockchain A fork in blockchain refers to a change in a cryptocurrency’s underlying code or network. In simple terms, it’s an update to a blockchain’s rules and protocols. The nature of the update might result in minor adjustments to the existing chain or cause a split that creates a new blockchain, a new set of rules, and a new cryptocurrency. How Blockchains Operate Before a Fork Blockchain networks operate on consensus, meaning everyone must agree on the same rules. Since most blockchains are open source, developers can propose changes such as performance upgrades, feature updates, and security improvements. But these changes only happen when the community reaches an agreement. Before a fork occurs, the blockchain operates as a unified system with every participant following the “consensus.” Think of it as a game of cards: if everyone follows the same rulebook, the game runs smoothly. Similarly, a blockchain remains cohesive and synchronized as long as all nodes adhere to the same protocols. Why Forks Are Necessary in Crypto Forks are significant for allowing blockchains to make major changes or enhancements, like creating new features, fixing security vulnerabilities, or speeding up transactions. Without forks, it could be possible for networks to be stuck with old rules and unable to evolve. Forks can also be great for settling disputes in decentralized communities. If the developers, miners, or users can’t come to an agreement on certain changes, such as block size or governance rules, forking allows the network to split, letting differing groups follow their chosen path. Types of Forks in Cryptocurrency There are several blockchain fork types, including hard forks, soft forks, and temporary forks caused by mining conditions. Hard Fork – Permanent Chain Split A Hard Fork occurs when a blockchain undergoes a major upgrade that consists of changes that are completely incompatible with previous consensus rules, transaction structures, or network features. For a hard fork to be legitimized, there needs to be a majority consensus among network stakeholders, and afterward, network participants using the previous version (not willing to upgrade) will no longer have access to the new version. Because a hard fork creates two separate paths, it can lead to the development of new networks, coins, and ecosystems, each with its own rules and governance. Typically, those who prefer the original protocol continue on the old chain. Soft Fork – Backward-Compatible Upgrade A soft fork is a change to a blockchain’s protocol that is backward-compatible. This means participants who do not adopt the new rules (old nodes) are still able to interact with the new blockchain. Soft forks typically introduce smaller, incremental updates, such as improving transaction efficiency, tightening rules for block validation, or adding new features without creating a separate chain. However, for a soft fork to succeed and avoid splitting the network, a majority of participants (miners, validators, or nodes) must adopt the new rules (i.e, upgrade to the new protocol). If not, the minority running outdated software may become orphaned from the network, forming an unintended chain split. Temporary Forks Caused by Mining Race Conditions A temporary fork occurs when two miners find a valid block simultaneously. Both blocks get shared with the network, but since the blockchain can only have one main chain, this creates a brief split called a race condition. A race condition happens when multiple processes access shared data at the same time, and the outcome depends on the order in which they run. Take for example, Block A and Block B. Some network nodes see Block A first while others see Block B, creating two competing versions of the same block. The conflict resolves automatically when the next block is mined – it will attach to one of the competing blocks, making that chain longer. Since the blockchain network always follows the longest valid chain rule, the shorter chain gets abandoned, and its block becomes an orphan block. This type of fork is temporary and does not create a new cryptocurrency. Why Do Forks Happen? While forks often result from disagreements, they play a crucial role in blockchain development. Here are some of the reasons why forks happen: Protocol Upgrades and Feature Additions Major updates sometimes require forks to improve network functionality. A good example is the Ethereum London Hard Fork, which introduced EIP-1559, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that dealt with transaction fee issues and improved overall network use. Bug Fixes and Security Patches There are times when a blockchain finds a significant security vulnerability that requires immediate action. In this case, a fork may help fix bugs and patch vulnerabilities. The Monero blockchain is a great example of a protocol that hard forks frequently to improve security and privacy, ensuring its blockchain is harder to attack or trace. Community Disagreements and Governance Issues Forks give communities the power to choose their own path. If participants disagree on updates, they can branch off. Bitcoin SV (BSV) split from Bitcoin Cash over disputes around block size and governance philosophy. Emergency Responses to Hacks In instances where major breaches take place, forks can be useful for reversing the damage and upgrading security mechanisms. One key example is the Ethereum DAO fork in July 2016, which was executed to reverse a large hack of funds that had been taken and return them to users. Notable Examples of Crypto Forks Some notable crypto fork examples include Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Cash. Let’s get into the details. Bitcoin Cash (Hard Fork of Bitcoin) In 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) split from Bitcoin (BTC) over debates about scalability solutions and transaction fees. Bitcoin processes only 3-7 transactions per second (TPS) compared to VISA’s 24,000 TPS. The status quo was unacceptable to BCH proponents, resulting in a proposal to increase the block sizes to achieve 100-250 TPS with lower fees. Bitcoin supporters argued that increasing the block size to upscale TPS could compromise security or decentralization, while also increasing the cost and energy associated with running nodes. Unable to reach a consensus, the community permanently split: Bitcoin (BTC) maintained small blocks prioritizing security, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chose larger blocks prioritizing transaction speed and lower costs. Ethereum Classic (Hard Fork After The DAO Hack) Ethereum experienced a serious crisis in 2016 when an attacker was able to exploit a vulnerability in the smart contract for the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), stealing about 3.6 million ETH (worth over $50M at the time). The Ethereum community discussed two options: first, do nothing and let the hack stand (an unchanged blockchain) since blockchains are meant to be immutable, or implement a fork and restore the stolen funds. Most of the community chose to reverse the hack, creating a hard fork that became the Ethereum (ETH) we know today. A smaller group, however, rejected this decision, arguing that “code is law” and the blockchain should never be altered. They continued with the original chain, now called Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum London Hard Fork (EIP-1559) August 2021 saw Ethereum activate one of its most significant upgrades, the London Hard Fork. The most important adjustment included in the upgrade was the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Protocols, or EIPs, which are meant to upgrade the network. A major improvement protocol was the EIP-1559, a proposal designed to fix Ethereum’s transaction fee (gas fee) system, which was at the time controversial. Before this upgrade, users had to bid for block space. Block space, in this case, refers to the storage that holds transactions. Because this space is limited, people often compete by paying higher fees to have their transaction picked up by a miner and processed quickly, making costs unpredictable and sometimes very expensive. EIP-1559 replaced this system with a base fee (automatically set by the network) plus a small tip to miners for faster processing. Additionally, the base fee is burned (permanently removed from circulation) instead of going to miners, introducing a deflationary pressure on ETH. The other improvement protocols introduced as part of the Ethereum London Hard Fork include EIP-3198, EIP-3529, EIP-3541, and EIP-3554. All these changes were implemented without splitting the network or creating new coins. Litecoin Forks Litecoin (LTC), often called the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” has also experienced hard and soft forks over the years, most of which were attempts to experiment with faster transactions, lower fees, or new features. Key Litecoin soft forks include: Segregated Witness (SegWit, 2017): This upgrade reduced block size. It also improved scalability and enabled technologies like the Lightning Network. MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB, May 2022): This upgrade allows users to send confidential Litecoin transactions, where the transaction amount is visible only to the sender and receiver. Key Litecoin hard forks include: Litecoin Cash (LCC): LCC forked from Litecoin in February 2018, created by an anonymous team with no connection to the official Litecoin development team. The developers claimed they wanted to improve transaction speeds and reduce fees by 90%, while supporting legacy Bitcoin mining hardware by using the SHA-256 algorithm (unlike Litecoin’s Scrypt). The fork attracted a fair amount of controversy because Litecoin’s founder, Charlie Lee, openly condemned the fork as a scam, telling users to be careful and not to fall victim to it, and also criticizing the efforts behind the fork for taking the Litecoin name without permission. The anonymous team promised holders 10 LCC tokens for every 1 LTC, which was appealing, but the project never took off due to its questionable legitimacy and lack of community support. Feathercoin (FTC): Developed as a fork of Litecoin in April 2013, Peter Bushnell thought he could develop a more user-friendly cryptocurrency that had the potential to address the issues he saw with other coins. The original concept was to create a more accessible and inclusive mining experience (especially for smaller miners) while also providing much faster block times than Bitcoin. Other forks include Junkcoin (JKC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Luckycoin (LKY), Monacoin (MONA), and Einsteinium (EMC2). How Forks Affect Investors and Users While forks often aim to improve scalability, security, or functionality, they can also create uncertainty and opportunities for both investors and users. Here’s how a crypto fork affects investors and users: Impact on Coin Supply and Valuation Forks create new cryptocurrencies, effectively increasing the total circulating supply in the market. This can dilute the value of the original coin unless both chains gain independent traction and community support. When Bitcoin Cash (BCH) forked from Bitcoin in August 2017, both cryptocurrencies maintained significant value. Bitcoin holders automatically received an equal amount of BCH, creating additional value for investors. For unsuccessful forks, initial hype quickly fades and values crash. Projects like Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and numerous other Bitcoin variants struggled to maintain relevance after initial exchange listings. Most of these forks lost over 90% of their value within months, wiping out speculative gains. Basically, you must keep in mind that not all forks create value; many result in worthless tokens. Wallet and Exchange Support The overall success of any fork is dependent on infrastructure adoption, and specifically, if there is support from major wallets and exchanges for the new chain. If there is no support from an exchange or wallet, then users have no way to access or store their new coins, and as a consequence, they cannot trade them. After Ethereum’s controversial split, many of the top exchanges at the time, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, supported both chains. Meaning users could claim their Ethereum Classic (ETC) tokens and immediately trade them. The backing from exchanges ensured both the ETH and ETC chains were able to coexist and thrive. On the other hand, loads of minor forks get little or no exchange support, leaving holders with worthless tokens. MoneroV exemplifies such failure. Before it split from Monero, it promised improvements in scalability, a capped supply, and the incorporation of MimbleWimble, but the project failed spectacularly. MimbleWimble was never implemented, and development stalled. Claiming Forked Coins When a cryptocurrency forks, holders of the original coin typically receive an equal amount of the new token – but only if they claim it correctly. When Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin in August 2017, users needed to import their Bitcoin private keys into Bitcoin Cash wallets to access their free coins. Many people who stored Bitcoin on exchanges had to wait months until those platforms added support for the new coin. Unfortunately, during Bitcoin SV’s split from Bitcoin Cash, technical complications made the process risky and confusing. While major exchanges eventually supported both coins, many users faced weeks or months of delays before they could access their Bitcoin SV tokens. Those who acted quickly often benefited more than casual investors who waited or didn’t understand the claiming process. Market Volatility Around Fork Announcements Fork announcements often cause big swings in crypto prices because investors either hope to get “free” coins from the fork or worry about the network’s stability. Traders may pile into the original coin before the fork, expecting to benefit, while others sell off due to uncertainty about which chain will survive. When Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin, investors who held Bitcoin automatically received Bitcoin Cash as well. This “two coins for one” effect created excitement, increased trading activity, and rewarded early holders generously. On the flip side, the Bitcoin Cash fork, resulting in BSV, fell on the other side of the spectrum. The “hash war,” as it was called, confused investors, led to sharp price drops, and even pulled down the broader crypto market. Risks and Opportunities from Forks Potential Gains from New Coins Hard forks that create a brand-new cryptocurrency are often exciting for investors because they can result in “free money.” When a blockchain splits, anyone who holds the original coin at the time of the fork usually receives an equal amount of the new coin. For example, if you owned two coins on the old chain, you would also automatically get two coins on the new chain. To take advantage of this, investors must ensure their coins are stored in a personal wallet or exchange that officially supports the fork. If the wallet or exchange doesn’t recognize the new chain, you won’t receive the new tokens. Once the new coins are distributed, you can decide what to do with them: sell quickly to lock in a profit, or hold on and hope the value rises over time. Increased Security or Functionality Some forks are created to improve the original blockchain, adding new features, boosting scalability, or patching vulnerabilities. For instance, Litecoin’s MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade introduced optional transaction privacy without creating a new coin. Similar examples include Bitcoin’s SegWit upgrade, Ethereum’s London Hard Fork, and Monero’s regular hard forks for enhanced privacy. When successful, these kinds of forks can make the network more useful and trusted, ultimately benefiting long-term holders. Risk of Scam Forks and Fake Chains Not all forks are made with good intentions. Some developers launch “scam forks” or copycat chains just to cash in on hype, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Sometimes, fake websites or wallets trick users into giving away their private keys while trying to “claim” forked coins. A good example is the wave of low-quality Bitcoin forks that popped up after Bitcoin Cash, many of which disappeared quickly or never gained exchange support. The Future of Forks in Blockchain Development Governance Models to Reduce Disputes Forks often happen because developers, miners, or the community disagree on key decisions about the blockchain, such as governance rules, transaction policies, or the project’s direction. Stronger governance systems in the future could help reduce these disputes. For example, blockchains like Tezos and Polkadot let token holders vote directly on major decisions, from protocol changes to network policies. This kind of on-chain voting allows the community to resolve conflicts without splitting into competing chains, making the network more stable and reducing the chance of contentious hard forks. Shift Toward Layer 2 Upgrades Instead of Forks Instead of changing the core blockchain through forks, many projects are now turning to “Layer 2” solutions to improve speed and reduce costs. These are upgrades that run on top of the main chain rather than altering it directly. For instance, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum’s rollups are Layer 2 technologies that boost scalability without needing a risky fork. After the Ethereum Merge of 2022, the blockchain became a stronger base for Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. These networks help lower transaction fees, increase throughput, and support wider adoption of decentralized applications. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Fork Impacts As blockchains become more connected, a fork on one network can affect many others. For example, an Ethereum fork can impact not just ETH, but also tokens, NFTs, and apps built on its network. Chains linked by bridges or cross-chain protocols can also be disrupted if rules change. This means developers must carefully plan forks to avoid disrupting multiple ecosystems at once.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|ETC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-27 22:40:37

Solana has remained one of the most closely watched names in the sector, while Ethereum’s newest meme-driven Layer 2 project, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), is starting to dominate presale chatter. Investors are now asking whether the Solana price forecast can play out with a push toward $400 in the short term, or if smaller tokens with meme appeal are where the bigger money will be made. Solana price forecast The Solana price forecast has turned increasingly optimistic, as the network proves itself with speed, efficiency, and reliability. SOL’s ability to handle large transaction volumes with ultra-low fees makes it a go-to blockchain for developers, particularly in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Activity on the chain has stayed high, with fresh launches continuing even during market slowdowns. Its NFT ecosystem, once a surprise to many, has matured into one of the strongest in crypto, and major platforms keep building on it. This steady developer engagement reinforces Solana’s position as not just a fast chain, but one with real adoption across multiple sectors. Institutional players are also paying closer attention. Funds that once ignored altcoins are now including SOL in their portfolios, citing its proven track record and efficiency compared to competitors. If SOL can sustain momentum, analysts believe the token could hit the $400 level within the next 90 days, a move that would confirm it as one of the most resilient large-cap cryptos in the market. Why Layer Brett is gaining traction While Solana provides stability, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is offering something different: meme culture fused with Ethereum Layer 2 scalability. Built on Ethereum’s scaling network, it delivers near-instant transfers and ultra-low fees, avoiding the congestion problems that plague Layer 1 tokens. At the same time, it embraces the viral power of meme coins, making it highly visible across trading communities. The presale has already been busy, drawing in both retail traders and early whales. Tokens are being snapped up at entry-level prices, with staking rewards hitting thousands of percent APY – a figure that naturally creates excitement among speculative buyers. What sets Layer Brett apart, however, is that it doesn’t stop at hype. Its roadmap features NFT integrations, gamified staking models, and cross-chain compatibility, ensuring there are new reasons for users to stay engaged long after launch. This approach has drawn comparisons to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two of the most successful meme tokens ever. But while those projects relied heavily on culture and community alone, Layer Brett begins with actual infrastructure. Its capped supply of 10 billion tokens introduces scarcity, while its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation ensures scalability that earlier meme coins lacked. Many traders now see $LBRETT as not just another meme token but potentially the next 45x opportunity as the market heads into 2025. Final thoughts The Solana price forecast shows the potential for SOL to reach $400 in the near term, reinforcing its role as a top-tier blockchain. Its mix of speed, adoption, and institutional interest keeps it in the spotlight for investors who want reliability and growth. At the same time, the buzz around Layer Brett highlights a shift in focus toward meme coins that offer more than hype. With Ethereum Layer 2 power, staking rewards, and an ambitious roadmap, $LBRETT is emerging as one of the most talked-about presales of the year. For investors, the choice is clear: Solana offers steady progress and institutional recognition, while Layer Brett brings high-risk, high-reward energy with the possibility of explosive returns.

50785794,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=793662,1756335476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50785794.jpeg,"Nvidia smashes Q2 earnings with numbers too good for its stock, turns Wall Street bearish",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-q2-earnings-too-good-for-its-stock/,"Nvidia reported second-quarter earnings, delivering $46.7 billion in revenue, a rise of 6% from Q1 and 56% higher than the same quarter last year, according to an earnings report published Tuesday. But the market didn’t reward it. Instead, the stock dipped in extended trading as the company’s data center unit, which Wall Street treats like the heartbeat of its AI engine, underperformed estimates again. The numbers weren’t soft. Nvidia’s Blackwell Data Center revenue climbed 17% quarter-over-quarter, showing demand is still running hot. But expectations were too high for just “hot.” The company also revealed that it made zero sales of its H20 AI chips to Chinese customers during Q2. Instead, it leaned on a $180 million inventory release of previously held H20 units and sold around $650 million worth of unrestricted H20 chips to one buyer outside China. It helped smooth out the financials, but it didn’t fix the market’s mood. Nvidia pads margins and EPS with inventory release, skips China Gross margins were 72.4% GAAP and 72.7% non-GAAP. Without the $180 million bump from that inventory release, the non-GAAP margin would’ve been 72.3%. The company also printed $1.08 in GAAP EPS and $1.05 in non-GAAP EPS. Again, take out the H20 trick and tax adjustment, and the number drops to $1.04 per share. In the middle of all this, CEO Jensen Huang threw the spotlight on the company’s flagship AI product line. “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap,” Jensen said , adding that production of Blackwell Ultra chips was moving fast. He said demand is “extraordinary.” He also highlighted Nvidia’s NVLink rack-scale computing, calling it “revolutionary” and claiming it arrives just in time to handle the load from new reasoning-based AI models. While AI demand might be “extraordinary,” investors clearly expected more. Despite Nvidia’s year-to-date stock gain of 35%, and its 2024 run where it almost tripled, the stock still dropped after the bell. That’s two quarters in a row where the data center segment missed analyst estimates. Wall Street doesn’t care how fast the chips are if the money doesn’t land exactly where expected. Company ramps up buybacks, eyes $54 billion in Q3 revenue The company’s shareholder returns in the first half of fiscal 2026 were heavy. Nvidia gave back $24.3 billion in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. At the end of Q2, it still had $14.7 billion left in buyback authorization. Then on August 26, the board added another $60 billion, with no expiration date. Nvidia also announced that its next dividend will be $0.01 per share, payable on October 2, 2025, to shareholders who are on the books by September 11, 2025. Looking ahead, the company’s Q3 revenue forecast came in at $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. Just like this quarter, Nvidia expects no sales of H20 chips to China in that period either. The company forecasted gross margins of 73.3% GAAP and 73.5% non-GAAP, with a 50 basis point wiggle room either way. It also said it expects to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70s. Operating expenses are set to climb. Nvidia projected $5.9 billion GAAP and $4.2 billion non-GAAP for Q3. The company also told investors to expect high-30% full-year growth in overall operating costs. For non-core income, it expects $500 million, excluding swings in private or public equity holdings. Tax rates are locked at 16.5%, give or take 1%, unless anything unusual happens. Even with all this, the market wasn’t thrilled. The same company that helped ignite the AI trade and posted one of the largest rallies in 2024 is now being punished for delivering “just strong” instead of “insane.” Wall Street gave Nvidia credit for revolutionizing compute. But now, it’s demanding faster, bigger, and somehow cleaner growth, even when margins are north of 70% and revenue is climbing by billions every few months.

Some chase quick attention, while others focus on building systems that deliver real value. In 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a clear example of how utility is overtaking hype as the true measure of success. The projects gaining momentum are those proving their worth through working tools and active communities. BlockDAG’s mobile mining model, for example, shows how participation can directly translate into ownership and growth. From BDAG’s presale achievements to scalable smart contract platforms, the top trending cryptos of 2025 are setting the stage for adoption, usability, and sustainable expansion. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Proves Mining Can Deliver Real Value BlockDAG is reshaping the idea of mobile mining by turning it into something tangible. Where projects like Pi Network attracted millions without providing actual payouts, BlockDAG’s X1 app has already brought in over 2.5 million daily users who mine BDAG coins that will be credited directly to their wallets at launch. This makes it a system designed for real rewards, not just promises. The presale has been a strong indicator of demand. With $385 million raised and more than 25.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is currently in batch 30 for $0.03. Early participants have already seen returns climb by 2,900% since batch 1, showing the scale of growth in a short time. Supporting this momentum is an ecosystem of infrastructure. BlockDAG offers hardware mining devices like the X10, X30, and X100, partnerships with professional sports teams, and confirmed listings on 20 major exchanges. With referral rewards, an educational academy, and gamified tools like Buyer Battles, BlockDAG has secured its place among the top trending cryptos of 2025. 2. Stellar (XLM): Edge in Global Payments Stellar has maintained its reputation as a network built for fast and affordable cross-border payments. With its early partnership with IBM and strong focus on unbanked communities, it carved out a unique role in financial inclusion. Even as growth has slowed compared to its early momentum, XLM remains a credible option for institutions seeking reliability. The ability to move funds across borders in seconds with minimal fees keeps Stellar relevant in regions where traditional remittance systems remain costly. While it lacks the complex smart contract functions of newer chains, its lean and efficient design makes it stand out. That strength ensures Stellar stays among the top trending cryptos for those looking at practical financial utility. 3. Algorand (ALGO): Quiet but Powerful Expansion Algorand continues to impress by delivering steady progress rather than chasing headlines. Founded by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor and Turing Award winner, the network’s Pure Proof of Stake design supports low-cost, secure, and high-throughput transactions. Its structure has positioned it as a reliable chain for both governments and enterprises. With use cases ranging from Central Bank Digital Currency pilots to national land registries, Algorand’s influence is broadening. The ecosystem is also welcoming more DeFi and NFT projects, thanks to fast finality and its carbon-neutral approach. Though it avoids wild price swings, ALGO is securing long-term credibility. This measured growth places Algorand firmly among the top trending cryptos with sustainable adoption potential. 4. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise-Grade Momentum Hedera brings a unique model to the table with its hashgraph consensus, allowing thousands of transactions per second with near-instant finality. This makes HBAR particularly suited for industries demanding speed and security. Its governance council, featuring companies like Google, IBM, Boeing, and LG, shows the scale of confidence it commands at the enterprise level. What makes Hedera especially compelling is its adoption in real-world applications like identity verification, secure data storage, and high-volume payments. With Fortune 500 firms actively building on its network, Hedera has validation that many competitors lack. While not yet a favorite for retail traders, its enterprise credibility ensures HBAR’s place among the top trending cryptos, where speculation meets powerful infrastructure. Quick Recap The time for empty promises is ending, and the spotlight is shifting to projects that provide utility, access, and meaningful growth. BlockDAG is showing this shift clearly, with mobile mining that delivers real payouts, a $385 million presale backed by strong ROI, and a community of millions already engaged worldwide. As the industry matures, focus is moving toward projects with traction and proven value. The top trending cryptos of 2025 will be those that combine adoption with long-term relevance, offering users impact that goes far beyond speculation.

50787744,566278,1756335613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50787744.jpeg,Is Dogecoin On Discount? Whales Go To Market With 32.9 Million DOGE Withdrawal From Binance,https://bitcoinist.com/is-dogecoin-on-discount/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in focus as whale activity ramps up despite the latest market correction. New on-chain data reveals that millions of DOGE are being transferred from Binance to private wallets, suggesting that major holders may view the current pullback as a prime entry point. With prices sliding from recent highs, whales also appear to be seizing the opportunity to accumulate tokens at a discount. Whales Move Millions Of Dogecoin From Binance On-chain data from multi-chain AI analytics platform Nansen has sparked renewed interest in Dogecoin after a major transaction was spotted on the blockchain. According to the platform, a newly created wallet withdrew 32.9 million DOGE, worth approximately $6.96 million, from Binance on August 26. Notably, large withdrawals of this kind are often associated with accumulation trends , particularly when directed toward self-custody wallets rather than exchanges. Commenting on the transfer, a crypto community member noted that new wallet activity of this scale usually signals a player gearing up for big moves. As a result, he urged market participants to monitor the wallet address closely. Not long after the first large-scale transfer, another whale made a similar move, withdrawing 20 million DOGE valued at $4.43 million. Nansen reveals that in total, the whale now holds an impressive 52.9 million DOGE, which amounts to roughly $11.71 million at current market prices. The rapid succession of these whale transfers suggests a growing confidence among large holders. Historically, sizeable withdrawals from exchanges have been associated with bullish sentiment, as they often suggest that investors prefer holding assets long-term rather than keeping them on platforms where they could be quickly liquidated. The timing of the withdrawals is also particularly interesting given Dogecoin’s prolonged decline , which may be encouraging deep-pocketed investors to buy tokens at much lower prices . DOGE Whale Accumulation Grows Amid Price Correction While whales initiate withdrawals from exchanges , on-chain metrics reveal a broader pattern of Dogecoin accumulation among large holders during the recent market downturn . According to data from Santiment, the 50-day average of large DOGE transfers, valued at $100,000 or higher, surged significantly in August, marking the highest level in five months. Alongside the rise in high-value transactions, Dogecoin’s daily active addresses have also increased significantly, marking their highest surge this month, around August 13. This suggests that not only are whales increasing their stakes, but network activity is showing renewed strength. Notably, the accumulation comes in the wake of a 16% price drop for Dogecoin from $0.245 on August 24. Following the correction , the meme coin has staged a mild recovery of 4.69% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.219. CoinMarketCap data also shows that despite a monthly decline of over 10%, Dogecoin has managed a weekly gain of about 3.2%. However, not all indicators are bullish. Daily trading volume has declined sharply, down 36.15% as of writing, and presently sitting at $2.1 billion.",Dogecoin|binance|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Nansen|Santiment,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-27 23:00:13

The move has triggered a renewed optimism among traders who see the ascending triangle pattern forming on the charts as a potential launchpad for a breakout toward $255. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Set To Hit $4 If It Breaks This Resistance Line According to analyst Lark Davis, Solana has been rejected three times at the $205 mark, but higher lows and sustained buying pressure suggest that momentum is building. “If volume continues to rise into this test, the setup points clearly to $255 as the next target,” Davis explained. Trading activity supports that outlook, with more than $9 billion in daily volume underscoring strong market participation. Technical Indicators Signal Solana Stability Market data shows Solana is not yet in overbought territory, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting at 55.63. This gives the cryptocurrency room to climb further without triggering immediate selling pressure. The MACD indicator has also confirmed a bullish crossover, aligning with the positive momentum. On-chain signals strengthen the case for upside. Solana’s trading volume is steadily increasing, while its clean rebounds from the ascending trendline highlight active buying on every dip. Market analyst Alex Clay further pointed out a completed W-bottom pattern on the SOL/BTC chart, suggesting Solana may outperform Bitcoin in the short term, just as Ethereum recently did. Outlook: Path Toward $255 Breakout For traders, the $205 level has become the decisive battleground. A confirmed breakout above it, supported by strong volume and sentiment, could propel Solana to the $255 technical target. SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview The broader crypto market backdrop also favors SOL, with Ethereum’s rally drawing attention to high-potential altcoins. Analysts caution that failure to hold above $205 could delay the move higher, leaving Solana stuck in its current consolidation zone. With institutional interest in Solana growing and network activity reaching record levels, the token remains one of the most closely watched assets in the market.

This explosive growth is fueling speculation that MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the kind of breakout Ethereum experienced in its early years. At the same time, Ethereum itself is dominating headlines with record-breaking ETF inflows, expanding DeFi dominance, and bullish price predictions from top analysts. Together, Ethereum’s institutional success and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s grassroots momentum highlight two powerful forces shaping the next phase of the crypto bull market. Ethereum ETFs Break Records as Institutional Demand Surges Ethereum (ETH) continues to attract massive institutional capital in 2025. In August alone, spot Ethereum ETFs brought in $2.3 billion , equal to 500,000 ETH — matching the network’s issuance since the 2022 Merge. A single day even saw $1 billion of inflows into nine spot ETFs, marking the largest daily inflow in Ethereum’s history. Leading the charge is the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) , which acquired over 150,000 ETH in August. Across all issuers, Ethereum ETFs now manage a staggering $19.2 billion in assets , with nearly $2 billion added in Q3 alone. ETH/USD Chart: TradingView This surge comes as regulatory clarity strengthens Ethereum’s position: the SEC reclassified ETH as a utility token , and the CLARITY Act officially recognized Ethereum as a digital commodity. These moves have paved the way for greater institutional adoption and financial integration. Ethereum Ecosystem Growth Reaches New Highs Beyond ETFs, Ethereum’s network fundamentals are stronger than ever: DeFi Dominance: Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has soared to $97 billion , accounting for 65% of all blockchain DeFi activity. Protocols like Aave, Lido, and Uniswap are leading this charge. Record Network Activity: With over 1.74 million daily transactions and 680,000 active addresses , Ethereum is busier than ever. The gas limit increase to 45 million has helped meet demand. Staking Surge: Over 36 million ETH is staked , representing nearly 30% of circulating supply. A recent mega-stake of 269,485 ETH by a suspected early Bitcoin whale highlighted deep institutional trust. Layer 2 Expansion: Arbitrum and Optimism now handle 60% of Ethereum’s transactions , offering sub-$0.01 gas fees and growing their TVLs to $10.4B and $5.6B respectively. Meanwhile, experts are extremely bullish on ETH price action. Tom Lee raised his 2025 target to $15,000 , while Arthur Hayes predicts ETH could soar to $20,000 this cycle . Standard Chartered holds a more conservative $7,500 target, but all forecasts point to Ethereum’s continued dominance. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Big Presale? While Ethereum is proving itself as the king of institutional adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating massive retail buzz . With its presale already exceeding $13 million , the project is quickly building a strong community foundation that could fuel breakout growth once it hits major exchanges. Smart money inflows show whales are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , signaling growing confidence from early large-scale investors. This type of accumulation often precedes major price breakouts, as experienced traders tend to position themselves well before mainstream hype arrives. MAGACOIN FINANCE successfully completed a full smart contract audit by HashEx, attracting investor attention. This clear approval has made buyers accumulate MAGA tokens heavily. With strong foundations in place, the audit adds another layer of trust to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation. With its fast-rising presale already crossing impressive funding milestones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being included in several analysts’ lists of the Best Cryptos to Buy for the upcoming multi-year bull market. Backed by strong community energy and early whale interest, it could become one of the standout performers of 2025. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Follow Ethereum’s Path? Ethereum’s early investors saw unimaginable returns, with ETH skyrocketing from under $1 to thousands of dollars per token. While MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t aiming to replace Ethereum, its high demand + presale momentum formula could generate similar explosive results for early holders. The project’s trajectory shows strong parallels: Ethereum Early Days: Grassroots excitement, massive upside potential, and early adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Today: Surging presale growth, viral buying demand, and perfect timing in a bullish crypto market. Ethereum’s success can be seen as a representation of the power held by institutions, whereas MAGACOIN FINANCE is the energy coming from the retail investors that have been the hallmark of crypto bull runs. With Ethereum breaking institutional records and MAGACOIN FINANCE igniting retail FOMO, investors in Q4 2025 have two clear paths to growth — and the chance to catch the next breakout success story. Final Thoughts Ethereum is cementing its position as the backbone of institutional crypto adoption, but retail investors are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the most explosive upside potential. Ethereum ETFs & DeFi dominance show how far the network has come. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $13M presale milestone : The $13M presale of MAGACOIN Finance underlines the impressive traction of a strong community-led growth. For investors seeking the next big opportunity , MAGACOIN FINANCE could very well be the best crypto presale to watch in 2025 , with the potential to deliver returns that echo Ethereum’s legendary breakout.

The platform has been touted as a milestone in the ongoing effort to connect decentralized finance (DeFi) with the infrastructure and rules of traditional markets, as it opens the door for institutional investors to easily access on-chain liquidity while still being compliant with regulatory standards. Horizon combines the compliance needs of regulated institutions with the open, composable infrastructure of Aave’s decentralized protocols. According to Aave Labs , institutions will be able to borrow stablecoins such as USDC, GHO, and Ripple Labs’ RLUSD against RWAs, including tokenized Treasuries, corporate bonds, and collateralized loan obligations. The platform operates on a permissioned instance of Aave V3, ensuring issuers comply with regulatory checks while preserving composability in stablecoin lending markets. Horizon combines compliance with composability Horizon balances two worlds that rarely meet. On one hand, collateral must come from issuers who clear regulatory checks, ensuring that the assets being posted are compliant. On the other hand, the borrowing side remains permissionless, so stablecoin markets like its stablecoin GHO, USDC, and Ripple Labs’ RLUSD can remain open and composable with the rest of DeFi. That hybrid structure is what Aave Labs believes will unlock institutional confidence. Horizon also integrates Chainlink’s SmartData infrastructure, such as the Onchain Net Asset Value (NAV) reporting and Proof of Reserves feeds, to continuously verify the value and collateralization of tokenized assets. Aave Labs has big-name partners lined up Aave didn’t launch Horizon in isolation. It arrives with a roster of well-known financial institutions and tokenization players already signed on. Partners include Circle, VanEck, Securitize, Superstate, Centrifuge, WisdomTree, and Hamilton Lane, among others. On day one, Horizon will support tokenized assets like Superstate’s USTB and USCC Treasury funds, Circle’s USYC short-duration yield fund, Centrifuge’s JAAA and JTRSY loan tokens, and VanEck’s VBILL Treasury bills. These aren’t fringe experiments; they’re some of the most credible efforts to bring U.S. Treasuries and other traditional fixed-income products on-chain. More capital into the $25B RWA market More than $25 billion worth of tokenized RWAs are already circulating on public blockchains. But most of that capital is kept in legacy structures, with Ethereum accounting for a sizeable chunk of the market. Horizon changes that dynamic by turning tokenized Treasuries and similar products into active collateral for stablecoin borrowing. That move doesn’t just expand liquidity in DeFi markets; it also creates new revenue streams for the Aave DAO, which governs the Aave ecosystem. For DeFi, the potential is significant. If tokenized RWAs become reliable collateral, it could deepen on-chain liquidity pools, reduce reliance on volatile crypto-native assets, and accelerate adoption by institutions that have so far hesitated. “Horizon is a very exciting new chapter in Aave’s development and really shows the next stage of the DeFi industry,” said Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink. “We are very excited to be a key partner for Aave’s Horizon plan and are looking forward to enabling it to be highly secure, reliable, and connected to leading financial institutions.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

South Korean Lawmakers: PEPE, XRP-Keen The administration of President Lee Jae-myung has talked of deregulating the crypto markets and ushering in the “KOSPI 5000 era.” Authorities plan to nearly double fines for companies and individuals found guilty of deliberate accounting fraud and introduce new penalties for corporate leaders who order such misconduct. https://t.co/InaV8tnh6b — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 27, 2025 The President wants to promote capital market revitalization, usher in new stablecoin- and crypto-powered investment growth, and breathe new life into the stagnant South Korean stock market. The media outlet said that it had analysed changes to the National Assembly’s Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee’s members’ assets since their last public declarations in March this year. The newspaper wrote that the 16 lawmakers who make up the committee have “focused their investments on cryptoassets such as XRP and PEPE, overseas tech stocks, and unlisted shares.

(Source: @jinjongoh_official/Instagram) The probe found that Jin is currently holding XRP 3,359, XCORE 8, and 214 Paycoin (PCI). The dollar value of these coins has “quadrupled” in recent months, rising from $1,768 to $9,579, the outlet wrote. However, South Korean law also requires lawmakers to disclose assets belonging to their immediate family. This measure was introduced to ensure lawmakers cannot hide their income and assets by registering them in family members’ names. The investigation revealed that Jin’s mother “diversified her crypto portfolio.” She is currently holding a range of metaverse and GameFi-related coins. Her holdings include Bitcoin, Chiliz, and Sandbox. She has also bought over 3.2 billion Pepe (PEPE) coins. US Tech Stocks Also Popular On the other side of the house, crypto enthusiasm is also high.

Others have spent money on unlisted gaming stocks, buying shares in developers such as Xten Games and Memray.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. China’s growing focus on stablecoins is less about embracing crypto and more about defending its currency from U.S. dollar dominance, says Dr. Vera Yuen of Hong Kong University's Business School, who argues the shift highlights offshore opportunities but also deep domestic limits. Beijing's shift comes as Washington moved first to create a regulatory framework for the stablecoin industry in the U.S. Reuters recently reported that China's State Council is reviewing a roadmap for yuan-backed stablecoins later this month, with Hong Kong and Shanghai expected to fast-track adoption. In an earlier interview, Animoca Group president Evan Auyang told CoinDesk the trigger was the U.S. GENIUS Act, which cements dollar-pegged tokens as part of global finance. He said the law is “pressuring China to act a lot faster,” pushing Beijing to consider stablecoins not as speculative instruments, as once described by the People's Bank of China, but as necessary infrastructure to keep pace in global trade and settlement. Yuen said the government first prioritized the e-CNY , its Central Bank Digital Currency, because it offered control, traceability, and seigniorage profits — features that regulators valued over those of privately issued tokens. But she noted that stablecoins have a clear edge in international use. “Many CBDCs are developed for domestic use, so for international use of CBDCs, there is a big problem of interoperability of different systems. Stablecoins are designed to be used internationally, so it can be a better option for cross-border transactions,” she told CoinDesk. ""Focusing on stablecoins allows China to respond proactively to global regulatory debates and technological advances, ensuring it remains competitive and prepared as the digital currency landscape evolves,"" Yuen continued. Capital controls still mean any yuan token will stay offshore, with Hong Kong’s new regime providing the testing ground. However, limited CNH liquidity underscores how narrow the runway is for China’s internationalization push. ""This would limit the issuance of offshore renminbi stablecoins, constraining its attractiveness as a means of payment,"" Yuen said. China is also not moving in isolation. In Japan, Monex Group is preparing to issue a yen-backed stablecoin tied to government bonds, joining other domestic players such as SBI and JPYC. Unlike China, however, where capital controls push experimentation offshore, Japan’s regulators are laying the groundwork for stablecoins to circulate at home, signaling Asia’s broader race to keep pace with U.S. dollar tokens. For now, Beijing’s stablecoin experiment looks less like a replacement for the e-CNY and more like a cautious complement, a way to extend the yuan’s reach abroad without loosening its grip at home. Market Movements BTC: BTC held at $111K as Nvidia posted strong earnings. ETH: ETH is trading at $4,500, and history shows that a green August often precedes a 60% year-end rally, though typically after a September dip. Gold: Gold traded Wednesday at $3,443 per ounce, up 1.6% from Tuesday’s close, extending a 37% year-over-year rally, though prices slipped in early trading as attention turned to Nvidia earnings and Trump’s Fed feud. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.2% Wednesday, pushing Wall Street to a new all-time high ahead of Nvidia’s earnings.

Many are seeking early-stage projects with strong fundamentals that can outperform established giants. Hidden gem presales are attracting attention not only for their upside potential but also for their ability to outpace even blue-chip tokens. Among the fresh names making waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about projects, with analysts linking it to extraordinary ROI projections. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight The MAGACOIN FINANCE forecast is shaking up discussions across trading circles. Analysts are projecting a staggering 22,500% return, pushing it far ahead of traditional players. Touted as one of the best crypto presale events of 2025, expectations now suggest a possible 40x rise. The excitement is driven by strong community backing and capped availability, which has fueled urgency among those chasing early entry. In comparison to legacy coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the bold new contender—an option for those hunting presales with high ROI . A Legitimate Presale Offering Safe Entry for 2025 Crypto Investors Few projects combine legitimacy and early-stage opportunity like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is why it’s ranked among the best crypto presales for 2025 . With verified audit results, a transparent roadmap, and a compliant team structure, the project sets a new standard in presale safety. This foundation is what gives MAGACOIN FINANCE its growing reputation as one of the most promising altcoins in the space. 2. Cardano: Q4 Upgrades and Bullish Outlook The Cardano price outlook for 2025 has been steadily improving thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Analysts remain optimistic: Digital Coin Price sees ADA climbing as high as $2.69 with an average of $2.46. CoinCodex pushes the ceiling even higher, projecting a $5.33 maximum target. Whale activity is also ramping up, with 200 million ADA bought in just 48 hours. Beyond speculation, Cardano is actively building. Hydra’s Layer-2 scaling reached one million transactions per second in tests, while Project Acropolis is cutting sync times by 40%. Cardano 1Y price chart With ETF approval odds surging past 80% on Polymarket, bullish bets are growing stronger. This makes Cardano one of the top crypto investments 2025 could deliver. 3. MATIC/POL: Bold Targets and Expanding Utility Polygon has undergone one of the most ambitious transitions in the space with its full migration to POL. The MATIC bullish prediction for 2025 paints an aggressive picture: Flitpay puts the top target at $6.25. TokenMetrics anticipates $3.91 by year-end. Participation in the migration has exceeded 85%, highlighting strong community support. Polygon’s AggLayer and Chain Development Kit are unlocking cross-chain liquidity, while 100 million POL are allocated yearly for project growth. With predictions spanning from $0.47 at the low end to multiple dollars in bullish scenarios, the MATIC bullish prediction narrative is hard to ignore. Like Cardano, Polygon is positioning itself among the top crypto investments 2025 watchers are tracking closely. Final Word: Which Hidden Gem Presales Stand Out? For those eyeing hidden gem presales, the field looks stacked with opportunities. Cardano and MATIC remain strong candidates thanks to robust development and institutional interest. However, the MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one turning heads with its bold 22,500% ROI projection. The limited entry slots and a fast-growing community narrative make it one of the presales with high ROI traders don’t want to overlook. In short, while ADA and MATIC are cementing their place as reliable long-term holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in as the rising star tipped as the best crypto presale of 2025.

This came after the administration secured an $11 billion equity deal with Intel, raising questions about whether similar stakes would be taken in other chipmakers. Speaking Wednesday on Fox Business, Bessent told Maria Bartiromo that Nvidia “doesn’t need financial support,” shutting down speculation immediately. He explained that the Intel deal was about taxpayers getting a return, not handouts. “President Trump is going to be the only president in modern times who creates assets for the American people rather than debt,” Bessent said. “We looked, he saw that Intel had been given grants, and wanted to know why the American taxpayer wouldn’t participate in the upside. So there’s $11 billion of immediate value. And I think there’s a very good chance here that it could be much more.” Bessent says future equity deals may target other U.S. industries Pressed by Bartiromo on whether Trump would back a stake in Nvidia, Bessent made the administration’s position clear: “I don’t think Nvidia needs financial support. So, you know, that that seems not on the table right now.” But he didn’t rule out other industries. “Could there be other industries where we’re reshaping—something like shipbuilding? Sure. There could be things like that. And these are critical industries that we have to be self-sufficient in the United States.” Bessent didn’t try to sell it as just another industrial strategy. He tied it directly to national survival, saying the COVID-19 pandemic showed how fragile the U.S. was. He called the pandemic a “beta” test for a kinetic war, pointing to America’s deep reliance on foreign manufacturing. “Think about it, 80-90% of the precursor pharma products are made overseas. And that’s just unacceptable,” Bessent said . “As we saw during COVID, the manufacturing countries will keep it for themselves.” The Intel move has already stirred up Republican backlash, with lawmakers split. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., didn’t hold back: “The U.S. federal government should not be buying companies,” he told Fox News Digital. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the CHIPS Act’s lead sponsors, also criticized the strategy. “It was not the intent of the law, you know, an equity stake to be taken,” Young said. “But it was the intent to ensure that we enhance our economic security and national security, which is the objective that they are trying, that the administration is trying to advance.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The reason? Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on Indian goods officially took effect Wednesday, and the hit is brutal. According to Reuters, trade analysts expect India’s exports to shrink by over 40%, a $37 billion blow in this April–March fiscal year. That crater is coming straight for labor-heavy industries like gems, textiles, and jewelry. These sectors are employment engines. Tens of thousands of jobs are now hanging by a thread. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t made a direct statement, but his silence is already costing him. With elections coming up in Bihar, a key rural state, his voter base is on edge. He’s responded with tax relief pledges, including a plan to slash goods and services taxes by October. The U.S. tariffs are a direct response to India’s increased trade with Russia, particularly in energy. Washington sees the flow of discounted oil as undermining Western pressure on Moscow. India refuses to stop buying oil as U.S. talks heat up Since early 2022, India’s oil imports from Russia have exploded. Russian crude now accounts for nearly 40% of all oil India buys, up from virtually nothing before the Ukraine invasion. Indian companies like Reliance Industries, owned by Mukesh Ambani, lead those purchases, and they’ve locked in discounts as high as 7% below global rates. Replacing that volume overnight is out of the question. India imports around 2 million barrels of Russian oil per day. If it stops, internal government estimates say global oil could surge to $200 per barrel. No one in New Delhi wants to carry that blame. India’s foreign ministry has defended the Russian oil purchases as “meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer,” calling them a necessity forced by global conditions. At the same time, officials are accusing Washington of hypocrisy. But while Trump attacks India over crude, the U.S. still buys Russian uranium hexafluoride, palladium, and fertilizer. India’s diplomats also point out that China’s oil imports from Russia have jumped from 13% to 16%, yet no penalties have landed on Beijing. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking on CNBC last week, said India’s behavior amounts to profiteering, calling the volume of post-war purchases “unacceptable.” That interview triggered the latest wave of friction. India argues that the Biden administration had previously supported its Russian oil purchases in order to help keep global fuel prices stable. Trump’s reversal now puts Modi in a bind—with Russia relying on India to maintain oil exports and the U.S. threatening long-term trade consequences. India juggles diplomacy as rivals eye its market share In recent days, Indian diplomats have made trips to Moscow to smooth ties. Modi is also expected to visit China this month, the first in over seven years, to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. He’ll meet both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping there. But Indian officials say no trilateral summit is planned. Trust with Beijing is still fragile following the 2020 border clash, and Delhi is playing cautious. Happymon Jacob, who leads the Council for Strategic and Defence Research in Delhi, laid out India’s tightrope walk. He said the country still needs Russia for weapons, oil, diplomatic support, and help on key political matters. But he also called the U.S. India’s most important strategic partner, noting: “India simply doesn’t have the luxury of choosing one over the other, at least not yet.” The U.S.–India fallout is already affecting more than just oil and trade. Experts say visa access for Indian tech workers and the offshoring of services may be the next friction points. And even if India manages to claw back some relief from the tariffs, the long-term effects could be devastating. Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI and a former trade official, warned that countries like Vietnam, China, Mexico, Turkey, Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala, and Kenya are ready to snap up the markets India is being forced out of. “They could lock India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled back,” Srivastava said.

Is This New Coin Set To Take The Shine Off Ripple’s 2025 Run?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/where-next-2-50-or-4-50-is-this-new-coin-set-to-take-the-shine-off-ripples-2025-run/,"The XRP Price Prediction has once again become a major talking point as Ripple’s token struggles to hold momentum. After a strong recovery earlier this year, XRP has slowed near the $0.60–$0.70 range, leaving traders divided. Some analysts believe a rally toward $2.50 is possible if broader sentiment turns bullish, while the more optimistic forecasts suggest a climb as high as $4.50 during the 2025 bull cycle. At the same time, a new meme-powered Ethereum Layer 2 project, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), has entered the conversation. With its mix of culture, speed, and staking rewards, it is already being discussed as a potential breakout that could rival some of the biggest names in the altcoin market. XRP price prediction in focus XRP has long been a controversial yet resilient asset in the crypto space. Despite ongoing legal hurdles with the SEC, it remains one of the largest tokens by market cap, supported by Ripple’s global payment network and partnerships with financial institutions. Bulls argue that if Ripple secures more adoption deals, XRP could revisit the $2.50 level in the next cycle. For the more ambitious predictions of $4.50 to materialize, however, the project will need to not only expand its institutional base but also regain speculative momentum among retail traders. Historically, XRP’s biggest rallies have come when both factors align. Without retail excitement, even strong fundamentals may not be enough to push it into new highs. Ethereum Layer 2 coins stealing the spotlight While XRP continues to battle resistance, traders are also scanning for coins that combine hype with technical innovation. Ethereum Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism have already shown how scaling solutions can unlock activity at lower costs. Building on this trend, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) has quickly emerged as a presale favorite. Unlike XRP, which is driven largely by institutional adoption, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is tapping into retail energy while adding real blockchain features. The team has laid out a roadmap that includes NFT tie-ins, gamified staking models, and future cross-chain links, all designed to keep the community active well beyond its presale phase. Traders on major forums and social platforms are already calling it one of the tokens to watch for 2025, noting how it combines humor with practical usability. With a fixed supply capped at 10 billion tokens, scarcity is built into the design, giving $LBRETT another edge as speculation builds that it could become one of the most talked-about meme plays of the next cycle. Final thoughts The latest XRP Price Prediction shows a wide gap between cautious and bullish forecasts, with targets ranging from $2.50 to $4.50 depending on adoption and market conditions. While XRP remains a heavyweight thanks to Ripple’s institutional focus, it is also facing competition from newer projects that are capturing retail imagination. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) stands out in this regard. With Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, meme-driven appeal, and eye-catching staking rewards, it is already being called one of the most exciting new tokens heading into 2025. For investors, the choice may come down to institutional reliability with XRP or speculative high upside with $LBRETT, a decision that could define which portfolios shine the brightest in the next bull run.

Bitcoin still is the benchmark but now, newer networks like SUI are making their mark through ecosystem building. Solana, Cardano, and Chainlink remain relevant despite falling market value. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the most attractive long-term opportunities, with many analysts endorsing its unique combination of security and growth potential. Bitcoin: The Benchmark Asset for Stability Bitcoin is trading at $110,000–$111,000, down by around 2% in the last 24 hours as miners and whales take profits from a recent high above $123,000. Even with this correction, ETF inflows are still strong, with some analysts predicting rallying towards $150,000 this year on momentum. Long-term predictions are as high as $200,000–$250,000 by 2030, cementing Bitcoin’s position as the base of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin’s growth curve might be more advanced than ETH’s, it is still the most trusted digital store of value. Sui (SUI): DeFi and Gaming Expansion Drive Growth Sui (SUI), the crypto asset, has been trading very close to $3.40. It has gained 1.8% in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, the coin has a market cap of about $8.8 billion. The Defi network’s growth has been accelerating quickly as DEX volume surpassed $10 billion in August while its TVL rose a whopping 44% this quarter to $1.76 billion. The gaming sector is also showing signs of promise as Jackson.io launches as Sui’s first licensed iGaming platform with profit-sharing for stakers. Analysts believe Sui is one of the best emerging chains to buy for the long term with more than 40 million monthly active addresses and the release of an XAUm gold-backed token for institutional purchasers. Cardano (ADA): Building for Real-World Adoption Cardano is priced at around $0.844, with solid network fundamentals supporting its outlook. Developer activity is strong, with Hydra scaling upgrades mitigating congestion. In the Middle East and Africa, partnerships are boosting adoption across supply chain, identity and education use cases. Cardano continues to rank among the best in terms of community engagement and staking. Analysts believe ADA could be a significant asset for long-term investors, given its low transaction volume and growing DeFi TVL. Solana (SOL): Institutional and Ecosystem Leadership Solana is up slightly on the day with a price of $188.52 and a market cap nearing $88 billion. The network, despite corrections, still generates more blockchain revenue than any other. So far this year, it has made over $1.3 billion. Wall Street treasuries are directly allocating into SOL as institutional adoption ramps up fast. Due to its unparalleled speed and thriving DeFi, NFT, and SocialFi ecosystems that make it is a top institutional and retail pick for long-term performance. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Powering Tokenization Crypto oracle provider Chainlink has a market cap of $11 billion, and the LINK price is $23.62. The network’s CCIP protocol is creating interoperability between Ethereum, Avalanche, and Sui for institutional-grade DeFi and tokenized assets. Analysts believe Chainlink will function as the backbone technology for the forthcoming wave of tokenization as its blockchain and traditional finance bridge becomes essential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Standout Growth Play Bitcoin and SUI remain strong analyst picks, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout long-term growth play. Backed by double audits from HashEx and CertiK, it’s rated safe, secure, and fully transparent, giving investors confidence. With forecasts of 90x upside and thousands already joining the presale, analysts call it one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth in 2025 — but limited supply means time is running out. Analysts also point out that its KYC-verified team and transparent roadmap set it apart from speculative presales, making it a safer yet high-upside opportunity. Conclusion The strongest altcoins for long-term adoption include Bitcoin, SUI, Cardano, Solana, and Chainlink. All these coins are active in their ecosystems. Also, they have institutional interest. Nonetheless, analysts agree that presales offer the biggest asymmetric opportunity. Due to its dual audits, verified team, and rising demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is recognized as one of the best cryptos with explosive upside and safety for long-term growth in 2025.

No one thought that it could be the biggest crypto by market cap. By 2025, BNB reached highs of over $800, meaning a $1,000 investment in 2020 would have grown to over $40,000. The growth of BNB is a result of Binance’s market dominance in the crypto industry. Developers are flooding into Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as it offers low fees and scalability. BNB dramatically increased in popularity as demand for DeFi apps, gaming projects, and NFTs, all of which utilise BNB in their ecosystems, surged. Ups and Downs Along BNB’s Journey BNB has seen both massive rallies and painful drawdowns. After reaching a high of $600 in 2021, it fell below $200 in the bear market of 2022, before a stronger bounceback in 2023–2025. Experts now suggest BNB may surge toward $1,000 in the next cycle, although like Ethereum, its upside multiples are more modest than they once were. Speculators Found a New Golden Opportunity As BNB has settled down, people are looking for an early-stage opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE. That’s unlike BNB, which is now too well established in the marketplace, MAGACOIN remains in presale – meaning a small influx of capital can trigger huge price movements. The quick sellout indicates that investors are seeking exposure before the listing. Why New Entrants Gain Traction Cryptocurrency investors are aware that the most significant multiples occur prior to general acceptance. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining popularity among traders due to its name, community, and limited supply. According to some analysts, the BNB project, which made early buyers billionaires, is strikingly similar to this mix in its early phases. Conclusion BNB utility token started at $20, and today, it is among the top coins in the world. Thus, showing that mankind can reap terrific benefits if they have an early conviction. A $1,000 bet in 2020 grew into tens of thousands today. With MAGACOIN FINANCE being planted as the next big thing, investors look for the next explosive play. If you weren’t able to get in on BNB’s rise, this presale could be the next early story. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

According to a new survey by Aviva , 27% of UK adults said they would be open to including digital currency in their retirement portfolios, while 23% said they might withdraw part or all of their existing pensions to buy crypto directly. Growing Appetite Despite Worries Based on reports from Censuswide, which polled 2,000 UK adults between June 4 and June 6, more than four in five people hold pensions that add up to about £3.8 trillion ($5.10 trillion). If even a small slice of that moved into crypto , it could be meaningful for markets. Of the respondents who said they were open to digital currency in pensions, just over 40% pointed to the chance of higher returns as the main draw. UK retirement savers warm to crypto. A new Aviva survey finds 27% of UK adults would include crypto in retirement, hinting at future flows from a multi-trillion pound pension market. ‣ 27% open to crypto in pensions, per @Censuswide polling for Aviva‣ 23% would even shift… pic.twitter.com/9xejvGEIGh — TrinityPad (@Trinity_Pad) August 27, 2025 Younger Savers Lead The Shift Younger adults appear to be the most active. Reports show nearly 20% of people aged 25 to 34 admitted to withdrawing pension money to buy crypto at some point. Aviva’s research also found that about one in five UK adults — roughly 11.5 million people — have held crypto at some time, and two-thirds of that group still hold some form of digital asset. That mix of ownership and age-skewed behavior helps explain why digital currency is now part of conversations about retirement planning. Survey participants flagged clear concerns. Hacking and phishing topped the list at 40%, while 37% cited a lack of regulation and consumer protection, and 30% named volatility. Almost one-third admitted they didn’t completely grasp the trade-offs involved in replacing pensions with bitcoin, and 27% said they were unaware of any risks at all. Those numbers suggest interest outpaces understanding for a notable share of the public. What Regulators And Companies Are Doing Regulation will likely play a large role in how fast any shift happens. Reports note that HM Revenue and Customs will require crypto platforms to collect full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026. That move is aimed at strengthening tax compliance and oversight and could change how some consumers view bitcoin’s privacy and convenience. US Policy Also Moves The Needle The debate over retirement funds and crypto is not confined to the UK. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, opening potential access to more than $9 trillion in retirement assets.

StanChart Exec Says ETH Is ‘Cheap’ And Ready To Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-still-a-bargain-stanchart-exec-says-eth-is-cheap-and-ready-to-rally/,"Standard Chartered’s digital assets research chief says Ethereum still has room to rise, even after recent swings in price. According to Geoffrey Kendrick, growing institutional demand and shrinking exchange liquidity are tightening supply and could push Ether higher toward his year-end target of $7,500. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Doubter Just Dropped Close To $5 Price Bomb — Here’s Why Institutional Demand Up Reports have disclosed that corporate digital asset treasury firms have bought about 2.5% of circulating ETH since June. Spot ETH exchange-traded funds added close to 5% over the same period. Based on those figures, roughly 7.5% of supply has been drawn into corporate treasuries and ETFs since June, a large shift in a relatively short time. Kendrick expects these firms could eventually hold up to 10% of all circulating Ether, a projection that underpins his bullish view. Exchange Outflows And Price Moves Exchange-balance trackers show a substantial movement of coins off trading platforms. In a single day, over 74,000 ETH — roughly $340 million at recent prices — was withdrawn from exchanges, led by Binance. Such outflows are often read as a sign of reduced near-term selling pressure. Ethereum did slip about 5% on Tuesday before bouncing back. According to CoinMarketCap, it trades near $4,618, marking a 4.6% gain in the last 24 hours and a weekly rise of 10%. Resistance Levels To Watch Traders are watching short-term barriers around $4,600. A clear move above that level could open $4,700, with $4,800 the next checkpoint before the prior high. The asset briefly hit an all-time high of $4,950 on August 24. Kendrick’s forecast of $7,500 by year-end implies a roughly 60% climb from current prices, a scenario that would require continued strong flows and calm macro conditions. Corporate Moves Versus Market Supply Reports point to firms such as SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion being valued in relation to their ETH exposure. Kendrick compared these companies to Strategy’s approach with Bitcoin, arguing some are priced below what he considers fair value. SharpLink has announced a share repurchase program that would trigger if its metric net asset value falls below 1.0, a move that could set a price floor for the stock. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For Triple Surge Vs. Bitcoin – Details That corporate behavior, while supportive for those equities, is not identical to permanent removal of ETH from circulation the way staking or ETF custody can be. The bullish picture rests on a few big assumptions. Macro shocks, quick shifts in investor sentiment, or regulatory moves could reverse flows fast. Crowded positions can be created when many buyers chase the same theme, and those positions can amplify volatility if sentiment changes.

Solana and XRP Whales Signal the Presale’s Just Beginning,https://timestabloid.com/can-magacoin-finance-deliver-100x-gains-solana-and-xrp/,"The crypto market is setting up for one of its most eventful years yet. Big investors are stacking into select projects, fueling debates on the best altcoin to buy now . While Solana and XRP dominate headlines with institutional demand and ETF chatter, a new contender is stepping into the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE , fresh from a clean audit by HashEx, is catching whale attention. Some are already calling it a rising star with high ROI crypto presale potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Whale Magnet With 100x Potential The hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE is simple: whales buying crypto presales are moving millions into it. This kind of behavior has historically signaled the start of major runs. Early buyers are speculating on a repeat of the same explosive growth Solana and XRP enjoyed in their early phases. With smart-contract security already verified by HashEx, confidence in its reliability has grown. Whale positioning matters because these early movers set the stage for broader adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now seen by many as a contender for the best crypto presale of 2025 , with analysts linking its setup to past breakout cycles. If momentum holds, the project could easily slot itself among the top altcoins for 2025. Solana: ETF Delays, Institutional Bets, and a Bold Future Few blockchains have attracted corporate-level conviction like Solana. Publicly traded companies now hold more than 3.5 million SOL, valued around $591 million. Pantera Capital is pushing a $1.25 billion initiative called “Solana Co.” to spotlight SOL as a treasury asset. These moves back up predictions, with one Solana price prediction 2025 pointing toward $280. Source: The Information ETF progress is mixed. The SEC delayed VanEck and Bitwise’s applications until October 2025, citing questions around staking and manipulation. Even with delays, institutional confidence remains strong. This institutional support continues to frame SOL as the best altcoin to buy now, especially among high-volume investors seeking long-term exposure. XRP: Whale Accumulation and ETF Triggers XRP has always been driven by whale-led moves, and that hasn’t changed. On-chain records show whales scooping up 440 million XRP — about $3.8 billion — during a dip around $2.95. This surge in holdings suggests growing conviction despite short-term sell pressure. Institutional plays could heat up if the SEC signs off on spot XRP ETFs between October 18–25, 2025. Analysts believe approvals could release $5–8 billion into the market. One XRP price forecast 2025 sets a bullish target of $5.50. With these developments, XRP sits firmly among the top altcoins for 2025 , drawing attention from traders aiming for multi-year growth. Final Thoughts: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the Hidden Gem? The market is stacked with opportunities. Solana has ETFs on the horizon, XRP thrives on whale-driven flows, and institutions are showing conviction. But the conversation about the best crypto presale of 2025 now includes MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whales moving in early, the setup mirrors past rallies that delivered outsized gains. If speculation holds true, MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver on the promise of a high ROI crypto presale. For traders searching for the best altcoin to buy now, this project offers a blend of whale confidence, smart-contract security, and growth potential. The whales buying crypto presales may be signaling that MAGACOIN FINANCE is just at the beginning of its journey.

The Solana (SOL) price target is pushing toward an all-time high, backed by institutional inflows into its ETF. However, while both coins show significant potential, Cold Wallet (CWT) presents a real utility-backed opportunity that the others simply can’t match. Unlike XRP or Solana, which rely on fluctuating market sentiment, Cold Wallet is flipping the script by rewarding users with cashback for every transaction. As Cold Wallet’s presale surges past $6.8M, its 3,423% ROI potential stands out as a stable and actionable investment choice for those looking to capitalize on real, tangible growth in the crypto ecosystem. XRP Eyes $3.90 as Whales Pump In $5 Billion Crypto whales are making their move, adding a staggering 1.7 billion XRP tokens, worth over $5 billion, at key support levels between $2.81 and $3.13. This massive accumulation positions XRP for a potential breakout. With resistance at $3.26, XRP must clear this barrier to push toward its all-time high of $3.90. In the context of the XRP price prediction, despite a slight 4.6% dip recently, XRP is still holding strong, trading 50% higher year-to-date, and showing solid gains from last year. But traders are cautious. Recent market drops and unlocks of $59 million worth of XRP tokens could put downward pressure on the price. Yet, with low supply above $3.26, a bullish run remains possible if whales continue defending key levels. Solana (SOL) Price Target Set for ATH as ETF Demand Soars Solana (SOL) is gaining momentum, with the price hovering around $193, just shy of its recent $210 high. The rise is driven by strong demand for the new Solana (SOL) price target as ETF inflows continue, signaling growing investor confidence. The recently launched REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) saw record inflows of $25.8 million last week, pushing total assets to over $183 million. Solana’s network activity is also accelerating, with a 6.2% increase in stablecoin supply and 31% more monthly transactions, now totaling 2.44 billion. With a solid technical setup, including a golden cross pattern, Solana’s price could soon break past $210, targeting its all-time high of $295. Investors eyeing growth should keep an eye on the SOL price target as momentum builds and institutional interest rises. Cold Wallet’s $6.8M Presale Surge: Why You Need to Buy Before Stage 18! Unlike Trust Wallet and MetaMask, which charge you fees to use them, Cold Wallet actually pays you. Whether it’s cashback on gas fees, swaps, or bridges, Cold Wallet turns your activity into rewards. Plus, users earn USDT just for referring others. It’s this real utility that’s helped Cold Wallet raise $6.8 million in its presale, with over 785 million tokens sold. Investors jumping in at Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, are betting on a challenger that doesn’t need to prove demand. It’s already packed with users, and it’s only getting started. With the price steadily rising and Stage 18 just around the corner, time is running out to lock in this massive opportunity. The ROI potential is massive; early buyers could see 3,423% gains when the price hits its $0.3517 launch price. But the closer we get to Stage 18, the less chance there is for huge returns. This is more than just another crypto presale website , it’s a real product that’s already rewarding its users. With Cold Wallet’s $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet, the project has 2 million active users and is set to scale even faster. If you’re tired of wallets that take your fees and give you nothing back, Cold Wallet is your chance to get paid for using crypto. Don’t wait too long, the window to act is closing fast! Cold Wallet Stands Out as the Best Crypto for Higher Returns, Beating XRP and Solana The XRP price prediction shows a bullish outlook, with whales positioning for a potential breakout toward $3.90. Solana’s (SOL) price target is set for a potential ATH, driven by ETF demand and institutional interest. But the best crypto for higher returns in the long term is Cold Wallet. Its cashback model, growing user base, and massive ROI potential are much better than the uncertain nature of XRP and Solana. Cold Wallet has already raised $6.8 million in presale, with over 785 million tokens sold, and its $0.00998 price is still offering early buyers an incredible upside. As CWT grows in popularity, its real utility will continue to separate it from the crowd, making it the top contender for those seeking stable, long-term rewards.

We’re talking about a massive Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal , involving a staggering $125 million worth of ETH. This substantial movement of funds from the FalconX platform has sparked considerable discussion and speculation among the cryptocurrency community. What Sparked This Significant Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal? According to diligent on-chain analyst Onchain Lens, four previously inactive wallets sprang to life, initiating a substantial withdrawal. These wallets collectively pulled 27,792 ETH, valued at an impressive $125 million, directly from FalconX. The analyst’s findings suggest a strong likelihood that these newly active wallets are directly linked to Bitmine, a name often associated with significant crypto operations. This connection transforms a simple transaction into a noteworthy market event, making the Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal a focal point. Tracing the Digital Footprints: The Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal Details Let’s break down the specifics of this intriguing transaction. The four wallets in question now collectively hold an astonishing 58,215 ETH. This figure includes the recently withdrawn amount, highlighting a considerable accumulation of Ethereum under these likely Bitmine-affiliated addresses. The sheer volume of this Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal underscores its importance. Moving $125 million in digital assets is not an everyday occurrence, and it naturally raises questions about the motivations behind such a strategic shift. Such large-scale movements are often closely watched by market participants. They can signal potential future actions or strategic repositioning by major entities in the crypto ecosystem. Why Does a Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal Matter? A withdrawal of this magnitude carries several potential implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, large movements of assets like Ethereum can sometimes precede significant market activity, such as selling or reallocation. Key considerations include: Market Impact: While not a direct signal of intent, a large accumulation could suggest future selling pressure or, conversely, a long-term holding strategy. Strategic Shift: This Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal might indicate a change in Bitmine’s operational strategy, perhaps moving assets for staking, diversification, or deployment in new ventures. Custody Preferences: Shifting funds from a trading platform like FalconX to private wallets suggests a move towards self-custody, offering greater control but also increased responsibility for security. Understanding On-Chain Analysis: Insights into Bitmine’s Movements On-chain analysis plays a crucial role in uncovering and interpreting these kinds of transactions. It involves examining publicly available data on blockchain ledgers to identify patterns, track fund flows, and deduce potential connections between wallets and entities. Analysts like Onchain Lens use sophisticated tools and techniques to piece together these digital breadcrumbs. Their work provides valuable transparency in an otherwise pseudonymous system, offering insights into the activities of major players, including this significant Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal . While direct attribution can sometimes be challenging, consistent patterns and historical transaction data often allow for high-probability linkages, as seen in the likely connection to Bitmine. What Could Be Next After This Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal? The crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close watch on these four wallets. Future movements from these addresses could provide further clues regarding Bitmine’s intentions. Will the ETH be transferred to other exchanges, potentially indicating a sale? Or will it be moved into staking protocols, suggesting a long-term bullish outlook? Only time will tell the full story behind this considerable Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal . For now, it serves as a powerful reminder of the transparency inherent in blockchain technology and the constant vigilance of on-chain analysts. This substantial Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal from FalconX represents more than just a large sum of money moving; it highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the critical role of on-chain intelligence. It’s a testament to how public ledger data empowers observers to gain insights into the strategic maneuvers of major players, shaping narratives and influencing market sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal? A Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal refers to a large movement of Ethereum (ETH) tokens from a cryptocurrency exchange or platform to wallets believed to be controlled by the entity known as Bitmine. In this specific instance, $125 million worth of ETH was moved from FalconX. Who is FalconX? FalconX is a prominent cryptocurrency prime brokerage platform that provides institutional investors with trading, credit, and clearing services for digital assets. It facilitates large-volume transactions for major players in the crypto market. How do analysts link wallets to entities like Bitmine? On-chain analysts use various techniques, including examining transaction histories, identifying common funding sources, tracing funds through multiple wallets, and correlating wallet activity with known entity behaviors or public announcements. This helps them infer connections, even when direct ownership isn’t explicitly stated. What are the potential implications of such a large ETH movement? Large ETH movements, such as this Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal, can have several implications. They might signal a strategic repositioning of assets, preparation for a major transaction (like staking or selling), a shift in custody preferences (e.g., from exchange to self-custody), or even a security-related transfer. They often lead to increased market speculation. Is this a common occurrence in the crypto market? While large withdrawals happen regularly, a single movement of $125 million by a potentially significant entity like Bitmine is noteworthy. It’s not an everyday event for most individual investors, but major institutional or whale movements are consistently monitored by on-chain analysts due to their potential market impact.

Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index experienced a notable shift, falling three points to 48. This movement, while keeping the index in a ‘neutral’ stage, signals a subtle change in collective market sentiment. Understanding this index is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by data provider Alternative, serves as a powerful barometer for market sentiment. It helps us gauge whether investors are feeling overly optimistic (greedy) or excessively pessimistic (fearful) about the crypto market. This index operates on a simple scale: 0: Extreme Fear – This often indicates that investors are very worried, potentially leading to selling pressure. 100: Extreme Greed – This suggests investors are overly confident, which can sometimes precede a market correction. A score of 48, as we see now, firmly places the market in a neutral zone. However, even small dips can reflect underlying shifts that smart investors monitor closely. This index provides a snapshot of the prevailing mood, offering insights beyond just price charts. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its comprehensive methodology. It doesn’t rely on a single factor but aggregates data from various sources to form a holistic view. Here are the key components and their respective weightings: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often suggests fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum. High buying volume in a positive market can signal greed, while high selling volume suggests fear. Social Media (15%): Scans social media for specific keywords and sentiment analysis. Increased mentions and positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls ask thousands of people for their market sentiment, providing direct feedback. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often points to fear, as investors tend to flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during uncertain times. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A surge in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ searches, for example, might indicate fear. Each factor contributes to the overall score, providing a nuanced perspective on investor psychology. Understanding the Recent Dip in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The recent three-point fall in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 48, while still neutral, hints at a slight cooling of market enthusiasm. This subtle shift could be influenced by a variety of factors: General Market Jitters: Broader economic concerns or regulatory uncertainties can make investors more cautious. Price Consolidation: After periods of significant price movements, markets often consolidate, leading to a more subdued sentiment. Reduced Momentum: A decrease in trading volume or social media chatter might naturally pull the index down from higher neutral levels. It’s important to remember that the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. A small dip doesn’t necessarily forecast a major crash, but it encourages investors to reassess their positions and market outlook. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights from the Index How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to inform your investment strategy? Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be ‘fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ The index can highlight these extremes, suggesting potential buying opportunities during extreme fear or caution during extreme greed. Risk Management: A high greed score might be a signal to take some profits or reduce exposure, while extreme fear could indicate a good time for dollar-cost averaging into positions. Complementary Tool: Always use the index in conjunction with fundamental analysis (project viability, technology, team) and technical analysis (price charts, indicators). No single metric tells the whole story. The index helps you understand the emotional landscape, but rational decision-making remains paramount. Conclusion: Deciphering Market Emotions The recent movement of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 48 underscores the continuous ebb and flow of sentiment in the crypto market. While remaining in the neutral zone, this dip serves as a gentle reminder that market emotions are constantly at play. By understanding how this crucial index is calculated and what its shifts signify, investors can gain a clearer perspective, making more informed decisions in their cryptocurrency journey. Always remember to combine emotional intelligence with thorough research for sustainable success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a ‘neutral’ score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A neutral score, like the current 48, indicates that investors are neither extremely fearful nor extremely greedy. It suggests a balanced market sentiment, where there isn’t a strong consensus on the market’s immediate direction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market cap dominance is a factor in its calculation, and Bitcoin often drives overall market sentiment, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to reflect the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. Its components consider general market activity. How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment for investors to consider. Can I rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions? No, it’s not advisable to rely solely on any single indicator. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for understanding market psychology, but it should be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your personal financial goals. What causes the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to change? Changes in the index are driven by shifts in its underlying factors: volatility, trading volume, social media activity, Bitcoin dominance, and Google search trends. Any significant movement in these areas can impact the overall score. Did you find this article insightful?

We’re witnessing a dramatic escalation in crypto voice phishing scams , where criminals trick victims into handing over their digital assets instead of traditional cash. This surge highlights a critical need for heightened awareness and robust security measures within the crypto community. What’s Behind the Alarming Surge in Crypto Voice Phishing Scams? The numbers paint a stark picture. According to data from South Korea’s National Police Agency, provided to People Power Party lawmaker Song Seok-jun, the first seven months of this year saw a staggering 420 cases of voice phishing rings stealing crypto assets. This figure represents an astounding 6.6-fold increase compared to the 64 cases reported during the same period last year. It’s clear that scammers are rapidly shifting their focus. Moreover, the total number of such fraud cases for all of 2024 was 130. However, the first seven months of 2025 have already far surpassed this, indicating a rapidly accelerating problem. This dramatic shift underscores the evolving tactics of criminals who are increasingly targeting the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, making it vital to understand the nature of these crypto voice phishing scams . How Do These Crypto Voice Phishing Scams Operate? Scammers employ various deceptive tactics to execute crypto voice phishing scams . Often, they impersonate government officials, law enforcement, or even representatives from reputable financial institutions. Their goal is to create a sense of urgency or fear, pressuring victims to act quickly without thinking. Common scenarios include: False Accusations: Victims receive calls claiming their accounts are linked to illegal activities, demanding crypto transfers to ‘secure’ their assets. Fake Investment Opportunities: Scammers promise unrealistic returns on crypto investments, convincing individuals to send funds to fraudulent platforms. Identity Theft: Posing as support staff, they request sensitive information or access to crypto wallets under the guise of resolving an issue. These elaborate schemes are designed to exploit trust and financial anxieties, making it difficult for unsuspecting individuals to differentiate legitimate calls from fraudulent ones. Protecting Yourself from Crypto Voice Phishing Scams: Essential Safeguards Vigilance is your strongest defense against crypto voice phishing scams . It is crucial to adopt proactive measures to safeguard your digital wealth. Always remember that legitimate institutions will never ask for your private keys or demand immediate transfers of your crypto assets over the phone. Here are key steps to protect yourself: Verify Identity: If you receive an unsolicited call, hang up and independently verify the caller’s identity using official contact information. Do not use numbers provided by the caller. Guard Private Keys: Your private keys are the access to your crypto. Never share them with anyone, under any circumstances. Be Skeptical of Urgency: Scammers thrive on creating panic. Any demand for immediate action or threats should be a major red flag. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implement 2FA on all your crypto exchanges and wallets for an added layer of security. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics. Knowledge is power when it comes to combating sophisticated fraud. If you suspect you’ve been targeted by crypto voice phishing scams , report the incident to the authorities immediately. Acting quickly can sometimes help in recovery efforts. The Broader Impact of Rising Crypto Scams in South Korea The escalating number of crypto voice phishing scams has far-reaching consequences beyond individual financial losses. It erodes public trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and can deter potential new investors. For victims, the emotional and psychological toll can be devastating, often leading to significant financial hardship. Furthermore, these incidents highlight the ongoing challenge for regulators and law enforcement to keep pace with evolving cybercrime. Governments worldwide, including South Korea, are working to implement stricter regulations and improve international cooperation to combat these sophisticated criminal networks. Industry players also bear responsibility in educating users and enhancing security features on their platforms. In conclusion, the alarming 6.6-fold surge in crypto voice phishing scams in South Korea serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset space. While the allure of cryptocurrencies grows, so does the sophistication of those seeking to exploit it. By staying informed, remaining skeptical, and adopting robust security practices, we can collectively work towards a safer crypto environment. Protect your assets, protect your future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a crypto voice phishing scam? A crypto voice phishing scam is a type of fraud where criminals use phone calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or directly transferring their cryptocurrency assets under false pretenses. 2. Why are scammers increasingly targeting crypto instead of cash? Cryptocurrency transactions can be harder to trace than traditional bank transfers, offering a degree of anonymity that appeals to scammers. The rapid growth and sometimes complex nature of crypto also make it easier to exploit less experienced users. 3. How can I verify if a call from a ‘bank’ or ‘authority’ is legitimate? Always hang up and call the institution back using an official phone number found on their website or statements. Never use a number provided by the caller. Legitimate organizations will never pressure you for immediate action or sensitive details over an unsolicited call. 4. What should I do if I fall victim to a crypto voice phishing scam? Immediately report the incident to your local law enforcement agency and any relevant cybersecurity or financial fraud departments. Also, notify your crypto exchange or wallet provider. Gather all available information about the scam, including phone numbers, transaction IDs, and communication logs. 5. Is South Korea taking action against these scams? Yes, data from the National Police Agency indicates active monitoring and reporting of these incidents.

According to the latest Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship digital asset has seen a notable Bitcoin price drop , falling below the crucial $111,000 mark. Currently, BTC is trading at approximately $110,953.37 on the Binance USDT market, sparking discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike. This unexpected dip raises important questions about market stability and future trajectories for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the factors behind any market movement is crucial, especially when it involves a prominent asset like Bitcoin. While a single cause is often elusive, several elements likely contribute to the current Bitcoin price drop . These can range from broad macroeconomic trends to specific technical indicators that influence trader sentiment. Market Sentiment: Negative news cycles, regulatory concerns, or even general risk-off sentiment in traditional markets can quickly impact crypto. Technical Resistance: Key resistance levels, once breached downwards, can accelerate selling pressure. Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors might decide to take profits, leading to a temporary decline. External Factors: Geopolitical events or unexpected shifts in global financial policies can also play a role. Market analysts are closely watching trading volumes and order books for further clues. Often, a combination of these elements creates a ripple effect across the ecosystem, influencing the overall market direction. How Does This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? A sudden Bitcoin price drop naturally brings questions and concerns for both seasoned traders and new entrants. For those holding BTC, seeing their portfolio value decrease can be unsettling. However, experienced investors often view such dips as potential opportunities, depending on their long-term strategy. Short-Term Traders: May experience increased volatility, creating opportunities for rapid gains or losses depending on their strategy and market timing. Long-Term Holders: Often remain unfazed, focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and long-term growth potential. Some might even see this as a chance to accumulate more at a lower price. New Investors: It is essential for new investors to approach the market with caution. Thorough research and understanding of market dynamics become paramount during volatile periods. Moreover, the current trading at $110,953.37 highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, making informed decision-making absolutely vital for everyone involved. Navigating the Volatility: What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Price? Predicting the exact future trajectory of Bitcoin’s price is challenging, given its inherent volatility. However, observing key indicators and market behavior can offer insights. After a significant Bitcoin price drop , market participants typically look for signs of stabilization or potential recovery. Support Levels: Analysts will identify crucial support levels where buying interest might emerge, potentially halting further declines. Trading Volume: An increase in buying volume following a dip could signal a potential rebound. Conversely, continued low volume with price drops suggests weak demand. News and Events: Upcoming economic data, regulatory announcements, or major industry news could significantly influence market direction. It is important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of global factors. Therefore, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective is always recommended, as market conditions can shift quickly. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $111,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic and often unpredictable nature. While such movements can be alarming, they are also a normal part of market cycles. Investors must prioritize robust risk management strategies and conduct their own due diligence. As the market continues to evolve, adaptability and a clear understanding of Bitcoin’s underlying value remain key to navigating its fascinating landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent Bitcoin price drop below $111,000? The specific cause is often multifaceted, but factors such as general market sentiment, macroeconomic trends, technical resistance levels, and profit-taking by investors likely contributed to the decline. 2. Is this a good time to buy BTC after the Bitcoin price drop? Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Some long-term investors view dips as accumulation opportunities, while others prefer to wait for signs of market stabilization. Always do your own research. 3. How does market sentiment affect Bitcoin’s price? Market sentiment, driven by news, social media, and investor confidence, plays a significant role. Positive sentiment can drive prices up, while negative sentiment, often fueled by fear or uncertainty, can lead to a Bitcoin price drop . 4. What should investors do during a BTC price decline? During a price decline, it’s crucial to avoid panic selling. Review your investment strategy, assess your risk tolerance, and consider if the fundamental reasons for your initial investment still hold true. Diversification and setting stop-loss orders can also be beneficial. 5. Will Bitcoin recover from this drop? Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience and recovered from numerous price drops. However, past performance does not guarantee future results. Recovery depends on various factors, including market demand, broader economic conditions, and investor confidence.

The move underlines how big tech is racing to keep up with global demand for computing power. The announcement was made on August 27, 2025, in a blog post and through official statements in Virginia. The investment will fund new construction and expansion of existing campuses. It will also fuel training and education programs for thousands of young people in the state. A centerpiece would be a new data center in Chesterfield County, next to the Meadowville Technology Park. This is Google’s first operation in central Virginia. According to company officials, building a data center of such size typically takes 18 to 24 months. But a precise date for when it will start operations has yet to be determined. Dominion Energy will power the site. The company will also grow its two Loudoun and Prince William counties campuses. Both are located in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” the most densely packed cluster of data centers on the planet. Loudoun, which is frequently referred to as “the wealthiest county in America,” has quickly become one of the epicenters of the cloud boom. With the expansion, Google is betting on a region vital to its global operations. Gov. Glenn Youngkin lauded the announcement as a significant shot in the arm for Virginia’s economy. He said the project would bring jobs and bolster the state’s role as a leader in digital innovation. Google expands infrastructure, invests in workforce Beyond the physical build-out, Google is trying to help grow Virginia’s talent pipeline . The company said it was launching a $1 billion program to offer Google’s AI Pro plan free to every college student in the state for a year. The students will also be trained in AI and cloud technologies. These programs will be offered in collaboration with the University of Virginia, Northern Virginia Community College, and Brightpoint Community College. The goal is to get students ready for jobs likely to develop from the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. The company emphasized working with local partners on energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives. It noted that Virginia’s rapid expansion of data centers had put pressure on the state’s power grid. Google stated it was fully committed to reaching its goal of being powered entirely by carbon-free energy around the clock at all its data centers and campuses worldwide. The company added that Northern Virginia had already achieved 95 percent clean energy use. Google fuels growth but raises energy and environmental questions Virginia is already the most concentrated cluster of data centers in the United States, and interest shows no sign of slowing. AI workloads are incredibly power- and water-intensive. A 2024 analysis forecasted that by 2030, Virginia will have to triple its energy production to meet the growth rate. Critics say such expansion may overburden resources and increase environmental risks. Data centers’ cooling systems use millions of gallons of water each year. Community groups in Chesterfield and Northern Virginia have expressed concern over how such projects impact local ecosystems. Yet Google says it is being responsible. The company has also promised to collaborate with local leaders to grow sustainably. It also signals new investments in energy programs and technologies with less environmental impact in the long run. Google’s move is indicative of a broader trend. Competing tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are investing tens of billions in data centers this year. Meta’s new rural Louisiana site is expected to cost $50 billion. The Delivery Trucks are backing large loans to finance data center projects around the U.S. and giants like JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ. Virginia has become a fixture in the global competition for AI leadership. With its infrastructure, tax credits, and proximity to Washington, D.C., the state has attracted investment interest. Virginia is well-positioned, industry analysts believe, to be at the center of a good deal of the next wave of AI growth on servers. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This upward movement sparks important conversations among investors and enthusiasts alike, hinting at potential shifts in market dynamics. For many, this rise suggests a growing appetite for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, opening new avenues for portfolio growth. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 46 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial metric that helps gauge the overall performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin. It signals an official altcoin season when a significant threshold is met: 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index suggests a stronger and more pronounced altcoin season. Currently sitting at 46, the index indicates that while we are not yet in a full-blown altcoin season, momentum is building. This reading shows that a notable portion of altcoins are indeed outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting a shift in investor focus and capital allocation. This gradual increase often precedes more significant movements, making it a key indicator for savvy traders. Is an Altcoin Season Truly Approaching? The one-point rise in the Altcoin Season Index to 46 is more than just a number; it’s a signal. While the 75% benchmark for an official altcoin season remains a distance away, this steady increase demonstrates growing confidence and interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. This recent shift in the Altcoin Season Index indicates increasing investor confidence in various altcoins, suggesting that many are seeing better returns than Bitcoin over the short term. What should you watch for as the index continues to evolve? Consistent Outperformance: Look for a sustained trend where a majority of top altcoins continue to surpass Bitcoin’s gains. Increased Trading Volume: Higher trading volumes in altcoin markets often accompany rising prices. New Project Excitement: Innovations and new projects in the altcoin space can attract fresh capital. Navigating Potential Altcoin Opportunities As the Altcoin Season Index inches higher, savvy investors are already looking at potential gains. However, navigating the altcoin market requires careful consideration and a strategic approach. It’s not simply about picking any altcoin; rather, it involves understanding market trends and individual project fundamentals. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, spread your investments across several promising altcoins. Do Your Research: Investigate the utility, team, and technology behind each altcoin. Strong fundamentals are key to long-term success. Risk Management: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technological developments, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. Important Considerations and Risks While the rising Altcoin Season Index is exciting, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains highly volatile. Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can experience dramatic price swings. This volatility presents both significant opportunities for profit and substantial risks of loss. Always conduct thorough due diligence and understand the unique risks associated with each investment. Market sentiment can change rapidly, influenced by global economic factors, regulatory news, and even social media trends. Therefore, a rising index does not guarantee continued upward movement, nor does it eliminate the potential for sudden corrections. A balanced approach, combining optimism with cautious risk assessment, is always recommended. Conclusion: The Evolving Crypto Landscape The climb in the Altcoin Season Index to 46 serves as a compelling indicator of shifting dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. While it doesn’t declare an immediate altcoin season, it certainly signals growing momentum and renewed interest in altcoins. This presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and managing risk effectively, you can better navigate this evolving landscape and potentially capitalize on the burgeoning altcoin market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score closer to 100 indicates a stronger altcoin season. What does a score of 46 mean for the Altcoin Season Index? A score of 46 means that 46% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. While not yet an official altcoin season (which requires 75%), it indicates growing momentum and a positive trend for altcoins. How is an Altcoin Season officially declared?

This signifies that 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have surpassed Bitcoin’s performance over a three-month period. What should investors do during a potential Altcoin Season? Investors should conduct thorough research on individual altcoins, consider diversifying their portfolios, manage risk with appropriate strategies, and stay updated on market trends and news.

Worldcoin (WLD) price action has stayed firm near the $0.90 level, a point that often sparks sharp moves when pressure builds. At the same time, Pi coin price holds around $0.35 after shaping chart setups that hint at a possible reversal if strong triggers appear. Yet, the spotlight now shines on BlockDAG (BDAG) . The project has already raised over $385 million, selling more than 25.5 billion coins at $0.03 in Batch 30. BlockDAG is moving far beyond presale buzz. Powered by DAG-based speed and real traction, it is being called the best crypto to buy now. Worldcoin (WLD) Price Action Holds $0.90 as Market Waits Worldcoin (WLD) price action continues to hold steady around the $0.90 level, showing strong resilience despite constant pressure. For several sessions, charts have displayed a tight range with resistance near $1.15, keeping rallies capped, while support around $0.90 has prevented deeper losses. This ongoing tug-of-war between buyers and sellers has left Worldcoin (WLD) price action stuck in sideways movement, but this type of pattern often signals that a bigger move is coming soon. The $1.00 mark has been a frequent pivot, acting as a magnet where price quickly returns after testing both higher and lower levels. Many traders use this zone for short-term entries, highlighting its importance. Momentum and volume remain the real deciding factors now. If either shifts sharply, Worldcoin (WLD) price action could set a clear new direction. A strong breakout above $1.15 or a drop under $0.90 will likely decide the next phase. Pi Coin Price Near $0.35 With Breakout Potential Pi coin price is trading in a quieter range, even as other assets in the crypto market show more volatility. After testing its yearly low, Pi coin price created a double-bottom around $0.3357, a classic chart signal that suggests strength may be building. Alongside this, a falling wedge has also appeared, which often points toward possible upside if momentum kicks in. Together, these patterns hint at breakout potential if the right catalysts show up. For Pi coin price to move higher, key triggers such as a tier-1 exchange listing or a supply reduction could play a major role. However, losing the $0.3357 support would cancel this view and open the door to weaker levels. At present, Pi coin price sits close to $0.3567, still far below the $3 peak reached earlier in the year. With low trading volume and a softer market cap, it looks like Pi coin price remains in accumulation mode while traders wait for the next clear spark. BlockDAG’s Growth Pushes Beyond Presale Buzz With $385M Raised BlockDAG has quickly taken center stage with its record-breaking rise and strong community traction. The project has already raised more than $385 million, selling over 25.5 billion coins at a price of $0.03 in Batch 30. These figures highlight how far BlockDAG has grown beyond basic presale talk, turning into one of the most active projects in the market. At its core, BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, a structure designed for speed and efficiency. Unlike older blockchains, DAG allows multiple chains to run at once. This design means faster confirmations, cheaper transactions, and far better scalability. Many see this approach as a game-changer, giving BlockDAG the tools to handle heavy use without delays or rising fees. Combined with its steady market traction, it is now seen as the best crypto to buy now. BlockDAG also focuses on creating a full working ecosystem. Beyond coin sales, it offers dashboards, mining tools, and ongoing updates to keep users engaged. Its miners are built to serve both beginners and experienced users, making the network more accessible. This practical mix of speed, usability, and hardware support is what makes BlockDAG stand out. With billions already raised and more batches still ahead, BlockDAG’s momentum continues to build. Missing out at this stage could mean watching one of the most talked-about launches of the year unfold from the sidelines. Patience, Progress, and the Clear Winner Ahead The overall picture highlights a balance of patience and steady progress. Worldcoin (WLD) price action remains caught in a narrow zone between $0.90 and $1.15, a range that often builds pressure for sudden moves in either direction. Pi coin price continues to circle around $0.35, carrying both risk and potential, with traders watching closely for the next sign of momentum that could spark a shift. Then comes BlockDAG, which has raised over $385 million with more than 25.5 billion coins sold, plus millions in miner sales. Its DAG-based system brings faster speeds and lower costs, setting it apart from older blockchain models. In a market filled with uncertainty, BlockDAG shows determination and energy, making it stand out as the best crypto to buy now .

Solana and Cardano are considered as competitors with bullish tendencies and developing ecosystems; however, the attention is currently moving towards MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts pointing to a massive 5000% upside, MAGA’s presale momentum and added bonus rewards are setting it apart as one of the best crypto presale stories right now. Solana Price Outlook Solana is coiling within a large rising triangle, a formation that is usually interpreted as a sign of strength before a breakout. Buyers have been supporting the $185 level since March, creating consistent higher bottoms that reflect an intense bullish activity. The big test is the $200 resistance level. A breakout higher would support rallies towards the $220 and $240 levels with Fibonacci projections eyeing $277 and $320. Analysts estimate that the average Solana price will be between $300 and $400 in 2025, with the most bullish forecasts that the asset price will rally to $1,000. Source: X Short-term prediction: Once it breaks the $200 level, analysts indicate that it will be able to go to its next higher target at between $220-$240. Holding above $185 keeps the bullish setup alive. Long-term projection: The longer-term outlook into late 2025 sees Solana tracking between $300 and $400, and in the top end having potential of hitting $1,000 or more should institutional demand ramp up on it. Why could Solana rally that high? It has emerged due to its low transaction costs and high throughput, as well as a rapidly expanding developer base. ETF speculation and robust adoption of DeFi and NFTs are other factors that have prompted institutions to circle Solana. With institutional inflows increasing and adoption continuing to expand, the growth in Solana to new loftier levels becomes all the more realistic. Cardano Update Cardano experienced a decline and fell beneath its trendline, testing around the support level of the currency near $0.8416. Should that break, price may see a touch of $0.8000 again, but a recovery higher than $0.8762 would put buyers back in control. Source: X Despite short-term weakness, Cardano’s long-term growth story remains intact. It utilizes Ouroboros, a Proof of Stake protocol that is much more energy efficient than Bitcoin mining. Its peer-reviewed research model ensures continuous innovation and trust. Furthermore, the layered architecture of the Cardano enables it to transact at a higher scan of 250 TPS and low transaction fees as compared to Ethereum. Short-term prediction: In the short-term, Cardano will remain in a range between $0.80 and $0.88. Once it breaks above $0.8762, it can rapidly move toward $0.92- $1.00. Long-term prediction: The average forecast for Cardano in 2025 was between $1.50-$2.50 with bullish predictions going as high as $5 as its adoption increases. These advantages answer why Cardano is appealing to developers, enterprises and environmentally friendly investors. All in combination with worldwide adoption tendencies in smart contracts and sustainable finance, Cardano has the basis to run towards greater prices in 2025 with an 8% projection in growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Presale Catching Fire Solana and Cardano are also predicted to rise but analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the present presale to keep an eye on. Backed by a completed audit that adds security and trust, MAGA is already drawing heavy demand. With forecasts pointing to a potential 5000% upside, early buyers are also unlocking a 50% EXTRA BONUS using code PATRIOT50X, fueling momentum ahead of the next bull run. Magacoin Finance has undergone rigorous security audits by reputable blockchain security firms HashEx and CertiK, both awarding it a perfect score of 100/100. These audits confirm that the smart contracts are secure, tamper-proof, and the deflationary tokenomics (including a 12% supply reduction planned for Q3 2025) are implemented as intended. Such verification erases much of the institutional intent of the meme-coins. Based on this background, MAGA is fast emerging to be one of the few presales that are both hyped and with solid structural support. Final Take Solana looks ready to explode in price once resistance is overcome, Cardano strength-building on sustainability and research, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking headlines with its audit backed presale. The combination of the technical arrangements, the development of an ecosystem, and trader interest explains why these three are under watchlists towards 2025. But the real headline is MAGA. With a completed audit, transparent tokenomics, and forecasts pointing to a 5000% upside , it’s hard to ignore the momentum. Providing the stable growth, Solana and Cardano might turn out as the game changer people strive to achieve configuring the next bull run.

Over the past week, ADA’s price has hovered between $0.82 and $0.87, reflecting cautious market sentiment. ADA's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Technical indicators remain split: the RSI sits at a neutral 52, leaving room for upward momentum, but the MACD shows bearish divergence, hinting at potential weakness. Analysts believe the next few trading sessions will determine whether ADA breaks higher or faces renewed selling pressure. Analysts Split on ADA Price Outlook Market experts are offering conflicting outlooks on ADA’s near-term trajectory. Some forecasts a short-term move toward $0.95, while others projects a more ambitious rally to $1.05–$1.10 by the end of August, provided volume increases. On the other hand, bearish predictions warn of a potential slide to $0.50 if Cardano fails to defend its key support levels. Institutional interest also remains a factor. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently postponed its decision on Grayscale’s Cardano ETF until October 26, adding regulatory uncertainty. Analysts argue that while an ETF approval could fuel institutional inflows, delays may weigh on investor confidence in the short term. Could a September Rate Cut Ignite a Cardano Rally Toward $3? Macroeconomic catalysts could play a decisive role in ADA’s next move. Speculation is mounting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Historically, rate cuts have provided a boost to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Market reports suggest a potential Fed rate cut could help ADA reclaim the $1 mark and even fuel a rally toward $3, echoing its explosive 2020 run. With Cardano already up 4% in August, a favorable macro shift may accelerate bullish momentum.

Buyers are carefully watching the best cryptos to buy, looking for strong growth and long-term value. Stellar (XLM), Chainlink (LINK), TRON (TRX), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are now at the center of attention thanks to upgrades, adoption, and consistent demand. Each of these coins brings different strengths that help them stand out. Success now depends on real use cases, secure systems, and ongoing improvements. These top performing crypto choices are not only seen as good for short-term returns but also as reliable for the years ahead. BlockDAG: A Better Answer to Slow Blockchain Systems BlockDAG (BDAG) is changing how crypto networks operate. It blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) design with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, creating a system that runs faster and handles more transactions than older blockchains. Traditional systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum often slow down when demand rises. BlockDAG (BDAG) fixes this problem by allowing multiple blocks to be processed at the same time. This means more speed, higher capacity, and stronger security. The presale results prove how much confidence people have in this project. So far, BlockDAG has raised more than $385 million in Batch 30. Over 25.5 billion coins have been sold, showing the strong demand in the market. Its price has grown from just $0.001 to $0.03, a 2,900% surge before even reaching full launch. Many experts suggest that BlockDAG could touch $1 soon, thanks to its clear purpose and strong growth. With its proven design, large-scale presale success, and solutions to long-standing blockchain issues, BlockDAG is making its place as a top performing crypto. This makes it one of the best cryptos to buy right now for anyone following the market closely. Stellar (XLM): Focused on Global Payments In recent days, Stellar (XLM) has dropped by 7%, moving from $0.42 down to $0.39. The decline is mainly linked to wider market shifts and heavier selling pressure. Even with this dip, XLM continues to show strength because of its role in cross-border transfers and asset tokenization. The Stellar Development Foundation has expanded through new partnerships with Archax and Franklin Templeton. These deals highlight its rising presence in regulated markets. While the price may face ups and downs in the short term, the long-term value of XLM stays strong. At $0.39, it holds its ground as one of the best cryptos to buy for those focused on financial solutions powered by blockchain. Chainlink (LINK): Powering Smart Contracts at $25.18 Chainlink (LINK) remains a top crypto and is currently priced at $25.18. Over the past week, LINK has seen gains as more projects use its services. Its strength lies in offering secure data feeds for smart contracts, which are essential in decentralized finance (DeFi) and many other areas. Short-term estimates put LINK between $26 and $30, with further growth expected. As more platforms adopt its technology, LINK continues to strengthen its position in blockchain systems. This strong adoption makes it one of the best cryptos to buy for 2025, as demand for smart contract solutions only increases. TRON (TRX): Leading Stablecoin Transactions TRON (TRX) has shown stability, staying above the 50-day moving average even with a slight fall recently. The steady price trend shows its resilience. TRX’s ongoing upgrades and active developer work help it keep a solid position in the market. The coin’s dominance in stablecoin transfers makes it a strong choice. Its partnerships with Kraken and MetaMask add further support, increasing its reach and appeal. High transaction volumes and strong adoption show why TRX is one of the best cryptos to buy. With consistent growth and proven ability to process large-scale activity, TRON remains a crypto worth following. Why BlockDAG Leads the Pack As 2025 comes to an end, XLM, LINK, TRX, and BlockDAG all show why they belong to the list of best cryptos to buy. Stellar continues to lead in cross-border payments, Chainlink drives secure smart contracts, and TRON dominates stablecoin transfers. But BlockDAG clearly stands out. Its mix of DAG and PoW provides speed, scalability, and safety that older systems struggle to match. With $385 million raised, 25.5 billion coins sold, and a 2,900% rise in price, BlockDAG is shaping up as a top performing crypto . For many, it is the best crypto to buy now and could reach new heights in 2025. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

50790864,567020,1756342850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50790864.jpeg,CFTC Steps Up Crypto Oversight By Implementing Nasdaq’s Surveillance Technology,https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-steps-up-crypto-oversight-nasdaq-surveillance/,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is taking a significant step to enhance its oversight of the expanding crypto market by adopting Nasdaq’s advanced surveillance program. CFTC To Stay Ahead Of Crypto Regulation To bolster its regulatory capabilities, the regulator announced on Wednesday that it has chosen Nasdaq to supply market surveillance and fraud detection technology. Nasdaq’s Market Surveillance system is designed to cover multiple asset classes and is instrumental in identifying potential market manipulation. By leveraging comprehensive order book data, this technology enables regulators to conduct real-time analysis, facilitating swift decision-making and robust oversight. As the CFTC continues to oversee crypto assets, the US government’s increasing focus on the digital asset landscape, especially in terms of creating a more accommodative regulatory environment, has expanded the agency’s responsibilities. The market structures are also changing, with many exchanges adopting 24-hour trading. Given these developments, the CFTC recognizes the need for more sophisticated tools to detect and prevent market abuse effectively. Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Caroline Pham emphasized the importance of staying ahead in regulatory practices, stating: It’s critical that the CFTC stays ahead of the curve. Nasdaq Market Surveillance will provide the CFTC with automated alerts and cross-market analytics that will benefit each of the CFTC’s operating divisions. Pham highlighted that this partnership will enhance the agency’s ability to protect markets such as crypto, from fraud and manipulation while improving efficiency in analyzing market trends and unusual trading activities. Collaboration With SEC Tal Cohen, Nasdaq’s president, noted the company’s unique position at the intersection of innovation and regulation, expressing pride in partnering with the CFTC to promote the integrity and resilience of US derivatives markets . This announcement coincides with the CFTC’s launch of the next phase of its “Crypto Sprint” initiative, aimed at evaluating and implementing recommendations from the White House regarding digital asset regulation. As reported by Bitcoinist last week, Pham has also called for public feedback on these recommendations, reinforcing the agency’s commitment to transparency and stakeholder engagement. In alignment with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) “Project Crypto,” the CFTC is also working closely with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce to provide regulatory clarity and foster innovation within the digital assets market. Pham expressed gratitude for the supportive feedback from stakeholders regarding the CFTC’s initiative on listed spot crypto trading, emphasizing that this collaborative effort responds to President Trump’s call for American leadership in crypto.

This pivotal decision, maintaining rates for the tenth consecutive meeting, sends a clear signal about South Korea’s current economic outlook and its strategic approach to monetary policy. For investors, especially those in the dynamic cryptocurrency space, understanding the nuances of this stability is crucial. Why Did the Bank of Korea Keep Interest Rate Steady? The decision by the Bank of Korea to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 2.50% reflects a cautious yet strategic approach. This move comes amid persistent inflation concerns, albeit with signs of moderation, and a desire to support economic growth without overheating the market. Policymakers are carefully balancing the need to tame price increases with fostering a stable environment for businesses and consumers. The BOK also considers global economic trends, including interest rate movements by major central banks. Inflation Management: While inflation has eased, it remains above the central bank’s target. Holding rates allows the BOK to continue monitoring inflationary pressures. Economic Stability: The BOK aims to provide a predictable economic landscape, reducing uncertainty for both domestic and international investors. Global Economic Headwinds: Global economic slowdowns and geopolitical tensions continue to pose risks, prompting a conservative stance on monetary policy. What Does This Bank of Korea Interest Rate Decision Mean for the Economy? Maintaining the Bank of Korea interest rate at its current level has several immediate and long-term implications for the South Korean economy. For consumers, borrowing costs for mortgages and loans are likely to remain stable, offering some predictability in household finances. This can encourage consumption and investment at a steady pace. Businesses, too, can plan their expansion and operational budgets with a clearer understanding of financing expenses, potentially boosting corporate investment and job creation. Stable Borrowing Costs: Consumers and businesses benefit from unchanged loan rates, which can encourage steady spending and strategic investment. Currency Impact: A steady interest rate might influence the Korean Won’s strength relative to other major currencies, impacting trade balances and import costs. Growth Outlook: The central bank hopes this stability will foster sustainable economic growth, preventing sharp downturns or excessive exuberance. Investment Climate: A consistent Bank of Korea interest rate policy signals predictability, potentially attracting more long-term capital. How Does the Bank of Korea Interest Rate Impact Crypto Markets? While seemingly distant, the Bank of Korea interest rate decision can indirectly ripple through the cryptocurrency markets. When traditional investments like government bonds and savings accounts offer stable, albeit lower, returns due to consistent interest rates, some investors might seek higher yields or alternative assets. Cryptocurrencies, known for their volatility and potential for significant returns, often attract capital when traditional markets offer less compelling opportunities or when liquidity is abundant. Furthermore, the broader economic sentiment fostered by the central bank’s policy can influence investor confidence. A stable domestic economy might free up discretionary income for investment, some of which could flow into digital assets. Conversely, if the economy were to face significant challenges, risk aversion would likely increase, potentially leading to outflows from more volatile assets like crypto. Risk Appetite: A stable economic environment can sometimes encourage greater risk appetite among investors, leading them to allocate more capital to speculative assets like crypto. Liquidity Flows: If the local economy remains robust and capital is readily available, domestic funds might seek diversification, potentially flowing into digital assets. Global Sentiment: South Korea is a significant player in the global crypto landscape. Its monetary policy can influence regional sentiment, which then impacts global crypto trends. Opportunity Cost: When traditional returns are stable but modest, the perceived opportunity cost of holding cash or low-yield assets increases, making higher-risk, higher-reward assets more appealing. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For those invested in or considering cryptocurrencies, the steady Bank of Korea interest rate serves as a crucial backdrop for strategic decision-making. It underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio and a clear understanding of market dynamics. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Global Trends: While local policy is stable, global interest rate movements, inflation data, and geopolitical shifts still heavily influence crypto markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Balance crypto holdings with other asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both macroeconomic indicators and specific crypto project developments and regulatory news. Understand Risk: Cryptocurrencies remain inherently volatile. Invest only what you can comfortably afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Consider a long-term investment strategy for crypto, focusing on projects with strong fundamentals. The Bank of Korea’s decision to hold its benchmark interest rate at 2.50% is a testament to its commitment to economic stability amidst a complex global environment. This consistent monetary policy provides a predictable foundation for the domestic economy, influencing everything from borrowing costs to investment sentiment. For crypto enthusiasts, this stability might subtly encourage a continued search for growth opportunities in alternative assets, highlighting the intricate dance between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset landscape. It’s a powerful reminder that even seemingly local central bank decisions have far-reaching implications, extending into the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the current Bank of Korea interest rate? The Bank of Korea has held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.50% for the tenth consecutive meeting. Q2: Why did the Bank of Korea hold rates steady? The decision reflects a balance between managing persistent inflation, supporting economic growth, and considering global economic trends to maintain stability. Q3: How does this decision affect South Korean consumers? For consumers, stable interest rates mean predictable borrowing costs for mortgages and loans, which can encourage steady consumption and investment. Q4: What are the indirect impacts of the Bank of Korea interest rate on cryptocurrency markets? A stable economic environment, driven by the consistent Bank of Korea interest rate, can influence investor risk appetite and liquidity flows, potentially encouraging some capital to seek higher yields in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Q5: Is this a positive or negative development for crypto investors? It’s generally seen as a neutral-to-subtly-positive development. Stable traditional returns might lead some investors to explore higher-yield opportunities in crypto, but direct positive correlation is not guaranteed.

Recently, a significant voice from China’s financial establishment has raised eyebrows, sparking a crucial debate. Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has voiced strong opposition to stablecoins, citing deep concerns about stablecoin financial stability . His comments ignite a critical conversation about the future of digital currencies and their potential impact on global economies. Why Are Stablecoins a Threat to Financial Stability? Zhou Xiaochuan’s primary concern revolves around the potential for stablecoins to introduce significant financial stability risks . He argues that these digital assets, despite their name, could actually encourage speculative behavior rather than provide a steady anchor in the volatile crypto market. Such speculation, he suggests, might destabilize broader financial systems. Furthermore, the former governor believes stablecoins could undermine existing, robust payment infrastructures, particularly in countries like China that already boast highly efficient digital payment networks. His arguments highlight several key points: Increased Speculation: Stablecoins, while pegged to traditional assets, can still become tools for speculative trading, especially when linked to less regulated decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Systemic Risk: A large-scale adoption of stablecoins, particularly those not backed by transparent reserves or strong regulatory oversight, could introduce new forms of systemic risk to the financial sector. Undermining Existing Systems: Established national payment systems, built over decades for security and efficiency, could face competition or disruption from unregulated stablecoin alternatives. Are Stablecoin Cost Advantages Overstated? A common argument for stablecoins is their promise of lower transaction costs and greater efficiency compared to traditional banking. However, Zhou Xiaochuan challenges this narrative. He asserts that claims of significant cost advantages over China’s existing payment systems are greatly exaggerated. China already utilizes advanced digital payment methods, like WeChat Pay and Alipay, which offer extremely low costs and high speed. This perspective suggests that for nations with mature digital payment infrastructures, the perceived benefits of stablecoins might not be as revolutionary as proponents claim. Consequently, the potential downsides, such as regulatory challenges and risks to stablecoin financial stability , could outweigh any marginal gains. For more insights into global payment innovations, you can explore our fintech articles . Navigating the Future: Stablecoin Financial Stability and Regulatory Concerns The former PBOC governor’s remarks come at a pivotal time. While he expresses caution, some experts and business leaders within China have recently advocated for the introduction of a yuan-backed stablecoin. This creates an interesting tension: the desire for innovation versus the imperative for financial security. The global financial community is closely watching how major economies, especially China, approach digital assets. The debate around stablecoin financial stability is not just theoretical; it has real-world implications for how money moves, how economies function, and how individuals conduct transactions. Regulators worldwide are grappling with similar questions, striving to balance technological advancement with consumer protection and systemic resilience. Key Considerations for Regulators: Establishing clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoin issuance and operation. Ensuring robust reserve requirements and transparency for stablecoin backing. Mitigating risks of illicit finance and market manipulation. Protecting consumers from potential losses or market volatility. A Crucial Dialogue for the Digital Age Zhou Xiaochuan’s cautionary stance on stablecoins serves as a vital reminder that while digital currencies offer exciting possibilities, they also introduce complex challenges. His experience at the helm of a major central bank lends significant weight to his concerns regarding stablecoin financial stability . The ongoing debate highlights the crucial importance of a balanced approach, one that encourages innovation while rigorously safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial systems. Ultimately, the discussion around stablecoins is far from over. It requires careful consideration from policymakers, innovators, and the public alike to forge a path that harnesses the benefits of digital assets without compromising the foundational principles of financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or even another cryptocurrency. Q2: Why is the former PBOC governor concerned about stablecoins? Zhou Xiaochuan is concerned that stablecoins could encourage speculation, undermine existing robust payment systems, and pose significant risks to overall financial stability due to their potential for unregulated growth and lack of transparency. Q3: Do stablecoins offer real cost advantages? While stablecoins are often promoted for their low transaction costs, Zhou Xiaochuan argues that for countries with highly efficient existing digital payment systems, like China, these cost advantages are often exaggerated and do not justify the associated risks. Q4: Are there calls for a yuan-backed stablecoin? Yes, despite the former PBOC governor’s opposition, some experts and business leaders in China have expressed interest in introducing a stablecoin backed by the Chinese yuan, aiming to explore its potential benefits. Q5: How do central banks typically view stablecoins? Central banks generally approach stablecoins with caution, focusing on potential risks to monetary policy, financial stability, and consumer protection. Many are actively researching or developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as an alternative. If you found this discussion insightful, consider sharing it with your network! The conversation around stablecoins and their impact on financial systems is vital for everyone in the crypto space and beyond. Spread the word!

The platform executed a significant PUMP token buyback last week, demonstrating a strong commitment to its ecosystem and token holders. This move has certainly captured the attention of many, signaling potential positive implications for the future of the PUMP token. What’s Driving the Massive PUMP Token Buyback? Pump.fun confirmed a substantial repurchase of its native token, PUMP, totaling an astonishing $10.66 million over the past week. This figure is not just large; it represents nearly all of the platform’s earnings for that period. Specifically, 99.32% of Pump.fun’s total revenue went directly into this recent PUMP token buyback . This commitment is a clear signal of confidence. Furthermore, this isn’t an isolated event. To date, Pump.fun has cumulatively repurchased a staggering $58.13 million worth of PUMP tokens. This total buyback amounts to approximately 4.3% of the token’s entire circulating supply. Such consistent action shows a strategic approach to managing tokenomics and enhancing value. Why Does a PUMP Token Buyback Matter for Holders? A consistent PUMP token buyback program offers several compelling benefits for existing token holders and the broader ecosystem. Here’s why these actions are crucial: Increased Scarcity: By removing tokens from circulation, the total supply decreases. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially driving up the value of remaining tokens if demand stays constant or grows. Price Support: Buybacks often act as a form of price support, especially during market downturns. The platform actively buying its own token can cushion price drops and demonstrate underlying strength. Demonstrates Commitment: When a platform dedicates such a large portion of its revenue to a token buyback, it signals strong belief in its own project. This builds trust and confidence among investors and the community. Aligns Incentives: A robust buyback program aligns the interests of the platform with those of its token holders. Both benefit from a healthier, more valuable token. Therefore, the recent PUMP token buyback is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic move designed to bolster the token’s long-term health and value. Pump.fun’s Strategy: A Closer Look at the PUMP Token Buyback Mechanism Pump.fun’s decision to allocate nearly all of its weekly revenue to the PUMP token buyback is a bold and transparent strategy. The platform’s model involves fees generated from token creation and trading activities. By committing a significant portion of these earnings to buybacks, Pump.fun essentially shares its success directly with its token holders. This mechanism is distinct from traditional stock buybacks in some ways, yet the core principle remains: reduce supply to potentially increase value. For a decentralized platform, such transparency in revenue allocation and buyback execution is vital. It allows the community to track the platform’s financial health and its direct impact on the PUMP token’s economics. Navigating the Future: Potential Impact of Consistent PUMP Token Buybacks What could these consistent PUMP token buyback efforts mean for the future of Pump.fun and its native token? The immediate impact is often a positive shift in market sentiment. Investors tend to view buybacks as a bullish signal, indicating that the project believes its token is undervalued or that it has excess capital to invest in its own ecosystem. However, it is important to consider potential challenges. Market volatility remains a constant factor in cryptocurrency. While buybacks can offer support, they do not entirely insulate a token from broader market trends. Sustainability is also key; the platform must maintain consistent revenue generation to continue such aggressive buyback programs. Ultimately, a sustained and well-managed PUMP token buyback program could significantly contribute to the token’s stability and growth. It encourages long-term holding and fosters a loyal community, crucial elements for any successful crypto project. Conclusion: A Powerful Signal for the PUMP Ecosystem Pump.fun’s recent $10.7 million PUMP token buyback , representing nearly all of its weekly revenue, sends a powerful message to the crypto community. This strategic move, coupled with the cumulative $58.13 million repurchased to date, underscores the platform’s commitment to enhancing the value and scarcity of its native token. For token holders, this consistent action offers compelling benefits, from potential price appreciation to increased trust in the project’s long-term vision. As Pump.fun continues to execute this impressive strategy, the PUMP token ecosystem appears poised for exciting developments ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a PUMP token buyback? A1: A PUMP token buyback occurs when Pump.fun uses its revenue to purchase its own native PUMP tokens from the open market. This reduces the circulating supply of the token. Q2: How much PUMP did Pump.fun buy back last week? A2: Pump.fun announced a significant PUMP token buyback of $10.66 million worth of PUMP tokens last week. Q3: What is the total amount of PUMP tokens repurchased by Pump.fun to date? A3: To date, Pump.fun has repurchased a total of $58.13 million in PUMP tokens, which is equivalent to 4.3% of the token’s circulating supply. Q4: Why are token buybacks considered beneficial for token holders? A4: Token buybacks can increase scarcity, provide price support, demonstrate the platform’s commitment, and align the interests of the platform with its token holders, potentially leading to increased token value. Q5: Does the PUMP token buyback guarantee a price increase? A5: While a PUMP token buyback can create positive market sentiment and reduce supply, it does not guarantee a price increase. Market dynamics, broader crypto trends, and platform performance also play significant roles.

Despite these challenges, some analysts remain optimistic and suggest that in case SHIB finds support over $0.00001211 and surges above the resistance zone, it can aim for a breakout to the $0.000020 level.

The chipmaker’s meteoric rise has made it the most traded name in the leveraged ETF market, drawing billions of dollars from traders hoping to capitalize on outsized gains. As its earnings beat Wall Street expectations , Nvidia is at the center of Wall Street’s latest fixation — high-risk funds that track the daily swings of stocks linked to artificial intelligence. The surge signifies the hunger to be exposed to companies powering the AI revolution. The leveraged ETFs linked to individual stocks rely on swaps or options to deliver double or even triple the usual daily share movement. For Nvidia, for whose iconic stock this has already been a record-surge year, that has made for an appealing but perilous speculator’s playground. In the first five months of 2025, over 100 new single-stock leveraged and inverse ETFs have debuted in the U.S., most directly or indirectly tied to AI. These products now dominate a lion’s share of assets in the space, which says a lot about how much Nvidia and other AI leaders like Tesla and Palantir vie for investor attention. Investors are flooding into AI-themed ETFs The numbers tell the story. Through merely eight months of 2025, asset managers have introduced 112 new leveraged and inverse ETFs linked to individual stocks. That’s nearly triple the 38 that launched in all of 2024. All told, there are now 190 single-stock leveraged and inverse ETFs listed in the U.S. Over half are associated with companies trying to capitalize on the AI wave. Combined, these funds with AI exposure hold $17.7 billion of the $23.7 billion deployed in the leveraged ETF universe. One of the stars in that crowd is the GraniteShares 2× Long NVDA Daily ETF. It has $4.56 billion in assets gathered in the 14 months since it opened in December 2022. Some other big names driving the creation of ETFs are Tesla, Palantir, and NuScale Power, companies directly or indirectly linked to AI. An ETF analyst at Morningstar, Bryan Armor, said the ETFs allow traders to increase their daily bets, adding that the potential upside is enormous but the risks are equally high. Nvidia earnings set tone for big market shake-up These speculative products get tested every earnings season, but the one from Nvidia’s report may be the check to checkmate. Following the results, options traders are positioning for a $260 billion market-value swing. That is about a 6% move in either direction. Leveraged ETFs, those moves can magnify gains or magnify pain. The risks are not theoretical. Nvidia shares dropped 17% earlier this year on fears of new competition from a Chinese chip rival. That day, the GraniteShares 2× Nvidia ETF lost almost 34%. But the upside can also be explosive. Last week, surprise earner MongoDB also pointed to AI demand. Its stock rose more than 23% in after-hours trading. The brand-new Tradr 2× Long MDB Daily ETF climbed 46% overnight. ETF issuers are raking it in. Leveraged ETFs average fees of 0.96%, almost double the industry average of 0.54%. But investors are still plowing money into the platform, eager for exposure to AI names. Matt Markiewicz, head of product and capital markets at Tradr ETFs, said demand for such products continues to climb. He noted that his firm had recently launched a leveraged ETF tied to Constellation Energy, on the expectation that power producers would benefit as AI data centers consume more electricity. He added that there is currently a strong thirst among investors for companies that stand to profit from the AI boom.

Nasdaq-listed digital healthcare innovator, CIMG, has announced a groundbreaking CIMG Bitcoin acquisition , signaling a significant pivot for the company and sending ripples across both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. This strategic move sees CIMG exchanging a substantial $55 million worth of its common stock for 500 Bitcoin (BTC), a decision that highlights the growing confidence of established firms in digital assets. What Does This CIMG Bitcoin Acquisition Entail? CIMG, a prominent player in the digital healthcare sector listed on Nasdaq, has formally entered into a purchase agreement with a group of nine investors. Under this agreement, the company will issue $55 million worth of its common stock. In return, these investors will provide CIMG with 500 units of Bitcoin. This substantial exchange is not just a simple trade; it’s a strategic shift for CIMG, aiming to diversify its treasury assets and potentially hedge against inflation. The transaction is currently on track to finalize in early September, pending customary closing conditions. For many, this CIMG Bitcoin acquisition marks a clear statement: digital assets are no longer a niche interest but a legitimate component of corporate financial strategy, even for companies outside the direct tech or finance sectors. Why Are Companies Like CIMG Embracing Bitcoin Now? The decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity like CIMG to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. Several factors drive this shift: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value and a hedge against the depreciating purchasing power of fiat currencies, especially in the current economic climate. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury holdings beyond traditional assets, potentially offering new avenues for growth and risk management. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers who are increasingly familiar with cryptocurrency. This strategic CIMG Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the evolving global financial landscape. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Move? For CIMG, the benefits could be substantial. A successful Bitcoin holding could appreciate in value, enhancing the company’s balance sheet. It also sends a strong signal to the market about CIMG’s willingness to innovate and adapt. However, this bold step is not without its challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price fluctuations, which could introduce volatility to CIMG’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential compliance challenges. Market Perception: While many will view this positively, some traditional investors might be wary of the perceived risks associated with digital assets. Despite these challenges, CIMG’s leadership appears confident in the long-term strategic value of this CIMG Bitcoin acquisition . How Does This CIMG Bitcoin Acquisition Impact the Broader Market? A move of this magnitude from a Nasdaq-listed digital healthcare company is a powerful endorsement for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class and gaining mainstream acceptance. Other companies, observing CIMG’s bold stride, might feel encouraged to explore similar strategies. This institutional interest can contribute to increased liquidity and stability in the Bitcoin market over time. Moreover, it blurs the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, suggesting a future where such cross-asset exchanges become more common. This transaction could very well serve as a case study for other firms contemplating their own ventures into the crypto space.

50791920,566900,1756346423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50791920.jpeg,Iran’s Crypto Sector Suffers 11% Decline Following $90-M Exchange Hack,https://bitcoinist.com/irans-crypto-sector-suffers-11-decline-following-90-m-exchange-hack/,"According to reports, Iran’s on-chain crypto activity fell sharply in the first half of 2025. Inflows totaled $3.7 billion in the first seven months, a 10% drop from the same period in 2024. The slump accelerated after April: June flows contracted 50% year-on-year and July tumbled 75%. Major Exchange Breach Shakes Trust Based on a TRM Labs report , a major security breach hit Nobitex on June 18. Roughly $90 million was taken from hot wallets, source code was leaked, and some stolen coins were steered to vanity addresses that referenced the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Outflows from the exchange spiked — more than 150% in the week before the fighting — as traders moved funds to what they saw as safer places. Trust, already fragile, was seriously damaged. Inbound Transactions Collapse As Users Withdraw Nobitex’s inbound transfers dropped by about 70% year-on-year after the breach. Some dormant Bitcoin wallets tied to mining activity were activated and later routed funds into a newly created hot wallet. Regulators responded by imposing overnight trading curbs designed to slow panic, but many users had already pulled funds offshore. Reports show a surge in transfers to foreign platforms and payment processors that have lighter identity checks. Stablecoin Freezes Strain Liquidity In July, Tether froze 42 wallets linked to Iran, removing a large chunk of usable stablecoin liquidity on local rails. More than half of those wallets had ties, on-chain, to Nobitex or addresses flagged with IRGC links, though ownership remains unclear. Tether also froze $27 million in USDT tied to Garantex , a sanctioned Russian exchange, an action that highlights the broad reach of compliance moves. The US Treasury blacklisted Garantex in 2022, and that prior action has had echoing effects on market behavior. Power Cuts And Conflict Worsen Market Stress The decline in flows came during a period of heightened regional tension. A 12-day conflict with Israel erupted in mid-June while nuclear talks stalled. Israeli strikes and internal disruptions led to widespread electricity outages. Mining rigs were idled. Trading became harder. For many traders, the safest option was to move funds off domestic rails; for others it was to switch stablecoins or chains. New Taxes Tighten The Grip In August, Iran approved the Law on Taxation of Speculation and Profiteering. The law brings capital gains taxes to crypto, gold, real estate, and forex. Enforcement will roll out in stages, but officials say oversight will increase. That policy move, combined with freezes and hacks, gives firms more reason to pause or shift operations.

Presales are back in the spotlight, and analysts are pointing to a select few projects as the top crypto presales worth watching. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a breakout star, with its presale raising more than $13 million . Often compared to the early stages of legendary projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention as one of the best crypto presale opportunities of the year. Alongside it, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has crossed $11.2 million in presale funding with its ambitious Bitcoin layer-two solution, while TOKEN6900 (T6900) is making waves as a viral meme coin raising over $2.3 million . Together, these three projects are dominating discussions around the top crypto presales to watch this quarter. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: A Standout Performer Smart investors are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the top crypto presales in Q4 2025 , thanks to its rapid fundraising momentum and strong grassroots appeal. Early-stage investors have already committed over $13 million , demonstrating confidence in the project’s ability to replicate the early success of past meme coin giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly built a reputation as a safe and reliable project. It recently passed an independent smart contract audit by HashEx, giving investors added confidence that the code is secure and free from major risks. Beyond the audit, the team has been open about its plans, sharing a clear roadmap that outlines every stage of development. This level of transparency, combined with strong community backing, makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as a trustworthy presale in today’s market. Analysts also note that whale wallets have started accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens quietly — a signal often seen before explosive breakouts. With retail hype growing and presale allocations filling fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now widely ranked as a best crypto presale to watch this quarter. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A DeFi-Ready Layer 2 for Bitcoin Another project grabbing attention among the top crypto presales is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , which has already raised over $11.2 million in its presale. Unlike traditional meme coins, Bitcoin Hyper is building a layer-two (L2) scaling solution for Bitcoin , designed to fix slow speeds and high fees. Key highlights for HYPER include: Integration with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM): Brings high throughput and scalability to Bitcoin. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Bundles transactions and settles them securely on Bitcoin’s base layer. Utility Features: Staking, governance, and dApp deployment are all planned. High APY Potential: Token holders can earn up to 98% APY from staking rewards. With Bitcoin continuing its long-term upward trajectory, HYPER offers a unique value proposition as both a utility token and an investment play. Many analysts believe this makes Bitcoin Hyper one of the best crypto presale opportunities for long-term growth. TOKEN6900 (T6900): Meme Coin Madness with Marketing Power If you’re looking for pure meme-driven energy, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is quickly earning a reputation as one of the top crypto presales this year. Branding itself as the “New Global Benchmark for Brain Rot Finance,” T6900 has already raised $2.3 million in its presale. What sets TOKEN6900 apart is its unapologetic focus on marketing: 40% of Presale Funds for Marketing: Ensuring high visibility and viral campaigns. Inspired by SPX6900: A meme token that delivered nearly 100,000% returns. Total Supply Joke: Set at 930,993,091 — exactly one token more than SPX’s supply. Staking Rewards: Token holders can earn up to 33% APY , with 139 million tokens already staked. Analysts believe T6900 could easily be 10x due to its community-driven hype and aggressive marketing tactics. While speculative, its potential makes it a best crypto presale for high-risk, high-reward investors. Final Thoughts: Best Crypto Presales in Q4 2025 The fourth quarter of 2025 is definitely filled with opportunities that exceed expectations, but there are three projects that are distinctly rising above the rest to become the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE — A viral meme coin presale already past $13M. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) — A DeFi-ready Bitcoin L2 solution with $11.2M raised. TOKEN6900 (T6900) — A chaotic, meme-fueled project with bold marketing power. For investors seeking the best crypto presale opportunities this quarter, these three projects offer very different strengths — from meme-fueled hype to groundbreaking utility. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge past $13M, the retail buzz is undeniable.

Coinbase Listing Claims Surface According to posts on X, a 2021 Pi Network Hackathon winner called Pi Barter Mall suggested a Coinbase listing could be in the offing. The comment touched off fresh debate among users who have been watching for the Pi coin to reach major global exchanges. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, posted a Pi Day image back in March that showed purple pies with the Pi logo. It was not a formal announcement. But it did rekindle rumors and talk across social channels.

Access to PiOS has been used to run new hackathons. One such event aims to get apps working with Pi in everyday transactions. Community moderators have suggested the open-source move could arrive before the end of the year, though the Pi Core Team has not confirmed specific dates. Questions that have long lingered about code transparency are expected to be addressed once more of the code is public. Binance And Swapfone Developments Screenshots have circulated showing Binance Connect and Binance P2P support options appearing inside the Pi Wallet’s Help & Support menu. That detail prompted discussion about a potential Binance integration, but users also pointed to hurdles that have slowed any listing. A lack of clear utility and concerns over decentralization were cited as reasons for delays. Meanwhile, practical steps have been taken elsewhere: Pi Coin secured a listing on Swapfone, a US-regulated, mobile-focused exchange, which launched a PI/USDS trading pair in July. Small Steps Toward Broader Exposure The Swapfone listing was described by some community members as Pi’s first meaningful move into the US trading scene. It is small in scale when compared with top global exchanges, but it is a footprint on American rails.

50792385,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=793703,1756346604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50792385.jpeg,Circle taps Mastercard and Finastra to push USDC into global payments,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/circle-taps-mastercard-and-finastra/,"Circle, the company behind USD Coin (USDC), is pushing to make stablecoins a mainstream tool in traditional banking. The firm is announcing new partnerships with Mastercard and Finastra to integrate USDC into payment flows for merchants and banks worldwide. These partnerships represent one of the most aggressive efforts yet to expand the use of stablecoins in everyday financial services . They arrive when regulators and banks are increasingly interested in how digital currencies can speed up settlement and reduce costs. Mastercard announced that acquirers and merchants in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) will now be able to settle transactions in USDC and Euro Coin (EURC). It is the first time that settlement with stablecoins will be available on Mastercard’s regional network. Arab Financial Services and Eazy Financial Services will initially launch the service. For merchants, this means payment can be cleared and settled faster and more efficiently than with conventional systems, many of which rely on intermediaries and protracted clearing cycles. The service will help companies reduce friction and smooth liquidity, Mastercard said. Stablecoins can drive down the time and cost —and frankly make it easier — for international settlements and merchants to receive money in an environment where they never go to their correspondent bank. Mastercard demonstrates confidence in digital assets as an adjunct to current payment rails by piloting stablecoin settlement in emerging markets. If it works, the model could spread to other areas. Finastra brings USDC to cross-border payments. Finastra, one of the largest financial software firms in the world, has added support for USDC to its Global PAYplus payment solution. This platform is of such wide use among banks that it handles over $5 trillion in cross-border transactions daily. The integration also means that banks in at least 50 countries can settle payments in USDC even if the payment instructions are written in a legacy fiat currency, such as the dollar, euro, or British pound. For the banks here, this is a big blow. They can use Circle’s blockchain-based settlement solution without changing their infrastructure. The plug-in solution enables them to provide quicker and more cost-effective international payments and keep up with the financial industry standards. Finastra said the partnership offers a way for banks to innovate in cross-border payments, at scale. It also makes stablecoin use cases more feasible by plugging directly into legacy bank rails. Circle drives global adoption of USDC Circle’s activities with Mastercard and Finastra are part of a broader wave of efforts to grow USDC adoption worldwide. The development comes after the July passage of the GENIUS Act, which sets a federal framework for stablecoins in the U.S., the first of its kind in the country, and Circle’s accelerating tie-ups with key financial players. Circle teamed up with crypto exchange OKX in July to allow zero-fee USDC conversions into U.S. dollars. This pumped up USDC liquidity in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. South Korea’s top banks, KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, are reportedly preparing to meet with Circle to explore a potential partnership in the stablecoin market. The meeting, scheduled during Tarbert’s visit to Seoul this month, is part of South Korean banks’ push to enter the stablecoin sector as the country moves toward establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier last week, major commercial banks in South Korea are ramping up preparations for stablecoin issuance ahead of upcoming legislation to shape the sector. Sources indicate that discussions have focused on potential collaborations with domestic fintech and tech giants as well as with international issuers of dollar-backed stablecoins, such as Circle. Circle also teamed up with SBI Group, Ripple, and Startale in Japan to further USDC uptake and create a tokenized asset platform for real-world assets. Together, these moves suggest a clear strategy: Embed USDC into the world’s financial arteries, from merchant settlements to cross-border banking. Get seen where it counts.

A recent and alarming development from South Korea highlights this reality, as authorities have cracked down on a significant memecoin scam . This incident serves as a stark reminder for all investors to exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough research before committing funds to any digital asset, especially those promising extravagant returns. How Did This Memecoin Scam Unfold? Police in South Korea’s Gyeonggi Nambu Province recently announced the arrest and referral for prosecution of three individuals. These arrests are linked to an alleged crypto fraud that successfully defrauded 129 victims, amounting to approximately 5.7 billion won, or about $4.1 million. This was not a small operation; it was a carefully orchestrated scheme. The Project: The group created a fraudulent memecoin called GCV. Timeline: This scheme operated between December 2023 and June 2024. The Lure: Scammers enticed investors with false promises of an exclusive Asian golf course membership. This membership was supposedly in exchange for investing in their GCV coin. The Impact: Many individuals lost significant amounts of money, believing they were securing a valuable asset and a luxurious perk. The ringleader, identified only as A, along with two accomplices, now faces legal action for their role in this extensive memecoin scam . Understanding the Allure of Crypto Fraud and Golf Memberships Why do such scams, particularly those involving luxury promises, continue to ensnare investors? The appeal often lies in a blend of aspirational living and the perceived ‘get rich quick’ nature of some crypto projects. Investors, drawn by the promise of high returns and exclusive benefits like golf memberships, might overlook critical red flags. Moreover, the novelty of memecoins can sometimes make it harder for new investors to distinguish legitimate projects from outright fraud. Scammers exploit this lack of familiarity, creating elaborate narratives that sound plausible to the untrained ear. They often leverage social media and community hype to build a false sense of legitimacy, making it challenging to identify a memecoin scam early on. Protecting Yourself from a Memecoin Scam: Actionable Insights Staying safe in the crypto space requires vigilance. Here are some key strategies to protect your investments and avoid falling victim to a memecoin scam : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Look for transparency and a clear roadmap. Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns or exclusive real-world assets (like golf memberships) for a new, unproven coin, it’s a major red flag. Check for Audits: Legitimate crypto projects often undergo smart contract audits by reputable third-party firms. Verify Team Identity: Anonymous teams can be a warning sign. While some legitimate projects start anonymously, transparency often increases trust. Community Scrutiny: Engage with the project’s community, but be critical. Scammers can create fake engagement. Start Small: If you’re unsure, invest only what you can afford to lose. Remember, a healthy skepticism is your best defense against sophisticated fraudsters.

Many early investors are looking to grab a much bigger share of the market. In 2025, Ethereum remains at the center of institutional adoption interest, but smart money conversations now turn to where the next big breakout is likely to occur. According to analysts, as Ethereum has confirmed its dominance in the industry, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a strong opportunity for long-term upside. Ethereum: Network Activity Surges Amid Institutional Growth Ethereum’s price recently spiked past $4,800, almost reaching new multiyear highs. However, the basics of the network seem to be unrivaled wholesomely. Transactions rose by 63% in the last 30 days while that of the active addresses climbed 26%. In the last 48 hours, exchanges have had over 200,000 ETH withdrawn, creating the potential for a supply squeeze. Staking demand is picking up so heavily that over 870,000 ETH worth more than $4.16 billion remain in the exit queue on Ethereum PoS. Confidence in the industry continues to increase as treasury giant Bitmine purchases an additional 9,613 ETH worth about 45 million. Despite $388 million in liquidations from leveraged longs, traders are rotating Bitcoin to Ethereum, which shows it’s bullish, analysts say. Ethereum’s 14,000% return on investment continues to be a testament to the rewards of early adoption of the right project. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Smart Money Play Ethereum’s historical 14,000% return on investment (“ROI”) is creating a new wave of hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE. The unique ecosystem has been audited double time by both HashEx and CertiK. It has received a safe, secure and fully transparent stamp passing all tests. With whale-backed inflows, a KYC-verified team and predictions of a major upside, analysts have called it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Early buyers using PATRIOT50X receive a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out fast. Unlike speculative presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is layered on credibility. Two of the most reputable blockchain security companies audited it twice, giving assurance about its technical safety. While Ethereum made early investors rich, MAGACOIN FINANCE now offers the asymmetric opportunity that could deliver similar upside in the current cycle. Why Smart Money Is Paying Attention Institutions or whales usually put their money into safer growth opportunities. Ethereum is still a contender, but is so large now that smaller, vetted projects can offer much better multiples. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being referred to by analysts and smart money forums as a project that combines safety with urgency due to scarcity. As presale allocations become tighter and added perks like PATRIOT50X drive more inflows, the early window to make huge returns is closing fast. Conclusion Ethereum’s historic 14,000% ROI is proof of how transformative early investment in the right project can be. In 2025, Ethereum remains a pillar of the crypto ecosystem, but analysts agree that the most exciting new growth story lies in presales. With its double audits, whale-backed demand, and KYC-verified team, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 — offering smart money investors the chance to capture exponential upside before allocations disappear.

Analysts and investors alike are noticing how its community-driven energy and unique positioning give it room to grow. While it doesn’t yet have the track record of Ethereum or Dogecoin, its rising visibility puts it firmly in the mix when people talk about the Best Altcoins to Buy Now.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news about a significant move by a publicly traded company. Sharplink Gaming Ethereum strategy is once again in the spotlight as the Nasdaq-listed firm (Nasdaq: SBET), a known strategic investor in Ethereum, has reportedly transferred a substantial 23.46 million USDT to Galaxy Digital.

This development is certainly worth watching for anyone interested in institutional crypto adoption and its impact on the market. What is Driving Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Ambition? Sharplink Gaming (SBET) is not new to the Ethereum space. They have previously demonstrated a clear interest in the asset, positioning themselves as a strategic investor.

How Might This Sharplink Gaming Ethereum Purchase Impact the Market? A purchase of this magnitude by a publicly traded company like Sharplink Gaming could have several implications for the Ethereum market. While 23.46 million USDT is a considerable sum, its immediate impact on ETH price might be limited given Ethereum’s large market capitalization and daily trading volumes. However, the psychological impact could be significant. Key Potential Impacts: Increased Institutional Confidence: This move signals continued confidence from traditional companies in Ethereum’s long-term potential, potentially encouraging other corporate entities to follow suit. Market Sentiment Boost: Positive news about institutional adoption often acts as a catalyst for broader market optimism, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Demand for ETH: A direct purchase of ETH by Sharplink Gaming would contribute to the overall demand, especially if executed in a structured manner through a firm like Galaxy Digital. Furthermore, Sharplink Gaming’s strategic approach to Sharplink Gaming Ethereum investments highlights the growing sophistication of corporate treasury management in the digital age. They are not just buying crypto; they are engaging with established financial intermediaries to execute their vision with precision.

For Sharplink Gaming, the potential benefits include: Capital Appreciation: If Ethereum’s value continues to grow, their investment could see substantial returns, boosting company assets and shareholder value. Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets to their portfolio provides diversification away from traditional asset classes, potentially reducing overall risk. Innovation Alignment: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Ethereum can enhance a company’s image as forward-thinking and innovative in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. However, challenges are also present: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, exposing the investment to significant risk and potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance challenges for corporate holders. Public Scrutiny: As a Nasdaq-listed company, Sharplink Gaming faces public and shareholder scrutiny over its investment decisions, requiring clear communication. Therefore, any move by Sharplink Gaming Ethereum strategy must be carefully considered, balancing potential rewards against inherent risks. Their choice of Galaxy Digital as a partner suggests a professional approach to mitigating some of these challenges and ensuring a secure transaction. In conclusion, Sharplink Gaming’s transfer of 23.46 million USDT to Galaxy Digital for a potential Ethereum purchase is a compelling indicator of ongoing institutional interest in the crypto market. This strategic decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity not only reinforces Ethereum’s position as a preferred institutional asset but also provides a fascinating case study in corporate crypto adoption.

His remarks followed a post by ETF specialist Nate Geraci, who noted that CME Group’s XRP futures contracts have surpassed $1 billion in open interest, the fastest contract ever to reach that milestone, achieving it within three months. Geraci also highlighted the $800 million already tied up in futures-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Deaton responded by stressing the significance of XRP’s user base and its impact on related markets. He stated, “I predicted this just like I predicted Gemini’s XRP Card would be Gemini’s most popular credit card,” referencing Gemini’s recently launched XRP rewards card backed by Mastercard and issued by WebBank. Deaton added that he believes XRP holders helped drive Gemini’s mobile application to surpass Coinbase’s app in recent download figures. I predicted this just like I predicted @Gemini ’s XRP Card would be Gemini’s most popular credit card.

He stressed that such collective legal involvement was unprecedented in the crypto industry. Other experts have emphasized the role of the community, noting that XRP may not have succeeded the way it did without its passionate community . For Deaton, the involvement of this global community is a direct indicator of sustained retail demand that complements growing institutional interest. The combination of CME futures activity, ETF inflows, and consumer-facing products like the Gemini XRP credit card suggests that demand is not confined to one area of the market. While futures growth demonstrates rising interest from institutional traders, retail adoption continues to expand rapidly. Anticipation for Spot XRP ETFs The next development attracting attention is the pending lineup of spot XRP ETF applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Several proposals are awaiting responses by October , with expectations among analysts and investors leaning toward eventual approval.

Taken together, the rising demand across derivatives, ETFs, consumer products, and community engagement shows the rising demand for XRP.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7914 Market cap $834.88M Trading volume (24-hour) $18.08M Circulating supply 1.056B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8023 24-hour low $0.784 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.87% 50-day SMA $0.8096 14-Day RSI 47.42 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.6568 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is trapped in $0.76-$0.83 consolidation zone with decreasing volume. The MACD is near zero with minimal directional bias. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart XTZ’s daily chart as of August 28, 2025 shows a modest 0.52% gain that fails to address the underlying bearish structure. The price remains trapped below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.8340 and well beneath the upper band resistance at $0.9044, indicating sustained selling pressure since the July highs. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD hovers near the zero line with minimal momentum in either direction, while the histogram shows slight compression, suggesting potential for a directional move but lacking clear conviction. The token appears stuck in a grinding sideways pattern between $0.76-$0.83, with neither bulls nor bears able to establish decisive control. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart confirms XTZ’s technical difficulties with the token struggling to break above the descending trendline resistance that has capped rallies since late July around $0.84. Current price action at $0.7919 shows the token consolidating just below the 21-period SMA at $0.7981, which now acts as immediate resistance after previously serving as support. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume patterns reveal diminishing interest with 24-hour volume at just 1.59M, significantly lower than the 4M+ levels seen during more active periods, suggesting retail and institutional participation has waned considerably. The On-Balance Volume at 347.95M shows relatively stable accumulation patterns, indicating that while selling pressure exists, there’s no panic distribution occurring. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7402 BUY SMA 5 $0.8041 SELL SMA 10 $0.8094 SELL SMA 21 $0.8373 SELL SMA 50 $0.8096 SELL SMA 100 $0.6973 BUY SMA 200 $0.6568 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8145 SELL EMA 5 $0.7833 BUY EMA 10 $0.7238 BUY EMA 21 $0.6827 BUY EMA 50 $0.7112 BUY EMA 100 $0.8038 SELL EMA 200 $0.8757 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ looks positioned for a decisive breakout from its current consolidation range, though direction remains uncertain. A break above $0.83 with volume would target the $0.87-$0.90 resistance zone, while failure to hold $0.76 support could lead to a test of the lower $0.72-$0.74 area, where stronger buying interest might emerge. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos unveiled Teslink, a modular interoperability layer connecting Tezos with EVM-compatible chains like Ethlink.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it maintained an average price of $0.7232. XTZ kicked off August at $0.7605 and is currently trading around $0.79.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-28 02:58:05

50794049,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80423,1756350016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"BlockDAG’s EVM Compatibility Brings 4,500 Developers Onboard Before Mainnet’s Launch",https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-evm-compatibility-brings-4500-developers-onboard/,"In crypto, developer traction often signals which networks will last. Ethereum’s lead comes from its large pool of builders, while other chains have struggled when they couldn’t attract enough projects. BlockDAG (BDAG) is already proving different. With full EVM compatibility and more than 4,500 developers building, it doesn’t need to start from zero. Instead, it offers an instant home for Ethereum-native applications. This zero-switching-cost model does more than simplify migration. It accelerates growth by giving builders the ability to bring their dApps directly into BlockDAG ’s system without rewriting code or learning a new framework. Since developer time is one of the scarcest resources in Web3, this path reduces friction and makes adoption far more likely. That advantage has already sparked visible momentum before the mainnet launch. Why EVM Compatibility Is a Game Changer The Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, has become the standard for executing smart contracts. Networks like Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain have grown quickly by supporting it, offering developers lower fees or faster speeds while keeping the same coding tools. By embracing EVM compatibility, BlockDAG gains access to Ethereum’s pool of builders and applications. For developers, the benefit is clear. They can port dApps into BlockDAG without costly redevelopment. For BlockDAG, this provides an immediate stream of projects across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Analysts note this solves the cold start challenge that new blockchains face. Instead of waiting years to attract activity, BlockDAG is entering the field with usage already on the table. BlockDAG’s Developer Momentum Before Launch What makes BlockDAG stand out is that developer activity is already happening before the mainnet exists. Over 4,500 developers are engaged, with more than 300 dApps in progress across categories like finance, gaming, and NFTs. This level of traction is rare at the presale stage, showing BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than a fundraiser. Its presale performance reinforces that story. The project has raised over $385 million and sold more than 25.5 billion coins across 30 batches. Early buyers from batch one are already sitting on paper gains of 2,900%, with the coin now priced at $0.03. Miner sales have also passed $7.8 million, with over 19,400 miners sold worldwide. With a hard cap of $600M, BlockDAG is already set up with resources for listings and ecosystem expansion. The combination of developer adoption and presale momentum creates a strong foundation. Developers benefit from frictionless migration through EVM compatibility, while the presale provides the liquidity needed for growth. Analysts note that this dual-track strategy, technical adoption plus financial support, separates BlockDAG from other presales that rely solely on hype. This is why BlockDAG’s projections of hitting $1 by 2027, $5 by 2030, and even $10 in bullish cases feel more achievable. Developer traction ensures that demand is built on real-world usage rather than only speculation. Why Developers Choose BlockDAG BlockDAG’s architecture blends DAG scalability with Proof of Work security. Ethereum’s congestion and gas costs have long frustrated developers, but BlockDAG’s setup offers faster confirmations with parallel processing. Testnet results already show 10 blocks per second, with scalability expected to improve as adoption grows. For dApps that need speed and reliability, such as exchanges, lending apps, and gaming platforms, this is an attractive option. Builders get Ethereum-level programmability with Bitcoin-like security, giving them fewer trade-offs. The 300+ projects in progress across DeFi, gaming, and NFTs highlight the momentum. Analysts often say ecosystems grow in clusters, and once a few flagship projects move, more follow. With EVM compatibility lowering migration costs, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a natural option for Ethereum-based projects looking for scale. Building the Ecosystem on Familiar Ground BlockDAG’s decision to fully support EVM means it connects with the most widely used standard in Web3. It doesn’t reinvent development from scratch. Instead, it gives builders a smoother path and better tools. That’s why thousands of developers are already engaged before launch. Alongside its developer traction, cultural visibility is also growing. Sponsorships with Inter Milan and U.S. sports teams add mainstream exposure, while the builder community drives technical adoption. This balance of public visibility and developer depth helps seed the project from both ends. With batch 30 priced at $0.03 and a $0.05 listing confirmed, the presale ROI has already reached 2,900%. Long-term analyst targets of $1 to $10 depend on adoption, and developer activity makes those projections realistic. BlockDAG isn’t starting from zero, it’s starting with momentum.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum out of reach for many retail investors, attention has shifted to coins that still trade below the dollar yet show strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Analysts are closely watching Hedera, Dogecoin, and a fresh contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE . Backed by a HashEx audit, MAGACOIN is starting to make waves as one of the best altcoin to buy now for those seeking growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Secure Under-$1 Gem with 3800% Potential When discussing the best altcoins to buy under $1, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its blend of security and upside. The project has passed a full smart-contract audit from HashEx , a respected blockchain security firm known for rigorous testing. Passing all checks adds a layer of trust that investors usually demand from new projects. What’s drawing attention is MAGACOIN’s projected 3800% growth potential , fueled by rising adoption and its positioning as a secure choice in a volatile market. Analysts highlight that unlike meme-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building from the ground up with strong fundamentals and a clear focus on sustainable growth. There’s also growing demand around its launch phase, with early buyers still able to claim a 50% bonus using the code PATRIOT50X . For many investors scanning through undervalued altcoins 2025, MAGACOIN is emerging as a name worth watching closely. Hedera: Strong Enterprise Use Cases Point to Big 2025 For those searching for the best crypto to buy now , Hedera (HBAR) has been making its case through real-world adoption. The project recently attracted attention with SWIFT’s blockchain payment trials scheduled for November 2025, a step that could see up to $150 trillion in annual settlements flow through Hedera’s hashgraph. That’s a scale few networks can match. Enterprise activity also continues to climb, with $126 million in stablecoins issued on Hedera, led by USDC’s overwhelming share. Analysts are growing more confident in Hedera’s ability to position itself as one of the top altcoins for 2025. Market watchers are already discussing the Hedera price prediction 2025 , with estimates pointing toward the $0.55 range. Source Crypto YouTuber Jesu Martinez even said he’s “50X more bullish on HBAR” after recent talks with the project’s founders, suggesting late 2025 and 2026 could be strong years for long-term holders. Dogecoin: Whale Moves and ETF Hype Keep It in Focus Another project topping analyst lists of the best altcoins to buy under $1 is Dogecoin (DOGE). The coin remains a trader favorite, boosted by whale activity and growing speculation around a potential spot DOGE ETF. Recent whale transfers of nearly 900 million DOGE (≈$200 million) to Binance spiked volatility, but on-chain data shows that whales quietly accumulated 680 million DOGE during the same period. DOGE analysis by Ali This kind of accumulation has analysts paying close attention. Influencer Ali suggested on X that “ Dogecoin $DOGE: One last dip before the breakout!”, while More Crypto Online noted that the $0.20 level is a critical support area for the token’s structure. Looking ahead, many are eyeing the Dogecoin price prediction 2025 with growing optimism. If ETF approvals come through—analysts assign a 60–70% chance within the next 12–18 months—Dogecoin could strengthen its place among the top altcoins for 2025 and maintain its status as a best altcoin to buy now for those betting on mainstream exposure. Final Word: Which Altcoin Stands Out? The race for the best altcoins to buy under $1 has intensified, with Hedera’s enterprise growth and Dogecoin’s ETF speculation fueling strong narratives. Both have bullish 2025 price predictions, making them attractive to traders and long-term investors. Yet, analysts are quick to point out that MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a unique path. With an independent audit, rising adoption, and the chance for early supporters to grab a bonus, it’s gaining traction as the best crypto to buy now .

At the time of writing, the asset trades around $111,090, reflecting a 10.5% decline from its peak and a 4.2% drop over the past week. The pullback highlights growing uncertainty among traders as buying pressure weakens, even while some on-chain indicators suggest potential accumulation. One such signal comes from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Analyst Crazzyblockk, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, examined a metric called the Binance Buying Power Ratio. According to the analyst, this ratio, measuring the inflow of stablecoins relative to Bitcoin outflows from Binance, has recently climbed sharply, moving into positive territory. The implication is that traders are sending stablecoins into the exchange (potential buying power) while withdrawing Bitcoin, likely for long-term storage.

Binance Buying Power Ratio Signals Accumulation Crazzyblockk explained that this pattern points to a buildup of liquidity while simultaneously reducing the Bitcoin supply available for sale on Binance. In his words: Stablecoins in, BTC out. This combination of accumulating ‘dry powder’ and securing assets off-exchange is a classic sign of a market preparing for a bullish move. The surge in buying power ratio coincides with Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase, suggesting that some traders may be preparing for a rebound. Historically, an increase in stablecoin inflows has often preceded heightened trading activity, with many market participants using these reserves to enter positions once favorable conditions emerge. At the same time, large Bitcoin outflows from exchanges can reflect a broader trend of long-term holding behavior. Investors who transfer coins to private or institutional-grade wallets often intend to store them securely, limiting immediate selling pressure. If sustained, this dual trend of stablecoin accumulation and Bitcoin withdrawals could support the market by reducing available supply and preparing liquidity for upward moves. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Weakness While Binance metrics suggest optimism, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a more cautious indicator: the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for short-term holders (STHs). This metric measures whether coins moved on-chain are being sold at a profit or loss. Darkfost noted that the STH SOPR has now fallen below 1, with its monthly average sitting at the neutral point. In practical terms, this means that many recent buyers are no longer selling at a profit, and some are even taking losses. He wrote: Historically, when STH SOPR reaches this level, two scenarios are common. Either the market rebounds quickly, or short-term holders panic, leading to further losses. During this cycle, the second scenario has often played out—though these periods have consistently created opportunities for medium- to long-term investors. The comparison to late 2021, when Bitcoin last peaked at $69,000 before entering a prolonged correction, shows the weight of this signal. A persistent decline in SOPR could indicate rising pressure from traders seeking to exit, even as long-term holders demonstrate greater conviction.

Most depend on whitepapers, developer conferences, and presale updates to slowly gain credibility. BlockDAG has rewritten that script. With a sponsorship deal with Inter Milan, plus partnerships in rugby and cricket, the project has already stepped into the spotlight, positioning itself not only as a blockchain but as a brand with consumer presence. This early move into cultural visibility adds a new layer to the story. With more than $385M raised, 25.5B coins sold, and 200,000 holders already on board, BlockDAG is proving it can establish credibility both within crypto and with millions of sports fans. Analysts argue that this kind of visibility, so early in its lifecycle, is rare, and could drive a wave of retail participation. Sports Partnerships as a Branding Engine Inter Milan, one of Europe’s most recognizable football clubs, puts BlockDAG’s name in stadiums and on screens seen by millions every week. Beyond Europe, the project’s partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket extend visibility across U.S. sports markets, both of which are fast-growing hubs for digital assets. For most chains, mainstream sponsorships come years after launch. Solana leaned heavily on NFTs before moving into branding. Avalanche and Aptos focused on technical marketing. BlockDAG, however, is taking its shot at cultural recognition before listing, signaling ambition and intent to engage audiences beyond crypto insiders. Visibility in major sports is not just about exposure; it is about building trust. Mainstream audiences who might hesitate to engage with early projects recognize familiar names like Inter Milan. That connection can reduce barriers to participation, strengthening BlockDAG’s image as a credible project. This is particularly important because BlockDAG’s presale is primarily retail-driven. Unlike Aptos with $350M in VC funding or Avalanche with $230M raised from institutions, BlockDAG is pushing toward its $600M target with grassroots support. Sponsorships accelerate this retail-first model, pulling in non-crypto participants and reinforcing its identity as the “people’s blockchain.” Turning Visibility Into Participation Brand exposure alone is not enough, but BlockDAG has linked it to direct participation. Its X1 Mobile Miner app, downloaded by more than 2.5M users, which allows anyone to mine from their phone. Meanwhile, 19,500 units of its X10 hardware miners have been sold, creating an option for those seeking deeper involvement. Together, they form a pipeline: sports fans see the brand, curiosity drives downloads, and easy onboarding turns awareness into action. This two-track strategy, combining cultural visibility with simple entry points, explains why BlockDAG has reached adoption levels that other projects typically only achieve years after mainnet. Analysts See Strategic Value in Early Visibility From an analyst’s lens, BlockDAG’s sponsorships create more than brand buzz, they build strategic momentum. Ecosystem dominance often hinges on cultural recognition as much as technical strength. Ethereum became a leader not only because of smart contracts but because it captured cultural attention in DeFi and NFTs. Solana rose on the back of NFT hype and strong consumer mindshare. BlockDAG is moving on this front earlier than most. With EVM compatibility, 4,500+ developers, and more than 300 applications in progress, it is pairing technical credibility with global visibility. This dual approach, winning both developers and consumers, strengthens its position as it heads toward listing. For buyers, sponsorships reinforce presale confidence. At the Batch 30 price of $0.03 and a confirmed $0.05 listing, early participants are already looking at a clear 2,900% ROI pathway. Analyst predictions of $1 to $10 long-term valuations rely heavily on adoption, and mainstream visibility increases the odds by pulling in audiences beyond crypto-native communities. BlockDAG also stands out from competitors. Many presale projects launch with nothing more than a roadmap and an online group. BlockDAG, by contrast, enters the market with millions of fans already seeing its brand in stadiums and media, far outside traditional crypto circles. From Presale to Prime Time By partnering with Inter Milan and securing rugby and cricket sponsorships, BlockDAG is signaling an aggressive strategy: to debut not just as another blockchain, but as a global consumer brand from day one. Combined with $385M already raised, millions of mobile miners, and thousands of developers building, its presale success is being matched by cultural expansion. For a project still in presale, this level of mainstream exposure is highly unusual. Few ever reach stadiums, households, and media markets before they list. BlockDAG has managed it, and that early momentum could set the stage for one of the most anticipated Layer-1 launches of 2025.

50794592,567049,1756350053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50794592.jpeg,Bitcoin Strategy Deepens As Metaplanet Plans $880 Million Raise,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-metaplanet-880-million/,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet today announced plans to raise another 130 billion yen ($880 million) through an international share sale. Of that amount, the firm intends to allocate roughly $835 million toward purchasing additional Bitcoin (BTC). Metaplanet Eyes More Bitcoin Purchases According to a regulatory filing , Tokyo-based Metaplanet has approved a plan to raise as much as $880 million, with nearly $837 million set aside for fresh BTC acquisitions. To generate the funds, the company will issue 555 million new shares. This issuance could increase the number of Metaplanet’s outstanding shares from 722 million to approximately 1.27 billion. Often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” Metaplanet has emerged as one of Asia’s most prominent corporate Bitcoin holders. Data from CoinGecko shows the firm currently ranks as the world’s 8th largest public company by BTC reserves, holding 18,991 BTC on its balance sheet. The firm noted that proceeds from the offering will be used between September and October 2025 to accumulate Bitcoin. In addition, around $43.9 million will be reserved for other Bitcoin-related financial operations. It is important to highlight that the share sale will take place exclusively on international markets. In the US, sales will be restricted to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act. Metaplanet’s latest BTC purchase came earlier this week when the firm announced it had bought 103 BTC worth more than $11 million. At present, Metaplanet’s total BTC holdings are valued around $2 billion. The firm plans to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The firm’s strategy reflects a broader trend of corporations integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries. Healthcare company KindlyMD, recently announced a $5 billion stock sale to expand its BTC reserves. Commenting on the development, David Bailey, CEO, KindlyMD, said that the move to raise $5 billion is a natural next step following the firm’s initial purchase of 5,744 BTC earlier this month. On the CoinGecko list, KindlyMD currently ranks 16th in terms of total BTC held. Is BTC On The Verge Of Supply Crunch? BTC’s fixed supply of 21 million coins remains one of its most defining features. However, a significant portion of these coins has been lost in unrecoverable wallets, further reducing the effective circulating supply. As a result, a quiet race has begun among corporations, institutional investors, and even nation-states to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before prices climb further. Recently, a congressman in the Philippines introduced a bill proposing the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the nation. Meanwhile, Dutch crypto services company Amdax announced plans last week to launch a public Bitcoin treasury firm, while Nasdaq-listed Top Win International disclosed a $10 million raise for BTC purchases. In similar news, Turkish mobility app Marti Technologies stated last month that it will hold 20% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin. At press time, BTC trades at $112,013, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|bitcoin corporate treasury strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Metaplanet|share issuance,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ASIA|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 03:00:53

On-chain data suggests a substantial Infini founder ETH sale , specifically from Christian, the founder of the stablecoin neobank project Infini. This development has sparked considerable discussion and speculation within the crypto community, highlighting the constant scrutiny that high-profile figures face in the transparent world of blockchain. Unpacking the Infini Founder ETH Sale: The Details According to diligent on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, an address linked to Infini founder Christian appears to have offloaded a staggering 2,477 ETH. This amount translates to approximately $11.66 million at the time of the transaction, which occurred roughly ten hours ago. Such a large movement of assets naturally draws attention and raises questions about its motivations and potential impact. Let’s break down how this massive transaction unfolded: Decentralized Exchange Activity: A significant portion, 1,257 wrapped Ethereum (wETH), was sold on CowSwap, a decentralized exchange. The average sale price for this segment was reported at $4,777.6 per wETH. Centralized Exchange Deposit: The remaining 1,220 ETH was subsequently deposited into Binance, one of the world’s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The analyst’s report indicates that if the ETH deposited into Binance is also sold, Christian’s address would have entirely liquidated its Ethereum holdings. This complete exit from an asset position by a project founder is a notable event. Why Does This Infini Founder ETH Sale Grab Headlines? Anytime a founder, especially of a relatively new project like Infini, makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples. Transparency is a double-edged sword in crypto; while it allows for public verification, it also exposes individuals to intense scrutiny. This specific Infini founder ETH sale event is no exception. What are some of the immediate concerns? Project Stability: Large sales by founders can sometimes signal a lack of confidence in their own project’s long-term prospects or personal financial needs. Market Sentiment: Such transactions can influence investor perception and potentially impact the market value of related tokens or the broader crypto ecosystem. Transparency vs. Privacy: It underscores the ongoing debate between on-chain transparency and an individual’s right to financial privacy, even for public figures. Understanding On-Chain Analysis: How Do We Know? The ability to track such transactions stems from the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. On-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa utilize publicly available data to trace asset movements. They identify wallets associated with known entities and monitor their activity. This process allows the community to gain insights into the financial actions of key players. This level of transparency is a core tenet of decentralized finance (DeFi). It empowers the community to: Verify transactions without intermediaries. Monitor large movements that could affect market dynamics. Hold project founders accountable for their actions. What Are the Potential Ramifications of the Infini Founder ETH Sale? While the reasons behind Christian’s substantial ETH sale remain speculative, the event itself carries potential implications. It could be a strategic personal financial decision, unrelated to Infini’s health. Alternatively, it might suggest a shift in the founder’s investment strategy or even a need for liquidity. For Infini and its community, this news prompts questions about the project’s future direction and the founder’s continued involvement. It is crucial for projects to communicate clearly during such times to maintain investor trust and confidence. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto’s Transparent Waters The reported Infini founder ETH sale serves as a stark reminder of the transparent yet often complex nature of the cryptocurrency market. While on-chain data offers unprecedented insight, interpreting these movements requires careful consideration and context. Investors and community members must stay informed, relying on verified information and critical analysis rather than succumbing to immediate speculation. This event underscores the importance of due diligence and understanding the motivations behind significant transactions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. As the market matures, the interplay between founder actions, on-chain transparency, and community perception will continue to shape its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions About the Infini Founder ETH Sale Here are some common questions regarding this significant cryptocurrency event: Q1: Who is Christian, and what is Infini? A1: Christian is identified as the founder of Infini, a stablecoin neobank project. Infini aims to provide banking services utilizing stablecoins. Q2: What exactly happened with the ETH sale? A2: An address linked to Christian reportedly sold 2,477 ETH, valued at approximately $11.66 million. Part of this was sold on CowSwap, and the rest was deposited into Binance. Q3: How was this transaction discovered? A3: The transaction was discovered and reported by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who tracks and interprets publicly available data on blockchain networks. Q4: Does this sale mean Infini is in trouble? A4: Not necessarily. While a large founder sale can raise concerns, the exact reasons are unknown. It could be a personal financial decision, a strategic portfolio adjustment, or something else entirely. Projects often need to provide clear communication in such situations. Q5: What is the significance of depositing ETH into Binance? A5: Depositing a large amount of ETH into a centralized exchange like Binance often precedes a sale. If the deposited amount is sold, it would mean the address has fully liquidated its ETH position. Was this insight into the Infini founder ETH sale helpful?

Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a downside correction and tested the $4,310 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price found support and recently started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $4,400 and $4,420 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,956 swing high to the $4,310 low. However, the bears were active near the $4,630 resistance zone. The 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,956 swing high to the $4,310 low is acting as a hurdle. Recently, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $4,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,580 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,630 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,710 level. A clear move above the $4,710 resistance might send the price toward the $4,820 resistance. An upside break above the $4,820 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,880 resistance zone or even $5,000 in the near term. More Losses In ETH?

PI’s price continues to struggle, sliding to about $0.33. The upcoming token unlocks and the increased amount of coins stored on exchanges intensify the selling pressure, though rumors of a potential Coinbase listing keep hopes for a rebound alive. Information About the Upcoming Feature The team behind Pi Network issued another announcement regarding the .pi Domain Auction. It reminded that the platform-level utility “directly harnesses the collective resources of the Pi community,” including its attention and authenticity. Having said that, the developers expect the campaign to be successful. The auction is a bidding event that will enable Pioneers to acquire unique .pi domain names. These will replace the users’ long addresses, consisting of numerous letters and numbers, and will be similar in concept to .eth (Ethereum Name Services) and .bnb (BSC Name Services). “Designed for active use, .pi domains become recognizable access points for apps in the ecosystem, making it simple for others to find, use, and share,” the team said . Earlier this month, Pi Network reminded Pioneers that the auction has been extended to September 30, 2025, allowing them more time to innovate, build, and bid for their applications. The latest disclosure was met with mixed feelings. Some community members argued that the crypto project has much bigger problems to solve rather than focus on such a development. Others, though, praised the initiative, claiming it can generate more trust if delivered on time. PI’s Price Decline Despite the frequent developments surrounding the controversial project, the price of the native token has continued to sink. During the latest correction of the cryptocurrency market, PI plummeted to a new all-time low of roughly $0.33, representing a staggering 90% decline compared to the historical peak of around $3 witnessed in February. Factors like the multi-million token unlock scheduled for the next 30 days and the rising amount of coins stored on crypto exchanges increase the selling pressure. Contrary to the bearish landscape, there are still optimists who believe PI could reclaim its former peak and even surpass it. Additionally, there have been increased rumors that Coinbase may soon offer trading services for the asset. Such a move will most likely trigger a significant price surge, but as of this writing, there is no official announcement.

This development signals a significant step towards clarifying the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the nation. Why Are Stablecoins a Hot Topic in Korea? Stablecoins are a unique class of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, their inherent stability makes them attractive for everyday transactions and remittances. Globally, central banks and regulators are scrutinizing stablecoins due to their growing popularity. They present both opportunities for financial innovation and potential risks to financial stability if not properly managed. The Bank of Korea, therefore, is proactively addressing these complex issues to ensure a secure and efficient financial system. Crucial Stablecoin Discussions: What’s on the Table? On August 28, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong confirmed that the central bank is deeply involved in discussions with other relevant government bodies regarding stablecoin -related matters. This collaborative effort, as reported by iNews24, aims to develop a comprehensive framework.

Check forecast,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/28/whats-next-for-hype-after-hitting-a-new-ath-of-51-check-forecast/,"The cryptocurrency market has been volatile since the start of the week. Bitcoin briefly dropped below $110k earlier this week but clawed its way back above $112k a few hours ago. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has now slightly declined and is trading above $111,500. Its positive performance allowed altcoins to rally, with one setting a new all-time high. Hyperliquid’s HYPE set a new all-time high of $51 after adding 12% to its value in the last seven days. HYPE hits $51 amid growing volume HYPE, the native coin of the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, rallied to a new all-time high of $51 on Wednesday. The coin has since then lost 6% of its value and is now trading at $47 per coin. The coin’s new milestone comes as the decentralized exchange recorded a derivatives volume of over $357 billion in August , up nearly 10 times from the same period last year. Hyperliquid generated $105 million in trading fees, most of which were funneled to token buybacks. In addition to that, digital asset custodian BitGo added support earlier this week for the HyperEVM network. The HyperEVM network powers the Hyperliquid ecosystem, with BitGo’s adoption unlocking institutional access to the HYPE token. Finally, the Hyperliquid team announced that they have implemented a protocol upgrade after a sudden 2.5x price spike in its pre-launch XPL perpetual market caused widespread liquidations. An analyst revealed that four addresses participated in short-squeezing XPL on Hyperliquid, with cumulative profits reaching over $46 million. Following this incident, Hyperliquid is rolling out two key updates in its next network upgrade. The first upgrade will introduce a new hard cap to limit hyperp mark prices to 10x the 8-hour exponential moving average. This will offer vercollateralized shorts clearer risk boundaries. The second upgrade involves incorporating external perpetual market data into the mark price formula for hyperps. This will help improve the robustness of price signals in thin markets, without altering realized profit and loss or funding mechanisms. HYPE could hit $60 if the rally persists The HYPE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, thanks to HYPE adding 12% to its value in the last seven days. At press time, HYPE is trading at $47 but could rally higher and reclaim its all-time high in the near term. The technical indicators remain bullish, with the MACD lines deeply within the positive territory since the start of the week. The RSI of 59 also shows that HYPE still has room for growth. If the rally resumes, HYPE could reclaim its all-time high price of $51 in the coming hours or days before rallying to a new high around $55-$60. An extended rally would depend on the broader market. However, HYPE has lost 3% of its value in the last 24 hours and could face further correction. If the correction persists, HYPE could drop to the nearest support and TLQ level at $42.7. Failure to defend this level could see HYPE drop below $40 for the second time in a week. The post What's next for HYPE after hitting a new ATH of $51?

One of the clearest voices on this point is Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor), a crypto expert on X, who recently explained how XRP can be managed using the same wealth strategies employed by traditional elites. His view is that the real advantage lies in treating XRP as an appreciating asset to be collateralized, rather than sold, and not in seeking short-term gains. $XRP HOLDERS LISTEN UP People who keep saying “the yield is too small” you’re missing the point. It’s not about chasing crazy yields. It’s about adopting the same wealth strategies the elites have used for decades: using your assets as collateral instead of selling them.… https://t.co/hgBFvlf19w — Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor) August 26, 2025 The Elite Approach to Assets Demanincor emphasized that established financial practices among high-net-worth individuals rely less on selling appreciating assets and more on using them as collateral. He noted that “it’s not about chasing crazy yields” but about adopting wealth-building methods that have been employed for decades. In traditional markets, this approach is evident in equities, real estate, and even alternative assets such as art and bonds. Owners of these assets do not typically liquidate when they need liquidity. Instead, they secure credit lines against their holdings, thereby maintaining long-term exposure while gaining access to cash. Experts have consistently advised against selling XRP , and applying this strategy to crypto investments can help XRP holders retain their assets while addressing immediate financial needs. This keeps investors positioned for potential future gains while avoiding the disadvantages of selling during periods of volatility or at inopportune times. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Collateralization Works with XRP The concept presented by Demanincor can be summarized as an expansion of established wealth management strategies into digital assets. For example, an individual holding $20,000 in XRP who faces an unexpected $10,000 expense would previously have had little choice but to liquidate part of their position. Under the collateralization model, however, that same investor can borrow against their holdings. This approach preserves exposure to XRP’s future trajectory while also supplying liquidity when needed. A Long-Term Wealth Model for Crypto Investors This approach mirrors strategies long employed by wealthy investors, who borrow against appreciating assets rather than selling them. In traditional finance, it takes the form of margin loans for equities or home equity credit in real estate. With crypto, similar tools now exist for retail investors. Lending XRP to banks or institutions that need it could be a profitable way to earn passive income, and is just one of many methods XRP holders can employ. With the asset’s supply shrinking , XRP’s scarcity could increase its value over time. This makes Demanincor’s approach even more relevant, as collateralizing XRP allows holders to access liquidity while maintaining exposure to potential appreciation, ensuring they benefit from long-term growth rather than selling too early.

This massive wipeout left many traders reeling, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in digital assets. Understanding these sudden market shifts is crucial for anyone involved in crypto, as they often signal broader market movements and potential dangers. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations in Perpetual Futures? When we talk about crypto liquidations , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, typically due to adverse price movements. Perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements. However, this flexibility comes with increased risk, especially when using high leverage. Essentially, if the market moves strongly against a trader’s leveraged bet, the exchange automatically sells off their assets to cover potential losses. This mechanism protects both the exchange and other traders, preventing the account balance from going negative. Consequently, it can be devastating for the individual experiencing the liquidation, often leading to significant capital loss. The Recent $161 Million Crypto Liquidations: Who Was Hit Hardest? The recent 24-hour period saw a staggering $161 million in crypto liquidations across various major cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the impact on some key players: Bitcoin (BTC): Approximately $36.07 million in BTC positions were liquidated. A significant 62.68% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were caught off guard by a downturn. Ethereum (ETH): ETH liquidations were even higher, reaching $97.41 million. Similar to BTC, long positions accounted for a substantial 64.97%, indicating a strong market reversal against bullish bets. Solana (SOL): SOL experienced $27.78 million in liquidations. Interestingly, for SOL, short positions made up 56.48% of the total, suggesting traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed as SOL saw an unexpected upward movement or failed to drop as anticipated. Why Such Sudden Crypto Liquidations Occur? Several factors contribute to these rapid crypto liquidations . Market volatility is, of course, a primary driver. Cryptocurrencies are known for their dramatic price swings, which can quickly erode margin balances on leveraged positions. Other contributing elements include: High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage, magnifying both potential gains and losses. A small price movement can lead to a large percentage loss on the leveraged capital, triggering a liquidation. Market Manipulation or ‘Wick’ Hunts: Sometimes, large players can execute trades designed to push prices briefly to trigger liquidation levels, benefiting from the cascade of forced sales. Unexpected News or Macro Events: Global economic news, regulatory announcements, or even major project updates can cause sudden shifts in market sentiment, leading to rapid price changes and subsequent liquidations. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights to Avoid Crypto Liquidations While crypto liquidations are an inherent risk of leveraged trading, traders can adopt strategies to mitigate their exposure: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, especially in volatile markets. Lower leverage provides a larger buffer against price swings. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close a position if it reaches a predetermined loss level, protecting your capital. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that could influence crypto prices. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of the initial and maintenance margin requirements of your chosen exchange and manage your account balance accordingly. Diversify and Don’t Over-Commit: Avoid putting all your capital into a single highly leveraged position. Diversification and responsible position sizing are key to long-term success. The recent $161 million in crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the high stakes in perpetual futures trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of sudden losses due to leverage and market volatility is ever-present. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters and protect their investments. Stay informed, trade responsibly, and prioritize capital preservation in the dynamic world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. 2. How do crypto liquidations work? Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements of the exchange. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, usually when the market moves significantly against the trader’s bet. 3. Why were long positions liquidated more for BTC and ETH? For BTC and ETH, a higher percentage of long positions were liquidated, indicating that a significant number of traders were betting on price increases. When the market experienced a downturn, these bullish bets were caught off guard, leading to forced closures. 4. Why were short positions liquidated for SOL? For SOL, short positions accounted for a majority of liquidations. This suggests that traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed, possibly due to an unexpected upward price movement or a failure of the price to drop as anticipated, forcing them to close their positions at a loss. 5. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by managing leverage wisely, setting stop-loss orders, monitoring market conditions closely, understanding margin requirements, and diversifying their portfolios to avoid over-commitment to single positions. 6. What is the impact of large-scale crypto liquidations on the market? Large-scale liquidations can exacerbate market volatility, as forced sales can create further downward (or upward) pressure, leading to a cascade effect. They can also indicate a shift in market sentiment or the presence of significant market events. Did this article help you understand the dynamics of crypto liquidations?

Reports confirm that Goldman Sachs now holds an astounding $721 million in spot Ethereum ETFs , marking the largest institutional position recorded to date. This bold move signals a powerful shift in how established financial players view cryptocurrency, particularly Ethereum. Goldman Sachs Leads the Charge in Spot Ethereum ETFs Recent U.S. 13F securities filings, brought to light by Cointelegraph via X, reveal Goldman Sachs’ substantial commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. Their $721 million holding in spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t just a large number; it positions them as the leading institutional investor in this nascent yet rapidly growing sector. This kind of investment from a titan like Goldman Sachs lends immense credibility to Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. For those unfamiliar, 13F filings are mandatory quarterly reports filed by institutional investment managers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings disclose their equity holdings, offering a transparent look into the strategies of major financial entities. The fact that Goldman Sachs’ holdings are now public knowledge underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Why Are Institutions Embracing Spot Ethereum ETFs? The appeal of spot Ethereum ETFs for institutional investors is multi-faceted. These exchange-traded funds offer a regulated and accessible way for large financial firms to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the underlying cryptocurrency. This bypasses many of the operational complexities and regulatory uncertainties associated with direct crypto ownership, such as secure storage, compliance, and direct market access. Key benefits for institutional adoption include: Regulated Access: ETFs operate within established financial frameworks, providing a familiar and compliant investment vehicle. Liquidity: Trading on traditional exchanges offers superior liquidity compared to some direct crypto markets. Diversification: Adding Ethereum exposure allows institutions to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets. Ease of Management: ETFs simplify the investment process, reducing the burden of self-custody and technical challenges. Moreover, the approval and trading of these ETFs signify a growing maturity in the crypto market, providing a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Beyond Goldman Sachs: Other Major Players in Ethereum ETFs While Goldman Sachs holds the top spot, they are certainly not alone in recognizing the potential of spot Ethereum ETFs . Other significant institutional players are also making their mark: Jane Street: This prominent quantitative trading firm holds a notable $190 million in spot Ethereum ETFs. Millennium Management: Another major hedge fund, Millennium Management, has invested $186 million in these same ETFs. These substantial investments from multiple reputable firms highlight a broader trend. It indicates a collective institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the evolving digital landscape. The collective interest from such diverse and influential financial entities suggests that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum, is accelerating. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The significant institutional interest in spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. This influx of capital from major financial institutions can lead to: Increased Liquidity: More institutional money generally means deeper markets and greater trading volumes. Market Validation: Endorsement from firms like Goldman Sachs adds legitimacy and can attract further mainstream investment. Price Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can potentially contribute to greater price stability over time, reducing extreme volatility. Regulatory Clarity: The demand from institutions often pushes regulators towards developing clearer frameworks, which benefits the entire ecosystem. However, it is also important to consider potential challenges, such as increased market correlation with traditional assets and the ongoing need for robust regulatory oversight. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider the inherent volatility of the crypto market. In conclusion, Goldman Sachs’ monumental $721 million investment in spot Ethereum ETFs, alongside other major players, underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This move not only validates Ethereum as a serious investment asset but also accelerates its integration into mainstream finance. The future looks increasingly intertwined for traditional financial powerhouses and the innovative world of digital assets, with spot Ethereum ETFs acting as a crucial bridge.

This significant upward movement captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally. According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading impressively at $112,018.34 on the Binance USDT market. This surge highlights a robust momentum for the world’s leading digital asset. What’s Driving This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Rally? This recent ascent in Bitcoin price is not an isolated event; several factors often contribute to such significant market movements. Investors are closely watching for potential catalysts that fuel this kind of growth. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Increased Institutional Interest: More large financial institutions are showing interest and allocating capital to Bitcoin. This often signals growing mainstream acceptance. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties can sometimes push investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived safe-haven asset, similar to gold. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, especially post-halving events, can create upward price pressure when demand increases. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, improving its utility and scalability, also contribute to positive sentiment. How Does the Current Bitcoin Price Impact the Broader Market? When the Bitcoin price experiences such a strong rally, it often has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s dominance can influence altcoin performance, creating both opportunities and challenges for other digital assets. Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead. Therefore, a sustained rise in BTC can pull other cryptocurrencies upwards. However, it can also lead to capital flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin as investors chase the primary asset’s gains. This dynamic requires careful observation from traders and long-term holders alike. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider with This Bitcoin Price? While the current Bitcoin price action is exciting, it is important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Prices can fluctuate significantly, and rapid gains can be followed by swift corrections. Informed decision-making is key. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Diversifying portfolios and understanding market trends can help mitigate potential risks. Staying updated on market news and expert analysis is also a valuable strategy for navigating these dynamic conditions. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor market news and analysis from reputable sources. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Define your investment strategy clearly. Security: Ensure your holdings are secure in reliable wallets or exchanges. The surge in Bitcoin price above $112,000 marks a significant moment for the crypto world. This impressive rally underscores the growing maturity and appeal of digital assets. While the future remains unpredictable, the current momentum signals strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. As the market continues to evolve, staying engaged and informed will be paramount for all participants.

The BIS said that a third-party currency with sufficient liquidity is critical for efficient cross-border payments. According to him, this aligns directly with XRP’s function in Ripple’s model, which positions the digital asset as a neutral bridge currency capable of reducing reliance on fragmented correspondent banking.

This aligns perfectly with XRP’s role in Ripple’s model as an independent and neutral bridge asset that removes dependence on… pic.twitter.com/YN568Utujl — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 26, 2025 Three Dimensions of Interoperability In the video, the BIS speaker addressed the challenges of making digital currencies “talk to each other,” describing interoperability on three levels. The first involved domestic interoperability, where digital currency solutions must interact with existing systems on shared platforms. Such platforms, the speaker noted, create “huge network externalities” by allowing broader connectivity. The second level concerned cross-border transactions within the same currency. Although this could introduce further operational challenges, XRP can easily play this role. However, it was the cross-currency and cross-border dimension that was described as the most difficult. While XRP can also bridge multiple currencies, the speaker divided the problems into three categories: technology, liquidity, and policy. Technology, Liquidity, and Policy Barriers Technologically, systems rely on different cryptographic frameworks, making communication difficult, with the “messaging element” described as fundamental. Liquidity was identified as more complex, as many currency pairs lack natural demand. This makes an intermediary asset necessary. “You need to go and search for a third-party currency in order to make this settlement actually happen,” he explained. The most difficult barrier is policy, as nations apply divergent rules. While risk-based AML-CFT standards can be coded, principles-based regulations are harder to align. With over one hundred jurisdictions, “110 nations might have 110 different ways of looking at this.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Can XRP Solve This Problem? This focus on liquidity as an indispensable component of interoperability closely mirrors arguments about XRP’s intended utility. Ripple’s model uses XRP as a bridge asset to eliminate the need for multiple correspondent banking relationships. By providing independent liquidity that is not tied to the monetary policy of any one nation, XRP aims to streamline settlement across otherwise fragmented systems. SMQKE emphasized that the BIS framework essentially outlined the very problem XRP was designed to address . His post concluded that the institution’s acknowledgment of liquidity constraints reinforces the relevance of XRP as a neutral, liquid digital asset for efficient global payments.

50796248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80485,1756353643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu — Meme Coin Battle Intensifies Ahead of October 2025 Market Repricing,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-meme-coin-battle-intensifies-ahead/,"The rivalry between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu is entering a decisive phase as October 2025 approaches. Both meme coins are drawing heightened interest from retail traders, while analysts expect broader market repricing to amplify their volatility. Dogecoin is leaning on its status as the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu continues to build out new utilities and community-driven governance. Yet as these two battle for dominance, analysts note that some early investors are already scouting new opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has attracted strong presale inflows and is is widely recognized for being legitimate and audited, is being discussed as a third force that could challenge the established meme coin order in the next cycle. Doge and Shib’s Investor Sentiment Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.213 as of August 2025. Forecasts for October point to a range between $0.239 and $0.274, with an average projection near $0.261. Bullish scenarios, fueled by celebrity endorsements and waves of retail enthusiasm, suggest possible moves to $0.80 or even $2 by the end of the year. Backed by Elon Musk’s public support and a long history of liquidity, DOGE retains an edge as the sector’s legacy asset. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, trades near $0.0000146. Analysts expect October levels to sit between $0.00004899 and $0.00005999, a potential leap tied to ongoing upgrades and DAO-led community development. SHIB’s strength lies in its innovation pipeline and grassroots engagement, though short-term momentum depends heavily on holding key support zones and sustaining trading activity. For SHIB holders, October is shaping up as a critical test of both technical resilience and market confidence. Meme Coin Market Dynamics The meme coin market overall is expanding, with retail traders and viral campaigns driving rapid cycles of price action. Regions such as North America and Asia-Pacific are proving pivotal, where tech-savvy populations and strong cultural momentum fuel adoption. Market watchers also highlight how integrations, celebrity visibility, and regulatory developments could sharply influence meme coin trajectories through Q4 2025. Dogecoin benefits most from cultural recognition and external endorsements, while Shiba Inu’s bet on added utility continues to attract a loyal base. However, the sector remains highly speculative, where momentum can shift overnight based on online trends or macro headlines. Analysts caution that volatility will remain elevated as October’s repricing nears. A Shifting Investor Outlook to This Crypto Presale While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are locked in a tight battle, presale momentum elsewhere is drawing early capital flows. Traders seeking exposure to the next breakout are increasingly turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, citing its strong community traction and exchange-ready positioning. Market analysts argue that the meme coin’s surge of presale demand signals a potential to separate itself from legacy meme plays during the next cycle. This shift in sentiment highlights how meme coin investors often hedge by diversifying across both established names and high-upside entrants. For many, Dogecoin provides short-term liquidity and visibility, Shiba Inu offers longer-term innovation potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a fresh opportunity that could capture the kind of exponential upside seen in earlier meme coin waves. Strategic Outlook Dogecoin appears positioned for stronger near-term moves, particularly if celebrity-driven speculation intensifies into year-end. Shiba Inu is leaning on its innovation roadmap and community strength, which could sustain it if utility upgrades deliver as promised. But analysts stress that crypto presale challengers like MAGACOIN FINANCE should not be overlooked, given the speed with which capital rotates in the meme sector. Ultimately, October 2025’s repricing will be determined by broader market sentiment, the flow of retail money, and unexpected events ranging from policy developments to high-profile endorsements. For investors navigating the meme coin arena, active monitoring and careful positioning in MAGACOIN remain essential.

Expert Predicts $1 Price Target As WLFI prepares to launch, the token will be available for trading on major platforms. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, already offers WLFI futures, which currently price the token at $0.2656, according to Binance’s futures data. The World Liberty Financial presale structure indicates that 20% of the tokens will be liquid, while the remaining 80% will be vested, providing a layered approach to distribution that could mitigate volatility in the early days of trading. Related Reading: Pundit Says Bitcoin Price Crash Is Not Over, Why A Decline Below $100,000 Is Coming Market expert Virtual Bacon recently shared an analysis on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), setting an ambitious price target of $1 for WLFI, which translates to a projected fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion. This could potentially represent a massive 276% from current levels in the futures market if Virtual Bacon’s projections hold true. Furthermore, WLFI would skyrocket to be one of the market’s top performers above established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This prediction highlights the potential market impact of World Liberty Financial, especially in light of the hype surrounding Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, which peaked at a fully diluted valuation of $73 billion 24 hours after its debut. Institutional Interest Surges For World Liberty Financial In contrast to the TRUMP memecoin launched earlier this year, the expert asserts that WLFI is positioned as a legitimate financial instrument, tied to the DeFi platform’s USD1 stablecoin and to US Treasuries. The expert believes that with Trump in office, the World Liberty Financial token carries a sense of credibility and utility that could attract institutional interest therefore boost its demand and price. The recently passed GENIUS Act for stablecoins and signed by President Trump could further increase the platform’s dollar-pegged cryptocurrency and its adoption and contribute to the platform’s overall bullish sentiment.

Additionally, the Nasdaq-listed fintech company ALT5 Sigma has committed $1.5 billion at a price of $0.20 to create the token’s first crypto treasury, similar to how publicly traded companies invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Virtual Bacon concludes by highlighting the launch of World Liberty’s official coin, coupled with institutional backing and a stablecoin aspect linked to crypto treasuries, positions WLFI as one of the most significant token events of the current financial cycle.

According to a Bloomberg report , the firms have partnered with Bluprynt, a fintech startup founded by Chris Brummer, to pilot a new approach that leverages cryptography and blockchain technology. Enhanced Transparency In Stablecoin Market? The pilot program is said to utilize Bluprynt’s technology to trace each token back to its verified issuer, thereby enhancing transparency in the stablecoin market in line with the recent legislations that aim to provide a new regulatory framework for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies . Brummer emphasized that this technology provides “provenance upfront,” which not only simplifies the verification process but also offers essential transparency for regulators and investors alike. He noted that such advancements could significantly mitigate risks associated with counterfeit tokens and impersonation attacks, which have become increasingly prevalent in the digital asset space. Per the report, the introduction of this verification technology could be advantageous for auditors, regulators, and investors, as it addresses the distinct security risks identified by firms like Chainalysis, which highlighted impersonation and fake stablecoins as common threats in a recent report. Mastercard And Circle Launch First Stablecoin Settlement In a related development, Mastercard has announced an expansion of its partnership with Circle to enable the settlement of USDC and EURC transactions for acquirers in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) regions. This initiative marks a milestone, as it is the first time the acquiring ecosystem in these regions will be able to settle transactions using dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. In its press release , Mastercard disclosed that acquiring institutions will be able to receive settlements in fully-reserved stablecoins issued by regulated Circle affiliates. Dimitrios Dosis, president of Mastercard for the EEMEA region, highlighted the strategic importance of this move by stating that the company aims to integrate stablecoins into the mainstream financial landscape. Kash Razzaghi, Chief Business Officer at Circle, echoed these sentiments, asserting that expanding USDC settlement across Mastercard’s extensive network represents a pivotal shift toward borderless, real-time commerce. Additionally, Mastercard is actively exploring broader use cases for regulated stablecoins in areas such as remittances, business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and payouts to gig workers and creators through platforms like Mastercard Move and the Multi-Token Network (MTN). As of this writing, Circle’s recently debuted stock, traded under the ticker symbol CRCL, is selling for $127 per share. For the first three weeks, the firm’s shares traded up, reaching a record high of $298. Since then, the firm’s valuation has dropped by nearly 58%.

Yet, even crypto investors must pay attention to the macro-economic tides, especially when major political shifts threaten global currency stability. The prospect of a Fed Shakeup under a potential future Trump administration is one such seismic event, with far-reaching implications for global markets, particularly for Asia FX and the mighty US Dollar . Understanding these dynamics is crucial, as traditional financial instability can often ripple into the digital asset space, creating both risks and opportunities. What is the Fed Shakeup and Why Does it Matter for the US Dollar? The Federal Reserve, often simply called the Fed, serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include managing monetary policy , maintaining price stability, maximizing employment, and supervising banks. The Fed’s independence from political influence is considered a cornerstone of its effectiveness, allowing it to make decisions based purely on economic data rather than short-term political agendas. However, former President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Fed’s policies, particularly its interest rate decisions. His past rhetoric and actions suggest a potential future administration might seek to exert greater political control over the central bank, possibly pushing for lower interest rates or even attempting to replace key officials with those more aligned with his economic views. This is the essence of a ‘Fed shakeup’ – a significant alteration in the Fed’s leadership, mandate, or operational independence. How Could a Fed Shakeup Impact the US Dollar? Interest Rate Uncertainty: A politically influenced Fed might be pressured to cut rates more aggressively or hold them lower for longer, irrespective of inflation data. Lower rates generally make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, potentially weakening the US Dollar . Loss of Credibility: If the Fed’s independence is perceived to be compromised, its credibility in the eyes of global investors could diminish. This could lead to a flight from dollar-denominated assets, further pressuring the currency. Inflationary Concerns: An overly accommodative monetary policy , driven by political imperatives rather than economic necessity, could spark inflationary pressures. While some inflation is normal, uncontrolled inflation erodes purchasing power and can destabilize an economy, negatively impacting the dollar’s value. The stability of the US Dollar is paramount, as it is the world’s primary reserve currency and the benchmark for global trade and finance. Any significant weakening or increased volatility could have ripple effects across all asset classes, including commodities and even digital assets. How Does Asia FX Respond to US Dollar Volatility and Monetary Policy Shifts? Asian currencies, collectively known as Asia FX , are highly sensitive to movements in the US Dollar and shifts in US monetary policy . This is due to several factors: Trade Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily export-oriented, with the US being a major trading partner. A strong dollar can make Asian exports cheaper for US buyers, but a weak dollar can make them more expensive, affecting trade balances. Capital Flows: When US interest rates rise, capital tends to flow out of emerging markets in Asia and into the US, seeking higher returns. Conversely, lower US rates can encourage capital to flow back into Asia. Dollar-Denominated Debt: Many Asian governments and corporations hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A strengthening dollar makes this debt more expensive to service in local currency terms, increasing financial strain. Reserve Management: Asian central banks hold vast reserves, much of which are in US Dollars. Changes in dollar value impact the value of these reserves. Examples of Asia FX Sensitivity: Historically, periods of US dollar strength or significant Fed policy changes have led to noticeable reactions across Asia FX . For instance, during the ‘taper tantrum’ of 2013, when the Fed signaled a reduction in its bond-buying program, several Asian currencies experienced sharp depreciations as capital fled the region. A potential Fed shakeup could introduce a new layer of uncertainty, leading to increased volatility for currencies like the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, South Korean Won, and the Indian Rupee. Central banks in these regions would likely be forced to intervene in their respective markets to stabilize their currencies, potentially burning through foreign exchange reserves or implementing their own defensive monetary policy adjustments. Table: Potential Impact of US Dollar Scenarios on Asia FX US Dollar Scenario (Post-Fed Shakeup) Potential Impact on Asia FX Example Asia FX Response Significant Weakening (due to lower rates/loss of confidence) Asian currencies may strengthen against the USD, making exports more expensive. However, capital inflows could increase. Japanese Yen (JPY) and Korean Won (KRW) could appreciate, potentially leading to central bank intervention to curb strength. Increased Volatility/Uncertainty (due to unpredictable policy) Wider trading ranges, higher risk premiums for Asian assets, potential for sudden capital outflows. Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and Philippine Peso (PHP) might see sharp, unpredictable swings, requiring active central bank management. Unexpected Strengthening (e.g., if global safe-haven demand overrides policy concerns) Asian currencies would depreciate, increasing dollar-denominated debt burdens and making imports more expensive. Indian Rupee (INR) could face renewed depreciation pressure, as could the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). The Indian Rupee Under Pressure: Unique Vulnerabilities and Monetary Policy Challenges The Indian Rupee (INR) has historically been one of the more vulnerable currencies in Asia FX , often facing pressure during periods of global uncertainty or US dollar strength. This vulnerability stems from several factors unique to India’s economy: Current Account Deficit: India often runs a current account deficit, meaning it imports more than it exports. This creates a structural demand for foreign currency (primarily USD) and puts downward pressure on the Rupee. Oil Imports: India is a major importer of crude oil, which is priced in US Dollars. Rising global oil prices automatically increase the demand for dollars and weigh on the Indian Rupee . Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) Flows: The Indian market is a significant destination for FIIs. However, these flows can be volatile. If global risk sentiment sours or US interest rates become more attractive, FIIs tend to pull money out of India, weakening the Rupee. Inflation: High domestic inflation, if not adequately addressed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through its monetary policy , can erode the Rupee’s value. How a Fed Shakeup Could Intensify Rupee Pressure: A potential Fed shakeup could exacerbate these existing pressures on the Indian Rupee . If the US Dollar experiences significant volatility or an unpredictable trajectory due to altered Fed policies, the RBI would face a complex challenge. For instance, if the dollar weakens substantially, the RBI might be concerned about imported inflation, but if it strengthens unexpectedly, the pressure on India’s current account and external debt servicing would increase dramatically. The RBI’s monetary policy would need to be nimble and proactive, potentially involving interventions in the forex market, adjustments to domestic interest rates, or capital control measures to stabilize the Rupee. This constant balancing act highlights the delicate position of emerging market currencies in the face of major global economic shifts. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Investors and Central Banks The prospect of a Fed Shakeup and its potential ramifications for the US Dollar , Asia FX , and the Indian Rupee demands careful consideration from all market participants. For investors, whether in traditional assets or cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro trends is vital for risk management and identifying opportunities. For Investors: Diversify Portfolios: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with currency volatility. This includes exploring digital assets that may offer a hedge against traditional market instability. Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and Asian central banks (like the RBI). Their forward guidance on monetary policy will offer clues about future currency movements. Hedge Currency Exposure: For those with significant exposure to specific currencies, consider hedging strategies to protect against adverse movements. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of uncertainty, strong economic fundamentals (e.g., low debt, stable growth, robust trade balances) will be key differentiators for national currencies and their underlying economies. For Central Banks in Asia: Strengthen Foreign Exchange Reserves: Maintaining robust foreign exchange reserves provides a buffer against sudden capital outflows and allows for market intervention to stabilize currencies. Coordinate Monetary Policy: While independence is key, regional coordination or at least clear communication among Asian central banks could help manage spillover effects from US policy changes. Prudent Fiscal Management: Governments should aim for sustainable fiscal policies to reduce reliance on external borrowing and strengthen economic resilience against global shocks. Develop Domestic Capital Markets: Deep and liquid domestic capital markets can reduce reliance on foreign capital, making economies less vulnerable to sudden shifts in global investor sentiment. Concluding Thoughts: The Interconnectedness of Global Finance The potential for a Fed Shakeup serves as a potent reminder of the profound interconnectedness of global financial markets. Decisions made in Washington D.C. can send ripples across continents, impacting the value of the US Dollar , influencing Asia FX , and putting specific pressure on currencies like the Indian Rupee . While the future remains uncertain, a proactive and informed approach to understanding these macro-economic forces is essential for investors, policymakers, and indeed, anyone navigating the complex landscape of global finance. The interplay between political rhetoric, central bank independence, and monetary policy will continue to shape currency markets for years to come. Staying informed about these developments is not just about forecasting currency movements; it is about understanding the very fabric of global economic stability.

Investment advisory firms are now the dominant holders of ETH ETFs , signaling a powerful shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a clear indication of growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s potential. Unveiling the Dominant Holders of ETH ETFs Recent analysis by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart reveals a fascinating trend. Investment advisory firms have emerged as the largest holders of ETH ETFs , amassing an impressive $1.35 billion in assets. This substantial figure represents a remarkable 68% increase from the previous quarter, highlighting a rapid acceleration in institutional interest. Trailing behind, hedge funds hold the second position with $690 million. This data underscores a broader narrative: professional money managers are actively integrating Ethereum-backed financial products into their portfolios. Therefore, the landscape of crypto investment is visibly maturing. Why Are These Firms Embracing ETH ETFs? So, what’s driving this significant influx into ETH ETFs ? Several key factors make these regulated products appealing to large investment advisory firms: Regulated Access: ETH ETFs offer a familiar, regulated investment vehicle. This allows traditional firms to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities and custodial challenges of direct crypto ownership. Diversification: For many firms, adding ETH ETFs provides portfolio diversification. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem and smart contract capabilities, offers a unique value proposition distinct from traditional assets. Client Demand: As client interest in cryptocurrencies grows, firms need accessible and compliant ways to meet that demand. ETH ETFs perfectly bridge this gap. Growth Potential: Despite market volatility, Ethereum’s long-term growth prospects, fueled by its role in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3, remain attractive to forward-thinking investors. The Impact of Institutional Adoption on ETH ETFs and Ethereum The increasing institutional embrace of ETH ETFs carries profound implications for both the Ethereum network and the broader crypto market. Firstly, it lends significant credibility to Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. When large, reputable firms allocate substantial capital, it sends a strong signal to other potential investors. Moreover, this institutional validation can lead to increased market liquidity and stability. As more traditional capital flows into ETH ETFs , it can help reduce price volatility and create a more robust trading environment. Ultimately, this integration accelerates the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Navigating the Future: What This Means for Your Portfolio and ETH ETFs For individual investors, this shift offers both opportunities and considerations. The growing presence of investment advisory firms in the ETH ETFs space suggests a more mature and potentially less volatile market. However, it’s crucial to remember that all investments carry risk. Key takeaways for investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market trends and regulatory developments concerning ETH ETFs . Diversify Wisely: Consider how ETH ETFs fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Do Your Due Diligence: Research the specific ETF products and their underlying structures before investing. The journey of Ethereum and its related financial products is still evolving, but this surge in institutional holding marks a pivotal moment. In conclusion, the rise of investment advisory firms as the largest holders of ETH ETFs is a monumental milestone. It signifies a profound maturation of the cryptocurrency market and underscores Ethereum’s growing importance in the global financial landscape. This trend is not merely about asset accumulation; it’s about the mainstreaming of a revolutionary technology, paving the way for a more integrated future between traditional finance and digital assets. The message is clear: institutions are here, and they’re serious about Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are ETH ETFs?

Their withdrawal came after they were reportedly advised to avoid interactions with Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump. Eric Yip Chee-hang, executive director of the HK Securities and Futures Commission, is no longer listed as a keynote speaker. Legislator Johnny Ng Kit-chong, a technology entrepreneur, was also removed from the agenda. Both names had appeared on the site in mid-July, shortly after organisers announced Eric Trump’s participation. Instead of Yip, Clarence Shen, an SFC manager who oversees fintech policy, will represent the regulator at the two-day event. Securities and Futures Commission executive director Eric Yip and lawmaker Johnny Ng have removed themselves from the upcoming Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference featuring US President Donald Trump's son Eric. “There is a request to lawmakers asking them not to attend the forum that… pic.twitter.com/HDxcAWl9pG — Aaron Busch (@tripperhead) August 28, 2025 Absences At Bitcoin Asia Linked To Official Guidance On Crypto Caution Eric Trump is scheduled to appear in Hong Kong on Friday for two sessions titled “All in on Bitcoin” and “Bitcoin Takes Over the World.” He is co-founder of mining venture American Bitcoin and has been involved in World Liberty Financial, a Trump family-backed project focused on digital assets. SCMP reported Wednesday that Ng said his withdrawal was linked to personal matters that clashed with the conference agenda. Meanwhile, the SFC described Yip’s absence as the result of a business trip. Further, the report said officials had been advised to keep a low profile on crypto issues. In particular, they were urged to be cautious when stablecoins and cross-border capital flows are under scrutiny. The guidance came ahead of the conference, which is being held in Hong Kong for the second time since last year as the city continues its push to establish itself as a hub for digital assets. US Tariffs On Hong Kong Imports Add Pressure Amid Escalating Trade Dispute Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the move aimed to avoid perceptions of cooperation with Donald Trump. Further, he noted that the Trump family’s involvement in crypto businesses has previously drawn criticism. In particular, critics argue it blurs the line between personal interests and public roles. Bitcoin Asia, organized by BTC Inc, is one of the largest industry gatherings worldwide. The event attracts investors, miners and policymakers from across the region. The conference comes as Hong Kong balances its ambitions to grow as a digital asset hub with the political realities of strained China-US relations. The timing shows the sensitivity of today’s political climate. Since his return to the White House in January, Donald Trump has placed crypto at the center of his economic agenda. Moreover, he has unveiled new regulations that supporters believe could transform the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” At the same time, his administration has intensified trade tensions. Specifically, Washington has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Hong Kong imports. As a result, the city now sits at the center of the latest phase of the tariff war between the US and China.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-got-a-major-boost-from-china-heres-the-latest/,"Crypto monitoring account WhaleWire reported that Linklogis, a major Chinese financial technology company, has chosen the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to support its supply chain finance platform. The update highlighted that Linklogis operates a trillion-dollar finance ecosystem and is now moving these operations to XRPL, a development described as a significant milestone for XRP. WhaleWire noted that the integration would power real-world assets, cross-border payments, and trade finance through the blockchain infrastructure. Linklogis has positioned itself as one of China’s largest supply chain finance providers, with services that extend across various global markets. By integrating with XRP Ledger, the company seeks to boost the efficiency, transparency, and speed of its financial operations, particularly in areas where cross-border trade requires fast settlements and reliable asset tokenization. BREAKING: $XRP just scored a huge win in China. Linklogis, a fintech powerhouse, is moving its trillion-dollar supply chain finance platform onto the XRP Ledger. Real-world assets, global payments, and trade finance, all powered by XRPL. pic.twitter.com/l0MBzDxWLn — WhaleWire (@WhaleWire) August 26, 2025 Community Responses and Observations Following the announcement, members of the digital asset community offered perspectives on what the move could mean for XRP. A user identified as MCDC25 stated that Linklogis’s platform integration with XRPL could increase transaction activity, resulting in more XRP being burned, which supports its deflationary mechanics. They added that the adoption strengthens XRP’s use in cross-border payments and real-world assets, increases institutional interest, and provides advantages in navigating both regulatory and geopolitical frameworks. Another comment from PF Studio raised the question of how such integration could occur, given China’s restrictions on cryptocurrency. They asked how the partnership was possible under China’s ongoing crypto ban. Clarifications on Regulatory Considerations In response, Ask Perplexity addressed the concern by explaining that China continues to enforce a strict ban on cryptocurrency use within its mainland jurisdiction, including trading, mining, and even personal ownership. Under these laws, XRP cannot be used by individuals or most companies domestically. However, the clarification pointed out that the partnership is not aimed at serving users inside mainland China. Instead, the focus lies on Linklogis’s cross-border operations, which are international in scope. Many of these functions are conducted through overseas subsidiaries or initiatives in regions such as Hong Kong, where the regulatory environment is more open to blockchain technologies. By concentrating on global trade and finance, the partnership avoids direct conflict with China’s domestic restrictions while still leveraging XRPL for international applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Significance of the Partnership Reports from financial and blockchain outlets confirm that Linklogis is using XRPL to tokenize trade receivables, invoices, and other real-world assets, enabling faster settlements and greater efficiency in international trade finance. While most of Linklogis’s operations are domestic, its cross-border business has grown significantly, extending into more than two dozen countries and managing billions in international trade assets annually. The XRPL integration is expected to initially support these cross-border activities, where blockchain technology provides immediate benefits. Industry sources note that XRPL’s established infrastructure, with its low-cost transactions and capacity for tokenization , is well-suited for trade finance and institutional adoption. By choosing XRPL, Linklogis is aligning with a blockchain designed to handle large-scale, real-world financial operations. This partnership also illustrates how companies in highly regulated environments are pursuing blockchain solutions through global channels. Although China maintains its ban on domestic cryptocurrency activities, Linklogis can apply blockchain technology to its international supply chain operations. The development strengthens XRPL’s positioning as a platform for enterprise-grade finance, particularly in the expanding market of tokenized real-world assets .

Ethereum Has Outperformed Bitcoin In Spot ETF Netflows In a new post on X, institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Ethereum spot ETF netflow. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset like ETH without having to directly own the asset. The ETFs trade on traditional platforms, so investors unfamiliar with digital asset wallets and exchanges can just choose to invest into the cryptocurrency through them. This pathway into digital assets is relatively new, with BTC only getting spot ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and ETH in mid-2024. Generally, Bitcoin spot ETFs tend to outpace Ethereum in terms of capital flows, as Bitcoin is the larger asset with more interest behind it. Recently, however, things have been different. As Sentora explains, Interestingly, ETH ETFs have now outperformed BTC ETFs for seven straight days; a trend that may signal growing investor rotation and strengthening relative sentiment toward ETH. That said, while ETH has done better than BTC in this period, it doesn’t mean the coin has enjoyed only inflows. As data from SoSoValue shows, the coin’s ETFs were facing outflows just earlier. Even during the outflows, however, Ethereum spot ETFs were doing better than Bitcoin’s as they were just bleeding to a lesser degree. In the past few days, the netflow has turned positive for the asset, with net inflows of $455 million occurring on Tuesday. Before the recent negative flows, the ETH spot ETFs had been on a weekly net inflow run since May, as is apparent from the chart shared by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode . The streak-breaking week saw a net outflow of around 105,000 ETH ($486 million). It now remains to be seen whether the end of this week would bring back green on this graph. Speaking of weekly figures, another indicator that ETH has recently seen a decline in is the Active Addresses , as Sentora has pointed out in another X post . As displayed in the above chart, Ethereum saw around 3.8 million addresses participating in transaction activity on the blockchain last week. This is down compared to the peak from early August, but still high when lined up against the past bull markets. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $4,600, up more than 7% over the last week.",Ethereum|bitcoin ETFs|ETH|Ethereum ETFs|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 05:00:16

At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $112,0474, reflecting a decline of 7.5% in the past two weeks. The latest movements come as analysts examine on-chain metrics to assess whether the current slowdown represents a pause in the ongoing bull cycle or the beginning of a broader correction. One of the key indicators gaining attention is Bitcoin’s active addresses metric. According to PelinayPA, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the number of active addresses has consistently remained high, suggesting that network usage is stable despite the recent price retracement. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin? Key Developments After Falling To $112,000 Active Address Growth Signals Resilient User Base The analyst notes that long-term data shows a strong correlation between address activity and market cycles, with spikes often coinciding with peaks and declines aligning with bear markets. PelinayPA outlined how active addresses have historically tracked Bitcoin’s broader price behavior. From 2010 through 2016, addresses expanded steadily as Bitcoin’s adoption grew. The 2017 bull run brought a sharp increase, while the 2018–2019 downturn saw a decline in both addresses and price. The most recent cycle again highlighted the relationship, with addresses surging alongside Bitcoin’s run to new highs in 2020–2021 before dropping in 2022 during the market correction. Since 2023, however, activity has stabilized, with daily active addresses consistently ranging between 900,000 and 1 million. As of now, approximately 919,000 addresses are active, reflecting sustained network use. PelinayPA emphasized that while addresses alone are not a perfect price predictor, consistently elevated activity provides long-term support for Bitcoin’s valuation. If addresses maintain levels above 1 million, it could underpin the case for further gains, with potential targets in the $150,000–$200,000 range. Conversely, a sharp decline in address activity would signal reduced demand and raise the likelihood of a reversal toward the $80,000–$90,000 range. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Reach Multi-Year Lows In addition to user activity, exchange inflows offer another perspective on current market conditions. CryptoOnchain, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlighted that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average of inflows has dropped to its lowest level since May 2023. Historically, low exchange inflows suggest reduced selling pressure, as fewer coins are being moved to trading platforms for liquidation. This trend is particularly notable on major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Cost Basis Aligns With Critical Indicator: Support Builds Around $100K Level On Coinbase, a platform often associated with US and institutional investors, inflows have significantly decreased, pointing to diminished selling activity from large holders. A similar pattern is visible on Binance, which continues to host the highest global trading volumes. According to CryptoOnchain, the combination of lower inflows and rising price levels may indicate an environment where available supply is constrained, creating conditions that could support higher valuations in the mid-term.

The Binance Coin (BNB) price just hit $882, supported by a sharp increase in active users crossing 3 million. Meanwhile, OKB jumped 152% in a single week, boosted by a major burn event and the launch of its own Layer-1 chain. Both show strong short-term action, yet they depend on upgrades within their existing ecosystems. BlockDAG, however, is separating itself by delivering results before launch. With 19,000 miners shipped, confirmed CEX listings, and live payouts through mobile mining and referrals, BlockDAG has raised $385 million and sold 25.5 billion coins in its presale. This ability to execute early is what makes it one of the top rated cryptos right now. BlockDAG Isn’t Just a Presale – It’s Already Delivering Most projects make promises about future value, but BlockDAG is already placing working tools in users’ hands before its mainnet launch. To date, more than 19,000 X-Series miners have been shipped, offering tangible proof that its hardware and network are real, not theoretical. On the exchange front, major listings with platforms like MEXC and BitMart are already confirmed, giving BlockDAG a clear path to liquidity and market access once it goes live. What makes BlockDAG stand out even more is its live earning system. Through the X1 mobile miner app, users can generate daily rewards via Proof-of-Engagement. At the same time, its 25% referral structure allows community members to earn instantly, creating an ecosystem where rewards are distributed in real time rather than left as distant promises. The presale data highlights this momentum: $385 million raised, over 25.5 billion coins sold, and an impressive 2,900% ROI since batch 1. Currently priced at $0.03 in batch 30, the project remains well under its $600M hard cap, leaving significant room for growth. Rather than asking participants to wait, BlockDAG is delivering now, shipping miners, confirming exchange deals, and rewarding activity ahead of its chain launch. This combination of action and adoption has positioned it as one of the top rated cryptos for 2025 and beyond, proving that credibility is built on execution, not speculation. Binance Coin Price Eyes $1,000 as Activity Climbs The Binance Coin (BNB) price reached a new high of $882.60, driven by surging usage. Daily active addresses have crossed 3 million, the most since June, showing strong real-world activity is fueling its move. Analysts now see $900 as the next resistance, with $1,000 a realistic target if momentum continues. Key support sits between $740 and $820, providing stability for recent buyers. The steady increase in on-chain activity is an encouraging sign that BNB’s growth has a foundation beyond short-term hype. Even with its strength, BNB’s path forward depends on sustaining this activity. By comparison, BlockDAG’s ability to pay out rewards and ship miners today adds a practical edge, strengthening its position as a top rated crypto. OKB Price Analysis: Burn and New Layer-1 Spark 152% Surge The latest OKB price analysis highlights a 152% weekly surge, driven largely by utility upgrades and a massive burn. OKX recently removed 65 million OKB, worth roughly $7.3 billion, cutting circulating s upply and spurring demand. A second major catalyst is the rollout of X Layer, OKX’s new Layer-1 built on Polygon’s zkEVM. With OKB now serving as the sole gas asset across its wallet, exchange, and payment services, demand pressure has intensified. Trading volume spiked 72%, while market cap rose 24%, reflecting the bullish shift. While this growth is notable, it stems primarily from supply manipulation and ecosystem integration. By contrast, BlockDAG’s rise as a top rated crypto is tied to measurable adoption, with miners shipped, referrals live, and real payouts in place. BlockDAG Sets a Higher Bar for Presales BNB’s rise and OKB’s surge prove how network upgrades and burns can drive attention. Yet both rely on changes within their ecosystems to justify higher valuations. BlockDAG takes a different approach; it’s already delivering. With 19,000 miners shipped, $385 million raised, and over 25.5 billion coins sold, its momentum is clear. Add confirmed exchange listings and real-time user rewards through mining and referrals, and BlockDAG demonstrates why it’s being called a top rated crypto .

The total notional open interest (OI) in ETH futures recently surpassed $10 billion for the first time on record, according to data shared by the exchange with CoinDesk. Early this month, the number of large open interest holders hit a record 101. Notional OI represents the dollar value of the number of active or open contracts at a given time. The CME offers standard contracts sized at 50ETH and micro contracts sized at 0.1 ETH. The large holders are those that hold at least 25 ether contracts open at a given time. The new high in open interest accompanies other record-breaking metrics, including the number of open micro ether contracts, which has exceeded 500,000, and ether notional options open interest topping $1 billion. Ether options OI in contract terms reached a year-to-date high of over 4,800 contracts. ""We're certainly seeing a resurgence and renewed enthusiasm in Ether futures -- especially as it relates to institutional participation. Our Ether futures Large Open Interest Holders (LOIH) hit a record of 101 during the week of August 5. This is a critical indicator for market participants as it signals a strengthening of the institutional and professional ecosystem around ether,"" Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, told CoinDesk in an email. ""As far as broader trends around the surge, increased network activity, corporate treasury accumulation of ether, and positive regulatory developments have further contributed to a broad-based rally around ether and ether-based derivatives,"" Vicioso added. While the ether market is booming, open interest in standard bitcoin (BTC) futures, sized at 5 BTC per contract, remains subdued at 137,300 BTC ($15.3 billion), significantly lower than the December high of 211,000 BTC, according to data source Velo. Ether hit record high Ethereum's native token ether, the second-largest token by market value, has risen 23% this month, hitting lifetime highs above $4,900 at one point, according to CoinDesk data. The U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted $3.69 billion this month, validating the gains in ether prices. The continued inflows extend a four-month streak of positive net investments, according to data from SoSoValue .

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring , BTC has achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring above the $113,000 mark. Specifically, on the Binance USDT market, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $113,065.36. This incredible surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting many to ask: what exactly is fueling this monumental rise? What’s Driving the Bitcoin $113,000 Milestone? Several key factors are contributing to this significant upward momentum, pushing Bitcoin to new heights. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the current market dynamics. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; instead, it reflects a confluence of powerful forces. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, integrating it into their portfolios and services. This growing institutional interest brings substantial capital and legitimacy to the crypto space. Supply Squeeze: The limited supply of Bitcoin, coupled with increased demand, naturally drives prices higher. The recent halving events further reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, intensifying this effect. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties often lead investors to seek safe-haven assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and perceived store-of-value properties, has emerged as a strong contender against traditional assets. Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are also flocking to Bitcoin, fueled by positive news and the desire to participate in its growth. This widespread enthusiasm creates a robust demand environment. These elements combine to create a powerful bullish sentiment, propelling the Bitcoin $113,000 achievement. Understanding the Impact of Bitcoin $113,000 on the Market The achievement of Bitcoin $113,000 sends ripples across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It profoundly influences market sentiment, investor behavior, and even the performance of altcoins. This milestone acts as a psychological benchmark, reinforcing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. When Bitcoin experiences such a significant surge, it often leads to: Increased Market Confidence: A strong Bitcoin performance typically boosts overall market optimism, encouraging more investment across the board. Altcoin Rally Potential: While Bitcoin leads the charge, altcoins often follow suit. As Bitcoin gains, investors may reallocate some profits into other promising cryptocurrencies, leading to an “altcoin season.” Media Attention: Major price movements attract mainstream media attention, which in turn can draw new investors into the market, creating a positive feedback loop. Profit-Taking Opportunities: For early investors, this price point offers a chance to realize substantial gains. However, this can also lead to temporary pullbacks as some decide to sell. Ultimately, the move past Bitcoin $113,000 underscores the digital asset’s growing maturity and its undeniable presence in global finance. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Do After Bitcoin $113,000? While the excitement around Bitcoin $113,000 is palpable, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Therefore, a thoughtful and strategic approach is essential for any investor. Panic buying or selling can lead to significant losses, highlighting the importance of informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this dynamic period: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on headlines. Thoroughly investigate any asset before investing. Understand its technology, use case, and market position. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Your personal financial situation should always guide your investment decisions. Consider Diversification: Spreading your investments across various assets can mitigate risk. While Bitcoin is strong, a balanced portfolio often includes other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Long-Term Perspective: Many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term strategy, focusing on Bitcoin’s potential over years rather than chasing short-term gains. This approach helps weather market fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Knowledge is your best tool in this fast-paced environment. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future results. Make choices that align with your financial goals and risk profile, especially when Bitcoin reaches milestones like Bitcoin $113,000 . The Road Ahead for Bitcoin: Beyond $113,000 As Bitcoin firmly establishes itself above the $113,000 mark, the conversation naturally shifts to what lies ahead. While predicting exact future prices is impossible, we can analyze potential scenarios and influential factors. The journey of Bitcoin $113,000 is a testament to its resilience, yet challenges and opportunities always exist. Potential future developments include: Further Institutional Inflows: Continued adoption by large financial entities could push prices even higher, creating new demand floors. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer global regulations could reduce uncertainty, making Bitcoin more attractive to a broader range of investors. Technological Advancements: Improvements in scalability and security, such as the Lightning Network, enhance Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. Global Economic Shifts: Ongoing inflation concerns or geopolitical events might further solidify Bitcoin’s role as a hedge asset. However, potential headwinds like increased regulatory scrutiny, market corrections, or emerging competitors also remain. The path beyond Bitcoin $113,000 will likely be dynamic, characterized by both growth and periods of consolidation. The recent surge of Bitcoin above $113,000 is more than just a number; it represents a significant moment in the cryptocurrency narrative. It highlights Bitcoin’s growing strength, market acceptance, and its potential to reshape the financial landscape. While the journey ahead will undoubtedly have its ups and downs, this milestone serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its capacity for remarkable growth. Staying informed and approaching the market with a well-thought-out strategy will be key for navigating the exciting times ahead.

A1: The achievement of Bitcoin $113,000 typically signals strong bullish sentiment, often leading to increased investor confidence and potentially sparking rallies in altcoins as capital flows from Bitcoin into other digital assets. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after it reached $113,000? A2: Whether it’s “too late” depends on your individual investment goals and risk tolerance. While the price is high, many believe Bitcoin has long-term growth potential. However, always conduct your own research and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Q3: What factors could cause Bitcoin’s price to drop from $113,000? A3: Potential factors include significant profit-taking by large holders, unexpected regulatory crackdowns, major security breaches in the crypto ecosystem, or adverse macroeconomic shifts that reduce investor appetite for risk assets.

While Ethereum shows potential for a price surge following Trump Media’s $105 million CRO acquisition, another standout is Remittix (RTX) . Focused on fast, low-cost cross-border payments, Remittix is gaining attention for real-world utility. With its presale momentum and upcoming wallet beta, RTX is positioning itself as a top choice for savvy investors in 2025. BlackRock Leads Massive ETH Purchase That Sparks Market Optimism Ethereum is grabbing attention as institutional whales pile in despite recent price dips. BlackRock’s purchase of $323.1 million worth of ETH has sparked optimism, signaling strong confidence in the asset. Even as ETH Price today slipped to $4,420, inflows into Ethereum ETFs reached $28.8 billion, showing institutions view dips as buying opportunities. Fidelity and Grayscale also added millions, reinforcing Ethereum’s growing mainstream appeal. Analysts note that repeated large purchases highlight long-term faith in ETH’s role in DeFi, staking, and tokenized assets. With broader adoption and rising regulation, Ethereum Price Prediction trends point to potential surges. Meanwhile, Bitcoin lags behind but remains steady. This is just a testament to Ethereum’s increasing dominance among institutional investors. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now, Ethereum remains a strong contender. Cronos Price Surges As Trump Media Confirms $105 Million Buy Cronos is surging as Trump Media & Technology Group makes a bold move to integrate CRO into its platforms. The partnership with Crypto.com and Yorkville Acquisition Corp. includes a $105 million initial buy, boosting CRO Price today by 26%. Trump Media plans to back a $6.42 billion CRO treasury, creating the world’s largest digital asset treasury strategy. The collaboration adds CRO rewards to Truth Social and Truth+, while securing 6.3 billion tokens, roughly 19% of the CRO market cap. Analysts highlight this as a game-changing move for CRO Price Prediction and overall adoption. With cash injections, warrants, and equity lines totaling over $5 billion, Cronos gains unique institutional support. The Cronus Price rally contrasts the broader crypto market struggling under downward pressure, marking CRO as one of the best altcoins to watch. Strategic Partnerships Could Accelerate Remittix Adoption Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the best crypto to buy now, drawing attention from investors tired of meme coins and AI tokens that have lost billions. The platform focuses on real-world usability, enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments. Over 622 million tokens were sold at $0.0987 each, raising $21.6 million. This is proof that investors are backing practical solutions. Analysts note that Remittix could replicate XRP’s early adoption success without the regulatory headaches associated with it. The Remittix Wallet will enter beta testing on September 15th, 2025, giving select community members early access. The team currently has several strategic partnerships with banks and payment platforms in the works. These partnerships are set to boost adoption and liquidity. The $20M presale milestone has already unlocked the first centralized exchange listing with BitMart. This upcoming listing will ensure instant access for new investors.

Monday saw $219m in Bitcoin ETF inflows and $444m in Ether ETF inflows, for a total of $663m. This follows weeks of redemptions and turbulence, so maybe sentiment is shifting as investors reposition. Ether ETFs were the big winner, with BlackRock’s ETHA pulling in $314.9m. Fidelity’s FETH added $87.4m, Grayscale’s Ether Mini Trust $53.2m. Bitwise, 21Shares and Invesco rounded out the gains. Only Grayscale’s ETHE saw outflows of $29.1m. Ether ETFs show signs of recovery, posting three consecutive days of inflows. Source: Sosovalue Despite this, daily ether ETF trading topped $3.75 billion, with net assets sitting at $28.8 billion. Bitcoin ETFs posted smaller yet meaningful gains. Fidelity’s FBTC led with $65.6 million, closely followed by BlackRock’s IBIT at $63.4 million and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB at $61.2 million. Additional support came from Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale products. No Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows, and total trading volume was $4.5b with $143.6b in assets. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Points to Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction appears to be turning bullish, as it has begun to reflect institutional support in the ETF flows. BTC is trading near $113,000 after holding support at $111,000. On the 2-hour chart, the asset remains inside a descending channel, but the technicals suggest growing bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI has climbed above 60, indicating strengthening demand, while the MACD has flipped positive with a bullish crossover. Price is now testing the 50-SMA near $111,900, a level that has repeatedly acted as both support and resistance. A clean break above $116,850 would be a key technical milestone, opening the path toward $120,900. Candlestick patterns provide further evidence of accumulation. Long-tailed rejection wicks near $111,000 highlight buying activity, while the absence of bearish engulfing candles suggests waning selling pressure. If higher lows hold above $112,000, the setup strengthens for an extended rally toward $124,500. Institutions Eye Long-Term Upside For traders, the path is clear. Above $116,850 and momentum to $120,900 and $124,500. Below and back to $108,695. Still, the overall structure indicates building volatility that may soon resolve in favor of the bulls. ETF inflows highlight that institutional capital is quietly positioning for a long-term cycle. The narrative of Bitcoin’s eventual march toward six figures—and perhaps even $1 million—remains tied to this steady stream of adoption. With liquidity returning and technicals tightening, Bitcoin could be preparing for its next major leg higher, offering presale investors and long-term holders a market environment rich with opportunity. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $12.1 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012805—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

Prices briefly fell from $0.25 to test $0.23 support on elevated volumes. Despite this, on-chain data shows whales accumulated 680 million DOGE through August, creating a tug-of-war between distribution and accumulation. Futures positioning weakened, with open interest sliding 8% in the aftermath of the transfer, highlighting reduced speculative leverage. Broader meme-coin sentiment remains tied to macro signals, with Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks fueling a temporary sector-wide rally. Price Action Summary From August 27 at 03:00 to August 28 at 02:00, DOGE traded in a tight $0.01 (3%) range, holding around $0.22. Peak institutional participation came at 20:00 GMT on August 27, when DOGE advanced from $0.219 to $0.224 on 1.26 billion volume — nearly 4x the hourly norm. Late in the session (01:20–02:19 GMT on Aug. 28), DOGE rallied from $0.219 lows to $0.224 intraday highs before profit-taking returned it to the $0.220–$0.221 band. Technical Analysis Support : Strong bid interest around $0.219–$0.220 has emerged as the new floor. Resistance : $0.224–$0.225 continues to cap short-term rallies after repeated failures. Momentum : RSI steady in the mid-50s suggests equilibrium rather than trend acceleration. Volume : Institutional spike to 1.26 billion tokens at $0.22 marked accumulation interest, but overall declining activity hints at consolidation. Patterns : Tight trading range indicates compression phase; resolution could set the stage for directional breakout.

This isn’t just a bold claim; it’s a strategic vision that could reshape global finance. Why is US Dollar Dominance Under Pressure? Hayes’ argument stems from a crucial observation: trust in the US dollar has been on a decline since the 2008 financial crisis. This erosion of confidence has led to some significant shifts in global financial behavior. Central Banks Opt for Gold: Many central banks now favor gold over traditional US dollar reserves. Gold is seen as a more reliable store of value during uncertain economic times. Dampened Treasury Demand: Consequently, demand for U.S. Treasurys – traditionally a safe haven for global investors – has weakened. This makes it harder for the U.S. government to finance its debt. The challenge is clear: how can the U.S. restore confidence and attract capital back into its financial system? How Can Stablecoins Reinforce the US Dollar? Arthur Hayes proposes an innovative solution involving stablecoins . He believes Secretary Bessent will leverage these digital assets to attract a new class of investors to U.S. government debt: individual investors. Here’s the core idea: Shifting Investor Focus: Instead of relying on central banks, the strategy would pivot to encourage everyday people to purchase U.S. government debt using stablecoins. Accessibility and Efficiency: Stablecoins offer a more accessible and efficient way for individuals globally to engage with U.S. financial instruments, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. This approach could open up a massive new pool of capital, potentially channeling trillions of dollars into the U.S. Treasury market. Fueling the DeFi Revolution with Stablecoins Hayes’ vision extends beyond just financing government debt; he sees a symbiotic relationship forming between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. This strategy, if implemented, would have profound implications for decentralized finance (DeFi). Consider the potential impact: Trillions into Crypto: By using stablecoins as the conduit, this strategy would inherently pull vast sums of money into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. DeFi Boom: This influx of capital would provide a massive boost to DeFi platforms, increasing liquidity and fostering innovation across decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading. Broader Adoption: It could also significantly accelerate the mainstream adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets, integrating them more deeply into the global financial fabric. This would create a powerful feedback loop, where stablecoins support the dollar, and the dollar’s strength, in turn, fuels the growth of the crypto economy. Navigating the Challenges of This Bold Vision for Stablecoins While Arthur Hayes’ prediction offers an exciting glimpse into the future, implementing such a grand strategy would undoubtedly face significant hurdles. The path to leveraging stablecoins for national fiscal policy is not without its complexities. Key challenges include: Regulatory Frameworks: Establishing clear, comprehensive regulations for stablecoins at a national and international level is paramount. Without this, widespread adoption and trust will be difficult to achieve. Technological Infrastructure: Building the necessary infrastructure to seamlessly connect traditional government debt markets with decentralized stablecoin platforms requires massive investment and coordination. Public and Political Acceptance: Overcoming skepticism from traditional financial institutions, politicians, and the general public about the use of cryptocurrencies in sovereign finance will be a significant undertaking. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards – a strengthened dollar and a booming DeFi sector – make this a concept worth exploring seriously. A Glimpse into a Stablecoin-Powered Future Arthur Hayes’ forecast paints a vivid picture of a future where stablecoins play a pivotal role in global finance. His vision suggests that the US dollar’s dominance, far from fading, could be revitalized through innovative integration with digital assets. This bold strategy, if successfully executed, could not only address the U.S. fiscal deficit but also usher in an unprecedented era of growth for the decentralized finance ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Arthur Hayes’ main prediction regarding stablecoins? Arthur Hayes predicts that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will use stablecoins to encourage individual investors to purchase U.S. government debt, thereby reducing the fiscal deficit and reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. Q2: Why does Hayes believe the US dollar’s dominance is at risk? Hayes argues that declining trust in the dollar since the 2008 financial crisis has led central banks to favor gold and has dampened demand for U.S. Treasurys, posing a threat to the dollar’s traditional strength. Q3: How would stablecoins help reduce the U.S. fiscal deficit? By making U.S. government debt accessible to individual investors globally via stablecoins, the strategy aims to tap into a new, vast pool of capital, helping to finance the deficit more effectively than relying solely on central banks. Q4: What impact would this strategy have on decentralized finance (DeFi)? Hayes projects that this strategy would channel trillions of dollars into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, fueling a significant boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) by increasing liquidity and fostering innovation. Q5: What are the primary challenges to implementing this stablecoin strategy? Key challenges include establishing clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, building robust technological infrastructure to bridge traditional and crypto markets, and gaining broad public and political acceptance for using digital assets in sovereign finance.

Unlike the rapid surges throughout its history, when volatility fueled retail speculation and short-term leverage, this uptrend has been more measured. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent market analyst on X, recently shared a video in which he described the current environment as “the healthiest XRP bull market ever.” He pointed out that leverage has dropped since 2024 with lower highs and argued that this indicates a lack of significant retail-driven speculation. In his view, the continued price appreciation, with XRP marking higher highs over the same period, points to institutional participation as the key factor behind the asset’s momentum. It shows a reduction in speculative trading activity, and this institutional interest has created an environment that supports sustained bullish momentum. Institutions Are ALL IN on #XRP pic.twitter.com/qbnHEWJtfA — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 27, 2025 What to Expect from XRP The distinction Steph draws highlights an important development for XRP. Previous bull cycles often relied heavily on retail enthusiasm and trading activity, which produced rapid expansions in leverage but also swift corrections . By contrast, the present cycle shows evidence of deeper market support. The reduction in leverage activity suggests that the price floor is being maintained without excessive reliance on short-term traders. This has implications for the stability of XRP’s upward trajectory, as institutions generally operate with longer-term horizons and larger capital allocations compared to retail investors. XRP’s 2025 Performance So Far Throughout the year, XRP has continued to post higher highs, reinforcing the case for stronger structural support behind the rally. Most prominent of these was the asset’s climb to an all-time high of $3.65 in July, and the consistent rise since 2024 aligns with the points made by Steph, showing that institutional buying has potentially been a sustaining force. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trading data reflects a liquid market but is less prone to the extreme volatility associated with retail-driven leverage buildups. For many observers, this differentiates the current market from earlier bull phases and shows the influence of various forces in shaping XRP’s valuation. Broader Implications If institutional demand is indeed the core driver, the long-term implications extend beyond just 2025. Institutional buyers typically look for assets with clear utility, regulatory clarity, and liquidity. XRP’s role in cross-border settlements and its positioning within broader financial infrastructure debates align with those criteria, offering a possible explanation for why capital from these players is flowing into the asset at this stage. This would also mean that price action is being reinforced by fundamental drivers rather than speculative cycles alone.

Just as navigating the crypto markets requires a keen eye for reliability and verifiable outcomes, enterprises venturing into AI are encountering a stark challenge: a staggering 95% enterprise AI failure rate for generative AI pilots. This alarming statistic, revealed by MIT’s NANDA initiative, highlights a critical need for solutions that can deliver on AI’s promise without the pervasive issues of unreliability and opacity. Enter Maisa AI, a year-old startup that has just secured a significant $25 million seed round to revolutionize how businesses adopt and trust AI. Why is Enterprise AI Struggling with a 95% Failure Rate? The promise of generative AI to transform business operations has led to widespread experimentation, yet most companies find their pilot projects falling flat. The core issue lies in the nature of current AI systems, which often operate as ‘opaque black boxes.’ This lack of transparency makes it incredibly difficult for organizations to trust AI with critical tasks, leading to high rates of hallucinations and unpredictable outputs. As Maisa AI CEO David Villalón notes, the challenge isn’t just about generating responses, but about ensuring those responses are reliable and auditable. Imagine reviewing ‘three months of work done in five minutes’ and needing to verify its accuracy; the human effort required becomes unfeasible. This fundamental flaw in current enterprise AI deployments is what Maisa AI aims to address head-on, focusing on building systems that are not only intelligent but also accountable. Maisa AI’s Vision: Pioneering Accountable Agentic AI Rather than abandoning AI, the most forward-thinking organizations are now exploring agentic AI systems. These systems are designed to learn, adapt, and be supervised, moving beyond simple response generation to building robust, verifiable processes. Maisa AI’s approach, centered on ‘chain-of-work,’ uses AI to construct the execution process itself, ensuring a structured and auditable pathway to results. This is a significant departure from ‘vibe coding’ platforms, which primarily focus on using AI to build the responses directly. With its new $25 million seed round, Maisa AI has launched Maisa Studio, a model-agnostic, self-serve platform that empowers users to deploy digital workers trainable with natural language. This platform is built on the premise that true enterprise automation demands accountable AI agents, a critical differentiator in a market flooded with less reliable solutions. Beyond Rules: Unlocking Advanced AI Automation with Trust Maisa AI is redefining AI automation by focusing on trustworthiness and accountability. Its proprietary systems, HALP (Human-Augmented LLM Processing) and KPU (Knowledge Processing Unit), are at the heart of this innovation. HALP works like a student at a blackboard, engaging users to understand their needs while the digital workers meticulously outline each step of the process. This interactive method ensures human oversight and clarifies the AI’s intended actions. The KPU is a deterministic system specifically engineered to limit hallucinations, a common pitfall in generative AI. By prioritizing these technical challenges, Maisa AI has developed a solution that resonates deeply with companies needing to apply AI to critical, high-stakes tasks. Clients in sectors like banking, car manufacturing, and energy are already leveraging Maisa AI in production, showcasing its ability to unlock productivity gains without the rigid, predefined rules or extensive manual programming typically associated with traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Furthermore, Maisa AI offers flexible deployment options, including secure cloud or on-premise solutions, catering to diverse enterprise needs. Fueling Growth: Maisa AI’s Strategic Funding and Expansion The $25 million seed round, led by European VC firm Creandum, underscores the market’s confidence in Maisa AI’s unique vision. This substantial investment follows a $5 million pre-seed round last December, which saw participation from San Francisco-based venture firms NFX and Village Global. Notably, U.S. firm Forgepoint Capital International also joined this new round via its European joint venture with Spanish bank Banco Santander, highlighting Maisa AI’s appeal for regulated sectors demanding high levels of security and compliance. With dual headquarters in Valencia and San Francisco, Maisa AI is strategically positioned for global expansion. The company plans to significantly grow its team from 35 to 65 people by the first quarter of 2026 to meet escalating demand. As CEO David Villalón observed regarding the ‘AI framework gold rush,’ a ‘quick start’ can quickly turn into a ‘long nightmare’ without reliability and auditability. Maisa AI aims to differentiate itself from competitors like CrewAI and other workflow automation products by focusing on complex use cases that demand accountability from non-technical users. The startup anticipates rapid growth as it begins serving its waiting list later this year, with Villalón confidently stating, ‘We are going to show the market that there is a company that is delivering what has been promised, and that it’s working.’ The Future of Enterprise AI: Trust and Accountability Maisa AI’s successful funding round and innovative approach mark a pivotal moment in the evolution of enterprise AI . By tackling the critical issue of the 95% AI failure rate with a commitment to accountable, agentic systems, Maisa AI is paving the way for a new era of trust and reliability in artificial intelligence. Their focus on ‘chain-of-work,’ human-augmented processing, and deterministic knowledge units ensures that digital workers can be deployed with confidence, even in the most sensitive and regulated environments. As businesses continue to seek transformative productivity gains, Maisa AI stands ready to deliver on the true promise of AI, ensuring that innovation is matched with verifiable results and unwavering accountability.

The filing was made amid surging interest in crypto ETFs, with Bitcoin and Ethereum products seeing record inflows and trading volumes over the past few months. BNB ETF Race Heats Up REX Shares and Osprey Funds jointly filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a BNB exchange-traded fund (ETF) that incorporates staking yield. The proposed REX-Osprey BNB + Staking ETF will allocate at least 80% of its capital to BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, or gain exposure through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, while the remainder could be invested in other ETFs or exchange-traded products tied to BNB. Staking on the Binance Chain, which uses a proof-of-staked-authority model, is estimated to generate yields of 1.5% to 3% annually for validators. REX-Osprey’s filing with the SEC This product will be different from Osprey Funds’ existing BNB Chain Trust , which was launched in 2024 for accredited investors with a $10,000 minimum investment. While the trust intends to stake all of its BNB, it must still stick to regulatory restrictions that prevent illiquid assets from exceeding 15% of the portfolio. Anchorage Digital Bank has been appointed custodian for the proposed ETF’s BNB, related holdings, and liquid staking tokens. The REX-Osprey filing was made after a similar proposal from VanEck in May of 2025, which was the first attempt to introduce a BNB ETF in the United States. Additionally, the broader market for crypto ETFs has been gaining traction, with Bitcoin ETFs recording monthly inflows between $3 billion and $6 billion in recent months, while Ethereum ETFs saw $5.4 billion of inflows in July and another $3.7 billion so far in August. Trading volumes also surged, with Ethereum ETFs alone generating around $17 billion in trades during mid-August, setting new records according to Bloomberg analysts. Monthly flows for ETH ETFs (Source: SoSoValue ) As interest builds, analysts at Bitfinex suggest that a true rally for altcoins may depend on more approvals of crypto ETFs in the US.

Currently trading around $0.2327, CRO surged nearly 41% after Crypto.com teamed up with Trump Media to establish a crypto treasury company focused on the token. The move, along with the 2025–2026 roadmap titled The Golden Age of On-Chain Dominance , has drawn investor attention. Yet, amid Cronos’ bullish setup, another altcoin is capturing the imagination of traders: Remittix (RTX) . Analysts predict Remittix could deliver 20x–50x returns by January, potentially overtaking Cronos in adoption and market attention. Cronos Shows Short-Term Momentum As the latest news on Cronos shows, CRO has traded in an ascending broadening wedge since the middle of July of 2025. Although the pattern has been profitable in recent times, ascending broadening wedges are not common, and can indicate growing volatility or exhaustion of bullish trends. Analysts see the next target for Cronos around $0.260, a 16% upside from current levels. A strong breakout above this point could bring CRO toward the psychological $0.280 mark, accelerating short-term gains. However, traders monitoring Cronos latest news note that the wedge pattern may also indicate heightened risk for a sudden retracement, suggesting careful positioning is necessary. source: TradingView Crypto experts also point to CRO’s limited ecosystem activity beyond the Crypto.com platform. Although the Trump Media partnership brings in visibility, wider adoption is important in ensuring long-term growth. Investors are considering this along with other promising altcoins, especially those with practicality and application in the real world. Remittix Gains Momentum Among Early Investors While Cronos maintains its market presence, Remittix is capturing attention with strong investor backing and ambitious infrastructure plans. The project has sold over 623 million tokens at $0.0987 each, raising more than $21.6 million. Its first CEX listing on BitMart has been announced, with the live listing expected soon. The next listing milestone is projected to be reached once the project raises $22 million. Additionally, Remittix is preparing to launch its Beta Wallet on September 15, 2025, providing seamless PayFi solutions for crypto-to-fiat transfers. Analysts and investors suggest Remittix is the fastest-growing altcoin of 2025–2026, offering 20x–50x potential returns for early adopters. The token’s real-world utility, combined with a growing investor base, positions it as a credible contender to rival even established projects like Cronos. Why Investors Are Turning To Remittix High-Growth Potential – Analysts project up to 50x returns within months. Real-World Use Case – Remittix focuses on bridging crypto to fiat payments. Strong Investor Confidence – Over 623 million tokens sold to date signals demand. CEX Listing on BitMart – Increases liquidity and market visibility. Beta Wallet Launch – Scheduled for September 15, 2025, making transactions fast and secure. Conclusion Cronos latest news shows CRO gaining traction thanks to partnerships and its roadmap, but structural chart patterns and limited ecosystem activity suggest risks remain. Meanwhile, Remittix is positioned for explosive growth with its BitMart CEX listing, Beta Wallet launch, and strong investor support. With predictions ranging from 20x to 50x by January , Remittix could emerge as a dominant altcoin, potentially rivaling or even surpassing Cronos in market impact.

However, an analyst suggested that the cryptocurrency risks a new retest of the range lows before bullish momentum continues. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Key Support As SEC Delays ETF Decision – Is An October Rally Brewing? XRP’s Daily Close Key For Momentum XRP has reclaimed a crucial level as support while the crypto market stabilizes from this week’s market downturn. The altcoin has been trading sideways over the past week, hovering between $2.85-$3.10 range. The cryptocurrency retested the range lows, holding the lower boundary as support during the recent market volatility. Now, the price surged 7% from Monday’s lows to the $3.08 area before retracing to the $3.00 mark. On Wednesday, analyst Ali Martinez noted that XRP was rejected from local resistance, around the $3.10 area, for the third time, which could signal a new correction to the range lows similar to the previous attempts. If the altcoin fails to hold the current level as support and loses the mid-range area, its price could drop to $2.83, risking a fall below the local range and a deeper correction. On the contrary, if bullish momentum continues and the cryptocurrency breaks out of the crucial resistance, its price could rally to the August high levels, between $3.20-$3.40. Similarly, analyst Cryptoinsightuk noted that XRP had a positive daily close, adding that the “RSI crossed bullish and even throughout this pullback we’ve seen no change in structure.” Nonetheless, he suggested that the cryptocurrency needs to continue its momentum with a second day of follow-through price actions and trading volume. The market watcher asserted that a daily close above the $3.14 area will set up the stage for a rally to the $3.40 resistance in the coming weeks. Is A 2017-Like Rally Coming? After its July rally to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $3.65, the altcoin has been consolidating within a bullish pennant, with price compressing between the pattern’s resistance and support levels. Analyst GalaxyBTC also noted that XRP has been compressing between two parallel levels, repeating its 2017 playbook. Previously, the cryptocurrency hovered between the previous ATH level and the rally breakout level, which was turned into support. Following a consolidation period, the cryptocurrency broke out of this range and recorded a massive rally to its 2018 ATH. This time, XRP turned the $1.70 area into support last November and has been consolidating between this level and the previous ATH for the past eight months, which could suggest that the rally isn’t over yet. If history repeats, a massive breakout will follow once the altcoin breaks out of the previous ATH resistance and turns it into support. Related Reading: Chainlink Ready For Massive Breakout? A 15% Drop May Come First Moreover, the analyst highlighted a key level in XRP’s trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC), explaining that the 0.00003014 area has been a resistance in the XRP/BTC chart over the past six years. While the XRP/BTC pair continues to near this resistance, the market watcher considers that “the timing is perfect, as breaking out will put us well into price discovery on the USD pair.” As of this writing, XRP is trading at $3.02, a 3.3% increase in the weekly timeframe.

50800651,567156,1756360837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50800651.jpeg,Hong Kong Officials Pull Out Of Bitcoin Asia 2025 Despite Crypto Push – Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-officials-pull-out-of-bitcoin-asia-2025/,"Recent reports claim that two Hong Kong officials have withdrawn from the upcoming Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference to allegedly avoid interacting with Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump. HK Officials Withdraw From Bitcoin Asia 2025 On Wednesday, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that senior Hong Kong official Eric Yip Chee-hang and lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong pulled out of the highly anticipated Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference, set to take place at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on August 28 and 29. The report noted that Yip, executive director of the city’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Ng, a legislator and technology entrepreneur, were removed from the list of keynote speakers for the conference. According to the report, archived versions of Bitcoin Asia 2025’s website show that both officials were listed on July 14, days after the announcement of Eric Trump’s participation in the forum. As reported by Bitcoinist, the event organizers announced Trump’s participation on July 8. The American businessman is set to speak about Bitcoin’s long-term potential, the implications for global finance, and the role of Asia in shaping the future of BTC adoption A Source familiar with the matter told SCMP that the lawmakers were requested not to attend the conference, as it featured Trump’s middle son. A second anonymous source confirmed the information, explaining that it was “advised” to the lawmakers. Meanwhile, Ng stated that he withdrew from the event due to “family issues” that overlap with Bitcoin Asia 2025’s agenda, while the SFC affirmed that Yip would not be in attendance due to a business trip. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told the news media outlet that the reason was to “avoid any public impression that Hong Kong was cooperating with or flattering Donald Trump.” “Under the intense China-US relations, it is only natural to avoid any impression that Hong Kong is doing something that is helping or pleasing the US,” Lau detailed. It’s worth noting that President Trump recently announced a 90-day trade tariff war truce with China, but has threatened that the nation could face “200 per cent tariffs, or something,” if it doesn’t continue to ensure shipments of permanent magnets containing certain minerals reach the US. Hong Kong Crypto Landscape A source close to the city’s regulators reportedly said that officials had been advised to “maintain a low profile on cryptocurrency and stablecoins,” the report affirmed, but noted that Clarence Shen, an SFC manager responsible for fintech policy formulation, will still attend as one of the event’s speakers. Notably, Hong Kong has been working to establish itself as one of the leading crypto hubs worldwide, advancing crucial legislation to regulate the sector. Amid the global push for stablecoins, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed the Stablecoin Ordinance in May, which was enacted on August 1. In June, regulators also released the “Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong,” outlining their plans to enhance the industry. Nonetheless, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has advised against excessive speculation and warned that caution is recommended amid the growing interest in the stablecoins sector. In a July blog post, HKMA’s CEO, Eddie Yue, affirmed there has been excessive hype in the market and public opinion, raising concerns over a developing trend toward speculation as the market has become “overly enthusiastic” with the “stablecoin craze.” The warning comes as the financial regulator attempts to implement its phased plan to ensure balanced growth and innovation, with regulation and customer protections.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Asia 2025|btc|BTCUSDT|Eric Trump|hkma|hong kong|Hong Kong authorities|Hong Kong Stablecoins|SFC|Stablecoin Legislation,EN,0,0,ASIA|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 06:00:37

Is Something Big Coming for XRP?,https://timestabloid.com/upholds-recent-riddle-stuns-xrp-army-is-something-big-coming-for-xrp/,"Crypto exchange Uphold recently published a cryptic message on X. The post contained only three sets of binary code: “01011000 01010010 01010000.” The brief sequence quickly caught the XRP community’s attention, leaving many to question whether Uphold was signaling something significant for XRP. Uphold, being a platform known for its strong support of XRP , added a point to the intrigue. With speculation already common in the digital asset space, the absence of an explanation only deepened curiosity. 01011000 01010010 01010000 — Uphold (@UpholdInc) August 27, 2025 XRP In the Picture: Decoding the Cryptic Message It did not take long for community members to translate the code. By converting the binary numbers into ASCII characters, they unveiled Uphold’s secret message. Breaking it down, the first set, “01011000”, corresponds to the letter X, “01010010” translates to R, and “01010000” becomes P. Taken together, the code spells “XRP,” the digital asset that Uphold has supported for years. This explanation quickly spread across the comments. This message suggests that the exchange could be preparing something centered on XRP. Hinting at a Bigger Development Uphold’s message can be compared to recent activity from Gemini, another major exchange. Gemini also shared a cryptic teaser involving XRP , hiding the letters inside a sentence but highlighting them to make the message clear. The hint eventually led to the release of an XRP credit card powered by Mastercard and issued by WebBank. That product has since gained notable popularity among users who favor XRP as a payment option. Against that backdrop, Uphold’s decision to publish a binary-coded message specifically referencing XRP suggests that the exchange is teasing something big for the digital asset and might be preparing to unveil a new service or product. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Speculation Over What Comes Next Uphold has not yet provided further details about the post or clarified whether it points to an upcoming launch. However, its history with XRP and the timing of the message have led many to believe that something meaningful could be on the horizon. While no official announcement has followed, this post has left ample room for speculation. For a company that has consistently emphasized support for XRP, such a cryptic reference may hide an interesting purpose. Whether Uphold is preparing a new product, service, or partnership remains unconfirmed. What is clear is that the post has successfully captured the interest of the XRP community.

His latest Arthur Hayes crypto predictions suggest a monumental upside for two promising altcoins: Ether.fi (ETHFI) and Ethena (ENA). These forecasts are not merely speculative; they are deeply rooted in the rapidly expanding real-world utility of stablecoins. Investors are now keenly observing how these projects might reshape the digital asset landscape. What Fuels Arthur Hayes’ Crypto Predictions for ETHFI? Arthur Hayes sees a transformative future for Ether.fi (ETHFI), projecting an astounding 34-fold increase in its value. This optimistic outlook hinges on the global commercialization of Ether.fi’s innovative Visa-linked credit card, known as Ether.fi Cash. Ether.fi Cash Potential: Imagine a credit card that seamlessly integrates your crypto assets into everyday spending. Ether.fi Cash aims to do just that, potentially revolutionizing how users interact with their digital holdings. Deposit-Based Revenue: The core of Hayes’ prediction lies in Ether.fi’s deposit-based revenue model. As more users adopt Ether.fi Cash for transactions, the platform’s deposits grow, directly boosting its revenue and, consequently, the value of the ETHFI token. Global Reach: If this Visa-linked solution achieves widespread global adoption, its impact on ETHFI’s price could be truly significant. It represents a tangible bridge between decentralized finance and traditional commerce. These Arthur Hayes crypto predictions highlight the power of practical applications in driving token value. How Do Arthur Hayes’ Crypto Predictions See ENA Soaring? Ethena (ENA) also features prominently in Hayes’ forecasts, with a projected 51-fold increase. This impressive target is tied to the success and expansion of Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, and its unique operational strategy. USDe’s Derivatives Arbitrage: USDe is gaining market share rapidly through a sophisticated derivatives arbitrage structure. This involves balancing long spot positions with short futures positions to maintain its peg to the US dollar while generating yield. Market Share Growth: Hayes anticipates that USDe’s market share could grow substantially, potentially reaching 25% of the stablecoin market. Such growth would solidify Ethena’s position as a major player. ENA’s Value Proposition: As USDe’s adoption expands and its yield generation mechanism proves robust, the demand and utility for the ENA token are expected to surge, driving its price upwards dramatically. The innovative design behind USDe is a key factor in these ambitious Arthur Hayes crypto predictions . Why Are Stablecoins Key to These Arthur Hayes Crypto Predictions? At the heart of Arthur Hayes’ bullish stance for both ETHFI and ENA is the increasing adoption of stablecoins. These digital assets, pegged to stable references like the US dollar, are proving to be much more than just trading tools. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: Stablecoins act as a crucial bridge, allowing users to navigate between the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the stability of fiat currencies. Emerging Market Impact: Hayes emphasizes their growing importance in emerging markets. Here, stablecoins offer a stable alternative to often volatile local currencies, facilitating remittances, cross-border payments, and a hedge against inflation. Fueling Ecosystem Growth: As stablecoins become more integrated into daily financial activities, the demand for underlying protocols and tokens that facilitate their use, like Ether.fi and Ethena, naturally increases. This broader adoption underpins the entire market. Understanding this fundamental shift is vital when considering Arthur Hayes crypto predictions . Navigating the Potential: What Should Investors Consider? While Arthur Hayes’ predictions are incredibly exciting, it is crucial for investors to approach such high-growth potential with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and significant upside often comes with commensurate risks. Market Volatility: Even promising projects can experience substantial price fluctuations. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for stablecoins and decentralized finance could impact these projects. Competition: The crypto space is highly competitive, with new innovations constantly emerging. Therefore, thorough research, diversification, and a clear understanding of personal risk tolerance remain paramount. Hayes’ insights provide a compelling narrative, but individual due diligence is always recommended before making investment decisions based on these Arthur Hayes crypto predictions . Arthur Hayes, a prominent voice in the crypto space, has once again captured attention with his remarkable Arthur Hayes crypto predictions for Ether.fi (ETHFI) and Ethena (ENA). His vision connects the burgeoning utility of stablecoins, particularly in global commerce and emerging economies, directly to the explosive growth potential of these specific tokens. While the future remains unpredictable, Hayes’ analysis offers a compelling glimpse into how real-world adoption could drive the next wave of innovation and value creation in the digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Arthur Hayes’ specific predictions for ETHFI and ENA? Arthur Hayes predicts a potential 34x upside for Ether.fi (ETHFI) if its Visa-linked credit card, Ether.fi Cash, achieves global commercialization. For Ethena (ENA), he forecasts a 51x increase, driven by its USDe stablecoin gaining a 25% market share through its derivatives arbitrage strategy. What is Ether.fi Cash and how does it relate to ETHFI’s potential? Ether.fi Cash is a Visa-linked credit card that aims to integrate crypto assets into everyday spending. Its global commercialization would significantly increase Ether.fi’s deposit-based revenue, which Hayes believes will directly propel the ETHFI token’s value. How does Ethena’s USDe stablecoin work? Ethena’s USDe is a synthetic dollar stablecoin that maintains its peg and generates yield through a derivatives arbitrage strategy. This involves holding long spot positions in crypto assets while simultaneously shorting futures contracts to hedge against price fluctuations. Why does Arthur Hayes believe stablecoins are crucial for these predictions? Hayes highlights stablecoins’ growing role in real-world use, especially in emerging markets. They offer stability for payments, remittances, and as a hedge against local currency inflation, thereby increasing demand and utility for projects like Ether.fi and Ethena that leverage stablecoin ecosystems. Are there risks associated with these high-upside predictions? Yes, like all cryptocurrency investments, ETHFI and ENA carry inherent risks. These include market volatility, potential regulatory changes, and intense competition within the decentralized finance space. Investors should conduct their own research and understand these risks.

Key Takeaways: Webull has launched crypto trading in Australia via Coinbase Prime, offering access to 240 digital assets with a competitive 30bps spread. The move is expected to pressure local exchanges to lower fees amid growing competition. Webull’s integration with traditional account types and advanced trading tools positions it as a low-cost alternative. The rollout marks the platform’s third crypto market globally, after the U.S. and Brazil, the firm said in a Wednesday press release . The Australian launch includes a 30-basis-point spread, which Webull claims makes it one of the lowest-cost crypto trading options in the country. Webull Launch Sparks Fee War Among Aussie Crypto Exchanges Analysts expect the move to pressure local exchanges to reduce fees or risk losing market share in an already competitive environment. “Crypto trading is the next phase of our mission to provide Australians with the freedom to trade what they want, when they want,” said Rob Talevski, CEO of Webull Securities Australia, in a statement on Wednesday. The offering is integrated across individual accounts, SMSFs, trusts, and company structures, placing crypto within traditional investment frameworks and allowing retail users to manage digital assets alongside equities and ETFs. The platform also includes premium charting tools, over 40 technical indicators, and 24/7 customer support. The launch comes days after Webull resumed crypto trading in the U.S. , following a temporary suspension during its 2023 public listing process. Crypto is officially here!

Webull’s Australian crypto service runs on Coinbase Prime’s infrastructure, offering institutional-grade custody, real-time market data, and trade execution. The move reinforces Coinbase’s ongoing push into global B2B partnerships. With more international rollouts expected later this year, Webull is positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to Australia’s established crypto exchanges, many of which have faced criticism for high fees and limited service features. ASIC Shuts Down 14,000 Scam Sites Australia’s securities regulator ASIC has taken down over 14,000 scam and phishing websites since July 2023, with crypto-related fraud accounting for 20% of the removals. The agency now targets 130 new malicious sites each week, including deceptive social media ads and AI-powered schemes promising passive crypto income. ASIC’s January–July 2025 enforcement update highlights evolving scam tactics, including cloaking, fake celebrity endorsements, and “AI washing.” The regulator has launched 345 new investigations, imposed $57.5 million in civil penalties, and wound up 95 companies tied to international pig butchering schemes , following $35.8 million in losses reported by victims in 14 countries. Despite scam losses falling from 2022’s $3.1 billion peak, Australians lost $945 million to investment scams in 2024, making it the country’s most damaging fraud category. ASIC’s wider enforcement has also targeted greenwashing, misconduct in superannuation funds, and unlicensed operators, including the prosecution of Mormarkets director Brendan Gunn for handling suspected scam proceeds.

Peterson argued that keeping interest rates at current levels would not solve structural problems but would instead make the economy suffer even more. According to Peterson, the Leading Economic Index (LEI) has declined by 5% or more before every recession in the last 50 years, and the Fed has cut interest rates each time. However, despite the LEI experiencing a historic decline between 2022 and 2025, the Fed has still not cut interest rates. The analyst described this as anomalous, stating, “There's a recession this cycle, but the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) hasn't officially declared it.” Peterson stated that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused disruptions in global trade and supply chains, creating supply shocks for energy, food, and critical minerals. The analyst emphasized that these structural problems cannot be solved by high interest rates, commenting, “As long as interest rates remain high, growth will slow further, unemployment will rise, and consumption will be suppressed.” Related News: Major Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Reveals What He Expects Following the Recent Drop in BTC Price Peterson, claiming that the Fed's fight against inflation will fail, said, “The root cause of inflation is supply constraints. The Fed's tools cannot solve this problem. Furthermore, consumers are in debt, income growth is slow, and food prices remain high.” The analyst also said stock markets weren't as strong as expected. “The majority of the rise in the S&P 500 is coming from just a few tech companies,” Peterson said. “This suggests it's not a broad-based rally.” Peterson argued that in current conditions, investors should turn to what he describes as “hard assets” to protect their portfolios: “The Fed can't fix structural problems. Global supply chains are broken, the government is overspending. Inflation is inevitable. Gold and Bitcoin must be at the core of your portfolio if you want to survive.” *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-bitcoin-bull-market-cycle-coming-to-an-end-analysts-weigh-in/,"“The old money flow cycle is breaking,” crypto trader ‘Koroush AK’ told his 376,000 X followers on Wednesday, referring to the previous pattern of money rotating from Bitcoin to Ether and then to altcoins. “Now we have to navigate isolated mini-cycles where only some sectors pump while others get left behind,” he added . The flow from BTC to ETH is the same, but now “sectors only pump when money and attention overlap,” he said before adding, “If either one is missing, that sector gets skipped.” He used Chainlink (LINK) as an example of a token that pumped from Ether’s run instead of Uniswap (UNI), which was largely ignored. What About The 4 Year Cycle? If this theory is accurate, it could also change the four-year cycle, which has traditionally been anchored around Bitcoin halving events. Earlier this week, analyst James Check opined that “Bitcoin has experienced three cycles, and they are not anchored around the halvings,” adding that they are anchored around the “trends in adoption and market structure,” with the market’s 2017 peak and 2022 bottom being the transition points. He said that there have been three cycles so far: an “adoption cycle” from 2011 to 2018, an “adolescence cycle” from 2018 to 2022, and the current “maturity cycle,” which is driven by “institutional maturity and stability.” Hedge fund veteran “PlanC” said on Thursday that there is a “99% chance stock-to-flow breaks this cycle, and a 50/50 chance the 4-year cycle breaks.” Meanwhile, trader Bob Loukas said it was hard to see which way things would go. “Either the 4-year cycle has already topped and we’re in heavy distribution as buyers eventually exhaust… or we’re just weeks away from start of blow-off phase, a fast doubling (or more) over 3-6 months.” Earlier this month, Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan said that gains are likely to continue into 2026, “so let’s say this: I think the 4-year cycle is over.” Slumptember Ahead? Glassnode also said that Bitcoin was still tracking its traditional patterns but added this week that recent profit taking and elevated selling pressure “suggests the market has entered a late phase of the cycle.” In previous ones, crypto markets pulled back heavily in the September of the bull market year before recovering and shifting to new highs at the end of the year. If history rhymes, this could be on the cards next month. In past cycles, Bitcoin marked a major low in September and then rallied for 2-3 months in Q4. pic.twitter.com/Vw5h9uPk4z — apsk32 (@apsk32) August 27, 2025 Whether the cycle is about to peak or will extend into 2026 remains to be seen, but more voices are favoring the latter due to the heavy institutional participation in crypto markets, which was not seen in previous cycles.

Analyst Explains What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-whales-are-selling-heavily-analyst-explains-what-it-means/,"Maartunn (@JA_Maartun), a prominent market analyst, has highlighted recent selling activity among XRP’s largest holders. Sharing a chart of whale flows, he remarked that “XRP Whales are selling heavily,” pointing to what he views as a clear distribution supported by on-chain data. The chart he shared shows the moving average of whale flows, splitting into positive inflows and negative outflows. Over the past several months, the red bars indicating negative whale flows have grown significantly, reflecting net selling from high-value wallets. This activity coincides with a notable rise and subsequent cooling in XRP’s price, signaling that whales may be offloading their holdings during periods of strength, with some also trying to short the asset’s price recently . XRP Whales are selling heavily It's clear distribution. On-chain data tells the story. In data, we trust. pic.twitter.com/MoMk1Fx4Lg — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 27, 2025 Data Shows Cycles of Accumulation and Distribution The chart covers data from 2022 through 2025, illustrating how whale behavior has changed over time. Periods of accumulation, marked by green bars, were often followed by upward price movements; however, the most recent data points toward sustained selling. In early 2025, XRP’s price spiked considerably, with whale inflows appearing briefly in the green. That phase was quickly overtaken by a sharp and extended period of outflows, aligning with the analyst’s view of heavy selling. The consistency of these negative flows suggests that large holders were systematically reducing their exposure rather than engaging in short-term trading. The asset experienced a notable shift in May and June, when whales resumed their accumulation ; however, the phase did not last long. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart shows a shift in July and August, with XRP’s rise to a new all-time high coinciding with massive outflows. These sell-offs likely contributed to XRP’s loss of crucial support in early August . Implications for XRP’s Market Structure XRP has long been influenced by the behavior of its largest wallets, given the concentration of supply among major holders. Heavy distribution raises questions about the sustainability of recent price levels. When whales move in unison, their actions often set the tone for broader market participants, particularly retail investors who may follow the market’s momentum. Whales have a dominant position in the XRP market . While demand-side factors, such as institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, play a role, supply-side actions from whales can create downward pressure. Sustained outflows may weigh on price recovery efforts unless matched by new inflows from buyers outside this group of whales.

At the same time, large holders are shifting focus toward Cardano and MAGACOIN FINANCE, both touted as higher-upside plays in the current market. Ethereum Corrects to Below $4,200 Ethereum (ETH) slipped under the $4,200 mark, briefly touching $4,190 before stabilizing. The dip comes after a strong rally earlier this month, leaving traders watching if the asset can reclaim higher ground or extend its pullback. For now, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but whales appear to be rebalancing into altcoins where upside is perceived to be larger. With Bitcoin already near its peak levels, the spotlight is turning to projects like Cardano and newer entrants such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano Drops 8% But Long-Term Story Remains Cardano (ADA) fell 8.01% in the last 24 hours, a worse performance than the broader market’s 2.78% decline. Despite the short-term weakness, the network just approved a $71 million development plan funded directly through its on-chain treasury — a governance first. The plan will deliver upgrades such as Ouroboros Leios, Hydra scaling, Mithril syncing, and Nested Transactions. Founder Charles Hoskinson has also made bullish statements, saying ADA could achieve up to 1,000x returns, far outpacing Bitcoin. He argues that ADA’s market cap leaves room for exponential expansion, while Bitcoin’s upside is already capped by its size. This view has divided the community, but it highlights why some whales are still betting on Cardano’s long-term trajectory. Whales Target 30x in MAGACOIN FINANCE Alongside ADA, MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted attention as a next-generation altcoin blending meme appeal with serious DeFi use cases. Analysts have already projected up to 30x upside, with smart money reportedly positioning early. The project has been audited, maintains transparent tokenomics, and is gaining traction as one of 2025’s most watched tokens. Whales appear to be treating it as a hedge against slower assets, with growing activity pointing toward a fast-closing entry window. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year , MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. What Traders Should Watch Ethereum’s slip under $4,200 has widened interest in altcoins, especially Cardano and MAGACOIN FINANCE, where whales see larger room for returns. Traders tracking this shift may want to explore these projects now, while the cycle is still developing.

With transparent data and professional risk control, we ensure a secure and convenient trading environment, empowering investors to capitalize on diversified opportunities across all market cycles. Over the past week (August 18–25), the crypto market’s momentum continued, with some emerging sectors surging and steadily lifting investor sentiment. HTX data shows that several tokens posted impressive gains. DONKEY from the BSC meme sector was the undisputed star, soaring 270% over the week and achieving a staggering 1,990% cumulative increase over 30 days. Meanwhile, DeSci newcomer BIO emerged as a “research superstar”, while blue-chip assets such as ETH and AAVE quietly rose. The entire market became a stage for both short-term frenzy and long-term stability. Meme Coins Remain in the Spotlight: DONKEY and MEME Take Flight The meme coin sector has long acted as a barometer of market sentiment in the past. With the “light narrative + strong community” model gaining traction, high volatility and popularity in meme coins are expected to continue presenting trading opportunities in the second half of the year. ● DONKEY (BSC Memecoin) : The week’s top performer, surging 270% over the week and nearly 1,990% over 30 days, making it the most impressive dark horse. Its rise is fueled by the hyper-active BSC on-chain community, coupled with market sentiment and the ever-growing cultural narrative around memes. ● MEME : A veteran meme coin, up 104% over the week. MEME is the native ecosystem token of Memeland, a Web3 creative studio founded by 9GAG, the globally popular meme platform. It has inherent meme DNA and a massive traditional internet user base. Emerging Sectors: DeSci and GameFi Stand Out Beyond the meme coin frenzy, two emerging sectors deserve particular attention this week. ● BIO (DeSci): Up 240% this week, a true dark horse. The DeSci (Decentralized Science) sector has been gaining global traction in recent years by integrating scientific research with blockchains. BIO’s strong performance reflects both market enthusiasm for innovative narratives and DeSci’s potential in real-world adoption. ● XTER (GameFi): Up 134% this week. GameFi is reviving after a period of dormancy. With ongoing improvements in user experience and tokenomics, capital is flowing back into high-quality GameFi projects. XTER’s performance suggests that the GameFi sector may be gearing up for its next growth cycle. Traditional Blue Chips: L1s and DeFi Rise Steadily Compared with the explosive rallies in meme coins and emerging narratives, blue-chip assets have maintained a stable upward trajectory. ● QTUM (L1): Up 57% this week. Qtum Blockchain (shortened as “Qtum”) is dedicated to developing a third blockchain ecosystem beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a long-established public blockchain project, QTUM continues to unlock its potential through renewed on-chain activity and ecosystem applications. ● AAVE (DeFi): Up 17% this week. Aave is an open-source decentralized lending protocol offering deposit and loan services. As a leader in decentralized lending, AAVE has once again earned market recognition thanks to ongoing protocol upgrades and its solid user base. ● ETH (L1): Up 8.8% this week to surpass $4,700, with mainnet TVL hitting a record high of $120 billion. As the industry infrastructure, ETH’s dominance is unshakable. With the Layer 2 scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem and the ongoing DeFi/NFT expansion, ETH’s steady appreciation also reinforces the market’s underlying confidence. Hot Token Listing Winners——8.18-8.25 2025 Structural Momentum Brings Opportunity: HTX Helps Capture the New Cycle This week, HTX’s asset performance reflected a distinct “structural differentiation”: On the one hand, emerging narratives such as meme coins, DeSci, and GameFi drew in substantial capital with explosive growth. On the other hand, L1s and DeFi blue chips advanced steadily, providing a foundation of long-term value. This structural landscape means that while investors can seize short-term, high-volatility opportunities, they should also allocate stable assets to strike a balance between risk and return.

50803076,567331,1756364919,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50803076.jpeg,ChatGPT’s Top 4 Cryptos to 100x for 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/chatgpt-top-100x-cryptos-2025/,"If you were paying attention, you probably know the crypto market is up to something. Rapidly increasing corporate crypto stashes, a slew of pro-crypto policy changes, and the Fed chair hinting at a September rate cut are all massive signs that the next few months could churn out some life-changing returns. But in a market with hundreds of thousands of tokens, how do you identify the best cryptos to buy ? Do you just stick to the main ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum? While relatively ‘safe,’ following this approach would probably mean leaving a lot of money on the table. On the other hand, you can’t just ape into random shitcoins either, hoping they skyrocket. That’s too risky and ill-advised. The solution? Building a well-balanced portfolio with a solid mix of under-the-radar, high-upside tokens and top-tier proven performers showing fresh breakouts. To help you do just that, we turned to ChatGPT, which is arguably the most powerful AI chatbot around right now. Read on as we unpack the AI’s top crypto picks, with detailed explanations on why each of them could be the next crypto to explode . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer 2 for Fast, Cheap Transactions & Better Programmability If you’re a Bitcoin believer who would happily purchase every last bit of ‘digital gold’ they could, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) might just be what you’re looking for. Not only is it far cheaper than $BTC, but $HYPER also carries a higher ROI potential, seeing as it’s currently in presale and available at ultra-low prices. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could surge almost 2,400% by the end of 2025, potentially hitting $0.32. What’s special about $HYPER? It’s building the first-ever Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin aimed at turbocharging the blockchain with Solana-like performance. Thanks to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER will bring lightning-fast speeds, low fees, and cutting-edge Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. And a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge lets you interact with Hyper’s SVM-powered Web3 environment by converting your Layer 1 $BTC into Layer 2 $BTC. Thanks to $HYPER, you’ll be able to engage in high-speed DeFi trading, NFTs, DAO and governance, lending, staking, swapping, and blockchain gaming right on Bitcoin. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already pulled in over $12.4M from early investors. And right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.012815 apiece. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to join the Bitcoin revolution. 2. Ethereum ($ETH) – Institutional Accumulation & Technical Breakout Setting the Stage for Massive Rally Ethereum ($ETH) has been at the center of nearly all crypto chatter in recent days, and for good reason. Institutional players are scooping up ‘digital silver’ at a rapid pace, in some cases even favoring it over Bitcoin. That’s a telling sign the whales know something. Case in point: BlackRock recently dropped a massive $314M on Ethereum , while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street beefed up their $ETH ETF holdings by adding another 160K and 32.5K $ETH , respectively. Even better? If Ethereum retests its all-time high, $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated , igniting a massive short squeeze and fueling a potential parabolic rally. On the technical front, CryptoGoos, a crypto analyst with 121K+ followers on X, pointed out that $ETH has just broken out of a huge consolidation channel on the weekly chart. After a quick retest, the token now looks primed to rally higher. And according to this trading pattern, Ethereum’s next target could be… drumroll… $10K! 3. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – New Meme Coin Changing the Crypto Investing Game Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) blends iconic meme coin humor with crypto finance, offering a never-before-seen community for retail investors. As a $WEPE holder, you gain access to a vibrant and tight-knit group of crypto traders, all benefitting from each other’s strategies, insights, alpha buy/sell calls, and, of course, plenty of jokes along the way. $WEPE’s mission is simple: to dilute the unfair amount of power crypto whales currently hold, as they manipulate markets at will using advanced tools and algorithms, often wrecking everyday portfolios. After a record-breaking presale performance, where $WEPE gathered over $70M from early investors, the token proved its worth by rising almost 900% during June-July this year. And while $WEPE is admittedly in the red over the past couple of weeks, it’s now flirting with the upper resistance of a major triangle consolidation pattern. A breakout here could slam the gas pedal and send $WEPE soaring, potentially even to new all-time highs, representing a 400% gain from current levels. In addition to strong technicals, the token is also set to benefit from its upcoming Solana launch , which is likely to bring in a fresh wave of investors and hype, further boosting price. Only a meme coin or a full-blown movement? We’ll let you decide. 1 $WEPE on $ETH is currently available at just $0.000067 on DEXs . Ir you want the new $SOL $WEPE, visit the visit Wall Street Pepe’s official website. 4. Chainlink ($LINK) – Mainstream Crypto Nearing Breakout as ETF Hype Builds Chainlink ($LINK) has long been considered one of the best tokens for diversifying crypto portfolios, but recent developments – both fundamental and technical – suggest it’s now ready to take the crypto space by storm. According to CryptoELITES, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst with more than 260K followers on X, $LINK is tantalizingly close to breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. Even better? The upward-sloping trendline of this pattern has acted as strong support for months, confirming this as a rock-solid setup that could deliver in a big way. The expectation? Once $LINK breaks out, ideally with a fat green candle, it could ignite an explosive rally on its way toward $100. That means if you scoop up $LINK now, while it’s trading around $24.16 , you could be staring at a chunky 313% return on your investment. And here’s where things get even more exciting: major investment firms are showing interest in launching a spot Chainlink ETF, with Bitwise having filed for one just a few days ago. A spot ETF would legitimize $LINK as an institutional-grade asset, open the floodgates for new capital, and massively increase demand, all of which would be highly bullish for price. Wrapping Up We decided to put ChatGPT’s potentially revolutionary research and narrative-building skills to the test by asking it to craft a well-rounded crypto portfolio for 2025. And the AI delivered. Its top picks include not only institutional-grade giants like Ethereum ($ETH) and Chainlink ($LINK) but also low-cap, high-upside gems such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) .

Analyst Thinks So,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-about-to-drain-the-life-out-of-altcoins-analyst-thinks-so/,"TL;DR Bitcoin’s dominance climbs off key support, hinting at renewed strength into September and October. Altcoins may underperform as Ethereum-led rallies show signs of topping out this quarter. Analysts expect Bitcoin to regain control as liquidity exits altcoins in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Dominance Rebounds After Trendline Support Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market has started to rise again. The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) index recently bounced off a key trendline that’s held firm since early 2023. It now sits above 58%, following weeks of decline. This rebound may signal the end of altcoins’ recent run. 1 week warning Bitcoin Dominance is likely going to move higher in Sep/Oct. As noted in the post below, ALTs tend to find tops against BTC in late August. Liquidity will flow back to the king. https://t.co/YX8FaX7SPt pic.twitter.com/BUN27JMC1n — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 27, 2025 Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, issued a warning last week. He expects Bitcoin dominance to climb higher through September and October as altcoins often peak against BTC in late August. “Liquidity will flow back to the king,” he wrote on X. Cowen pointed out that several previous summers showed similar patterns. Altcoin rallies often peak around late August, then lose strength as money shifts back into Bitcoin heading into the final quarter of the year. He reminded traders, “If you are riding ALTs right now like the last few summers, just remember that the tides will likely turn a little later in Q3.” His chart suggests a possible rise in BTC dominance toward the 61–63% range. This shift would likely come at the expense of altcoins, which could underperform during this period. The focus appears to be moving back to Bitcoin, particularly if ETH, which has led the latest altcoin push, starts to fade. Analysts Cautious on Short-Term Moves A crypto market watcher said Bitcoin dominance could still drop to 52%, but not right away. “If it goes to 52%, I don’t think it will happen until much later in the year,” Cowen replied. He acknowledged that while shorter timeframes may show BTC.D as overbought, the longer-term charts suggest there’s room to move higher. Cowen added that the current rotation into altcoins seems to be driven mainly by Ethereum’s rally. He expects ETH to face resistance soon, which could trigger another upward leg in BTC dominance lasting through September and October. Bitcoin Price Holds, but Market Watches Key Level Bitcoin was trading at $113,000 at press time, with a daily gain of 1%, though still down 1% over the past week. Market veteran Peter Brandt commented on a large weekend sell order, saying it could represent market supply. “Tops in markets are created by SUPPLY or DISTRIBUTION,” he said, adding that BTC needs to reclaim $117,570 to avoid forming a potential double top. While Brandt made it clear he wasn’t taking a side, he urged traders not to ignore the signal. With Bitcoin dominance rising and altcoins showing signs of slowing, the coming weeks may mark a shift in market direction. The post Is Bitcoin About to Drain the Life Out of Altcoins?

In a statement today, the Board stated that Nasdaq's system will prevent fraud, abuse, and manipulation in the markets. Interim Chair Caroline Pham said, “As our markets evolve with new technologies, it is critical that the CFTC stays one step ahead.” The new system will provide the institution with automatic alerts and cross-market analysis.

The CFTC's role in cryptocurrency oversight could expand significantly if bills being considered in Congress pass. Specifically, the Clarity Act, which has yet to be enacted, would grant the agency exclusive jurisdiction over blockchain-based commodities, require the registration of digital commodity exchanges and brokers, and impose new compliance, anti-money laundering, and reporting obligations. The CFTC stated that the Nasdaq system will be able to identify potential manipulation patterns and allow for rapid scaling during periods of high volume and volatility. “This includes access to comprehensive order book data to support real-time analysis and decision-making,” the statement said. “This is a critical element in preventing market abuse in both traditional and crypto asset markets.” *This is not investment advice.

The arrangement will allow users to pay for VPN access using crypto, enabling them to maintain personal privacy when connecting to and browsing the web. Nym’s reputation as a privacy-focused VPN provider has famously been bolstered by Edward Snowden, who’s previously endorsed its service. When shopping around for a VPN provider, privacy is naturally one of the primary attributes that web users, tired of seeing their data reshared or accessed by unauthorized third parties, are anxious to maximize. The Dash partnership will support this goal, allowing VPN users to pay for access without the need to hand over their credit card details. Dash Gives Nym a Privacy Upgrade Originally launched in 2014 as Xcoin and then Darkcoin before rebranding to its current name, Dash is an OG cryptocurrency that benefits from being one of the few privacy coins still widely available on crypto exchanges. This makes it easier for users to obtain it and use it to pay for goods and services where privacy is desirable. Interest in the project has heightened in 2025 now that privacy is back on the menu, with everyone from consumers to institutions seeking private ways of transacting onchain without disclosing sensitive data in the process. Following the NymVPN partnership, customers can use Dash to subscribe to the service before taking their pick of two options for connecting to the web. “Fast” is a WireGuard-based VPN for everyday browsing and streaming, while “Anonymous” incorporates more hops – five instead of two – for users who desire maximum anonymity. This provides robust protection against a range of cyber threats as well as censorship which threatens to limit the sites that web users can access. End-to-End Privacy Payments have long been the achilles heel of VPN providers, since the very act of purchasing a subscription risks exposing the sort of financial information that users are understandably keen to keep hidden. Cryptocurrencies – especially those with privacy features built in – are a practical solution to this problem. They’re also convenient, enabling payment to be confirmed almost instantly, with no card details stored on centralized servers where they form a honeypot to hackers. “This collaboration with Dash strengthens our mission to offer privacy across different kinds of financial transactions,” explains Nym CEO Harry Halpin. “With Dash payments that offer a degree of privacy beyond most cryptocurrencies, our users can access NymVPN’s metadata-resistant mixnet, further shielding their transactions from mass surveillance.” The other challenge web users face when electing to use a VPN is deciding which company to trust, which is less straightforward than it sounds. While all VPN providers offer broadly the same service, their architecture can differ significantly. Moreover, while all VPNs purport to protect user privacy, some do the bare minimum, while the most diligent go above and beyond in their quest to keep user data secure and anonymized at all times. With Edward Snowden singing its praises and Dash payments now integrated, NymVPN can justifiably claim to be doing its bit to keep web users and their precious data secure, not only when using its VPN but when signing up, connecting, and disconnecting. In recent years, crypto holders who’ve wanted to use privacy coins have been viewed with suspicion by regulators and lawmakers pursuing the misguided notion that “if you’re not doing anything wrong, you haven’t got anything to hide.” That idea has since been well and truly dispelled, ushering in a new era for onchain privacy in which it’s acknowledged that the ability to conceal personal information is not only normal but desirable. NymVPN’s partnership with Dash will help to further legitimize the use of privacy coins while giving web users a more discreet way of subscribing to a service that forms the foundation of their internet browsing.

The current hot-tickets are Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has been gaining increasingly widespread traction due to its revolutionary DeFi lending system. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. Initial investors will enjoy over 500% increase once it is listed. The Mutuum Finance presale has already surpassed an amount of over $15 million with more than 15720 holders buying them. XRP still takes a central spot in cross border payments and this makes it interesting to traders who are trying to maneuver the current slide in the market. XRP: Holding Steady Amid Market Moves The current price of XRP is about $2.88, keeping to the same range with the other changes in the market. It has fluctuated between $2.84 and $3.05 within the last 24-hour period, showing a relatively slowing period awaiting clear signals with regard to the rest of the market. It has not shown any deep spikes or drastic declines, but it still remains in the topic and process of cross border payments and regulation policies that could determine the future dynamics of the currency. Certainly, this is not lost on the market as the conversation around altcoin performance is now directed more towards emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as well. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty MUTM has announced that its Bug Bounty Program was launched in collaboration with Certik. By inviting white hackers, developers and security researchers to join the security program, Mutuum Finance will further enhance the security of its platform by rewarding them with bounties when they report any vulnerability they can identify. The reward system will reach a maximum of 50,000 USDT and the prize will also be in accordance with the gravity of the bug detected whether small level bugs to high-impact bug vulnerability. The hierarchical model provides one of the most comprehensive security coverings and in the simplified way is able to secure the users, investors’ money and profits, and gains increasing confidence in the Mutuum Finance system. The 100,000 Giveaway was created to build a loyal community. In addition to its bug bounty, Mutuum Finance team is conducting a $100,000 giveaway that will be encouraging early adopters of the project and internally growing its user base. It is going to be awarding 10 prizes, and the prize will be worth $10,000 MUTM, and just as earlier indicated, this will reflect the strong long term dedicated focus user base which the project aims to achieve. These community projects are a part of the desire Mutuum Finance has to not only be on the track toward creating a safe environment in the form of a platform it is building but also be a lifegiving entity which assists in creating an enriching environment where the users, token holders and investors will enjoy the success. Presale Phase 6 Beats Milestones Mutuum Finance is also taking humongous steps of its ongoing presale. The 6th stage of presale is progressing fast at $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $15 million, secured more than 15,720 token holders, and surged 16.17% to $0.035 in presale phase 6, offering early investors potential returns exceeding 500% at listing. Backed by a $100,000 giveaway, a $50,000 CertiK Bug Bounty Program, and a dual lending protocol designed for security and scalability, the project is quickly gaining traction amid market dips. Act now, join the presale today, claim your tokens, and secure your allocation before the next price milestone while ensuring eligibility for exclusive rewards and long-term growth opportunities.

Over 1,000 wallets lost more than $10,000 each. Few YZY Traders Profited as Gains Concentrated in Top Wallets In contrast, only 18,333 wallets saw profits, but the gains were unevenly distributed. Most profiting wallets made less than $1,000, while 11 wallet addresses alone captured nearly 30% of total profits, which amounted to $66.6 million in gains across all winning wallets. YZY, short for Yeezy Money, was launched last Wednesday with heavy promotion from West’s official website and social channels. Marketed as a way to put users in control of their finances, the token quickly lost steam. Within hours of launch, YZY’s price crashed nearly 70% , sparking accusations of manipulation. Bubblemaps highlighted suspicious activity including sniping, a tactic where bots acquire large portions of a token’s supply seconds after launch. One wallet identified as belonging to a trader known as “Naseem”, previously linked to Trump’s DJT memecoin profits, was flagged as YZY’s first investor. Another key figure named by Bubblemaps was Hayden Davis, a serial participant in high-profile token launches. Davis allegedly earned $12 million sniping YZY. He had previously been involved with Libra and other coins that collapsed shortly after release. “The playbook is simple: Infiltrate big launches, get in early, and extract millions,” Bubblemaps wrote in a post on X. “It’s happening in plain sight, and no one is stopping it.” The past week truly exposed the failures of our industry Despite our collective efforts as investigators, builders, and communities – the same names keep running the same scams The playbook is simple: Infiltrate big launches, get in early, and extract millions It’s happening… — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) August 27, 2025 Notably, West had previously distanced himself from the memecoin trend, saying such tokens “prey on the fans with hype.” Kanye West Denies Involvement in YZY Token, Cites Hacked Account On Wednesday, West denied involvement in the YZY-themed memecoin , stating his Instagram account was compromised. The claim was posted on West’s X (formerly known as Twitter) on August 26, in which he wrote: “My Instagram has been hacked and it’s following a fake coin…The official project is @YZY_MNY.” He went on to promote a different project, accompanied by a new Solana wallet address. No further details were provided on how the alleged compromise occurred or who may have been behind the original launch. The situation adds to a growing number of celebrity-linked crypto controversies in 2024 and 2025, raising ongoing questions about how memecoins are launched, endorsed, and sold across platforms with limited oversight. Meanwhile, West’s YZY token appears to have set the record for the fastest collapse , losing 90% of its value in just one day, despite reaching a $3 billion market cap.

Genoot told Reuters that the team chose a merger instead of a direct listing. He explained that this route offered better access to financing. Also, it allows the company to leverage an existing business already connected to capital markets. American Bitcoin has been exploring acquisitions in Hong Kong and Japan to expand its footprint, the Financial Times reported earlier this month. Genoot confirmed that the company is actively assessing opportunities in Asia, with the aim of giving investors broader access to bitcoin-linked assets beyond the US. He said that while discussions are under way, no firm commitments have been made. The focus, he added, is to create options for investors who cannot directly buy Nasdaq-listed crypto stocks due to local restrictions. American Bitcoin Born From Hut 8’s Strategic Shift Into Infrastructure American Bitcoin was founded earlier this year. It emerged from Hut 8’s pivot away from pure crypto mining into energy infrastructure and data centres. The new venture was created in partnership with the Trump brothers. Now, it is positioning itself as a global bitcoin miner. Further, the company has ambitions to expand through acquisitions and partnerships. The strategy has been described as mirroring that of large US-listed Bitcoin firms. These firms often use equity financing and mergers to accelerate growth. Moreover, Genoot said the goal is to build a vehicle that appeals to both institutional investors and retail traders. He added that the focus is on giving them exposure to Bitcoin through regulated exchanges.

American Bitcoin , a prominent mining firm, is making headlines with its ambitious plan to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This pivotal move, backed by the two sons of former U.S. President Donald Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., aims for an early September debut, according to a Reuters report. This development signals a major step for a crypto mining company entering traditional financial markets. What is American Bitcoin and Its Nasdaq Journey? American Bitcoin is not just another mining operation. Founded by Eric Trump, in collaboration with established Bitcoin miner Hut8, the company has set its sights on a public listing to expand its reach and capital. The path to Nasdaq involves a strategic merger with Gryphon Digital, another significant player in the digital asset space. Upon completion of this merger, the combined entity will trade under the familiar ticker symbol ABTC. Importantly, the company will retain its current name, American Bitcoin , maintaining its brand identity. This structure will see President Trump’s sons and Hut8 jointly owning a substantial 98% of the company, highlighting their significant commitment and belief in its future. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Significant for American Bitcoin? A Nasdaq listing is a monumental achievement for any company, especially one in the dynamic cryptocurrency sector. For American Bitcoin , it means increased visibility, enhanced credibility, and access to a broader pool of institutional and retail investors. This move could potentially unlock significant capital for further expansion, technological upgrades, and operational scaling. Listing on a major exchange like Nasdaq also subjects the company to rigorous regulatory scrutiny and reporting standards. This can instill greater confidence among investors, signaling a commitment to transparency and sound corporate governance. It further legitimizes the crypto mining industry within mainstream finance, bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional investment opportunities. Future Horizons: Expansion and Potential Acquisitions for American Bitcoin The ambitions of American Bitcoin extend beyond just a Nasdaq listing. The Financial Times (FT) previously reported that the company was actively exploring the acquisition of a Bitcoin-related firm in Asia. This strategic interest indicates a global vision for expansion and a desire to diversify its operations and market presence. Such an acquisition could provide access to new markets, technology, or mining resources, further solidifying its position in the competitive crypto landscape. However, navigating international acquisitions and integrating new operations comes with its own set of challenges. Market volatility, regulatory differences across regions, and the complexities of mergers and acquisitions are all factors that American Bitcoin will need to manage carefully. Their ability to successfully execute these plans will be key to their long-term growth. Investor Interest and the Road Ahead for American Bitcoin The involvement of Donald Trump’s sons naturally brings a unique level of public and media attention to American Bitcoin . This high profile could attract significant investor interest, but it also means the company will operate under intense scrutiny. Investors will closely watch its performance, particularly its ability to navigate the volatile crypto market and deliver on its growth strategies. The early September target for the Nasdaq listing is fast approaching. All eyes will be on ABTC as it prepares to make its debut. This event could serve as a bellwether for other crypto-related companies considering similar moves, potentially paving the way for more digital asset firms to enter traditional public markets. The journey of American Bitcoin is certainly one to follow closely. In conclusion, American Bitcoin ‘s impending Nasdaq listing, backed by the Trump sons and a strategic merger with Gryphon Digital, marks a significant milestone. This move promises enhanced visibility, access to capital, and increased legitimacy for the crypto mining sector. While challenges remain, the company’s ambitious plans for expansion and potential acquisitions suggest a forward-looking approach that could reshape its future in the digital economy. This is a truly transformative moment for the crypto industry. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is American Bitcoin?

With institutional confidence holding firm and key macro data releases ahead, the crypto market is entering a critical junction. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research examines the drivers behind Bitcoin’s recent strength and outlines the key catalysts to watch heading into September. Liquidity and Institutional Demand Anchor BTC’s Strength At the end of August, global liquidity remained elevated. According to StreetStats, as of August 27, 2025, the total M2 money supply across major economies reached approximately USD 95.116 trillion, a record high, with a quarter-on-quarter increase of 3.87%. This indicates continued monetary easing in the short term and provides crucial support for Bitcoin’s strength. At the same time, institutional holdings became more concentrated. By August 27, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs held about 1.3 million BTC, accounting for roughly 6% of circulating supply. In mid-August, MicroStrategy purchased another 430 BTC, raising its total holdings to 629,376 BTC. These additional acquisitions, concentrated in July and August, show that short-term market volatility has not deterred institutional long-term allocation. On the regulatory front, positive developments earlier in the month continued to reverberate. On August 7, the U.S. President signed an executive order requiring regulators to allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in Bitcoin and other alternative assets. This policy triggered discussions in late August about launching new Bitcoin investment products. Given that 401(k) plans manage about USD 8.9 trillion in assets, even a modest 1% allocation to Bitcoin would imply nearly USD 89 billion in potential inflows. On-Chain Metrics Signal Caution Amid Resilience On-chain data at the end of August indicated short-term overheating but overall resilience. The MVRV-Z score stood at around 2.49, above its historical average and suggesting potential near-term correction risks. However, the aSOPR was around 1.019 and NUPL at 0.558, both reflecting stable realized and unrealized profit levels. This indicates that while current prices sit above average cost, the market as a whole has not entered excessive profit-taking territory. Upcoming Data and Policy to Guide Market Expectations Macro data releases are also likely to influence sentiment. Preliminary estimates from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed second-quarter real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 3.0%, rebounding sharply from -0.5% in the first quarter, driven by a 30.3% collapse in imports, stronger consumer spending, and increased government outlays. Markets expect the revised figure due on August 28 to be lowered to around 3.0% or even 2.4%. A downward revision would reinforce expectations of monetary easing. On August 29, the July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report—considered the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge and the last major release before the September FOMC meeting—will be published. Economists expect core PCE (excluding food and energy) to edge up from 2.8% to 2.9% year-on-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, while headline PCE is expected to remain around 2.6% year-on-year, with a 0.2% monthly increase. If the data overshoots, markets may reassess the timing of Fed rate cuts; if it comes in weaker, it would provide further support for Bitcoin. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

The Cronos project also aims for organic growth and expanding its network, in addition to potentially becoming the social media token for Truth Social.

The token was among the day’s trending projects, rising over 54% in the past 24 hours. CRO traded at $0.34, after months of drifting under $0.10. The token is seen as potentially breaking to a higher price range, though it is yet to reach its all-time high above $0.89.

Despite this, Cronos was one of the leading platforms for crypto onboarding during the 2024 and 2025 bull markets, showing widespread organic appeal.

The project will use its wide network to boost access to DeFi, through staking and lending. Cronos also aims to make CRO one of the assets adopted for ETF and ETP products. Treasuries may also become one of the sources for CRO demand. In 2026, Cronos aims to place up to 20B CRO to additional public demand. The platform aims to place the re-issued and locked 70B CRO, which will enter circulation in the past decade. CRO open interest rose to a three-year high CRO open interest expanded to a three-year peak, rising to over $75M after months of relatively low trading activity. The token attracted retail activity, including from the long-term community of supporters. CRO sentiment also dipped during the latest price rally. However, more than 2.1K participants have voted on CRO sentiment , while the token usually only gained around 150 votes to gauge sentiment. After a prolonged period of inactivity, CRO may turn into a prime attention token, with increased mindshare. Based on Messari data, CRO mindshare rose by 853% in the past day, with retail interest and community mentions adding to the initial Trump Media Group hype. While the current sentiment shows CRO is below its peak hype, the token may still extend its rally and consolidate at a higher range. CRO is not yet represented on Hyperliquid, despite long-running listings on exchanges, though significant volumes are locked on the Crypto.com native exchange, with major interest on the South Korean exchange Upbit.

While established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain strong assets, their upside potential is limited compared to new tokens entering the market at ultra-low valuations. This is why presale tokens priced below $0.1 have captured the attention of both retail traders and institutional investors. One standout project currently making waves is Ozak AI (OZ)—an AI-powered crypto project that blends innovation with utility. With its presale priced at just $0.01, analysts are calling it the best presale happening right now, offering investors the possibility to turn $2,000 into $40,000 or even more if projections are realized. Why OZ Presales Offer Massive Upside Presales are unique because they allow early investors to get in before a token launches on major exchanges. In many cases, once the project gains exposure and liquidity, the token price surges exponentially. Early-stage entries like these have historically delivered life-changing returns. For example, Ethereum’s early backers bought in for cents before it became worth thousands of dollars, while Solana and Polygon also produced 100x–200x gains for presale participants. With Ozak AI priced at just $0.01 per token, it gives investors the chance to participate in a project with high-growth potential at the ground floor, before broader adoption pushes prices closer to its projected $1 target. Ozak AI’s Presale Success The Ozak AI presale has already proven itself a success, raising over $2.4 million and selling more than 820 million tokens in record time. These numbers are a testament to the strong demand and confidence surrounding the project. Unlike meme coins that rely purely on hype, Ozak AI’s foundation lies in utility-driven technology. The project’s core mission is to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain, providing predictive trading tools, automated analytics, and real-time insights for crypto traders. As AI continues to dominate headlines in both the tech and financial industries, Ozak AI is positioned perfectly at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing sectors. OZ Security and Transparency Building Trust One of the most important challenges in the crypto area is trust. Many presale initiatives fail due to lack of transparency or safety flaws. Ozak AI has addressed those issues by finishing a Certik audit, giving buyers reassurance that its smart contracts are stable and dependable. Furthermore, the challenge is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, platforms that best showcase legitimate tokens, further boosting investor confidence. This combination of transparency and credibility has helped Ozak AI stand out from hundreds of other presales happening across the market. Why $2,000 Could Become $40,000 or More The math behind Ozak AI’s upside is straightforward. At its current presale price of $0.01, a $2,000 investment would secure 200,000 tokens. If Ozak AI hits its projected target of $1, that $2,000 stake could be worth $200,000—a 100x return. Even a more conservative scenario of the token reaching $0.20–$0.25 could flip that investment into $40,000 or above. When compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, which would require massive capital to achieve similar multipliers, the appeal of presales like Ozak AI becomes even clearer. This is why presale tokens continue to attract investors looking for asymmetric opportunities—where the risk is limited, but the upside is extraordinary. OZ Partnerships and Growth Roadmap Beyond its presale numbers, Ozak AI has been constructing vital partnerships to boost up adoption. Collaborations with blockchain ecosystems and AI-pushed systems ensure that its tools might be integrated throughout trading communities. By addressing real-world demanding situations, which include unreliable trading alerts and lack of predictive analytics, Ozak AI ensures that its token isn’t just a speculative asset but part of a developing ecosystem with sensible use instances. As the project moves towards its reputable release, those partnerships and product rollouts are predicted to drive even more demand for the token, doubtlessly pushing its price better than the initial $1 goal. The crypto market in 2025 is full of opportunities, but few compare to presales priced under $0.1, where the potential for exponential growth is highest. Among these, Ozak AI has emerged as the best presale happening currently, offering investors a rare chance to enter at just $0.01 before the wider market catches on. With strong fundamentals, audited security, major listings, and millions raised, it combines credibility with explosive upside. For investors looking to flip $2,000 into $40,000—or potentially much more—Ozak AI represents one of the most compelling opportunities of the year.

This top altcoin boasts a 30% TVL rise, active addresses around 22 million, and massive institutional interest that keeps rising. Meanwhile, Remittix is making massive strides of its own, delivering record-breaking improvements, earning its place among the best cryptos to buy now for different but valid reasons. Even an early Solana backer is convinced that this PayFi sensation will deliver the big bags this year. Analyzing Solana Market Performance Solana holds its spot among the list of the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its explosive on-chain performance and figures. This year, its performance has seen a 43% annualized return, with increasing DeFi engagement, project development, and fresh ETF instruments like the Solana + Staking ETF all strengthening SOL’s position. Considering its institutional enthusiasm, speed, and thriving ecosystem backing, Solana remains a key option for savvy investors. However, savvy investors who found this Altcoin early have now backed the new Remittix DeFi project to match this and do better. Source: TradingView Remittix Drives Rapid Growth With Potential for More Through Tangible Utility Remittix is making a name for itself where several crypto projects rely on hype. This project has sold over 623 million RTX tokens, selling at $0.0987, and has raised over $21.6 million, massive capital before launch. This PayFi project’s strategy surpasses raising capital. There’s an ongoing $250,000 giveaway that is attracting users in droves. The first CEX listing on BitMart is live, with another listing to come once Remittix hits the $22 million funding target, which isn’t far off. Also, the wallet beta launch in September is expected to enable more utility through crypto-to-bank transfers and attract more attention. Here is why this Solana expert, like several other investors, backs Remittix: Wallet beta launch this quarter will increase momentum Offering a solution to a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Audited by CertiK to affirm trust and transparency Deflationary tokenomics created for long-term growth Providing solutions freelancers, remitters, global earners, and businesses need Remittix presents itself as a practical, compelling name by delivering these infrastructure and access. While Solana continues to dazzle with on-chain growth and developer activity, Remittix is powering forward with scheduled product rollouts and tangible utility. These cryptos have unique strengths: Solana for altcoin velocity and Remittix for today’s payments infrastructure. However, Remittix has a low-cap advantage, which allows for more growth.

Analyst Says “The Delay Is Actually a Good Thing” and Explains Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-isnt-the-anticipated-major-altcoin-season-happening-analyst-says-the-delay-is-actually-a-good-thing-and-explains-why/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch evaluated the latest market situation and argued that altcoin investors should be patient. According to Koch, the delay of the anticipated altcoin season is not a negative situation, but rather a healthy process for the crypto ecosystem. In his analysis, Koch noted that growing impatience in the crypto market has divided investors into two camps, with some anticipating a strong altcoin rally and others predicting the collapse of all projects except Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, according to Koch, the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes: “The delay in the altcoin season allows Bitcoin to renew confidence and attract liquidity into the market first.” A report published last week by US exchange Coinbase predicted that an altcoin rally could begin in September. The report noted that altcoin market capitalization has increased by more than 50% in recent weeks, while Bitcoin dominance has fallen from 65% to 59%. Coinbase interprets this decline as an early signal of capital reshuffling. It also estimates that approximately $7.2 trillion in funds is currently held in money market funds, and that some of this money could shift to cryptocurrency with interest rate cuts expected in the fall. Related News: Major Company Announces Investment in Binance-Listed Altcoins - Both Altcoins Backed According to Coinbase analysis, the Global M2 Money Supply index, which measures global money supply, trends approximately 100 days ahead of Bitcoin price movements. The latest data suggests a new wave of liquidity could arrive in the fourth quarter of 2025, potentially boosting Bitcoin and altcoin markets. Koch also highlighted the warnings of renowned analyst Benjamin Cowen. Cowen noted that in every bull cycle, Bitcoin initially instills confidence in the market, leading to a prolonged period of BTC dominance before altcoins perform, saying, “If the altcoin season is delayed, it will come back stronger later.” Cowen argues that this process has played out similarly in past cycles, noting that altcoin rallies typically follow strong gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Koch, technical indicators point to a potential breakout in the altcoin market. He noted that the 125 largest altcoins have formed an ascending triangle formation on their monthly charts, noting that this pattern has historically mostly broken upwards. According to the analyst, altcoin market capitalization increased by 320% following a similar formation in the 2021 cycle. *This is not investment advice.

50804938,567261,1756368027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50804938.jpeg,Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Push Ignited By Japan’s Democratic People’s Party,https://bitcoinist.com/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-japan-dpp/,"Japan’s debate over sovereign Bitcoin exposure moved from the fringe to the front row this week after JAN3 chief executive Samson Mow met in Tokyo with Yuichiro Tamaki, who leads the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), and Sōhei Kamiya, leader of Sanseitō. Will Japan Establish A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? As Mow put it, “We had very productive meetings in Tokyo with Kamiya-san, leader of Sanseito, and Tamaki-san, leader of the DPP. Both leaders already had a great understanding of #Bitcoin so our discussions flowed very naturally… I focused mainly on the limited window of opportunity for a nation-state to accumulate significant amounts of BTC for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. We will likely have additional meetings later this year.” The political substance of those conversations tracks long-running parliamentary activity by both leaders. In Mow’s words, “Kamiya-san has raised the idea of Japan holding Bitcoin reserves in the Diet and called for tax reform, reflecting his party Sanseito’s sovereignty-first stance. Tamaki-san has proposed lowering capital gains taxes on Bitcoin to 20% and exempting smaller swaps and payments from taxation, giving Bitcoin fairer treatment in law.” He then clarified that “these are activities they have done previously in the Diet.” JAN3, for its part, framed the agenda in explicitly geopolitical terms. “JAN3 CEO @Excellion met with Sohei Kamiya, leader of Sanseito, and Yuichiro Tamaki, leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), at their offices in Tokyo to discuss the urgency to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for Japan. Diet Members understand the world has changed dramatically with the US SBR already established and the Bitcoin Act on the way.” The reference is to the United States’ March 6, 2025 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), followed days later by the introduction of the BITCOIN Act in Congress to codify and scale that framework. The Tokyo meetings were not confined to opposition figures. Mow also underscored engagement with gatekeepers in the ruling camp: “It was a pleasure to meet Satsuki Katayama at @WebX_Asia where she delivered a speech at the Bitcoin networking event. Katayama-san is a member of Japan’s House of Councillors, representing the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and also chair of the LDP Committee on Finance.” Katayama indeed chairs the LDP’s Financial Research Commission and has recently fronted party policy work touching capital markets, banking supervision and digital-asset issues, a signal that Bitcoin policy sits squarely inside the LDP’s finance apparatus. Japan’s Political Power Structure Understanding how and where the DPP and Sanseitō sit in Japan’s power structure is essential to gauging the odds of near-term policy change. In the July 20, 2025 House of Councillors election, the LDP–Komeito ruling bloc lost its upper-house majority, while smaller parties surged. The DPP won 17 seats in that contest and now holds 22 seats in the chamber, making it the third-largest force after the LDP and the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP). Sanseitō captured 14 seats, lifting its total to 15. Those tallies translate into real leverage for both parties in an upper house where the government must now assemble issue-by-issue majorities. Percentages tell the same story. On the national proportional list, the DPP took roughly 12.88% of the vote, while Sanseitō drew about 12.55%, confirming that both parties converted a broad base of support into seats. With the LDP–Komeito alliance short of a majority, that performance gives Tamaki’s centrists and Kamiya’s sovereigntists greater committee-level bargaining power over any crypto tax rewrite or more ambitious reserve initiative. Within that parliamentary geometry, tax reform is the most immediate vector. Tamaki has consistently pushed to replace today’s progressive treatment of crypto gains—which can run to the mid-50s percent when local levies are included—with a 20% separate tax, and to exempt small-value payments and crypto-to-crypto swaps from recognition, a de minimis regime designed to unlock everyday usage.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Whales Have Seen Their Counts Go Up Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how the whale populations have shifted on the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains recently. Whales refer to the key stakeholders of a cryptocurrency who hold amounts large enough that they can carry some degree of influence in the market. The exact scale of these investors is defined differently across networks. For BTC, whales are considered to be entities carrying more than 1,000 BTC (equivalent to $112 million at the current exchange rate), while for ETH, the threshold is 10,000 ETH ($46.4 million). Related Reading: Bitcoin Selloff: $2.2 Billion In BTC Floods Exchanges Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the total number of whale-sized wallets has changed on each of these networks over the past few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin whales saw their count plummet back in July, implying a notable number of these investors exited from the market near the rally high. In August, the metric has made gradual recovery for the cryptocurrency, with there now being 13 more such wallets compared to the start of the month. While this isn’t anything too big, it does indicate that big-money investors are slowly buying back in. Ethereum has also seen its whale population go up during the same window and the increase has been more dramatic in its case. In total, 48 new whales have joined the blockchain since August began. Given the key position that these investors occupy in the market, the sentiment among them is often worth keeping an eye on. With a buying push occurring from them right now, it would seem that their outlook is bullish, particularly in the case of ETH. In some other news, Bitcoin has witnessed a sharp decline in capital inflows recently, as analyst Willy Woo has explained in an X post. Bitcoin is today seeing around less than $1 billion per day in capital inflows, which is significantly down compared to the earlier peak above $2 billion per day. Interestingly, in the same period as BTC has seen inflows dry up, ETH has observed them pick up instead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Keeps Slipping Down: Is $107,000 The Next Support? This could be an indication that investor interest has been rotating from the former to the latter. Following the uptrend, Ethereum inflows have risen to almost the same level as BTC ones, meaning that a flip could occur soon. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen some recovery from its recent low as its price has climbed back up to $112,500.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-were-all-going-to-get-extremely-rich-this-cycle-heres-why/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known analyst on X, has presented a chart that compares XRP’s past market dominance with potential future levels. His post includes a bold claim that XRP reclaiming its 2017 market dominance level could make many investors “extremely rich” in this cycle. The Historical Reference Point The chart highlights XRP’s dominance in 2017, when it reached approximately 24.9% of the overall cryptocurrency market. That surge represented an increase of more than 1,200% from prior levels. This rally also helped XRP reach its previous peak of $3.36 in January 2018. At the time, XRP also briefly became the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, before the correction in 2018 pulled it down. From the perspective of market structure, the chart marks that high as a benchmark for comparison with present conditions. Since then, XRP’s dominance has steadily declined, reaching much lower levels in the years that followed. At the time of Steph’s analysis, it sat near 4.68%, indicating that XRP represents a smaller portion of the cryptocurrency market compared to 2018. This gap between the historic high and the current level forms the basis for projections about future growth. If #XRP reclaims its 2017 market dominance level, we’re all going to get extremely rich this cycle! pic.twitter.com/46ZQSNoggn — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 27, 2025 The Projection for 2025 According to the analysis, the next major target sits at around 20.65% dominance by 2025. If achieved, this would represent a 428% increase from current levels. XRP has performed remarkably in 2025, recently reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 , and Steph expects a swift rise in dominance to follow. The timeline on the chart places this projection within the current market cycle, suggesting that the coming few months may be decisive for XRP’s share of the broader market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Repeating Historical Pattern The comparison between 2017 and 2025 rests on repeating patterns in market dominance. The chart notes a consolidation period followed by a breakout during the previous cycle, implying that a similar breakout could occur again. While the percentage gains would be smaller than those recorded in 2017, the overall effect would still mark a significant shift in XRP’s standing within the digital asset space and help it surpass Ethereum, making it the second-largest cryptocurrency once again. A move from below 5% to over 20% would indicate that XRP had absorbed substantial market share from competitors, reinforcing its long-term presence, and also putting it on the path to challenge Bitcoin’s position at the top of the market.

Features and The Controversy That Led to Its Ban,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/why-was-candy-ai-so-popular-features-and-the-controversy-that-led-to-its-ban/,"BitcoinWorld Why Was Candy AI So Popular? Features and The Controversy That Led to Its Ban For tech enthusiasts and a broad user base seeking digital companionship, Candy AI became a viral phenomenon. As of August 2025 , the platform is no longer available, having been banned due to a combination of legal, safety, and ethical issues. However, before its shutdown, it was widely discussed for its advanced technology and the controversy surrounding its adult-oriented features. The Rise and Fall of Candy AI The platform’s popularity stemmed from its sophisticated ability to offer a deeply personalized and intimate AI chat experience , a step beyond typical chatbots. The core appeal was the ability to create and engage with an emotionally responsive virtual companion that was always available. Discussions about Candy AI often revolved around these key themes: The Novelty of AI Intimacy: The platform gained attention for simulating human-like, intimate relationships, fulfilling a desire for companionship in a digital space. Controversy and Ethical Debates: Its explicit, unfiltered content for adults sparked intense global debate over the ethics, privacy, and safety of generative AI platforms. Tech and User Curiosity: The service was a major topic in the AI community, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with conversational AI and attracting users eager to explore these new frontiers. Key Features of the Candy AI Platform Prior to its ban, Candy AI stood out from competitors due to its advanced and highly customizable features, which were built on cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. Customization Personalized AI Companions: Users could design their own virtual characters, often referred to as an “AI girlfriend” or “AI boyfriend,” with extensive control over appearance and voice. Detailed Persona Creation: The platform allowed for the definition of specific personality traits, relationship dynamics, hobbies, and backstories, ensuring a highly personalized experience . Conversational Experience Advanced NLP for Realistic Conversations: Candy AI utilized sophisticated NLP to facilitate fluid, context-aware conversations that felt more authentic than scripted chatbot responses. Adaptive Memory: The AI had a robust memory system that allowed it to recall past conversations and user preferences, making interactions feel more personal and long-term. Emotional Simulation: The technology was capable of detecting a user’s tone and mood, allowing it to provide empathetic and emotionally responsive replies . Multimedia and Immersive Features Voice Integration: Users could engage in voice-based conversations, which added a more immersive and personal dimension to the chat experience. Image Generation: A key feature was the ability to request custom, on-demand images of the AI companion, such as “selfies” created from a user’s specific prompts. Immersive Roleplay: Users could participate in complex, user-scripted roleplaying scenarios, from fantasy adventures to romantic storylines. The Reason for the Ban The primary reason for the platform’s shutdown was its focus on mature, unfiltered adult-oriented content . While a premium feature available to verified 18+ users , the explicit nature of the interactions raised significant red flags. This, combined with a lack of robust age verification and content moderation, led to a global ban in August 2025 by authorities concerned with legal and ethical violations. Conclusion The story of Candy AI underscores the rapid evolution and significant challenges within the AI companion market. While its advanced features set a new standard for conversational and personalized AI, its eventual ban highlights the critical importance of legal compliance and ethical responsibility in the development of generative AI technologies.

Hyper-HYPER) بكميات كبيرة استعداداً لموسم العملات البديلة,https://bitcoinist.com/%d8%a3%d9%81%d8%b6%d9%84-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d9%85%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d9%82%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%84%d8%b4%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%88%d9%84/,"يشهد سوق الكريبتو زيادةً ملحوظة في النشاط مع تزايد الترقب لموسم العملات البديلة، وقد أصدرت شركة كوينبيس (Coinbase) تقريراً جديداً يوم الخميس يشير إلى احتمال بدء الموسم قريباً، ما يُحسّن التوقعات الإيجابية في السوق. في الوقت ذاته، ارتفع مؤشر موسم العملات البديلة الخاص بمنصة CoinMarketCap بمقدار 12 نقطة هذا الأسبوع، بينما تقترب سيطرة عملة بيتكوين (Bitcoin-BTC) من أدنى مستوياتها خلال 6 أشهر، حيث تبدو جميعُ العوامل مهيأةً لبدء ارتفاع أسعار العملات البديلة. ومع تصاعد الحماس، يبحث المتداولون عن أفضل العملات الرقمية للشراء حالياً، ومن أبرز تلك المشاريع عملة سولانا (Solana) وعملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper)، فقد وصل عدد حيتان (كبار مستثمري) عملة سولانا (Solana) إلى أعلى مستوياته الجديدة على الإطلاق، بينما يقترب اكتتاب عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) من جمع 10 مليون دولار. وعلى الرغم من تراجع أسعار أغلب العملات الرقمية الكبرى خلال آخر 24 ساعة، يستمر هذان المشروعان بجذب المزيد من الاستثمارات، ما يشير إلى مستقبل واعد. هل بدأ موسم العملات البديلة؟ الأسعار مهيأة لتشهد ارتفاعاً حاداً في أيلول/سبتمبر هز تقرير جديد صادر عن منصة كوينبيس (Coinbase) السوق، حيث توقع بدء موسم العملات البديلة في شهر أيلول/سبتمبر. وذكر التقرير الذي تم نشره يوم الخميس أن انخفاض مستوى سيطرة عملة بيتكوين (Bitcoin) وارتفاع القيمة السوقية للعملات البديلة وقوة عملة إيثيريوم (Ethereum-ETH) النسبية، تشير إلى أن العملات البديلة قد تبدأ تفوقها بشكلٍ ملحوظٍ على عملة بيتكوين. كذلك، أشارت كوينبيس إلى أنّ السيولة بدأت تعود إلى سوق الكريبتو بعد توقفٍ دام 6 أشهر، ما يدعم احتمال حدوث موسم عملات بديلة. في الوقت ذاته، شارك المحلل جوردون (Gordon) معلوماتٍ إضافية، مشيراً إلى أن مؤشر MACD لمستوى سيطرة عملة بيتكوين (Bitcoin) قد أظهر أول تقاطع هابطٍ شهري له خلال 4 سنوات. وقال جوردون: “في المرة الأخيرة التي حدَث فيها ذلك، شهدت أسعار العملات البديلة ارتفاعاً حاداً دام مدة 4 أشهر، حيث حققت العملات ذات القيمة السوقية الكبيرة أرباحاً قدرُها 10 أضعافٍ، بينما حققت العملات المتوسطة والصغيرة أرباحاً تتراوح بين 20 و50 ضعفاً”. تعكس تعليقات جوردون حالة الحماس المتزايد داخل قطاع العملات البديلة في الوقت الحالي بشكلٍ مثالي. وإذا سارت الأمور كما هو متوقع، فقد يكون العديد من المتداولين على وشك تحقيق مكاسب تغير حياتهم. ولكنْ، ما هي العملات الرقمية التي قد تُحقق أفضل أداء؟ دعونا نستعرض مشروعين يتمتعان بإمكاناتٍ هائلة. عملة سولانا (Solana) تشهد عملة سولانا (Solana) حالياً زخماً قوياً، فقد أدى نشاط سوق العملات البديلة إلى زيادة استثمارات الحيتان بشكلٍ ملحوظ. ووفقاً للمحلل علي مارتينيز (Ali Martinez)، بلغ عدد مالكي العملة الذين يمتلكون أكثرَ من 10,000 عملة سولانا (Solana) أعلى مستوى جديد يبلغ 5,224 شخصاً. تعكس هذه الخطوة مستوى ثقة كبار المستثمرين بالعملة، ما قد يشير إلى احتمال ارتفاع السعر بشكلٍ حاد في المستقبل القريب. في الوقت ذاته، سجّل صندوق التداول الفوري لعملة سولانا المتداول في البورصة REX-Osprey) (REX-Osprey spot SOL ETF أكبر استثماراتٍ يومية له على الإطلاق تبلغ 13 مليون دولار يوم الخميس، ما يُبرز جاذبية عملة سولانا (Solana) المتنامية بين المتداولين الخبراء. وتشير هذه العوامل إلى أن سعر عملة سولانا (Solana) قد يكون على وشك الارتفاع بشكلٍ كبير. عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) تقدم عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) حل طبقة ثانية لبلوكتشين بيتكوين (Bitcoin Blockchain)، وتقترب حصيلة اكتتابه بسرعةٍ من الوصول إلى 10 مليون دولار. تجدر الإشارة إلى أن الاكتتاب يجمع يومياً تمويلاً يتراوح بين 300,000$ و700,000$، ما يعكس اهتمام كبار المستثمرين القوي بهذا المشروع الجديد. يُعزى ذلك إلى استخداماته الطموحة، فهو يهدف إلى معالجة المشكلات الرئيسية لبلوكتشين بيتكوين (Bitcoin) مثل بطء المعاملات وارتفاع الرسوم وضعف الوظائف. وبفضل تقنية تجميع المعاملات وفق معرفة صفرية (ZK-rollups) وآلة سولانا الافتراضية (SVM) والجسر اللامركزي الخاص بها، ستقدم لكم عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) معاملاتٍ سريعة وآمنة ومنخفضة التكلفة. لذلك، على المهتمين الاستفادة من المرحلة الحالية من الاكتتاب، حيث تُباع العملات بسعر منخفض. علاوةً على ذلك، يقدم المشروع آلية رهن توفر عائداً سنوياً نسبته 113%، ما سيُساعد المستثمرين الأوائل على تحقيق المزيد من الأرباح >> أفكار ختامية: ما هي أفضل عملة رقمية للشراء؟ مع اقتراب موسم العملات البديلة، يواجه مستثمرو الكريبتو فرصة نادرةً لتحقيق أرباح. مع ذلك، يشير اهتمام الحيتان المتزايد بعملة سولانا (Solana) وعملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) -حتى خلال أيام انخفاض أسعار العملات البديلة الأخرى- إلى إمكانية التفوق على السوق. وكما أوضح المحلل جوردون، يُمكن أن توفر العملات ذات القيمة السوقية الكبيرة مثل عملة سولانا (Solana) عوائد تصل إلى 10 أضعاف، بينما قد تحقق المشاريع القوية ذات القيمة السوقية الصغيرة مكاسبَ تتراوح بين 20 إلى 50 ضعفاً. لذلك، قد تُحقق عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) عوائد كبيرةً خلال الأشهر القادمة، نظراً لنجاحها المبكر واستخداماتها الطموحة.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SOL|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img':

A notable Ethena ENA deposit , valued at nearly $9.64 million, has just landed on Binance. This significant movement by a multi-signature address linked to the Ethena project is certainly worth a closer look for anyone following the crypto space. What Exactly Was This Ethena ENA Deposit? Just a short while ago, an address identified as belonging to the Ethena (ENA) project team made a substantial transfer. They deposited a whopping 15 million ENA tokens, equivalent to approximately $9.64 million, directly to the Binance exchange. This information comes from reputable on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who spotted the transaction around 15 minutes after it occurred. For those unfamiliar, Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native, censorship-resistant solution for money. Its native token, ENA, plays a crucial role within its ecosystem, often used for governance and other utility functions. Therefore, any large Ethena ENA deposit from the project’s own wallet naturally draws significant market attention. Why Does a Large Deposit Like This Matter? When a project team moves a substantial amount of its native tokens to an exchange, it often triggers speculation. Such a large Ethena ENA deposit could indicate several things, and understanding these possibilities is key for investors. Typically, these movements are closely watched for their potential impact on token price and market liquidity. Here are a few common reasons for such large deposits: Increasing Liquidity: Teams might deposit tokens to improve liquidity on the exchange, making it easier for users to buy and sell ENA. Market Making Activities: The team could be engaging in market making to ensure stable trading conditions and reduce volatility. Treasury Management: It might be part of the project’s broader treasury management strategy, perhaps to fund operational costs or future development. Token Unlocks or Vesting Schedules: Sometimes, these deposits align with scheduled token unlocks, where previously locked tokens become available. It’s important to remember that not all large deposits are signals of impending sell-offs. Many are routine operational activities designed to support the project’s health and ecosystem. What Could This Ethena ENA Deposit Mean for ENA Holders? For current and potential ENA holders, understanding the implications of this deposit is crucial. While a large influx of tokens onto an exchange can sometimes precede selling pressure, leading to a temporary price dip, it’s not always the case. In fact, if the deposit is for market making or liquidity provision, it could ultimately benefit traders by offering better execution prices. Consider these points: Short-term Volatility: Be prepared for potential short-term price fluctuations as the market digests this news. Long-term Outlook: Focus on Ethena’s fundamentals and development roadmap. A single large transaction, even a significant Ethena ENA deposit , rarely defines a project’s long-term trajectory. Transparency: While the direct reason isn’t always immediately clear, the public nature of blockchain transactions allows for transparency and monitoring. Navigating Crypto Whale Movements: Your Actionable Insights Large transfers from project teams or “whales” are a regular occurrence in the crypto space. Learning to interpret them without panic is a valuable skill. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate such events: Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and official project channels for updates. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t solely rely on speculation. Investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, and recent announcements. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio can also mitigate risks associated with single token movements. Look for Context: Always try to understand the ‘why’ behind a transaction. Is it part of a known vesting schedule? Is the team communicating about it? The recent Ethena ENA deposit to Binance is a prime example of the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While such movements can spark immediate interest and speculation, a balanced perspective, coupled with thorough research, is always the best approach. Keep an eye on Ethena’s official communications and market reaction in the coming days to gain further clarity on this intriguing development. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethena (ENA)? Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to provide a crypto-native, censorship-resistant financial solution. Its native token, ENA, serves various utility and governance purposes within the ecosystem. Q2: How much ENA was deposited to Binance? A multi-signature address associated with the Ethena project deposited 15 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $9.64 million, to Binance. Q3: Who reported this Ethena ENA deposit? On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa reported the significant deposit shortly after it occurred. Q4: Does this deposit mean ENA’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While large deposits can sometimes precede selling pressure, they can also be for purposes like increasing liquidity, market making, or treasury management, which might not negatively impact the price in the long term. It’s crucial to monitor market reactions and project announcements. Q5: What should ENA holders do after this news? ENA holders should stay informed by following official Ethena channels and reputable crypto news sources. It’s advisable to avoid panic, conduct personal research, and consider the broader market context rather than reacting solely to a single transaction.

Active addresses dropped to 38,303 in late August, reflecting weak network support behind price moves. Analyst fractal points to $4.30 breakout, but sustainability is questioned without stronger on-chain activity. Price Pattern Shows Reversal Setup, But Momentum Fades XRP recently formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a structure that often suggests a possible change in trend. The pattern was visible toward the end of July, with the price attempting to break higher. While the setup pointed to a potential reversal, the move stalled shortly after. BitGuru noted that the pattern failed to gain traction. “XRP showed an inverse head & shoulders pattern, but failed to sustain momentum,” they said. The weak breakout left the market open for renewed selling, keeping price movement within a broader downtrend that has been in place since late July. $XRP Battling the Downtrend $XRP showed an inverse head & shoulders pattern, but failed to sustain momentum, keeping sellers active. The market has mostly been tracking a downtrend, with repeated rejections from the $3.10 zone. https://t.co/eUykHZvqSS pic.twitter.com/L0Lfwrs5qc — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) August 27, 2025 Notably, the $3.10 zone has been a consistent resistance level for several weeks. XRP has approached this price multiple times throughout August, but each attempt has been met with selling. None of the rallies managed to stay above it for long. Current market behavior shows hesitation around the same area. Without a strong close above $3.10, supported by buying volume, the market appears to favor the downside. XRP is trading near $3.00, reflecting limited movement over the past day and modest gains for the week. Network Activity Tracks Lower Data from Glassnode shows that XRP’s network usage has declined. As of August 27, the number of active addresses was 38,303. This drop in activity has come despite recent moves in price, which suggests lower engagement from users. Source: Glassnode Earlier in the year, especially in June, active addresses saw spikes well above 500,000. That trend has not continued. Since late July, the numbers have been steady but low, even as XRP reached the $3.40 range in early August. A healthy move up is often supported by growing network use, but that support isn’t visible here. Market Watching Possible Repeat Structure Another view came from Gordon, who pointed to a familiar pattern forming. He posted that the “$XRP fractal [is] looking strong,” adding that “the pump will shock many.” The price is now targeting $4.30, which would mark a new record. However, this setup is similar to previous XRP moves that followed long periods of consolidation. Still, without stronger network signals or a sustained hold above key levels, questions around the move remain.
