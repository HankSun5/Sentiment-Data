For example, Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Bitcoin and Ethereum, you may be familiar with – but what about Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic? What are these? Why do they share such similar names with the two largest cryptocurrencies? BCH, ETC are spin-offs of their original blockchain, and in crypto terms, these are known as “forks.” You’re probably already wondering: what is a fork in crypto, and how do crypto forks work? In this guide, we’ll break down what a fork is in cryptocurrency, why it happens, the different types of forks, and the risks and opportunities it brings for investors. Understanding the Basics of Blockchain Forks The Definition of a Fork in Blockchain A fork in blockchain refers to a change in a cryptocurrency’s underlying code or network. In simple terms, it’s an update to a blockchain’s rules and protocols. The nature of the update might result in minor adjustments to the existing chain or cause a split that creates a new blockchain, a new set of rules, and a new cryptocurrency. How Blockchains Operate Before a Fork Blockchain networks operate on consensus, meaning everyone must agree on the same rules. Since most blockchains are open source, developers can propose changes such as performance upgrades, feature updates, and security improvements. But these changes only happen when the community reaches an agreement. Before a fork occurs, the blockchain operates as a unified system with every participant following the “consensus.” Think of it as a game of cards: if everyone follows the same rulebook, the game runs smoothly. Similarly, a blockchain remains cohesive and synchronized as long as all nodes adhere to the same protocols. Why Forks Are Necessary in Crypto Forks are significant for allowing blockchains to make major changes or enhancements, like creating new features, fixing security vulnerabilities, or speeding up transactions. Without forks, it could be possible for networks to be stuck with old rules and unable to evolve. Forks can also be great for settling disputes in decentralized communities. If the developers, miners, or users can’t come to an agreement on certain changes, such as block size or governance rules, forking allows the network to split, letting differing groups follow their chosen path. Types of Forks in Cryptocurrency There are several blockchain fork types, including hard forks, soft forks, and temporary forks caused by mining conditions. Hard Fork – Permanent Chain Split A Hard Fork occurs when a blockchain undergoes a major upgrade that consists of changes that are completely incompatible with previous consensus rules, transaction structures, or network features. For a hard fork to be legitimized, there needs to be a majority consensus among network stakeholders, and afterward, network participants using the previous version (not willing to upgrade) will no longer have access to the new version. Because a hard fork creates two separate paths, it can lead to the development of new networks, coins, and ecosystems, each with its own rules and governance. Typically, those who prefer the original protocol continue on the old chain. Soft Fork – Backward-Compatible Upgrade A soft fork is a change to a blockchain’s protocol that is backward-compatible. This means participants who do not adopt the new rules (old nodes) are still able to interact with the new blockchain. Soft forks typically introduce smaller, incremental updates, such as improving transaction efficiency, tightening rules for block validation, or adding new features without creating a separate chain. However, for a soft fork to succeed and avoid splitting the network, a majority of participants (miners, validators, or nodes) must adopt the new rules (i.e, upgrade to the new protocol). If not, the minority running outdated software may become orphaned from the network, forming an unintended chain split. Temporary Forks Caused by Mining Race Conditions A temporary fork occurs when two miners find a valid block simultaneously. Both blocks get shared with the network, but since the blockchain can only have one main chain, this creates a brief split called a race condition. A race condition happens when multiple processes access shared data at the same time, and the outcome depends on the order in which they run. Take for example, Block A and Block B. Some network nodes see Block A first while others see Block B, creating two competing versions of the same block. The conflict resolves automatically when the next block is mined – it will attach to one of the competing blocks, making that chain longer. Since the blockchain network always follows the longest valid chain rule, the shorter chain gets abandoned, and its block becomes an orphan block. This type of fork is temporary and does not create a new cryptocurrency. Why Do Forks Happen? While forks often result from disagreements, they play a crucial role in blockchain development. Here are some of the reasons why forks happen: Protocol Upgrades and Feature Additions Major updates sometimes require forks to improve network functionality. A good example is the Ethereum London Hard Fork, which introduced EIP-1559, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that dealt with transaction fee issues and improved overall network use. Bug Fixes and Security Patches There are times when a blockchain finds a significant security vulnerability that requires immediate action. In this case, a fork may help fix bugs and patch vulnerabilities. The Monero blockchain is a great example of a protocol that hard forks frequently to improve security and privacy, ensuring its blockchain is harder to attack or trace. Community Disagreements and Governance Issues Forks give communities the power to choose their own path. If participants disagree on updates, they can branch off. Bitcoin SV (BSV) split from Bitcoin Cash over disputes around block size and governance philosophy. Emergency Responses to Hacks In instances where major breaches take place, forks can be useful for reversing the damage and upgrading security mechanisms. One key example is the Ethereum DAO fork in July 2016, which was executed to reverse a large hack of funds that had been taken and return them to users. Notable Examples of Crypto Forks Some notable crypto fork examples include Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Cash. Let’s get into the details. Bitcoin Cash (Hard Fork of Bitcoin) In 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) split from Bitcoin (BTC) over debates about scalability solutions and transaction fees. Bitcoin processes only 3-7 transactions per second (TPS) compared to VISA’s 24,000 TPS. The status quo was unacceptable to BCH proponents, resulting in a proposal to increase the block sizes to achieve 100-250 TPS with lower fees. Bitcoin supporters argued that increasing the block size to upscale TPS could compromise security or decentralization, while also increasing the cost and energy associated with running nodes. Unable to reach a consensus, the community permanently split: Bitcoin (BTC) maintained small blocks prioritizing security, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chose larger blocks prioritizing transaction speed and lower costs. Ethereum Classic (Hard Fork After The DAO Hack) Ethereum experienced a serious crisis in 2016 when an attacker was able to exploit a vulnerability in the smart contract for the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), stealing about 3.6 million ETH (worth over $50M at the time). The Ethereum community discussed two options: first, do nothing and let the hack stand (an unchanged blockchain) since blockchains are meant to be immutable, or implement a fork and restore the stolen funds. Most of the community chose to reverse the hack, creating a hard fork that became the Ethereum (ETH) we know today. A smaller group, however, rejected this decision, arguing that “code is law” and the blockchain should never be altered. They continued with the original chain, now called Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum London Hard Fork (EIP-1559) August 2021 saw Ethereum activate one of its most significant upgrades, the London Hard Fork. The most important adjustment included in the upgrade was the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Protocols, or EIPs, which are meant to upgrade the network. A major improvement protocol was the EIP-1559, a proposal designed to fix Ethereum’s transaction fee (gas fee) system, which was at the time controversial. Before this upgrade, users had to bid for block space. Block space, in this case, refers to the storage that holds transactions. Because this space is limited, people often compete by paying higher fees to have their transaction picked up by a miner and processed quickly, making costs unpredictable and sometimes very expensive. EIP-1559 replaced this system with a base fee (automatically set by the network) plus a small tip to miners for faster processing. Additionally, the base fee is burned (permanently removed from circulation) instead of going to miners, introducing a deflationary pressure on ETH. The other improvement protocols introduced as part of the Ethereum London Hard Fork include EIP-3198, EIP-3529, EIP-3541, and EIP-3554. All these changes were implemented without splitting the network or creating new coins. Litecoin Forks Litecoin (LTC), often called the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” has also experienced hard and soft forks over the years, most of which were attempts to experiment with faster transactions, lower fees, or new features. Key Litecoin soft forks include: Segregated Witness (SegWit, 2017): This upgrade reduced block size. It also improved scalability and enabled technologies like the Lightning Network. MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB, May 2022): This upgrade allows users to send confidential Litecoin transactions, where the transaction amount is visible only to the sender and receiver. Key Litecoin hard forks include: Litecoin Cash (LCC): LCC forked from Litecoin in February 2018, created by an anonymous team with no connection to the official Litecoin development team. The developers claimed they wanted to improve transaction speeds and reduce fees by 90%, while supporting legacy Bitcoin mining hardware by using the SHA-256 algorithm (unlike Litecoin’s Scrypt). The fork attracted a fair amount of controversy because Litecoin’s founder, Charlie Lee, openly condemned the fork as a scam, telling users to be careful and not to fall victim to it, and also criticizing the efforts behind the fork for taking the Litecoin name without permission. The anonymous team promised holders 10 LCC tokens for every 1 LTC, which was appealing, but the project never took off due to its questionable legitimacy and lack of community support. Feathercoin (FTC): Developed as a fork of Litecoin in April 2013, Peter Bushnell thought he could develop a more user-friendly cryptocurrency that had the potential to address the issues he saw with other coins. The original concept was to create a more accessible and inclusive mining experience (especially for smaller miners) while also providing much faster block times than Bitcoin. Other forks include Junkcoin (JKC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Luckycoin (LKY), Monacoin (MONA), and Einsteinium (EMC2). How Forks Affect Investors and Users While forks often aim to improve scalability, security, or functionality, they can also create uncertainty and opportunities for both investors and users. Here’s how a crypto fork affects investors and users: Impact on Coin Supply and Valuation Forks create new cryptocurrencies, effectively increasing the total circulating supply in the market. This can dilute the value of the original coin unless both chains gain independent traction and community support. When Bitcoin Cash (BCH) forked from Bitcoin in August 2017, both cryptocurrencies maintained significant value. Bitcoin holders automatically received an equal amount of BCH, creating additional value for investors. For unsuccessful forks, initial hype quickly fades and values crash. Projects like Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and numerous other Bitcoin variants struggled to maintain relevance after initial exchange listings. Most of these forks lost over 90% of their value within months, wiping out speculative gains. Basically, you must keep in mind that not all forks create value; many result in worthless tokens. Wallet and Exchange Support The overall success of any fork is dependent on infrastructure adoption, and specifically, if there is support from major wallets and exchanges for the new chain. If there is no support from an exchange or wallet, then users have no way to access or store their new coins, and as a consequence, they cannot trade them. After Ethereum’s controversial split, many of the top exchanges at the time, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, supported both chains. Meaning users could claim their Ethereum Classic (ETC) tokens and immediately trade them. The backing from exchanges ensured both the ETH and ETC chains were able to coexist and thrive. On the other hand, loads of minor forks get little or no exchange support, leaving holders with worthless tokens. MoneroV exemplifies such failure. Before it split from Monero, it promised improvements in scalability, a capped supply, and the incorporation of MimbleWimble, but the project failed spectacularly. MimbleWimble was never implemented, and development stalled. Claiming Forked Coins When a cryptocurrency forks, holders of the original coin typically receive an equal amount of the new token – but only if they claim it correctly. When Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin in August 2017, users needed to import their Bitcoin private keys into Bitcoin Cash wallets to access their free coins. Many people who stored Bitcoin on exchanges had to wait months until those platforms added support for the new coin. Unfortunately, during Bitcoin SV’s split from Bitcoin Cash, technical complications made the process risky and confusing. While major exchanges eventually supported both coins, many users faced weeks or months of delays before they could access their Bitcoin SV tokens. Those who acted quickly often benefited more than casual investors who waited or didn’t understand the claiming process. Market Volatility Around Fork Announcements Fork announcements often cause big swings in crypto prices because investors either hope to get “free” coins from the fork or worry about the network’s stability. Traders may pile into the original coin before the fork, expecting to benefit, while others sell off due to uncertainty about which chain will survive. When Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin, investors who held Bitcoin automatically received Bitcoin Cash as well. This “two coins for one” effect created excitement, increased trading activity, and rewarded early holders generously. On the flip side, the Bitcoin Cash fork, resulting in BSV, fell on the other side of the spectrum. The “hash war,” as it was called, confused investors, led to sharp price drops, and even pulled down the broader crypto market. Risks and Opportunities from Forks Potential Gains from New Coins Hard forks that create a brand-new cryptocurrency are often exciting for investors because they can result in “free money.” When a blockchain splits, anyone who holds the original coin at the time of the fork usually receives an equal amount of the new coin. For example, if you owned two coins on the old chain, you would also automatically get two coins on the new chain. To take advantage of this, investors must ensure their coins are stored in a personal wallet or exchange that officially supports the fork. If the wallet or exchange doesn’t recognize the new chain, you won’t receive the new tokens. Once the new coins are distributed, you can decide what to do with them: sell quickly to lock in a profit, or hold on and hope the value rises over time. Increased Security or Functionality Some forks are created to improve the original blockchain, adding new features, boosting scalability, or patching vulnerabilities. For instance, Litecoin’s MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade introduced optional transaction privacy without creating a new coin. Similar examples include Bitcoin’s SegWit upgrade, Ethereum’s London Hard Fork, and Monero’s regular hard forks for enhanced privacy. When successful, these kinds of forks can make the network more useful and trusted, ultimately benefiting long-term holders. Risk of Scam Forks and Fake Chains Not all forks are made with good intentions. Some developers launch “scam forks” or copycat chains just to cash in on hype, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Sometimes, fake websites or wallets trick users into giving away their private keys while trying to “claim” forked coins. A good example is the wave of low-quality Bitcoin forks that popped up after Bitcoin Cash, many of which disappeared quickly or never gained exchange support. The Future of Forks in Blockchain Development Governance Models to Reduce Disputes Forks often happen because developers, miners, or the community disagree on key decisions about the blockchain, such as governance rules, transaction policies, or the project’s direction. Stronger governance systems in the future could help reduce these disputes. For example, blockchains like Tezos and Polkadot let token holders vote directly on major decisions, from protocol changes to network policies. This kind of on-chain voting allows the community to resolve conflicts without splitting into competing chains, making the network more stable and reducing the chance of contentious hard forks. Shift Toward Layer 2 Upgrades Instead of Forks Instead of changing the core blockchain through forks, many projects are now turning to “Layer 2” solutions to improve speed and reduce costs. These are upgrades that run on top of the main chain rather than altering it directly. For instance, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum’s rollups are Layer 2 technologies that boost scalability without needing a risky fork. After the Ethereum Merge of 2022, the blockchain became a stronger base for Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. These networks help lower transaction fees, increase throughput, and support wider adoption of decentralized applications. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Fork Impacts As blockchains become more connected, a fork on one network can affect many others. For example, an Ethereum fork can impact not just ETH, but also tokens, NFTs, and apps built on its network. Chains linked by bridges or cross-chain protocols can also be disrupted if rules change. This means developers must carefully plan forks to avoid disrupting multiple ecosystems at once.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|ETC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-27 22:40:37

Solana has remained one of the most closely watched names in the sector, while Ethereum’s newest meme-driven Layer 2 project, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), is starting to dominate presale chatter. Investors are now asking whether the Solana price forecast can play out with a push toward $400 in the short term, or if smaller tokens with meme appeal are where the bigger money will be made. Solana price forecast The Solana price forecast has turned increasingly optimistic, as the network proves itself with speed, efficiency, and reliability. SOL’s ability to handle large transaction volumes with ultra-low fees makes it a go-to blockchain for developers, particularly in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Activity on the chain has stayed high, with fresh launches continuing even during market slowdowns. Its NFT ecosystem, once a surprise to many, has matured into one of the strongest in crypto, and major platforms keep building on it. This steady developer engagement reinforces Solana’s position as not just a fast chain, but one with real adoption across multiple sectors. Institutional players are also paying closer attention. Funds that once ignored altcoins are now including SOL in their portfolios, citing its proven track record and efficiency compared to competitors. If SOL can sustain momentum, analysts believe the token could hit the $400 level within the next 90 days, a move that would confirm it as one of the most resilient large-cap cryptos in the market. Why Layer Brett is gaining traction While Solana provides stability, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is offering something different: meme culture fused with Ethereum Layer 2 scalability. Built on Ethereum’s scaling network, it delivers near-instant transfers and ultra-low fees, avoiding the congestion problems that plague Layer 1 tokens. At the same time, it embraces the viral power of meme coins, making it highly visible across trading communities. The presale has already been busy, drawing in both retail traders and early whales. Tokens are being snapped up at entry-level prices, with staking rewards hitting thousands of percent APY – a figure that naturally creates excitement among speculative buyers. What sets Layer Brett apart, however, is that it doesn’t stop at hype. Its roadmap features NFT integrations, gamified staking models, and cross-chain compatibility, ensuring there are new reasons for users to stay engaged long after launch. This approach has drawn comparisons to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two of the most successful meme tokens ever. But while those projects relied heavily on culture and community alone, Layer Brett begins with actual infrastructure. Its capped supply of 10 billion tokens introduces scarcity, while its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation ensures scalability that earlier meme coins lacked. Many traders now see $LBRETT as not just another meme token but potentially the next 45x opportunity as the market heads into 2025. Final thoughts The Solana price forecast shows the potential for SOL to reach $400 in the near term, reinforcing its role as a top-tier blockchain. Its mix of speed, adoption, and institutional interest keeps it in the spotlight for investors who want reliability and growth. At the same time, the buzz around Layer Brett highlights a shift in focus toward meme coins that offer more than hype. With Ethereum Layer 2 power, staking rewards, and an ambitious roadmap, $LBRETT is emerging as one of the most talked-about presales of the year. For investors, the choice is clear: Solana offers steady progress and institutional recognition, while Layer Brett brings high-risk, high-reward energy with the possibility of explosive returns.

50785794,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=793662,1756335476,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50785794.jpeg,"Nvidia smashes Q2 earnings with numbers too good for its stock, turns Wall Street bearish",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-q2-earnings-too-good-for-its-stock/,"Nvidia reported second-quarter earnings, delivering $46.7 billion in revenue, a rise of 6% from Q1 and 56% higher than the same quarter last year, according to an earnings report published Tuesday. But the market didn’t reward it. Instead, the stock dipped in extended trading as the company’s data center unit, which Wall Street treats like the heartbeat of its AI engine, underperformed estimates again. The numbers weren’t soft. Nvidia’s Blackwell Data Center revenue climbed 17% quarter-over-quarter, showing demand is still running hot. But expectations were too high for just “hot.” The company also revealed that it made zero sales of its H20 AI chips to Chinese customers during Q2. Instead, it leaned on a $180 million inventory release of previously held H20 units and sold around $650 million worth of unrestricted H20 chips to one buyer outside China. It helped smooth out the financials, but it didn’t fix the market’s mood. Nvidia pads margins and EPS with inventory release, skips China Gross margins were 72.4% GAAP and 72.7% non-GAAP. Without the $180 million bump from that inventory release, the non-GAAP margin would’ve been 72.3%. The company also printed $1.08 in GAAP EPS and $1.05 in non-GAAP EPS. Again, take out the H20 trick and tax adjustment, and the number drops to $1.04 per share. In the middle of all this, CEO Jensen Huang threw the spotlight on the company’s flagship AI product line. “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap,” Jensen said , adding that production of Blackwell Ultra chips was moving fast. He said demand is “extraordinary.” He also highlighted Nvidia’s NVLink rack-scale computing, calling it “revolutionary” and claiming it arrives just in time to handle the load from new reasoning-based AI models. While AI demand might be “extraordinary,” investors clearly expected more. Despite Nvidia’s year-to-date stock gain of 35%, and its 2024 run where it almost tripled, the stock still dropped after the bell. That’s two quarters in a row where the data center segment missed analyst estimates. Wall Street doesn’t care how fast the chips are if the money doesn’t land exactly where expected. Company ramps up buybacks, eyes $54 billion in Q3 revenue The company’s shareholder returns in the first half of fiscal 2026 were heavy. Nvidia gave back $24.3 billion in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. At the end of Q2, it still had $14.7 billion left in buyback authorization. Then on August 26, the board added another $60 billion, with no expiration date. Nvidia also announced that its next dividend will be $0.01 per share, payable on October 2, 2025, to shareholders who are on the books by September 11, 2025. Looking ahead, the company’s Q3 revenue forecast came in at $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. Just like this quarter, Nvidia expects no sales of H20 chips to China in that period either. The company forecasted gross margins of 73.3% GAAP and 73.5% non-GAAP, with a 50 basis point wiggle room either way. It also said it expects to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70s. Operating expenses are set to climb. Nvidia projected $5.9 billion GAAP and $4.2 billion non-GAAP for Q3. The company also told investors to expect high-30% full-year growth in overall operating costs. For non-core income, it expects $500 million, excluding swings in private or public equity holdings. Tax rates are locked at 16.5%, give or take 1%, unless anything unusual happens. Even with all this, the market wasn’t thrilled. The same company that helped ignite the AI trade and posted one of the largest rallies in 2024 is now being punished for delivering “just strong” instead of “insane.” Wall Street gave Nvidia credit for revolutionizing compute. But now, it’s demanding faster, bigger, and somehow cleaner growth, even when margins are north of 70% and revenue is climbing by billions every few months.

Some chase quick attention, while others focus on building systems that deliver real value. In 2025, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a clear example of how utility is overtaking hype as the true measure of success. The projects gaining momentum are those proving their worth through working tools and active communities. BlockDAG’s mobile mining model, for example, shows how participation can directly translate into ownership and growth. From BDAG’s presale achievements to scalable smart contract platforms, the top trending cryptos of 2025 are setting the stage for adoption, usability, and sustainable expansion. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Proves Mining Can Deliver Real Value BlockDAG is reshaping the idea of mobile mining by turning it into something tangible. Where projects like Pi Network attracted millions without providing actual payouts, BlockDAG’s X1 app has already brought in over 2.5 million daily users who mine BDAG coins that will be credited directly to their wallets at launch. This makes it a system designed for real rewards, not just promises. The presale has been a strong indicator of demand. With $385 million raised and more than 25.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is currently in batch 30 for $0.03. Early participants have already seen returns climb by 2,900% since batch 1, showing the scale of growth in a short time. Supporting this momentum is an ecosystem of infrastructure. BlockDAG offers hardware mining devices like the X10, X30, and X100, partnerships with professional sports teams, and confirmed listings on 20 major exchanges. With referral rewards, an educational academy, and gamified tools like Buyer Battles, BlockDAG has secured its place among the top trending cryptos of 2025. 2. Stellar (XLM): Edge in Global Payments Stellar has maintained its reputation as a network built for fast and affordable cross-border payments. With its early partnership with IBM and strong focus on unbanked communities, it carved out a unique role in financial inclusion. Even as growth has slowed compared to its early momentum, XLM remains a credible option for institutions seeking reliability. The ability to move funds across borders in seconds with minimal fees keeps Stellar relevant in regions where traditional remittance systems remain costly. While it lacks the complex smart contract functions of newer chains, its lean and efficient design makes it stand out. That strength ensures Stellar stays among the top trending cryptos for those looking at practical financial utility. 3. Algorand (ALGO): Quiet but Powerful Expansion Algorand continues to impress by delivering steady progress rather than chasing headlines. Founded by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor and Turing Award winner, the network’s Pure Proof of Stake design supports low-cost, secure, and high-throughput transactions. Its structure has positioned it as a reliable chain for both governments and enterprises. With use cases ranging from Central Bank Digital Currency pilots to national land registries, Algorand’s influence is broadening. The ecosystem is also welcoming more DeFi and NFT projects, thanks to fast finality and its carbon-neutral approach. Though it avoids wild price swings, ALGO is securing long-term credibility. This measured growth places Algorand firmly among the top trending cryptos with sustainable adoption potential. 4. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise-Grade Momentum Hedera brings a unique model to the table with its hashgraph consensus, allowing thousands of transactions per second with near-instant finality. This makes HBAR particularly suited for industries demanding speed and security. Its governance council, featuring companies like Google, IBM, Boeing, and LG, shows the scale of confidence it commands at the enterprise level. What makes Hedera especially compelling is its adoption in real-world applications like identity verification, secure data storage, and high-volume payments. With Fortune 500 firms actively building on its network, Hedera has validation that many competitors lack. While not yet a favorite for retail traders, its enterprise credibility ensures HBAR’s place among the top trending cryptos, where speculation meets powerful infrastructure. Quick Recap The time for empty promises is ending, and the spotlight is shifting to projects that provide utility, access, and meaningful growth. BlockDAG is showing this shift clearly, with mobile mining that delivers real payouts, a $385 million presale backed by strong ROI, and a community of millions already engaged worldwide. As the industry matures, focus is moving toward projects with traction and proven value. The top trending cryptos of 2025 will be those that combine adoption with long-term relevance, offering users impact that goes far beyond speculation.

50787744,566278,1756335613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50787744.jpeg,Is Dogecoin On Discount? Whales Go To Market With 32.9 Million DOGE Withdrawal From Binance,https://bitcoinist.com/is-dogecoin-on-discount/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in focus as whale activity ramps up despite the latest market correction. New on-chain data reveals that millions of DOGE are being transferred from Binance to private wallets, suggesting that major holders may view the current pullback as a prime entry point. With prices sliding from recent highs, whales also appear to be seizing the opportunity to accumulate tokens at a discount. Whales Move Millions Of Dogecoin From Binance On-chain data from multi-chain AI analytics platform Nansen has sparked renewed interest in Dogecoin after a major transaction was spotted on the blockchain. According to the platform, a newly created wallet withdrew 32.9 million DOGE, worth approximately $6.96 million, from Binance on August 26. Notably, large withdrawals of this kind are often associated with accumulation trends , particularly when directed toward self-custody wallets rather than exchanges. Commenting on the transfer, a crypto community member noted that new wallet activity of this scale usually signals a player gearing up for big moves. As a result, he urged market participants to monitor the wallet address closely. Not long after the first large-scale transfer, another whale made a similar move, withdrawing 20 million DOGE valued at $4.43 million. Nansen reveals that in total, the whale now holds an impressive 52.9 million DOGE, which amounts to roughly $11.71 million at current market prices. The rapid succession of these whale transfers suggests a growing confidence among large holders. Historically, sizeable withdrawals from exchanges have been associated with bullish sentiment, as they often suggest that investors prefer holding assets long-term rather than keeping them on platforms where they could be quickly liquidated. The timing of the withdrawals is also particularly interesting given Dogecoin’s prolonged decline , which may be encouraging deep-pocketed investors to buy tokens at much lower prices . DOGE Whale Accumulation Grows Amid Price Correction While whales initiate withdrawals from exchanges , on-chain metrics reveal a broader pattern of Dogecoin accumulation among large holders during the recent market downturn . According to data from Santiment, the 50-day average of large DOGE transfers, valued at $100,000 or higher, surged significantly in August, marking the highest level in five months. Alongside the rise in high-value transactions, Dogecoin’s daily active addresses have also increased significantly, marking their highest surge this month, around August 13. This suggests that not only are whales increasing their stakes, but network activity is showing renewed strength. Notably, the accumulation comes in the wake of a 16% price drop for Dogecoin from $0.245 on August 24. Following the correction , the meme coin has staged a mild recovery of 4.69% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.219. CoinMarketCap data also shows that despite a monthly decline of over 10%, Dogecoin has managed a weekly gain of about 3.2%. However, not all indicators are bullish. Daily trading volume has declined sharply, down 36.15% as of writing, and presently sitting at $2.1 billion.",Dogecoin|binance|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Nansen|Santiment,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-27 23:00:13

The move has triggered a renewed optimism among traders who see the ascending triangle pattern forming on the charts as a potential launchpad for a breakout toward $255. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Set To Hit $4 If It Breaks This Resistance Line According to analyst Lark Davis, Solana has been rejected three times at the $205 mark, but higher lows and sustained buying pressure suggest that momentum is building. “If volume continues to rise into this test, the setup points clearly to $255 as the next target,” Davis explained. Trading activity supports that outlook, with more than $9 billion in daily volume underscoring strong market participation. Technical Indicators Signal Solana Stability Market data shows Solana is not yet in overbought territory, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting at 55.63. This gives the cryptocurrency room to climb further without triggering immediate selling pressure. The MACD indicator has also confirmed a bullish crossover, aligning with the positive momentum. On-chain signals strengthen the case for upside. Solana’s trading volume is steadily increasing, while its clean rebounds from the ascending trendline highlight active buying on every dip. Market analyst Alex Clay further pointed out a completed W-bottom pattern on the SOL/BTC chart, suggesting Solana may outperform Bitcoin in the short term, just as Ethereum recently did. Outlook: Path Toward $255 Breakout For traders, the $205 level has become the decisive battleground. A confirmed breakout above it, supported by strong volume and sentiment, could propel Solana to the $255 technical target. SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview The broader crypto market backdrop also favors SOL, with Ethereum’s rally drawing attention to high-potential altcoins. Analysts caution that failure to hold above $205 could delay the move higher, leaving Solana stuck in its current consolidation zone. With institutional interest in Solana growing and network activity reaching record levels, the token remains one of the most closely watched assets in the market.

This explosive growth is fueling speculation that MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the kind of breakout Ethereum experienced in its early years. At the same time, Ethereum itself is dominating headlines with record-breaking ETF inflows, expanding DeFi dominance, and bullish price predictions from top analysts. Together, Ethereum’s institutional success and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s grassroots momentum highlight two powerful forces shaping the next phase of the crypto bull market. Ethereum ETFs Break Records as Institutional Demand Surges Ethereum (ETH) continues to attract massive institutional capital in 2025. In August alone, spot Ethereum ETFs brought in $2.3 billion , equal to 500,000 ETH — matching the network’s issuance since the 2022 Merge. A single day even saw $1 billion of inflows into nine spot ETFs, marking the largest daily inflow in Ethereum’s history. Leading the charge is the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) , which acquired over 150,000 ETH in August. Across all issuers, Ethereum ETFs now manage a staggering $19.2 billion in assets , with nearly $2 billion added in Q3 alone. ETH/USD Chart: TradingView This surge comes as regulatory clarity strengthens Ethereum’s position: the SEC reclassified ETH as a utility token , and the CLARITY Act officially recognized Ethereum as a digital commodity. These moves have paved the way for greater institutional adoption and financial integration. Ethereum Ecosystem Growth Reaches New Highs Beyond ETFs, Ethereum’s network fundamentals are stronger than ever: DeFi Dominance: Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has soared to $97 billion , accounting for 65% of all blockchain DeFi activity. Protocols like Aave, Lido, and Uniswap are leading this charge. Record Network Activity: With over 1.74 million daily transactions and 680,000 active addresses , Ethereum is busier than ever. The gas limit increase to 45 million has helped meet demand. Staking Surge: Over 36 million ETH is staked , representing nearly 30% of circulating supply. A recent mega-stake of 269,485 ETH by a suspected early Bitcoin whale highlighted deep institutional trust. Layer 2 Expansion: Arbitrum and Optimism now handle 60% of Ethereum’s transactions , offering sub-$0.01 gas fees and growing their TVLs to $10.4B and $5.6B respectively. Meanwhile, experts are extremely bullish on ETH price action. Tom Lee raised his 2025 target to $15,000 , while Arthur Hayes predicts ETH could soar to $20,000 this cycle . Standard Chartered holds a more conservative $7,500 target, but all forecasts point to Ethereum’s continued dominance. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Big Presale? While Ethereum is proving itself as the king of institutional adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating massive retail buzz . With its presale already exceeding $13 million , the project is quickly building a strong community foundation that could fuel breakout growth once it hits major exchanges. Smart money inflows show whales are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , signaling growing confidence from early large-scale investors. This type of accumulation often precedes major price breakouts, as experienced traders tend to position themselves well before mainstream hype arrives. MAGACOIN FINANCE successfully completed a full smart contract audit by HashEx, attracting investor attention. This clear approval has made buyers accumulate MAGA tokens heavily. With strong foundations in place, the audit adds another layer of trust to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation. With its fast-rising presale already crossing impressive funding milestones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being included in several analysts’ lists of the Best Cryptos to Buy for the upcoming multi-year bull market. Backed by strong community energy and early whale interest, it could become one of the standout performers of 2025. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Follow Ethereum’s Path? Ethereum’s early investors saw unimaginable returns, with ETH skyrocketing from under $1 to thousands of dollars per token. While MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t aiming to replace Ethereum, its high demand + presale momentum formula could generate similar explosive results for early holders. The project’s trajectory shows strong parallels: Ethereum Early Days: Grassroots excitement, massive upside potential, and early adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE Today: Surging presale growth, viral buying demand, and perfect timing in a bullish crypto market. Ethereum’s success can be seen as a representation of the power held by institutions, whereas MAGACOIN FINANCE is the energy coming from the retail investors that have been the hallmark of crypto bull runs. With Ethereum breaking institutional records and MAGACOIN FINANCE igniting retail FOMO, investors in Q4 2025 have two clear paths to growth — and the chance to catch the next breakout success story. Final Thoughts Ethereum is cementing its position as the backbone of institutional crypto adoption, but retail investors are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE as the most explosive upside potential. Ethereum ETFs & DeFi dominance show how far the network has come. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $13M presale milestone : The $13M presale of MAGACOIN Finance underlines the impressive traction of a strong community-led growth. For investors seeking the next big opportunity , MAGACOIN FINANCE could very well be the best crypto presale to watch in 2025 , with the potential to deliver returns that echo Ethereum’s legendary breakout.

The platform has been touted as a milestone in the ongoing effort to connect decentralized finance (DeFi) with the infrastructure and rules of traditional markets, as it opens the door for institutional investors to easily access on-chain liquidity while still being compliant with regulatory standards. Horizon combines the compliance needs of regulated institutions with the open, composable infrastructure of Aave’s decentralized protocols. According to Aave Labs , institutions will be able to borrow stablecoins such as USDC, GHO, and Ripple Labs’ RLUSD against RWAs, including tokenized Treasuries, corporate bonds, and collateralized loan obligations. The platform operates on a permissioned instance of Aave V3, ensuring issuers comply with regulatory checks while preserving composability in stablecoin lending markets. Horizon combines compliance with composability Horizon balances two worlds that rarely meet. On one hand, collateral must come from issuers who clear regulatory checks, ensuring that the assets being posted are compliant. On the other hand, the borrowing side remains permissionless, so stablecoin markets like its stablecoin GHO, USDC, and Ripple Labs’ RLUSD can remain open and composable with the rest of DeFi. That hybrid structure is what Aave Labs believes will unlock institutional confidence. Horizon also integrates Chainlink’s SmartData infrastructure, such as the Onchain Net Asset Value (NAV) reporting and Proof of Reserves feeds, to continuously verify the value and collateralization of tokenized assets. Aave Labs has big-name partners lined up Aave didn’t launch Horizon in isolation. It arrives with a roster of well-known financial institutions and tokenization players already signed on. Partners include Circle, VanEck, Securitize, Superstate, Centrifuge, WisdomTree, and Hamilton Lane, among others. On day one, Horizon will support tokenized assets like Superstate’s USTB and USCC Treasury funds, Circle’s USYC short-duration yield fund, Centrifuge’s JAAA and JTRSY loan tokens, and VanEck’s VBILL Treasury bills. These aren’t fringe experiments; they’re some of the most credible efforts to bring U.S. Treasuries and other traditional fixed-income products on-chain. More capital into the $25B RWA market More than $25 billion worth of tokenized RWAs are already circulating on public blockchains. But most of that capital is kept in legacy structures, with Ethereum accounting for a sizeable chunk of the market. Horizon changes that dynamic by turning tokenized Treasuries and similar products into active collateral for stablecoin borrowing. That move doesn’t just expand liquidity in DeFi markets; it also creates new revenue streams for the Aave DAO, which governs the Aave ecosystem. For DeFi, the potential is significant. If tokenized RWAs become reliable collateral, it could deepen on-chain liquidity pools, reduce reliance on volatile crypto-native assets, and accelerate adoption by institutions that have so far hesitated. “Horizon is a very exciting new chapter in Aave’s development and really shows the next stage of the DeFi industry,” said Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink. “We are very excited to be a key partner for Aave’s Horizon plan and are looking forward to enabling it to be highly secure, reliable, and connected to leading financial institutions.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

South Korean Lawmakers: PEPE, XRP-Keen The administration of President Lee Jae-myung has talked of deregulating the crypto markets and ushering in the “KOSPI 5000 era.” Authorities plan to nearly double fines for companies and individuals found guilty of deliberate accounting fraud and introduce new penalties for corporate leaders who order such misconduct. https://t.co/InaV8tnh6b — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 27, 2025 The President wants to promote capital market revitalization, usher in new stablecoin- and crypto-powered investment growth, and breathe new life into the stagnant South Korean stock market. The media outlet said that it had analysed changes to the National Assembly’s Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee’s members’ assets since their last public declarations in March this year. The newspaper wrote that the 16 lawmakers who make up the committee have “focused their investments on cryptoassets such as XRP and PEPE, overseas tech stocks, and unlisted shares.

(Source: @jinjongoh_official/Instagram) The probe found that Jin is currently holding XRP 3,359, XCORE 8, and 214 Paycoin (PCI). The dollar value of these coins has “quadrupled” in recent months, rising from $1,768 to $9,579, the outlet wrote. However, South Korean law also requires lawmakers to disclose assets belonging to their immediate family. This measure was introduced to ensure lawmakers cannot hide their income and assets by registering them in family members’ names. The investigation revealed that Jin’s mother “diversified her crypto portfolio.” She is currently holding a range of metaverse and GameFi-related coins. Her holdings include Bitcoin, Chiliz, and Sandbox. She has also bought over 3.2 billion Pepe (PEPE) coins. US Tech Stocks Also Popular On the other side of the house, crypto enthusiasm is also high.

Others have spent money on unlisted gaming stocks, buying shares in developers such as Xten Games and Memray.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. China’s growing focus on stablecoins is less about embracing crypto and more about defending its currency from U.S. dollar dominance, says Dr. Vera Yuen of Hong Kong University's Business School, who argues the shift highlights offshore opportunities but also deep domestic limits. Beijing's shift comes as Washington moved first to create a regulatory framework for the stablecoin industry in the U.S. Reuters recently reported that China's State Council is reviewing a roadmap for yuan-backed stablecoins later this month, with Hong Kong and Shanghai expected to fast-track adoption. In an earlier interview, Animoca Group president Evan Auyang told CoinDesk the trigger was the U.S. GENIUS Act, which cements dollar-pegged tokens as part of global finance. He said the law is “pressuring China to act a lot faster,” pushing Beijing to consider stablecoins not as speculative instruments, as once described by the People's Bank of China, but as necessary infrastructure to keep pace in global trade and settlement. Yuen said the government first prioritized the e-CNY , its Central Bank Digital Currency, because it offered control, traceability, and seigniorage profits — features that regulators valued over those of privately issued tokens. But she noted that stablecoins have a clear edge in international use. “Many CBDCs are developed for domestic use, so for international use of CBDCs, there is a big problem of interoperability of different systems. Stablecoins are designed to be used internationally, so it can be a better option for cross-border transactions,” she told CoinDesk. ""Focusing on stablecoins allows China to respond proactively to global regulatory debates and technological advances, ensuring it remains competitive and prepared as the digital currency landscape evolves,"" Yuen continued. Capital controls still mean any yuan token will stay offshore, with Hong Kong’s new regime providing the testing ground. However, limited CNH liquidity underscores how narrow the runway is for China’s internationalization push. ""This would limit the issuance of offshore renminbi stablecoins, constraining its attractiveness as a means of payment,"" Yuen said. China is also not moving in isolation. In Japan, Monex Group is preparing to issue a yen-backed stablecoin tied to government bonds, joining other domestic players such as SBI and JPYC. Unlike China, however, where capital controls push experimentation offshore, Japan’s regulators are laying the groundwork for stablecoins to circulate at home, signaling Asia’s broader race to keep pace with U.S. dollar tokens. For now, Beijing’s stablecoin experiment looks less like a replacement for the e-CNY and more like a cautious complement, a way to extend the yuan’s reach abroad without loosening its grip at home. Market Movements BTC: BTC held at $111K as Nvidia posted strong earnings. ETH: ETH is trading at $4,500, and history shows that a green August often precedes a 60% year-end rally, though typically after a September dip. Gold: Gold traded Wednesday at $3,443 per ounce, up 1.6% from Tuesday’s close, extending a 37% year-over-year rally, though prices slipped in early trading as attention turned to Nvidia earnings and Trump’s Fed feud. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.2% Wednesday, pushing Wall Street to a new all-time high ahead of Nvidia’s earnings.

Many are seeking early-stage projects with strong fundamentals that can outperform established giants. Hidden gem presales are attracting attention not only for their upside potential but also for their ability to outpace even blue-chip tokens. Among the fresh names making waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about projects, with analysts linking it to extraordinary ROI projections. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight The MAGACOIN FINANCE forecast is shaking up discussions across trading circles. Analysts are projecting a staggering 22,500% return, pushing it far ahead of traditional players. Touted as one of the best crypto presale events of 2025, expectations now suggest a possible 40x rise. The excitement is driven by strong community backing and capped availability, which has fueled urgency among those chasing early entry. In comparison to legacy coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the bold new contender—an option for those hunting presales with high ROI . A Legitimate Presale Offering Safe Entry for 2025 Crypto Investors Few projects combine legitimacy and early-stage opportunity like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is why it’s ranked among the best crypto presales for 2025 . With verified audit results, a transparent roadmap, and a compliant team structure, the project sets a new standard in presale safety. This foundation is what gives MAGACOIN FINANCE its growing reputation as one of the most promising altcoins in the space. 2. Cardano: Q4 Upgrades and Bullish Outlook The Cardano price outlook for 2025 has been steadily improving thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Analysts remain optimistic: Digital Coin Price sees ADA climbing as high as $2.69 with an average of $2.46. CoinCodex pushes the ceiling even higher, projecting a $5.33 maximum target. Whale activity is also ramping up, with 200 million ADA bought in just 48 hours. Beyond speculation, Cardano is actively building. Hydra’s Layer-2 scaling reached one million transactions per second in tests, while Project Acropolis is cutting sync times by 40%. Cardano 1Y price chart With ETF approval odds surging past 80% on Polymarket, bullish bets are growing stronger. This makes Cardano one of the top crypto investments 2025 could deliver. 3. MATIC/POL: Bold Targets and Expanding Utility Polygon has undergone one of the most ambitious transitions in the space with its full migration to POL. The MATIC bullish prediction for 2025 paints an aggressive picture: Flitpay puts the top target at $6.25. TokenMetrics anticipates $3.91 by year-end. Participation in the migration has exceeded 85%, highlighting strong community support. Polygon’s AggLayer and Chain Development Kit are unlocking cross-chain liquidity, while 100 million POL are allocated yearly for project growth. With predictions spanning from $0.47 at the low end to multiple dollars in bullish scenarios, the MATIC bullish prediction narrative is hard to ignore. Like Cardano, Polygon is positioning itself among the top crypto investments 2025 watchers are tracking closely. Final Word: Which Hidden Gem Presales Stand Out? For those eyeing hidden gem presales, the field looks stacked with opportunities. Cardano and MATIC remain strong candidates thanks to robust development and institutional interest. However, the MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one turning heads with its bold 22,500% ROI projection. The limited entry slots and a fast-growing community narrative make it one of the presales with high ROI traders don’t want to overlook. In short, while ADA and MATIC are cementing their place as reliable long-term holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in as the rising star tipped as the best crypto presale of 2025.

This came after the administration secured an $11 billion equity deal with Intel, raising questions about whether similar stakes would be taken in other chipmakers. Speaking Wednesday on Fox Business, Bessent told Maria Bartiromo that Nvidia “doesn’t need financial support,” shutting down speculation immediately. He explained that the Intel deal was about taxpayers getting a return, not handouts. “President Trump is going to be the only president in modern times who creates assets for the American people rather than debt,” Bessent said. “We looked, he saw that Intel had been given grants, and wanted to know why the American taxpayer wouldn’t participate in the upside. So there’s $11 billion of immediate value. And I think there’s a very good chance here that it could be much more.” Bessent says future equity deals may target other U.S. industries Pressed by Bartiromo on whether Trump would back a stake in Nvidia, Bessent made the administration’s position clear: “I don’t think Nvidia needs financial support. So, you know, that that seems not on the table right now.” But he didn’t rule out other industries. “Could there be other industries where we’re reshaping—something like shipbuilding? Sure. There could be things like that. And these are critical industries that we have to be self-sufficient in the United States.” Bessent didn’t try to sell it as just another industrial strategy. He tied it directly to national survival, saying the COVID-19 pandemic showed how fragile the U.S. was. He called the pandemic a “beta” test for a kinetic war, pointing to America’s deep reliance on foreign manufacturing. “Think about it, 80-90% of the precursor pharma products are made overseas. And that’s just unacceptable,” Bessent said . “As we saw during COVID, the manufacturing countries will keep it for themselves.” The Intel move has already stirred up Republican backlash, with lawmakers split. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., didn’t hold back: “The U.S. federal government should not be buying companies,” he told Fox News Digital. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the CHIPS Act’s lead sponsors, also criticized the strategy. “It was not the intent of the law, you know, an equity stake to be taken,” Young said. “But it was the intent to ensure that we enhance our economic security and national security, which is the objective that they are trying, that the administration is trying to advance.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The reason? Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on Indian goods officially took effect Wednesday, and the hit is brutal. According to Reuters, trade analysts expect India’s exports to shrink by over 40%, a $37 billion blow in this April–March fiscal year. That crater is coming straight for labor-heavy industries like gems, textiles, and jewelry. These sectors are employment engines. Tens of thousands of jobs are now hanging by a thread. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hasn’t made a direct statement, but his silence is already costing him. With elections coming up in Bihar, a key rural state, his voter base is on edge. He’s responded with tax relief pledges, including a plan to slash goods and services taxes by October. The U.S. tariffs are a direct response to India’s increased trade with Russia, particularly in energy. Washington sees the flow of discounted oil as undermining Western pressure on Moscow. India refuses to stop buying oil as U.S. talks heat up Since early 2022, India’s oil imports from Russia have exploded. Russian crude now accounts for nearly 40% of all oil India buys, up from virtually nothing before the Ukraine invasion. Indian companies like Reliance Industries, owned by Mukesh Ambani, lead those purchases, and they’ve locked in discounts as high as 7% below global rates. Replacing that volume overnight is out of the question. India imports around 2 million barrels of Russian oil per day. If it stops, internal government estimates say global oil could surge to $200 per barrel. No one in New Delhi wants to carry that blame. India’s foreign ministry has defended the Russian oil purchases as “meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer,” calling them a necessity forced by global conditions. At the same time, officials are accusing Washington of hypocrisy. But while Trump attacks India over crude, the U.S. still buys Russian uranium hexafluoride, palladium, and fertilizer. India’s diplomats also point out that China’s oil imports from Russia have jumped from 13% to 16%, yet no penalties have landed on Beijing. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking on CNBC last week, said India’s behavior amounts to profiteering, calling the volume of post-war purchases “unacceptable.” That interview triggered the latest wave of friction. India argues that the Biden administration had previously supported its Russian oil purchases in order to help keep global fuel prices stable. Trump’s reversal now puts Modi in a bind—with Russia relying on India to maintain oil exports and the U.S. threatening long-term trade consequences. India juggles diplomacy as rivals eye its market share In recent days, Indian diplomats have made trips to Moscow to smooth ties. Modi is also expected to visit China this month, the first in over seven years, to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. He’ll meet both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping there. But Indian officials say no trilateral summit is planned. Trust with Beijing is still fragile following the 2020 border clash, and Delhi is playing cautious. Happymon Jacob, who leads the Council for Strategic and Defence Research in Delhi, laid out India’s tightrope walk. He said the country still needs Russia for weapons, oil, diplomatic support, and help on key political matters. But he also called the U.S. India’s most important strategic partner, noting: “India simply doesn’t have the luxury of choosing one over the other, at least not yet.” The U.S.–India fallout is already affecting more than just oil and trade. Experts say visa access for Indian tech workers and the offshoring of services may be the next friction points. And even if India manages to claw back some relief from the tariffs, the long-term effects could be devastating. Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI and a former trade official, warned that countries like Vietnam, China, Mexico, Turkey, Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala, and Kenya are ready to snap up the markets India is being forced out of. “They could lock India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled back,” Srivastava said.

Is This New Coin Set To Take The Shine Off Ripple’s 2025 Run?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/where-next-2-50-or-4-50-is-this-new-coin-set-to-take-the-shine-off-ripples-2025-run/,"The XRP Price Prediction has once again become a major talking point as Ripple’s token struggles to hold momentum. After a strong recovery earlier this year, XRP has slowed near the $0.60–$0.70 range, leaving traders divided. Some analysts believe a rally toward $2.50 is possible if broader sentiment turns bullish, while the more optimistic forecasts suggest a climb as high as $4.50 during the 2025 bull cycle. At the same time, a new meme-powered Ethereum Layer 2 project, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), has entered the conversation. With its mix of culture, speed, and staking rewards, it is already being discussed as a potential breakout that could rival some of the biggest names in the altcoin market. XRP price prediction in focus XRP has long been a controversial yet resilient asset in the crypto space. Despite ongoing legal hurdles with the SEC, it remains one of the largest tokens by market cap, supported by Ripple’s global payment network and partnerships with financial institutions. Bulls argue that if Ripple secures more adoption deals, XRP could revisit the $2.50 level in the next cycle. For the more ambitious predictions of $4.50 to materialize, however, the project will need to not only expand its institutional base but also regain speculative momentum among retail traders. Historically, XRP’s biggest rallies have come when both factors align. Without retail excitement, even strong fundamentals may not be enough to push it into new highs. Ethereum Layer 2 coins stealing the spotlight While XRP continues to battle resistance, traders are also scanning for coins that combine hype with technical innovation. Ethereum Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism have already shown how scaling solutions can unlock activity at lower costs. Building on this trend, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) has quickly emerged as a presale favorite. Unlike XRP, which is driven largely by institutional adoption, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is tapping into retail energy while adding real blockchain features. The team has laid out a roadmap that includes NFT tie-ins, gamified staking models, and future cross-chain links, all designed to keep the community active well beyond its presale phase. Traders on major forums and social platforms are already calling it one of the tokens to watch for 2025, noting how it combines humor with practical usability. With a fixed supply capped at 10 billion tokens, scarcity is built into the design, giving $LBRETT another edge as speculation builds that it could become one of the most talked-about meme plays of the next cycle. Final thoughts The latest XRP Price Prediction shows a wide gap between cautious and bullish forecasts, with targets ranging from $2.50 to $4.50 depending on adoption and market conditions. While XRP remains a heavyweight thanks to Ripple’s institutional focus, it is also facing competition from newer projects that are capturing retail imagination. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) stands out in this regard. With Ethereum Layer 2 scalability, meme-driven appeal, and eye-catching staking rewards, it is already being called one of the most exciting new tokens heading into 2025. For investors, the choice may come down to institutional reliability with XRP or speculative high upside with $LBRETT, a decision that could define which portfolios shine the brightest in the next bull run.

Bitcoin still is the benchmark but now, newer networks like SUI are making their mark through ecosystem building. Solana, Cardano, and Chainlink remain relevant despite falling market value. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the most attractive long-term opportunities, with many analysts endorsing its unique combination of security and growth potential. Bitcoin: The Benchmark Asset for Stability Bitcoin is trading at $110,000–$111,000, down by around 2% in the last 24 hours as miners and whales take profits from a recent high above $123,000. Even with this correction, ETF inflows are still strong, with some analysts predicting rallying towards $150,000 this year on momentum. Long-term predictions are as high as $200,000–$250,000 by 2030, cementing Bitcoin’s position as the base of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin’s growth curve might be more advanced than ETH’s, it is still the most trusted digital store of value. Sui (SUI): DeFi and Gaming Expansion Drive Growth Sui (SUI), the crypto asset, has been trading very close to $3.40. It has gained 1.8% in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, the coin has a market cap of about $8.8 billion. The Defi network’s growth has been accelerating quickly as DEX volume surpassed $10 billion in August while its TVL rose a whopping 44% this quarter to $1.76 billion. The gaming sector is also showing signs of promise as Jackson.io launches as Sui’s first licensed iGaming platform with profit-sharing for stakers. Analysts believe Sui is one of the best emerging chains to buy for the long term with more than 40 million monthly active addresses and the release of an XAUm gold-backed token for institutional purchasers. Cardano (ADA): Building for Real-World Adoption Cardano is priced at around $0.844, with solid network fundamentals supporting its outlook. Developer activity is strong, with Hydra scaling upgrades mitigating congestion. In the Middle East and Africa, partnerships are boosting adoption across supply chain, identity and education use cases. Cardano continues to rank among the best in terms of community engagement and staking. Analysts believe ADA could be a significant asset for long-term investors, given its low transaction volume and growing DeFi TVL. Solana (SOL): Institutional and Ecosystem Leadership Solana is up slightly on the day with a price of $188.52 and a market cap nearing $88 billion. The network, despite corrections, still generates more blockchain revenue than any other. So far this year, it has made over $1.3 billion. Wall Street treasuries are directly allocating into SOL as institutional adoption ramps up fast. Due to its unparalleled speed and thriving DeFi, NFT, and SocialFi ecosystems that make it is a top institutional and retail pick for long-term performance. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Powering Tokenization Crypto oracle provider Chainlink has a market cap of $11 billion, and the LINK price is $23.62. The network’s CCIP protocol is creating interoperability between Ethereum, Avalanche, and Sui for institutional-grade DeFi and tokenized assets. Analysts believe Chainlink will function as the backbone technology for the forthcoming wave of tokenization as its blockchain and traditional finance bridge becomes essential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Standout Growth Play Bitcoin and SUI remain strong analyst picks, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the standout long-term growth play. Backed by double audits from HashEx and CertiK, it’s rated safe, secure, and fully transparent, giving investors confidence. With forecasts of 90x upside and thousands already joining the presale, analysts call it one of the best cryptos to buy for long-term growth in 2025 — but limited supply means time is running out. Analysts also point out that its KYC-verified team and transparent roadmap set it apart from speculative presales, making it a safer yet high-upside opportunity. Conclusion The strongest altcoins for long-term adoption include Bitcoin, SUI, Cardano, Solana, and Chainlink. All these coins are active in their ecosystems. Also, they have institutional interest. Nonetheless, analysts agree that presales offer the biggest asymmetric opportunity. Due to its dual audits, verified team, and rising demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is recognized as one of the best cryptos with explosive upside and safety for long-term growth in 2025.

No one thought that it could be the biggest crypto by market cap. By 2025, BNB reached highs of over $800, meaning a $1,000 investment in 2020 would have grown to over $40,000. The growth of BNB is a result of Binance’s market dominance in the crypto industry. Developers are flooding into Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as it offers low fees and scalability. BNB dramatically increased in popularity as demand for DeFi apps, gaming projects, and NFTs, all of which utilise BNB in their ecosystems, surged. Ups and Downs Along BNB’s Journey BNB has seen both massive rallies and painful drawdowns. After reaching a high of $600 in 2021, it fell below $200 in the bear market of 2022, before a stronger bounceback in 2023–2025. Experts now suggest BNB may surge toward $1,000 in the next cycle, although like Ethereum, its upside multiples are more modest than they once were. Speculators Found a New Golden Opportunity As BNB has settled down, people are looking for an early-stage opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE. That’s unlike BNB, which is now too well established in the marketplace, MAGACOIN remains in presale – meaning a small influx of capital can trigger huge price movements. The quick sellout indicates that investors are seeking exposure before the listing. Why New Entrants Gain Traction Cryptocurrency investors are aware that the most significant multiples occur prior to general acceptance. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining popularity among traders due to its name, community, and limited supply. According to some analysts, the BNB project, which made early buyers billionaires, is strikingly similar to this mix in its early phases. Conclusion BNB utility token started at $20, and today, it is among the top coins in the world. Thus, showing that mankind can reap terrific benefits if they have an early conviction. A $1,000 bet in 2020 grew into tens of thousands today. With MAGACOIN FINANCE being planted as the next big thing, investors look for the next explosive play. If you weren’t able to get in on BNB’s rise, this presale could be the next early story. Access MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

According to a new survey by Aviva , 27% of UK adults said they would be open to including digital currency in their retirement portfolios, while 23% said they might withdraw part or all of their existing pensions to buy crypto directly. Growing Appetite Despite Worries Based on reports from Censuswide, which polled 2,000 UK adults between June 4 and June 6, more than four in five people hold pensions that add up to about £3.8 trillion ($5.10 trillion). If even a small slice of that moved into crypto , it could be meaningful for markets. Of the respondents who said they were open to digital currency in pensions, just over 40% pointed to the chance of higher returns as the main draw. UK retirement savers warm to crypto. A new Aviva survey finds 27% of UK adults would include crypto in retirement, hinting at future flows from a multi-trillion pound pension market. ‣ 27% open to crypto in pensions, per @Censuswide polling for Aviva‣ 23% would even shift… pic.twitter.com/9xejvGEIGh — TrinityPad (@Trinity_Pad) August 27, 2025 Younger Savers Lead The Shift Younger adults appear to be the most active. Reports show nearly 20% of people aged 25 to 34 admitted to withdrawing pension money to buy crypto at some point. Aviva’s research also found that about one in five UK adults — roughly 11.5 million people — have held crypto at some time, and two-thirds of that group still hold some form of digital asset. That mix of ownership and age-skewed behavior helps explain why digital currency is now part of conversations about retirement planning. Survey participants flagged clear concerns. Hacking and phishing topped the list at 40%, while 37% cited a lack of regulation and consumer protection, and 30% named volatility. Almost one-third admitted they didn’t completely grasp the trade-offs involved in replacing pensions with bitcoin, and 27% said they were unaware of any risks at all. Those numbers suggest interest outpaces understanding for a notable share of the public. What Regulators And Companies Are Doing Regulation will likely play a large role in how fast any shift happens. Reports note that HM Revenue and Customs will require crypto platforms to collect full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026. That move is aimed at strengthening tax compliance and oversight and could change how some consumers view bitcoin’s privacy and convenience. US Policy Also Moves The Needle The debate over retirement funds and crypto is not confined to the UK. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, opening potential access to more than $9 trillion in retirement assets.

StanChart Exec Says ETH Is ‘Cheap’ And Ready To Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-still-a-bargain-stanchart-exec-says-eth-is-cheap-and-ready-to-rally/,"Standard Chartered’s digital assets research chief says Ethereum still has room to rise, even after recent swings in price. According to Geoffrey Kendrick, growing institutional demand and shrinking exchange liquidity are tightening supply and could push Ether higher toward his year-end target of $7,500. Related Reading: XRP’s Biggest Doubter Just Dropped Close To $5 Price Bomb — Here’s Why Institutional Demand Up Reports have disclosed that corporate digital asset treasury firms have bought about 2.5% of circulating ETH since June. Spot ETH exchange-traded funds added close to 5% over the same period. Based on those figures, roughly 7.5% of supply has been drawn into corporate treasuries and ETFs since June, a large shift in a relatively short time. Kendrick expects these firms could eventually hold up to 10% of all circulating Ether, a projection that underpins his bullish view. Exchange Outflows And Price Moves Exchange-balance trackers show a substantial movement of coins off trading platforms. In a single day, over 74,000 ETH — roughly $340 million at recent prices — was withdrawn from exchanges, led by Binance. Such outflows are often read as a sign of reduced near-term selling pressure. Ethereum did slip about 5% on Tuesday before bouncing back. According to CoinMarketCap, it trades near $4,618, marking a 4.6% gain in the last 24 hours and a weekly rise of 10%. Resistance Levels To Watch Traders are watching short-term barriers around $4,600. A clear move above that level could open $4,700, with $4,800 the next checkpoint before the prior high. The asset briefly hit an all-time high of $4,950 on August 24. Kendrick’s forecast of $7,500 by year-end implies a roughly 60% climb from current prices, a scenario that would require continued strong flows and calm macro conditions. Corporate Moves Versus Market Supply Reports point to firms such as SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion being valued in relation to their ETH exposure. Kendrick compared these companies to Strategy’s approach with Bitcoin, arguing some are priced below what he considers fair value. SharpLink has announced a share repurchase program that would trigger if its metric net asset value falls below 1.0, a move that could set a price floor for the stock. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For Triple Surge Vs. Bitcoin – Details That corporate behavior, while supportive for those equities, is not identical to permanent removal of ETH from circulation the way staking or ETF custody can be. The bullish picture rests on a few big assumptions. Macro shocks, quick shifts in investor sentiment, or regulatory moves could reverse flows fast. Crowded positions can be created when many buyers chase the same theme, and those positions can amplify volatility if sentiment changes.

Solana and XRP Whales Signal the Presale’s Just Beginning,https://timestabloid.com/can-magacoin-finance-deliver-100x-gains-solana-and-xrp/,"The crypto market is setting up for one of its most eventful years yet. Big investors are stacking into select projects, fueling debates on the best altcoin to buy now . While Solana and XRP dominate headlines with institutional demand and ETF chatter, a new contender is stepping into the spotlight. MAGACOIN FINANCE , fresh from a clean audit by HashEx, is catching whale attention. Some are already calling it a rising star with high ROI crypto presale potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Whale Magnet With 100x Potential The hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE is simple: whales buying crypto presales are moving millions into it. This kind of behavior has historically signaled the start of major runs. Early buyers are speculating on a repeat of the same explosive growth Solana and XRP enjoyed in their early phases. With smart-contract security already verified by HashEx, confidence in its reliability has grown. Whale positioning matters because these early movers set the stage for broader adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now seen by many as a contender for the best crypto presale of 2025 , with analysts linking its setup to past breakout cycles. If momentum holds, the project could easily slot itself among the top altcoins for 2025. Solana: ETF Delays, Institutional Bets, and a Bold Future Few blockchains have attracted corporate-level conviction like Solana. Publicly traded companies now hold more than 3.5 million SOL, valued around $591 million. Pantera Capital is pushing a $1.25 billion initiative called “Solana Co.” to spotlight SOL as a treasury asset. These moves back up predictions, with one Solana price prediction 2025 pointing toward $280. Source: The Information ETF progress is mixed. The SEC delayed VanEck and Bitwise’s applications until October 2025, citing questions around staking and manipulation. Even with delays, institutional confidence remains strong. This institutional support continues to frame SOL as the best altcoin to buy now, especially among high-volume investors seeking long-term exposure. XRP: Whale Accumulation and ETF Triggers XRP has always been driven by whale-led moves, and that hasn’t changed. On-chain records show whales scooping up 440 million XRP — about $3.8 billion — during a dip around $2.95. This surge in holdings suggests growing conviction despite short-term sell pressure. Institutional plays could heat up if the SEC signs off on spot XRP ETFs between October 18–25, 2025. Analysts believe approvals could release $5–8 billion into the market. One XRP price forecast 2025 sets a bullish target of $5.50. With these developments, XRP sits firmly among the top altcoins for 2025 , drawing attention from traders aiming for multi-year growth. Final Thoughts: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the Hidden Gem? The market is stacked with opportunities. Solana has ETFs on the horizon, XRP thrives on whale-driven flows, and institutions are showing conviction. But the conversation about the best crypto presale of 2025 now includes MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whales moving in early, the setup mirrors past rallies that delivered outsized gains. If speculation holds true, MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver on the promise of a high ROI crypto presale. For traders searching for the best altcoin to buy now, this project offers a blend of whale confidence, smart-contract security, and growth potential. The whales buying crypto presales may be signaling that MAGACOIN FINANCE is just at the beginning of its journey.

The Solana (SOL) price target is pushing toward an all-time high, backed by institutional inflows into its ETF. However, while both coins show significant potential, Cold Wallet (CWT) presents a real utility-backed opportunity that the others simply can’t match. Unlike XRP or Solana, which rely on fluctuating market sentiment, Cold Wallet is flipping the script by rewarding users with cashback for every transaction. As Cold Wallet’s presale surges past $6.8M, its 3,423% ROI potential stands out as a stable and actionable investment choice for those looking to capitalize on real, tangible growth in the crypto ecosystem. XRP Eyes $3.90 as Whales Pump In $5 Billion Crypto whales are making their move, adding a staggering 1.7 billion XRP tokens, worth over $5 billion, at key support levels between $2.81 and $3.13. This massive accumulation positions XRP for a potential breakout. With resistance at $3.26, XRP must clear this barrier to push toward its all-time high of $3.90. In the context of the XRP price prediction, despite a slight 4.6% dip recently, XRP is still holding strong, trading 50% higher year-to-date, and showing solid gains from last year. But traders are cautious. Recent market drops and unlocks of $59 million worth of XRP tokens could put downward pressure on the price. Yet, with low supply above $3.26, a bullish run remains possible if whales continue defending key levels. Solana (SOL) Price Target Set for ATH as ETF Demand Soars Solana (SOL) is gaining momentum, with the price hovering around $193, just shy of its recent $210 high. The rise is driven by strong demand for the new Solana (SOL) price target as ETF inflows continue, signaling growing investor confidence. The recently launched REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) saw record inflows of $25.8 million last week, pushing total assets to over $183 million. Solana’s network activity is also accelerating, with a 6.2% increase in stablecoin supply and 31% more monthly transactions, now totaling 2.44 billion. With a solid technical setup, including a golden cross pattern, Solana’s price could soon break past $210, targeting its all-time high of $295. Investors eyeing growth should keep an eye on the SOL price target as momentum builds and institutional interest rises. Cold Wallet’s $6.8M Presale Surge: Why You Need to Buy Before Stage 18! Unlike Trust Wallet and MetaMask, which charge you fees to use them, Cold Wallet actually pays you. Whether it’s cashback on gas fees, swaps, or bridges, Cold Wallet turns your activity into rewards. Plus, users earn USDT just for referring others. It’s this real utility that’s helped Cold Wallet raise $6.8 million in its presale, with over 785 million tokens sold. Investors jumping in at Stage 17, priced at $0.00998, are betting on a challenger that doesn’t need to prove demand. It’s already packed with users, and it’s only getting started. With the price steadily rising and Stage 18 just around the corner, time is running out to lock in this massive opportunity. The ROI potential is massive; early buyers could see 3,423% gains when the price hits its $0.3517 launch price. But the closer we get to Stage 18, the less chance there is for huge returns. This is more than just another crypto presale website , it’s a real product that’s already rewarding its users. With Cold Wallet’s $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet, the project has 2 million active users and is set to scale even faster. If you’re tired of wallets that take your fees and give you nothing back, Cold Wallet is your chance to get paid for using crypto. Don’t wait too long, the window to act is closing fast! Cold Wallet Stands Out as the Best Crypto for Higher Returns, Beating XRP and Solana The XRP price prediction shows a bullish outlook, with whales positioning for a potential breakout toward $3.90. Solana’s (SOL) price target is set for a potential ATH, driven by ETF demand and institutional interest. But the best crypto for higher returns in the long term is Cold Wallet. Its cashback model, growing user base, and massive ROI potential are much better than the uncertain nature of XRP and Solana. Cold Wallet has already raised $6.8 million in presale, with over 785 million tokens sold, and its $0.00998 price is still offering early buyers an incredible upside. As CWT grows in popularity, its real utility will continue to separate it from the crowd, making it the top contender for those seeking stable, long-term rewards.

We’re talking about a massive Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal , involving a staggering $125 million worth of ETH. This substantial movement of funds from the FalconX platform has sparked considerable discussion and speculation among the cryptocurrency community. What Sparked This Significant Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal? According to diligent on-chain analyst Onchain Lens, four previously inactive wallets sprang to life, initiating a substantial withdrawal. These wallets collectively pulled 27,792 ETH, valued at an impressive $125 million, directly from FalconX. The analyst’s findings suggest a strong likelihood that these newly active wallets are directly linked to Bitmine, a name often associated with significant crypto operations. This connection transforms a simple transaction into a noteworthy market event, making the Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal a focal point. Tracing the Digital Footprints: The Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal Details Let’s break down the specifics of this intriguing transaction. The four wallets in question now collectively hold an astonishing 58,215 ETH. This figure includes the recently withdrawn amount, highlighting a considerable accumulation of Ethereum under these likely Bitmine-affiliated addresses. The sheer volume of this Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal underscores its importance. Moving $125 million in digital assets is not an everyday occurrence, and it naturally raises questions about the motivations behind such a strategic shift. Such large-scale movements are often closely watched by market participants. They can signal potential future actions or strategic repositioning by major entities in the crypto ecosystem. Why Does a Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal Matter? A withdrawal of this magnitude carries several potential implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, large movements of assets like Ethereum can sometimes precede significant market activity, such as selling or reallocation. Key considerations include: Market Impact: While not a direct signal of intent, a large accumulation could suggest future selling pressure or, conversely, a long-term holding strategy. Strategic Shift: This Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal might indicate a change in Bitmine’s operational strategy, perhaps moving assets for staking, diversification, or deployment in new ventures. Custody Preferences: Shifting funds from a trading platform like FalconX to private wallets suggests a move towards self-custody, offering greater control but also increased responsibility for security. Understanding On-Chain Analysis: Insights into Bitmine’s Movements On-chain analysis plays a crucial role in uncovering and interpreting these kinds of transactions. It involves examining publicly available data on blockchain ledgers to identify patterns, track fund flows, and deduce potential connections between wallets and entities. Analysts like Onchain Lens use sophisticated tools and techniques to piece together these digital breadcrumbs. Their work provides valuable transparency in an otherwise pseudonymous system, offering insights into the activities of major players, including this significant Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal . While direct attribution can sometimes be challenging, consistent patterns and historical transaction data often allow for high-probability linkages, as seen in the likely connection to Bitmine. What Could Be Next After This Bitmine Ethereum Withdrawal? The crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close watch on these four wallets. Future movements from these addresses could provide further clues regarding Bitmine’s intentions. Will the ETH be transferred to other exchanges, potentially indicating a sale? Or will it be moved into staking protocols, suggesting a long-term bullish outlook? Only time will tell the full story behind this considerable Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal . For now, it serves as a powerful reminder of the transparency inherent in blockchain technology and the constant vigilance of on-chain analysts. This substantial Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal from FalconX represents more than just a large sum of money moving; it highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the critical role of on-chain intelligence. It’s a testament to how public ledger data empowers observers to gain insights into the strategic maneuvers of major players, shaping narratives and influencing market sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal? A Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal refers to a large movement of Ethereum (ETH) tokens from a cryptocurrency exchange or platform to wallets believed to be controlled by the entity known as Bitmine. In this specific instance, $125 million worth of ETH was moved from FalconX. Who is FalconX? FalconX is a prominent cryptocurrency prime brokerage platform that provides institutional investors with trading, credit, and clearing services for digital assets. It facilitates large-volume transactions for major players in the crypto market. How do analysts link wallets to entities like Bitmine? On-chain analysts use various techniques, including examining transaction histories, identifying common funding sources, tracing funds through multiple wallets, and correlating wallet activity with known entity behaviors or public announcements. This helps them infer connections, even when direct ownership isn’t explicitly stated. What are the potential implications of such a large ETH movement? Large ETH movements, such as this Bitmine Ethereum withdrawal, can have several implications. They might signal a strategic repositioning of assets, preparation for a major transaction (like staking or selling), a shift in custody preferences (e.g., from exchange to self-custody), or even a security-related transfer. They often lead to increased market speculation. Is this a common occurrence in the crypto market? While large withdrawals happen regularly, a single movement of $125 million by a potentially significant entity like Bitmine is noteworthy. It’s not an everyday event for most individual investors, but major institutional or whale movements are consistently monitored by on-chain analysts due to their potential market impact.

Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index experienced a notable shift, falling three points to 48. This movement, while keeping the index in a ‘neutral’ stage, signals a subtle change in collective market sentiment. Understanding this index is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by data provider Alternative, serves as a powerful barometer for market sentiment. It helps us gauge whether investors are feeling overly optimistic (greedy) or excessively pessimistic (fearful) about the crypto market. This index operates on a simple scale: 0: Extreme Fear – This often indicates that investors are very worried, potentially leading to selling pressure. 100: Extreme Greed – This suggests investors are overly confident, which can sometimes precede a market correction. A score of 48, as we see now, firmly places the market in a neutral zone. However, even small dips can reflect underlying shifts that smart investors monitor closely. This index provides a snapshot of the prevailing mood, offering insights beyond just price charts. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its comprehensive methodology. It doesn’t rely on a single factor but aggregates data from various sources to form a holistic view. Here are the key components and their respective weightings: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often suggests fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum. High buying volume in a positive market can signal greed, while high selling volume suggests fear. Social Media (15%): Scans social media for specific keywords and sentiment analysis. Increased mentions and positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls ask thousands of people for their market sentiment, providing direct feedback. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often points to fear, as investors tend to flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during uncertain times. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A surge in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ searches, for example, might indicate fear. Each factor contributes to the overall score, providing a nuanced perspective on investor psychology. Understanding the Recent Dip in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The recent three-point fall in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 48, while still neutral, hints at a slight cooling of market enthusiasm. This subtle shift could be influenced by a variety of factors: General Market Jitters: Broader economic concerns or regulatory uncertainties can make investors more cautious. Price Consolidation: After periods of significant price movements, markets often consolidate, leading to a more subdued sentiment. Reduced Momentum: A decrease in trading volume or social media chatter might naturally pull the index down from higher neutral levels. It’s important to remember that the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. A small dip doesn’t necessarily forecast a major crash, but it encourages investors to reassess their positions and market outlook. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights from the Index How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to inform your investment strategy? Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Cyclical Investing: Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be ‘fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ The index can highlight these extremes, suggesting potential buying opportunities during extreme fear or caution during extreme greed. Risk Management: A high greed score might be a signal to take some profits or reduce exposure, while extreme fear could indicate a good time for dollar-cost averaging into positions. Complementary Tool: Always use the index in conjunction with fundamental analysis (project viability, technology, team) and technical analysis (price charts, indicators). No single metric tells the whole story. The index helps you understand the emotional landscape, but rational decision-making remains paramount. Conclusion: Deciphering Market Emotions The recent movement of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 48 underscores the continuous ebb and flow of sentiment in the crypto market. While remaining in the neutral zone, this dip serves as a gentle reminder that market emotions are constantly at play. By understanding how this crucial index is calculated and what its shifts signify, investors can gain a clearer perspective, making more informed decisions in their cryptocurrency journey. Always remember to combine emotional intelligence with thorough research for sustainable success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a ‘neutral’ score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A neutral score, like the current 48, indicates that investors are neither extremely fearful nor extremely greedy. It suggests a balanced market sentiment, where there isn’t a strong consensus on the market’s immediate direction. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index only for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market cap dominance is a factor in its calculation, and Bitcoin often drives overall market sentiment, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to reflect the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. Its components consider general market activity. How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index is updated daily by Alternative, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment for investors to consider. Can I rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions? No, it’s not advisable to rely solely on any single indicator. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for understanding market psychology, but it should be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your personal financial goals. What causes the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to change? Changes in the index are driven by shifts in its underlying factors: volatility, trading volume, social media activity, Bitcoin dominance, and Google search trends. Any significant movement in these areas can impact the overall score. Did you find this article insightful?

We’re witnessing a dramatic escalation in crypto voice phishing scams , where criminals trick victims into handing over their digital assets instead of traditional cash. This surge highlights a critical need for heightened awareness and robust security measures within the crypto community. What’s Behind the Alarming Surge in Crypto Voice Phishing Scams? The numbers paint a stark picture. According to data from South Korea’s National Police Agency, provided to People Power Party lawmaker Song Seok-jun, the first seven months of this year saw a staggering 420 cases of voice phishing rings stealing crypto assets. This figure represents an astounding 6.6-fold increase compared to the 64 cases reported during the same period last year. It’s clear that scammers are rapidly shifting their focus. Moreover, the total number of such fraud cases for all of 2024 was 130. However, the first seven months of 2025 have already far surpassed this, indicating a rapidly accelerating problem. This dramatic shift underscores the evolving tactics of criminals who are increasingly targeting the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, making it vital to understand the nature of these crypto voice phishing scams . How Do These Crypto Voice Phishing Scams Operate? Scammers employ various deceptive tactics to execute crypto voice phishing scams . Often, they impersonate government officials, law enforcement, or even representatives from reputable financial institutions. Their goal is to create a sense of urgency or fear, pressuring victims to act quickly without thinking. Common scenarios include: False Accusations: Victims receive calls claiming their accounts are linked to illegal activities, demanding crypto transfers to ‘secure’ their assets. Fake Investment Opportunities: Scammers promise unrealistic returns on crypto investments, convincing individuals to send funds to fraudulent platforms. Identity Theft: Posing as support staff, they request sensitive information or access to crypto wallets under the guise of resolving an issue. These elaborate schemes are designed to exploit trust and financial anxieties, making it difficult for unsuspecting individuals to differentiate legitimate calls from fraudulent ones. Protecting Yourself from Crypto Voice Phishing Scams: Essential Safeguards Vigilance is your strongest defense against crypto voice phishing scams . It is crucial to adopt proactive measures to safeguard your digital wealth. Always remember that legitimate institutions will never ask for your private keys or demand immediate transfers of your crypto assets over the phone. Here are key steps to protect yourself: Verify Identity: If you receive an unsolicited call, hang up and independently verify the caller’s identity using official contact information. Do not use numbers provided by the caller. Guard Private Keys: Your private keys are the access to your crypto. Never share them with anyone, under any circumstances. Be Skeptical of Urgency: Scammers thrive on creating panic. Any demand for immediate action or threats should be a major red flag. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implement 2FA on all your crypto exchanges and wallets for an added layer of security. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics. Knowledge is power when it comes to combating sophisticated fraud. If you suspect you’ve been targeted by crypto voice phishing scams , report the incident to the authorities immediately. Acting quickly can sometimes help in recovery efforts. The Broader Impact of Rising Crypto Scams in South Korea The escalating number of crypto voice phishing scams has far-reaching consequences beyond individual financial losses. It erodes public trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and can deter potential new investors. For victims, the emotional and psychological toll can be devastating, often leading to significant financial hardship. Furthermore, these incidents highlight the ongoing challenge for regulators and law enforcement to keep pace with evolving cybercrime. Governments worldwide, including South Korea, are working to implement stricter regulations and improve international cooperation to combat these sophisticated criminal networks. Industry players also bear responsibility in educating users and enhancing security features on their platforms. In conclusion, the alarming 6.6-fold surge in crypto voice phishing scams in South Korea serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset space. While the allure of cryptocurrencies grows, so does the sophistication of those seeking to exploit it. By staying informed, remaining skeptical, and adopting robust security practices, we can collectively work towards a safer crypto environment. Protect your assets, protect your future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a crypto voice phishing scam? A crypto voice phishing scam is a type of fraud where criminals use phone calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or directly transferring their cryptocurrency assets under false pretenses. 2. Why are scammers increasingly targeting crypto instead of cash? Cryptocurrency transactions can be harder to trace than traditional bank transfers, offering a degree of anonymity that appeals to scammers. The rapid growth and sometimes complex nature of crypto also make it easier to exploit less experienced users. 3. How can I verify if a call from a ‘bank’ or ‘authority’ is legitimate? Always hang up and call the institution back using an official phone number found on their website or statements. Never use a number provided by the caller. Legitimate organizations will never pressure you for immediate action or sensitive details over an unsolicited call. 4. What should I do if I fall victim to a crypto voice phishing scam? Immediately report the incident to your local law enforcement agency and any relevant cybersecurity or financial fraud departments. Also, notify your crypto exchange or wallet provider. Gather all available information about the scam, including phone numbers, transaction IDs, and communication logs. 5. Is South Korea taking action against these scams? Yes, data from the National Police Agency indicates active monitoring and reporting of these incidents.

According to the latest Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship digital asset has seen a notable Bitcoin price drop , falling below the crucial $111,000 mark. Currently, BTC is trading at approximately $110,953.37 on the Binance USDT market, sparking discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike. This unexpected dip raises important questions about market stability and future trajectories for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the factors behind any market movement is crucial, especially when it involves a prominent asset like Bitcoin. While a single cause is often elusive, several elements likely contribute to the current Bitcoin price drop . These can range from broad macroeconomic trends to specific technical indicators that influence trader sentiment. Market Sentiment: Negative news cycles, regulatory concerns, or even general risk-off sentiment in traditional markets can quickly impact crypto. Technical Resistance: Key resistance levels, once breached downwards, can accelerate selling pressure. Profit-Taking: After periods of upward movement, some investors might decide to take profits, leading to a temporary decline. External Factors: Geopolitical events or unexpected shifts in global financial policies can also play a role. Market analysts are closely watching trading volumes and order books for further clues. Often, a combination of these elements creates a ripple effect across the ecosystem, influencing the overall market direction. How Does This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Investors? A sudden Bitcoin price drop naturally brings questions and concerns for both seasoned traders and new entrants. For those holding BTC, seeing their portfolio value decrease can be unsettling. However, experienced investors often view such dips as potential opportunities, depending on their long-term strategy. Short-Term Traders: May experience increased volatility, creating opportunities for rapid gains or losses depending on their strategy and market timing. Long-Term Holders: Often remain unfazed, focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and long-term growth potential. Some might even see this as a chance to accumulate more at a lower price. New Investors: It is essential for new investors to approach the market with caution. Thorough research and understanding of market dynamics become paramount during volatile periods. Moreover, the current trading at $110,953.37 highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Prices can fluctuate rapidly, making informed decision-making absolutely vital for everyone involved. Navigating the Volatility: What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Price? Predicting the exact future trajectory of Bitcoin’s price is challenging, given its inherent volatility. However, observing key indicators and market behavior can offer insights. After a significant Bitcoin price drop , market participants typically look for signs of stabilization or potential recovery. Support Levels: Analysts will identify crucial support levels where buying interest might emerge, potentially halting further declines. Trading Volume: An increase in buying volume following a dip could signal a potential rebound. Conversely, continued low volume with price drops suggests weak demand. News and Events: Upcoming economic data, regulatory announcements, or major industry news could significantly influence market direction. It is important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of global factors. Therefore, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective is always recommended, as market conditions can shift quickly. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $111,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic and often unpredictable nature. While such movements can be alarming, they are also a normal part of market cycles. Investors must prioritize robust risk management strategies and conduct their own due diligence. As the market continues to evolve, adaptability and a clear understanding of Bitcoin’s underlying value remain key to navigating its fascinating landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent Bitcoin price drop below $111,000? The specific cause is often multifaceted, but factors such as general market sentiment, macroeconomic trends, technical resistance levels, and profit-taking by investors likely contributed to the decline. 2. Is this a good time to buy BTC after the Bitcoin price drop? Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Some long-term investors view dips as accumulation opportunities, while others prefer to wait for signs of market stabilization. Always do your own research. 3. How does market sentiment affect Bitcoin’s price? Market sentiment, driven by news, social media, and investor confidence, plays a significant role. Positive sentiment can drive prices up, while negative sentiment, often fueled by fear or uncertainty, can lead to a Bitcoin price drop . 4. What should investors do during a BTC price decline? During a price decline, it’s crucial to avoid panic selling. Review your investment strategy, assess your risk tolerance, and consider if the fundamental reasons for your initial investment still hold true. Diversification and setting stop-loss orders can also be beneficial. 5. Will Bitcoin recover from this drop? Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience and recovered from numerous price drops. However, past performance does not guarantee future results. Recovery depends on various factors, including market demand, broader economic conditions, and investor confidence.

The move underlines how big tech is racing to keep up with global demand for computing power. The announcement was made on August 27, 2025, in a blog post and through official statements in Virginia. The investment will fund new construction and expansion of existing campuses. It will also fuel training and education programs for thousands of young people in the state. A centerpiece would be a new data center in Chesterfield County, next to the Meadowville Technology Park. This is Google’s first operation in central Virginia. According to company officials, building a data center of such size typically takes 18 to 24 months. But a precise date for when it will start operations has yet to be determined. Dominion Energy will power the site. The company will also grow its two Loudoun and Prince William counties campuses. Both are located in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” the most densely packed cluster of data centers on the planet. Loudoun, which is frequently referred to as “the wealthiest county in America,” has quickly become one of the epicenters of the cloud boom. With the expansion, Google is betting on a region vital to its global operations. Gov. Glenn Youngkin lauded the announcement as a significant shot in the arm for Virginia’s economy. He said the project would bring jobs and bolster the state’s role as a leader in digital innovation. Google expands infrastructure, invests in workforce Beyond the physical build-out, Google is trying to help grow Virginia’s talent pipeline . The company said it was launching a $1 billion program to offer Google’s AI Pro plan free to every college student in the state for a year. The students will also be trained in AI and cloud technologies. These programs will be offered in collaboration with the University of Virginia, Northern Virginia Community College, and Brightpoint Community College. The goal is to get students ready for jobs likely to develop from the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. The company emphasized working with local partners on energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives. It noted that Virginia’s rapid expansion of data centers had put pressure on the state’s power grid. Google stated it was fully committed to reaching its goal of being powered entirely by carbon-free energy around the clock at all its data centers and campuses worldwide. The company added that Northern Virginia had already achieved 95 percent clean energy use. Google fuels growth but raises energy and environmental questions Virginia is already the most concentrated cluster of data centers in the United States, and interest shows no sign of slowing. AI workloads are incredibly power- and water-intensive. A 2024 analysis forecasted that by 2030, Virginia will have to triple its energy production to meet the growth rate. Critics say such expansion may overburden resources and increase environmental risks. Data centers’ cooling systems use millions of gallons of water each year. Community groups in Chesterfield and Northern Virginia have expressed concern over how such projects impact local ecosystems. Yet Google says it is being responsible. The company has also promised to collaborate with local leaders to grow sustainably. It also signals new investments in energy programs and technologies with less environmental impact in the long run. Google’s move is indicative of a broader trend. Competing tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are investing tens of billions in data centers this year. Meta’s new rural Louisiana site is expected to cost $50 billion. The Delivery Trucks are backing large loans to finance data center projects around the U.S. and giants like JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ. Virginia has become a fixture in the global competition for AI leadership. With its infrastructure, tax credits, and proximity to Washington, D.C., the state has attracted investment interest. Virginia is well-positioned, industry analysts believe, to be at the center of a good deal of the next wave of AI growth on servers. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This upward movement sparks important conversations among investors and enthusiasts alike, hinting at potential shifts in market dynamics. For many, this rise suggests a growing appetite for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, opening new avenues for portfolio growth. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 46 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial metric that helps gauge the overall performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin. It signals an official altcoin season when a significant threshold is met: 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index suggests a stronger and more pronounced altcoin season. Currently sitting at 46, the index indicates that while we are not yet in a full-blown altcoin season, momentum is building. This reading shows that a notable portion of altcoins are indeed outperforming Bitcoin, suggesting a shift in investor focus and capital allocation. This gradual increase often precedes more significant movements, making it a key indicator for savvy traders. Is an Altcoin Season Truly Approaching? The one-point rise in the Altcoin Season Index to 46 is more than just a number; it’s a signal. While the 75% benchmark for an official altcoin season remains a distance away, this steady increase demonstrates growing confidence and interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. This recent shift in the Altcoin Season Index indicates increasing investor confidence in various altcoins, suggesting that many are seeing better returns than Bitcoin over the short term. What should you watch for as the index continues to evolve? Consistent Outperformance: Look for a sustained trend where a majority of top altcoins continue to surpass Bitcoin’s gains. Increased Trading Volume: Higher trading volumes in altcoin markets often accompany rising prices. New Project Excitement: Innovations and new projects in the altcoin space can attract fresh capital. Navigating Potential Altcoin Opportunities As the Altcoin Season Index inches higher, savvy investors are already looking at potential gains. However, navigating the altcoin market requires careful consideration and a strategic approach. It’s not simply about picking any altcoin; rather, it involves understanding market trends and individual project fundamentals. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, spread your investments across several promising altcoins. Do Your Research: Investigate the utility, team, and technology behind each altcoin. Strong fundamentals are key to long-term success. Risk Management: Altcoins can be highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technological developments, and, of course, the Altcoin Season Index itself. Important Considerations and Risks While the rising Altcoin Season Index is exciting, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains highly volatile. Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can experience dramatic price swings. This volatility presents both significant opportunities for profit and substantial risks of loss. Always conduct thorough due diligence and understand the unique risks associated with each investment. Market sentiment can change rapidly, influenced by global economic factors, regulatory news, and even social media trends. Therefore, a rising index does not guarantee continued upward movement, nor does it eliminate the potential for sudden corrections. A balanced approach, combining optimism with cautious risk assessment, is always recommended. Conclusion: The Evolving Crypto Landscape The climb in the Altcoin Season Index to 46 serves as a compelling indicator of shifting dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. While it doesn’t declare an immediate altcoin season, it certainly signals growing momentum and renewed interest in altcoins. This presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks for investors. By staying informed, conducting thorough research, and managing risk effectively, you can better navigate this evolving landscape and potentially capitalize on the burgeoning altcoin market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures the percentage of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score closer to 100 indicates a stronger altcoin season. What does a score of 46 mean for the Altcoin Season Index? A score of 46 means that 46% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. While not yet an official altcoin season (which requires 75%), it indicates growing momentum and a positive trend for altcoins. How is an Altcoin Season officially declared?

This signifies that 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have surpassed Bitcoin’s performance over a three-month period. What should investors do during a potential Altcoin Season? Investors should conduct thorough research on individual altcoins, consider diversifying their portfolios, manage risk with appropriate strategies, and stay updated on market trends and news.

Worldcoin (WLD) price action has stayed firm near the $0.90 level, a point that often sparks sharp moves when pressure builds. At the same time, Pi coin price holds around $0.35 after shaping chart setups that hint at a possible reversal if strong triggers appear. Yet, the spotlight now shines on BlockDAG (BDAG) . The project has already raised over $385 million, selling more than 25.5 billion coins at $0.03 in Batch 30. BlockDAG is moving far beyond presale buzz. Powered by DAG-based speed and real traction, it is being called the best crypto to buy now. Worldcoin (WLD) Price Action Holds $0.90 as Market Waits Worldcoin (WLD) price action continues to hold steady around the $0.90 level, showing strong resilience despite constant pressure. For several sessions, charts have displayed a tight range with resistance near $1.15, keeping rallies capped, while support around $0.90 has prevented deeper losses. This ongoing tug-of-war between buyers and sellers has left Worldcoin (WLD) price action stuck in sideways movement, but this type of pattern often signals that a bigger move is coming soon. The $1.00 mark has been a frequent pivot, acting as a magnet where price quickly returns after testing both higher and lower levels. Many traders use this zone for short-term entries, highlighting its importance. Momentum and volume remain the real deciding factors now. If either shifts sharply, Worldcoin (WLD) price action could set a clear new direction. A strong breakout above $1.15 or a drop under $0.90 will likely decide the next phase. Pi Coin Price Near $0.35 With Breakout Potential Pi coin price is trading in a quieter range, even as other assets in the crypto market show more volatility. After testing its yearly low, Pi coin price created a double-bottom around $0.3357, a classic chart signal that suggests strength may be building. Alongside this, a falling wedge has also appeared, which often points toward possible upside if momentum kicks in. Together, these patterns hint at breakout potential if the right catalysts show up. For Pi coin price to move higher, key triggers such as a tier-1 exchange listing or a supply reduction could play a major role. However, losing the $0.3357 support would cancel this view and open the door to weaker levels. At present, Pi coin price sits close to $0.3567, still far below the $3 peak reached earlier in the year. With low trading volume and a softer market cap, it looks like Pi coin price remains in accumulation mode while traders wait for the next clear spark. BlockDAG’s Growth Pushes Beyond Presale Buzz With $385M Raised BlockDAG has quickly taken center stage with its record-breaking rise and strong community traction. The project has already raised more than $385 million, selling over 25.5 billion coins at a price of $0.03 in Batch 30. These figures highlight how far BlockDAG has grown beyond basic presale talk, turning into one of the most active projects in the market. At its core, BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, a structure designed for speed and efficiency. Unlike older blockchains, DAG allows multiple chains to run at once. This design means faster confirmations, cheaper transactions, and far better scalability. Many see this approach as a game-changer, giving BlockDAG the tools to handle heavy use without delays or rising fees. Combined with its steady market traction, it is now seen as the best crypto to buy now. BlockDAG also focuses on creating a full working ecosystem. Beyond coin sales, it offers dashboards, mining tools, and ongoing updates to keep users engaged. Its miners are built to serve both beginners and experienced users, making the network more accessible. This practical mix of speed, usability, and hardware support is what makes BlockDAG stand out. With billions already raised and more batches still ahead, BlockDAG’s momentum continues to build. Missing out at this stage could mean watching one of the most talked-about launches of the year unfold from the sidelines. Patience, Progress, and the Clear Winner Ahead The overall picture highlights a balance of patience and steady progress. Worldcoin (WLD) price action remains caught in a narrow zone between $0.90 and $1.15, a range that often builds pressure for sudden moves in either direction. Pi coin price continues to circle around $0.35, carrying both risk and potential, with traders watching closely for the next sign of momentum that could spark a shift. Then comes BlockDAG, which has raised over $385 million with more than 25.5 billion coins sold, plus millions in miner sales. Its DAG-based system brings faster speeds and lower costs, setting it apart from older blockchain models. In a market filled with uncertainty, BlockDAG shows determination and energy, making it stand out as the best crypto to buy now .

Solana and Cardano are considered as competitors with bullish tendencies and developing ecosystems; however, the attention is currently moving towards MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts pointing to a massive 5000% upside, MAGA’s presale momentum and added bonus rewards are setting it apart as one of the best crypto presale stories right now. Solana Price Outlook Solana is coiling within a large rising triangle, a formation that is usually interpreted as a sign of strength before a breakout. Buyers have been supporting the $185 level since March, creating consistent higher bottoms that reflect an intense bullish activity. The big test is the $200 resistance level. A breakout higher would support rallies towards the $220 and $240 levels with Fibonacci projections eyeing $277 and $320. Analysts estimate that the average Solana price will be between $300 and $400 in 2025, with the most bullish forecasts that the asset price will rally to $1,000. Source: X Short-term prediction: Once it breaks the $200 level, analysts indicate that it will be able to go to its next higher target at between $220-$240. Holding above $185 keeps the bullish setup alive. Long-term projection: The longer-term outlook into late 2025 sees Solana tracking between $300 and $400, and in the top end having potential of hitting $1,000 or more should institutional demand ramp up on it. Why could Solana rally that high? It has emerged due to its low transaction costs and high throughput, as well as a rapidly expanding developer base. ETF speculation and robust adoption of DeFi and NFTs are other factors that have prompted institutions to circle Solana. With institutional inflows increasing and adoption continuing to expand, the growth in Solana to new loftier levels becomes all the more realistic. Cardano Update Cardano experienced a decline and fell beneath its trendline, testing around the support level of the currency near $0.8416. Should that break, price may see a touch of $0.8000 again, but a recovery higher than $0.8762 would put buyers back in control. Source: X Despite short-term weakness, Cardano’s long-term growth story remains intact. It utilizes Ouroboros, a Proof of Stake protocol that is much more energy efficient than Bitcoin mining. Its peer-reviewed research model ensures continuous innovation and trust. Furthermore, the layered architecture of the Cardano enables it to transact at a higher scan of 250 TPS and low transaction fees as compared to Ethereum. Short-term prediction: In the short-term, Cardano will remain in a range between $0.80 and $0.88. Once it breaks above $0.8762, it can rapidly move toward $0.92- $1.00. Long-term prediction: The average forecast for Cardano in 2025 was between $1.50-$2.50 with bullish predictions going as high as $5 as its adoption increases. These advantages answer why Cardano is appealing to developers, enterprises and environmentally friendly investors. All in combination with worldwide adoption tendencies in smart contracts and sustainable finance, Cardano has the basis to run towards greater prices in 2025 with an 8% projection in growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Presale Catching Fire Solana and Cardano are also predicted to rise but analysts say that MAGACOIN FINANCE is the present presale to keep an eye on. Backed by a completed audit that adds security and trust, MAGA is already drawing heavy demand. With forecasts pointing to a potential 5000% upside, early buyers are also unlocking a 50% EXTRA BONUS using code PATRIOT50X, fueling momentum ahead of the next bull run. Magacoin Finance has undergone rigorous security audits by reputable blockchain security firms HashEx and CertiK, both awarding it a perfect score of 100/100. These audits confirm that the smart contracts are secure, tamper-proof, and the deflationary tokenomics (including a 12% supply reduction planned for Q3 2025) are implemented as intended. Such verification erases much of the institutional intent of the meme-coins. Based on this background, MAGA is fast emerging to be one of the few presales that are both hyped and with solid structural support. Final Take Solana looks ready to explode in price once resistance is overcome, Cardano strength-building on sustainability and research, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking headlines with its audit backed presale. The combination of the technical arrangements, the development of an ecosystem, and trader interest explains why these three are under watchlists towards 2025. But the real headline is MAGA. With a completed audit, transparent tokenomics, and forecasts pointing to a 5000% upside , it’s hard to ignore the momentum. Providing the stable growth, Solana and Cardano might turn out as the game changer people strive to achieve configuring the next bull run.

Over the past week, ADA’s price has hovered between $0.82 and $0.87, reflecting cautious market sentiment. ADA's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Technical indicators remain split: the RSI sits at a neutral 52, leaving room for upward momentum, but the MACD shows bearish divergence, hinting at potential weakness. Analysts believe the next few trading sessions will determine whether ADA breaks higher or faces renewed selling pressure. Analysts Split on ADA Price Outlook Market experts are offering conflicting outlooks on ADA’s near-term trajectory. Some forecasts a short-term move toward $0.95, while others projects a more ambitious rally to $1.05–$1.10 by the end of August, provided volume increases. On the other hand, bearish predictions warn of a potential slide to $0.50 if Cardano fails to defend its key support levels. Institutional interest also remains a factor. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently postponed its decision on Grayscale’s Cardano ETF until October 26, adding regulatory uncertainty. Analysts argue that while an ETF approval could fuel institutional inflows, delays may weigh on investor confidence in the short term. Could a September Rate Cut Ignite a Cardano Rally Toward $3? Macroeconomic catalysts could play a decisive role in ADA’s next move. Speculation is mounting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Historically, rate cuts have provided a boost to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Market reports suggest a potential Fed rate cut could help ADA reclaim the $1 mark and even fuel a rally toward $3, echoing its explosive 2020 run. With Cardano already up 4% in August, a favorable macro shift may accelerate bullish momentum.

Buyers are carefully watching the best cryptos to buy, looking for strong growth and long-term value. Stellar (XLM), Chainlink (LINK), TRON (TRX), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are now at the center of attention thanks to upgrades, adoption, and consistent demand. Each of these coins brings different strengths that help them stand out. Success now depends on real use cases, secure systems, and ongoing improvements. These top performing crypto choices are not only seen as good for short-term returns but also as reliable for the years ahead. BlockDAG: A Better Answer to Slow Blockchain Systems BlockDAG (BDAG) is changing how crypto networks operate. It blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) design with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, creating a system that runs faster and handles more transactions than older blockchains. Traditional systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum often slow down when demand rises. BlockDAG (BDAG) fixes this problem by allowing multiple blocks to be processed at the same time. This means more speed, higher capacity, and stronger security. The presale results prove how much confidence people have in this project. So far, BlockDAG has raised more than $385 million in Batch 30. Over 25.5 billion coins have been sold, showing the strong demand in the market. Its price has grown from just $0.001 to $0.03, a 2,900% surge before even reaching full launch. Many experts suggest that BlockDAG could touch $1 soon, thanks to its clear purpose and strong growth. With its proven design, large-scale presale success, and solutions to long-standing blockchain issues, BlockDAG is making its place as a top performing crypto. This makes it one of the best cryptos to buy right now for anyone following the market closely. Stellar (XLM): Focused on Global Payments In recent days, Stellar (XLM) has dropped by 7%, moving from $0.42 down to $0.39. The decline is mainly linked to wider market shifts and heavier selling pressure. Even with this dip, XLM continues to show strength because of its role in cross-border transfers and asset tokenization. The Stellar Development Foundation has expanded through new partnerships with Archax and Franklin Templeton. These deals highlight its rising presence in regulated markets. While the price may face ups and downs in the short term, the long-term value of XLM stays strong. At $0.39, it holds its ground as one of the best cryptos to buy for those focused on financial solutions powered by blockchain. Chainlink (LINK): Powering Smart Contracts at $25.18 Chainlink (LINK) remains a top crypto and is currently priced at $25.18. Over the past week, LINK has seen gains as more projects use its services. Its strength lies in offering secure data feeds for smart contracts, which are essential in decentralized finance (DeFi) and many other areas. Short-term estimates put LINK between $26 and $30, with further growth expected. As more platforms adopt its technology, LINK continues to strengthen its position in blockchain systems. This strong adoption makes it one of the best cryptos to buy for 2025, as demand for smart contract solutions only increases. TRON (TRX): Leading Stablecoin Transactions TRON (TRX) has shown stability, staying above the 50-day moving average even with a slight fall recently. The steady price trend shows its resilience. TRX’s ongoing upgrades and active developer work help it keep a solid position in the market. The coin’s dominance in stablecoin transfers makes it a strong choice. Its partnerships with Kraken and MetaMask add further support, increasing its reach and appeal. High transaction volumes and strong adoption show why TRX is one of the best cryptos to buy. With consistent growth and proven ability to process large-scale activity, TRON remains a crypto worth following. Why BlockDAG Leads the Pack As 2025 comes to an end, XLM, LINK, TRX, and BlockDAG all show why they belong to the list of best cryptos to buy. Stellar continues to lead in cross-border payments, Chainlink drives secure smart contracts, and TRON dominates stablecoin transfers. But BlockDAG clearly stands out. Its mix of DAG and PoW provides speed, scalability, and safety that older systems struggle to match. With $385 million raised, 25.5 billion coins sold, and a 2,900% rise in price, BlockDAG is shaping up as a top performing crypto . For many, it is the best crypto to buy now and could reach new heights in 2025. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

50790864,567020,1756342850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50790864.jpeg,CFTC Steps Up Crypto Oversight By Implementing Nasdaq’s Surveillance Technology,https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-steps-up-crypto-oversight-nasdaq-surveillance/,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is taking a significant step to enhance its oversight of the expanding crypto market by adopting Nasdaq’s advanced surveillance program. CFTC To Stay Ahead Of Crypto Regulation To bolster its regulatory capabilities, the regulator announced on Wednesday that it has chosen Nasdaq to supply market surveillance and fraud detection technology. Nasdaq’s Market Surveillance system is designed to cover multiple asset classes and is instrumental in identifying potential market manipulation. By leveraging comprehensive order book data, this technology enables regulators to conduct real-time analysis, facilitating swift decision-making and robust oversight. As the CFTC continues to oversee crypto assets, the US government’s increasing focus on the digital asset landscape, especially in terms of creating a more accommodative regulatory environment, has expanded the agency’s responsibilities. The market structures are also changing, with many exchanges adopting 24-hour trading. Given these developments, the CFTC recognizes the need for more sophisticated tools to detect and prevent market abuse effectively. Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Caroline Pham emphasized the importance of staying ahead in regulatory practices, stating: It’s critical that the CFTC stays ahead of the curve. Nasdaq Market Surveillance will provide the CFTC with automated alerts and cross-market analytics that will benefit each of the CFTC’s operating divisions. Pham highlighted that this partnership will enhance the agency’s ability to protect markets such as crypto, from fraud and manipulation while improving efficiency in analyzing market trends and unusual trading activities. Collaboration With SEC Tal Cohen, Nasdaq’s president, noted the company’s unique position at the intersection of innovation and regulation, expressing pride in partnering with the CFTC to promote the integrity and resilience of US derivatives markets . This announcement coincides with the CFTC’s launch of the next phase of its “Crypto Sprint” initiative, aimed at evaluating and implementing recommendations from the White House regarding digital asset regulation. As reported by Bitcoinist last week, Pham has also called for public feedback on these recommendations, reinforcing the agency’s commitment to transparency and stakeholder engagement. In alignment with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) “Project Crypto,” the CFTC is also working closely with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce to provide regulatory clarity and foster innovation within the digital assets market. Pham expressed gratitude for the supportive feedback from stakeholders regarding the CFTC’s initiative on listed spot crypto trading, emphasizing that this collaborative effort responds to President Trump’s call for American leadership in crypto.

This pivotal decision, maintaining rates for the tenth consecutive meeting, sends a clear signal about South Korea’s current economic outlook and its strategic approach to monetary policy. For investors, especially those in the dynamic cryptocurrency space, understanding the nuances of this stability is crucial. Why Did the Bank of Korea Keep Interest Rate Steady? The decision by the Bank of Korea to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 2.50% reflects a cautious yet strategic approach. This move comes amid persistent inflation concerns, albeit with signs of moderation, and a desire to support economic growth without overheating the market. Policymakers are carefully balancing the need to tame price increases with fostering a stable environment for businesses and consumers. The BOK also considers global economic trends, including interest rate movements by major central banks. Inflation Management: While inflation has eased, it remains above the central bank’s target. Holding rates allows the BOK to continue monitoring inflationary pressures. Economic Stability: The BOK aims to provide a predictable economic landscape, reducing uncertainty for both domestic and international investors. Global Economic Headwinds: Global economic slowdowns and geopolitical tensions continue to pose risks, prompting a conservative stance on monetary policy. What Does This Bank of Korea Interest Rate Decision Mean for the Economy? Maintaining the Bank of Korea interest rate at its current level has several immediate and long-term implications for the South Korean economy. For consumers, borrowing costs for mortgages and loans are likely to remain stable, offering some predictability in household finances. This can encourage consumption and investment at a steady pace. Businesses, too, can plan their expansion and operational budgets with a clearer understanding of financing expenses, potentially boosting corporate investment and job creation. Stable Borrowing Costs: Consumers and businesses benefit from unchanged loan rates, which can encourage steady spending and strategic investment. Currency Impact: A steady interest rate might influence the Korean Won’s strength relative to other major currencies, impacting trade balances and import costs. Growth Outlook: The central bank hopes this stability will foster sustainable economic growth, preventing sharp downturns or excessive exuberance. Investment Climate: A consistent Bank of Korea interest rate policy signals predictability, potentially attracting more long-term capital. How Does the Bank of Korea Interest Rate Impact Crypto Markets? While seemingly distant, the Bank of Korea interest rate decision can indirectly ripple through the cryptocurrency markets. When traditional investments like government bonds and savings accounts offer stable, albeit lower, returns due to consistent interest rates, some investors might seek higher yields or alternative assets. Cryptocurrencies, known for their volatility and potential for significant returns, often attract capital when traditional markets offer less compelling opportunities or when liquidity is abundant. Furthermore, the broader economic sentiment fostered by the central bank’s policy can influence investor confidence. A stable domestic economy might free up discretionary income for investment, some of which could flow into digital assets. Conversely, if the economy were to face significant challenges, risk aversion would likely increase, potentially leading to outflows from more volatile assets like crypto. Risk Appetite: A stable economic environment can sometimes encourage greater risk appetite among investors, leading them to allocate more capital to speculative assets like crypto. Liquidity Flows: If the local economy remains robust and capital is readily available, domestic funds might seek diversification, potentially flowing into digital assets. Global Sentiment: South Korea is a significant player in the global crypto landscape. Its monetary policy can influence regional sentiment, which then impacts global crypto trends. Opportunity Cost: When traditional returns are stable but modest, the perceived opportunity cost of holding cash or low-yield assets increases, making higher-risk, higher-reward assets more appealing. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For those invested in or considering cryptocurrencies, the steady Bank of Korea interest rate serves as a crucial backdrop for strategic decision-making. It underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio and a clear understanding of market dynamics. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Global Trends: While local policy is stable, global interest rate movements, inflation data, and geopolitical shifts still heavily influence crypto markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Balance crypto holdings with other asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both macroeconomic indicators and specific crypto project developments and regulatory news. Understand Risk: Cryptocurrencies remain inherently volatile. Invest only what you can comfortably afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Consider a long-term investment strategy for crypto, focusing on projects with strong fundamentals. The Bank of Korea’s decision to hold its benchmark interest rate at 2.50% is a testament to its commitment to economic stability amidst a complex global environment. This consistent monetary policy provides a predictable foundation for the domestic economy, influencing everything from borrowing costs to investment sentiment. For crypto enthusiasts, this stability might subtly encourage a continued search for growth opportunities in alternative assets, highlighting the intricate dance between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset landscape. It’s a powerful reminder that even seemingly local central bank decisions have far-reaching implications, extending into the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the current Bank of Korea interest rate? The Bank of Korea has held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.50% for the tenth consecutive meeting. Q2: Why did the Bank of Korea hold rates steady? The decision reflects a balance between managing persistent inflation, supporting economic growth, and considering global economic trends to maintain stability. Q3: How does this decision affect South Korean consumers? For consumers, stable interest rates mean predictable borrowing costs for mortgages and loans, which can encourage steady consumption and investment. Q4: What are the indirect impacts of the Bank of Korea interest rate on cryptocurrency markets? A stable economic environment, driven by the consistent Bank of Korea interest rate, can influence investor risk appetite and liquidity flows, potentially encouraging some capital to seek higher yields in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Q5: Is this a positive or negative development for crypto investors? It’s generally seen as a neutral-to-subtly-positive development. Stable traditional returns might lead some investors to explore higher-yield opportunities in crypto, but direct positive correlation is not guaranteed.

Recently, a significant voice from China’s financial establishment has raised eyebrows, sparking a crucial debate. Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), has voiced strong opposition to stablecoins, citing deep concerns about stablecoin financial stability . His comments ignite a critical conversation about the future of digital currencies and their potential impact on global economies. Why Are Stablecoins a Threat to Financial Stability? Zhou Xiaochuan’s primary concern revolves around the potential for stablecoins to introduce significant financial stability risks . He argues that these digital assets, despite their name, could actually encourage speculative behavior rather than provide a steady anchor in the volatile crypto market. Such speculation, he suggests, might destabilize broader financial systems. Furthermore, the former governor believes stablecoins could undermine existing, robust payment infrastructures, particularly in countries like China that already boast highly efficient digital payment networks. His arguments highlight several key points: Increased Speculation: Stablecoins, while pegged to traditional assets, can still become tools for speculative trading, especially when linked to less regulated decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Systemic Risk: A large-scale adoption of stablecoins, particularly those not backed by transparent reserves or strong regulatory oversight, could introduce new forms of systemic risk to the financial sector. Undermining Existing Systems: Established national payment systems, built over decades for security and efficiency, could face competition or disruption from unregulated stablecoin alternatives. Are Stablecoin Cost Advantages Overstated? A common argument for stablecoins is their promise of lower transaction costs and greater efficiency compared to traditional banking. However, Zhou Xiaochuan challenges this narrative. He asserts that claims of significant cost advantages over China’s existing payment systems are greatly exaggerated. China already utilizes advanced digital payment methods, like WeChat Pay and Alipay, which offer extremely low costs and high speed. This perspective suggests that for nations with mature digital payment infrastructures, the perceived benefits of stablecoins might not be as revolutionary as proponents claim. Consequently, the potential downsides, such as regulatory challenges and risks to stablecoin financial stability , could outweigh any marginal gains. For more insights into global payment innovations, you can explore our fintech articles . Navigating the Future: Stablecoin Financial Stability and Regulatory Concerns The former PBOC governor’s remarks come at a pivotal time. While he expresses caution, some experts and business leaders within China have recently advocated for the introduction of a yuan-backed stablecoin. This creates an interesting tension: the desire for innovation versus the imperative for financial security. The global financial community is closely watching how major economies, especially China, approach digital assets. The debate around stablecoin financial stability is not just theoretical; it has real-world implications for how money moves, how economies function, and how individuals conduct transactions. Regulators worldwide are grappling with similar questions, striving to balance technological advancement with consumer protection and systemic resilience. Key Considerations for Regulators: Establishing clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoin issuance and operation. Ensuring robust reserve requirements and transparency for stablecoin backing. Mitigating risks of illicit finance and market manipulation. Protecting consumers from potential losses or market volatility. A Crucial Dialogue for the Digital Age Zhou Xiaochuan’s cautionary stance on stablecoins serves as a vital reminder that while digital currencies offer exciting possibilities, they also introduce complex challenges. His experience at the helm of a major central bank lends significant weight to his concerns regarding stablecoin financial stability . The ongoing debate highlights the crucial importance of a balanced approach, one that encourages innovation while rigorously safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial systems. Ultimately, the discussion around stablecoins is far from over. It requires careful consideration from policymakers, innovators, and the public alike to forge a path that harnesses the benefits of digital assets without compromising the foundational principles of financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or even another cryptocurrency. Q2: Why is the former PBOC governor concerned about stablecoins? Zhou Xiaochuan is concerned that stablecoins could encourage speculation, undermine existing robust payment systems, and pose significant risks to overall financial stability due to their potential for unregulated growth and lack of transparency. Q3: Do stablecoins offer real cost advantages? While stablecoins are often promoted for their low transaction costs, Zhou Xiaochuan argues that for countries with highly efficient existing digital payment systems, like China, these cost advantages are often exaggerated and do not justify the associated risks. Q4: Are there calls for a yuan-backed stablecoin? Yes, despite the former PBOC governor’s opposition, some experts and business leaders in China have expressed interest in introducing a stablecoin backed by the Chinese yuan, aiming to explore its potential benefits. Q5: How do central banks typically view stablecoins? Central banks generally approach stablecoins with caution, focusing on potential risks to monetary policy, financial stability, and consumer protection. Many are actively researching or developing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as an alternative. If you found this discussion insightful, consider sharing it with your network! The conversation around stablecoins and their impact on financial systems is vital for everyone in the crypto space and beyond. Spread the word!

The platform executed a significant PUMP token buyback last week, demonstrating a strong commitment to its ecosystem and token holders. This move has certainly captured the attention of many, signaling potential positive implications for the future of the PUMP token. What’s Driving the Massive PUMP Token Buyback? Pump.fun confirmed a substantial repurchase of its native token, PUMP, totaling an astonishing $10.66 million over the past week. This figure is not just large; it represents nearly all of the platform’s earnings for that period. Specifically, 99.32% of Pump.fun’s total revenue went directly into this recent PUMP token buyback . This commitment is a clear signal of confidence. Furthermore, this isn’t an isolated event. To date, Pump.fun has cumulatively repurchased a staggering $58.13 million worth of PUMP tokens. This total buyback amounts to approximately 4.3% of the token’s entire circulating supply. Such consistent action shows a strategic approach to managing tokenomics and enhancing value. Why Does a PUMP Token Buyback Matter for Holders? A consistent PUMP token buyback program offers several compelling benefits for existing token holders and the broader ecosystem. Here’s why these actions are crucial: Increased Scarcity: By removing tokens from circulation, the total supply decreases. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially driving up the value of remaining tokens if demand stays constant or grows. Price Support: Buybacks often act as a form of price support, especially during market downturns. The platform actively buying its own token can cushion price drops and demonstrate underlying strength. Demonstrates Commitment: When a platform dedicates such a large portion of its revenue to a token buyback, it signals strong belief in its own project. This builds trust and confidence among investors and the community. Aligns Incentives: A robust buyback program aligns the interests of the platform with those of its token holders. Both benefit from a healthier, more valuable token. Therefore, the recent PUMP token buyback is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic move designed to bolster the token’s long-term health and value. Pump.fun’s Strategy: A Closer Look at the PUMP Token Buyback Mechanism Pump.fun’s decision to allocate nearly all of its weekly revenue to the PUMP token buyback is a bold and transparent strategy. The platform’s model involves fees generated from token creation and trading activities. By committing a significant portion of these earnings to buybacks, Pump.fun essentially shares its success directly with its token holders. This mechanism is distinct from traditional stock buybacks in some ways, yet the core principle remains: reduce supply to potentially increase value. For a decentralized platform, such transparency in revenue allocation and buyback execution is vital. It allows the community to track the platform’s financial health and its direct impact on the PUMP token’s economics. Navigating the Future: Potential Impact of Consistent PUMP Token Buybacks What could these consistent PUMP token buyback efforts mean for the future of Pump.fun and its native token? The immediate impact is often a positive shift in market sentiment. Investors tend to view buybacks as a bullish signal, indicating that the project believes its token is undervalued or that it has excess capital to invest in its own ecosystem. However, it is important to consider potential challenges. Market volatility remains a constant factor in cryptocurrency. While buybacks can offer support, they do not entirely insulate a token from broader market trends. Sustainability is also key; the platform must maintain consistent revenue generation to continue such aggressive buyback programs. Ultimately, a sustained and well-managed PUMP token buyback program could significantly contribute to the token’s stability and growth. It encourages long-term holding and fosters a loyal community, crucial elements for any successful crypto project. Conclusion: A Powerful Signal for the PUMP Ecosystem Pump.fun’s recent $10.7 million PUMP token buyback , representing nearly all of its weekly revenue, sends a powerful message to the crypto community. This strategic move, coupled with the cumulative $58.13 million repurchased to date, underscores the platform’s commitment to enhancing the value and scarcity of its native token. For token holders, this consistent action offers compelling benefits, from potential price appreciation to increased trust in the project’s long-term vision. As Pump.fun continues to execute this impressive strategy, the PUMP token ecosystem appears poised for exciting developments ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a PUMP token buyback? A1: A PUMP token buyback occurs when Pump.fun uses its revenue to purchase its own native PUMP tokens from the open market. This reduces the circulating supply of the token. Q2: How much PUMP did Pump.fun buy back last week? A2: Pump.fun announced a significant PUMP token buyback of $10.66 million worth of PUMP tokens last week. Q3: What is the total amount of PUMP tokens repurchased by Pump.fun to date? A3: To date, Pump.fun has repurchased a total of $58.13 million in PUMP tokens, which is equivalent to 4.3% of the token’s circulating supply. Q4: Why are token buybacks considered beneficial for token holders? A4: Token buybacks can increase scarcity, provide price support, demonstrate the platform’s commitment, and align the interests of the platform with its token holders, potentially leading to increased token value. Q5: Does the PUMP token buyback guarantee a price increase? A5: While a PUMP token buyback can create positive market sentiment and reduce supply, it does not guarantee a price increase. Market dynamics, broader crypto trends, and platform performance also play significant roles.

Despite these challenges, some analysts remain optimistic and suggest that in case SHIB finds support over $0.00001211 and surges above the resistance zone, it can aim for a breakout to the $0.000020 level.

The chipmaker’s meteoric rise has made it the most traded name in the leveraged ETF market, drawing billions of dollars from traders hoping to capitalize on outsized gains. As its earnings beat Wall Street expectations , Nvidia is at the center of Wall Street’s latest fixation — high-risk funds that track the daily swings of stocks linked to artificial intelligence. The surge signifies the hunger to be exposed to companies powering the AI revolution. The leveraged ETFs linked to individual stocks rely on swaps or options to deliver double or even triple the usual daily share movement. For Nvidia, for whose iconic stock this has already been a record-surge year, that has made for an appealing but perilous speculator’s playground. In the first five months of 2025, over 100 new single-stock leveraged and inverse ETFs have debuted in the U.S., most directly or indirectly tied to AI. These products now dominate a lion’s share of assets in the space, which says a lot about how much Nvidia and other AI leaders like Tesla and Palantir vie for investor attention. Investors are flooding into AI-themed ETFs The numbers tell the story. Through merely eight months of 2025, asset managers have introduced 112 new leveraged and inverse ETFs linked to individual stocks. That’s nearly triple the 38 that launched in all of 2024. All told, there are now 190 single-stock leveraged and inverse ETFs listed in the U.S. Over half are associated with companies trying to capitalize on the AI wave. Combined, these funds with AI exposure hold $17.7 billion of the $23.7 billion deployed in the leveraged ETF universe. One of the stars in that crowd is the GraniteShares 2× Long NVDA Daily ETF. It has $4.56 billion in assets gathered in the 14 months since it opened in December 2022. Some other big names driving the creation of ETFs are Tesla, Palantir, and NuScale Power, companies directly or indirectly linked to AI. An ETF analyst at Morningstar, Bryan Armor, said the ETFs allow traders to increase their daily bets, adding that the potential upside is enormous but the risks are equally high. Nvidia earnings set tone for big market shake-up These speculative products get tested every earnings season, but the one from Nvidia’s report may be the check to checkmate. Following the results, options traders are positioning for a $260 billion market-value swing. That is about a 6% move in either direction. Leveraged ETFs, those moves can magnify gains or magnify pain. The risks are not theoretical. Nvidia shares dropped 17% earlier this year on fears of new competition from a Chinese chip rival. That day, the GraniteShares 2× Nvidia ETF lost almost 34%. But the upside can also be explosive. Last week, surprise earner MongoDB also pointed to AI demand. Its stock rose more than 23% in after-hours trading. The brand-new Tradr 2× Long MDB Daily ETF climbed 46% overnight. ETF issuers are raking it in. Leveraged ETFs average fees of 0.96%, almost double the industry average of 0.54%. But investors are still plowing money into the platform, eager for exposure to AI names. Matt Markiewicz, head of product and capital markets at Tradr ETFs, said demand for such products continues to climb. He noted that his firm had recently launched a leveraged ETF tied to Constellation Energy, on the expectation that power producers would benefit as AI data centers consume more electricity. He added that there is currently a strong thirst among investors for companies that stand to profit from the AI boom.

Nasdaq-listed digital healthcare innovator, CIMG, has announced a groundbreaking CIMG Bitcoin acquisition , signaling a significant pivot for the company and sending ripples across both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. This strategic move sees CIMG exchanging a substantial $55 million worth of its common stock for 500 Bitcoin (BTC), a decision that highlights the growing confidence of established firms in digital assets. What Does This CIMG Bitcoin Acquisition Entail? CIMG, a prominent player in the digital healthcare sector listed on Nasdaq, has formally entered into a purchase agreement with a group of nine investors. Under this agreement, the company will issue $55 million worth of its common stock. In return, these investors will provide CIMG with 500 units of Bitcoin. This substantial exchange is not just a simple trade; it’s a strategic shift for CIMG, aiming to diversify its treasury assets and potentially hedge against inflation. The transaction is currently on track to finalize in early September, pending customary closing conditions. For many, this CIMG Bitcoin acquisition marks a clear statement: digital assets are no longer a niche interest but a legitimate component of corporate financial strategy, even for companies outside the direct tech or finance sectors. Why Are Companies Like CIMG Embracing Bitcoin Now? The decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity like CIMG to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. Several factors drive this shift: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value and a hedge against the depreciating purchasing power of fiat currencies, especially in the current economic climate. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury holdings beyond traditional assets, potentially offering new avenues for growth and risk management. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers who are increasingly familiar with cryptocurrency. This strategic CIMG Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the evolving global financial landscape. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Move? For CIMG, the benefits could be substantial. A successful Bitcoin holding could appreciate in value, enhancing the company’s balance sheet. It also sends a strong signal to the market about CIMG’s willingness to innovate and adapt. However, this bold step is not without its challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price fluctuations, which could introduce volatility to CIMG’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential compliance challenges. Market Perception: While many will view this positively, some traditional investors might be wary of the perceived risks associated with digital assets. Despite these challenges, CIMG’s leadership appears confident in the long-term strategic value of this CIMG Bitcoin acquisition . How Does This CIMG Bitcoin Acquisition Impact the Broader Market? A move of this magnitude from a Nasdaq-listed digital healthcare company is a powerful endorsement for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class and gaining mainstream acceptance. Other companies, observing CIMG’s bold stride, might feel encouraged to explore similar strategies. This institutional interest can contribute to increased liquidity and stability in the Bitcoin market over time. Moreover, it blurs the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, suggesting a future where such cross-asset exchanges become more common. This transaction could very well serve as a case study for other firms contemplating their own ventures into the crypto space.

50791920,566900,1756346423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50791920.jpeg,Iran’s Crypto Sector Suffers 11% Decline Following $90-M Exchange Hack,https://bitcoinist.com/irans-crypto-sector-suffers-11-decline-following-90-m-exchange-hack/,"According to reports, Iran’s on-chain crypto activity fell sharply in the first half of 2025. Inflows totaled $3.7 billion in the first seven months, a 10% drop from the same period in 2024. The slump accelerated after April: June flows contracted 50% year-on-year and July tumbled 75%. Major Exchange Breach Shakes Trust Based on a TRM Labs report , a major security breach hit Nobitex on June 18. Roughly $90 million was taken from hot wallets, source code was leaked, and some stolen coins were steered to vanity addresses that referenced the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Outflows from the exchange spiked — more than 150% in the week before the fighting — as traders moved funds to what they saw as safer places. Trust, already fragile, was seriously damaged. Inbound Transactions Collapse As Users Withdraw Nobitex’s inbound transfers dropped by about 70% year-on-year after the breach. Some dormant Bitcoin wallets tied to mining activity were activated and later routed funds into a newly created hot wallet. Regulators responded by imposing overnight trading curbs designed to slow panic, but many users had already pulled funds offshore. Reports show a surge in transfers to foreign platforms and payment processors that have lighter identity checks. Stablecoin Freezes Strain Liquidity In July, Tether froze 42 wallets linked to Iran, removing a large chunk of usable stablecoin liquidity on local rails. More than half of those wallets had ties, on-chain, to Nobitex or addresses flagged with IRGC links, though ownership remains unclear. Tether also froze $27 million in USDT tied to Garantex , a sanctioned Russian exchange, an action that highlights the broad reach of compliance moves. The US Treasury blacklisted Garantex in 2022, and that prior action has had echoing effects on market behavior. Power Cuts And Conflict Worsen Market Stress The decline in flows came during a period of heightened regional tension. A 12-day conflict with Israel erupted in mid-June while nuclear talks stalled. Israeli strikes and internal disruptions led to widespread electricity outages. Mining rigs were idled. Trading became harder. For many traders, the safest option was to move funds off domestic rails; for others it was to switch stablecoins or chains. New Taxes Tighten The Grip In August, Iran approved the Law on Taxation of Speculation and Profiteering. The law brings capital gains taxes to crypto, gold, real estate, and forex. Enforcement will roll out in stages, but officials say oversight will increase. That policy move, combined with freezes and hacks, gives firms more reason to pause or shift operations.

Presales are back in the spotlight, and analysts are pointing to a select few projects as the top crypto presales worth watching. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a breakout star, with its presale raising more than $13 million . Often compared to the early stages of legendary projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention as one of the best crypto presale opportunities of the year. Alongside it, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has crossed $11.2 million in presale funding with its ambitious Bitcoin layer-two solution, while TOKEN6900 (T6900) is making waves as a viral meme coin raising over $2.3 million . Together, these three projects are dominating discussions around the top crypto presales to watch this quarter. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: A Standout Performer Smart investors are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the top crypto presales in Q4 2025 , thanks to its rapid fundraising momentum and strong grassroots appeal. Early-stage investors have already committed over $13 million , demonstrating confidence in the project’s ability to replicate the early success of past meme coin giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly built a reputation as a safe and reliable project. It recently passed an independent smart contract audit by HashEx, giving investors added confidence that the code is secure and free from major risks. Beyond the audit, the team has been open about its plans, sharing a clear roadmap that outlines every stage of development. This level of transparency, combined with strong community backing, makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as a trustworthy presale in today’s market. Analysts also note that whale wallets have started accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens quietly — a signal often seen before explosive breakouts. With retail hype growing and presale allocations filling fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now widely ranked as a best crypto presale to watch this quarter. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A DeFi-Ready Layer 2 for Bitcoin Another project grabbing attention among the top crypto presales is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , which has already raised over $11.2 million in its presale. Unlike traditional meme coins, Bitcoin Hyper is building a layer-two (L2) scaling solution for Bitcoin , designed to fix slow speeds and high fees. Key highlights for HYPER include: Integration with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM): Brings high throughput and scalability to Bitcoin. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Bundles transactions and settles them securely on Bitcoin’s base layer. Utility Features: Staking, governance, and dApp deployment are all planned. High APY Potential: Token holders can earn up to 98% APY from staking rewards. With Bitcoin continuing its long-term upward trajectory, HYPER offers a unique value proposition as both a utility token and an investment play. Many analysts believe this makes Bitcoin Hyper one of the best crypto presale opportunities for long-term growth. TOKEN6900 (T6900): Meme Coin Madness with Marketing Power If you’re looking for pure meme-driven energy, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is quickly earning a reputation as one of the top crypto presales this year. Branding itself as the “New Global Benchmark for Brain Rot Finance,” T6900 has already raised $2.3 million in its presale. What sets TOKEN6900 apart is its unapologetic focus on marketing: 40% of Presale Funds for Marketing: Ensuring high visibility and viral campaigns. Inspired by SPX6900: A meme token that delivered nearly 100,000% returns. Total Supply Joke: Set at 930,993,091 — exactly one token more than SPX’s supply. Staking Rewards: Token holders can earn up to 33% APY , with 139 million tokens already staked. Analysts believe T6900 could easily be 10x due to its community-driven hype and aggressive marketing tactics. While speculative, its potential makes it a best crypto presale for high-risk, high-reward investors. Final Thoughts: Best Crypto Presales in Q4 2025 The fourth quarter of 2025 is definitely filled with opportunities that exceed expectations, but there are three projects that are distinctly rising above the rest to become the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE — A viral meme coin presale already past $13M. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) — A DeFi-ready Bitcoin L2 solution with $11.2M raised. TOKEN6900 (T6900) — A chaotic, meme-fueled project with bold marketing power. For investors seeking the best crypto presale opportunities this quarter, these three projects offer very different strengths — from meme-fueled hype to groundbreaking utility. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge past $13M, the retail buzz is undeniable.

Coinbase Listing Claims Surface According to posts on X, a 2021 Pi Network Hackathon winner called Pi Barter Mall suggested a Coinbase listing could be in the offing. The comment touched off fresh debate among users who have been watching for the Pi coin to reach major global exchanges. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, posted a Pi Day image back in March that showed purple pies with the Pi logo. It was not a formal announcement. But it did rekindle rumors and talk across social channels.

Access to PiOS has been used to run new hackathons. One such event aims to get apps working with Pi in everyday transactions. Community moderators have suggested the open-source move could arrive before the end of the year, though the Pi Core Team has not confirmed specific dates. Questions that have long lingered about code transparency are expected to be addressed once more of the code is public. Binance And Swapfone Developments Screenshots have circulated showing Binance Connect and Binance P2P support options appearing inside the Pi Wallet’s Help & Support menu. That detail prompted discussion about a potential Binance integration, but users also pointed to hurdles that have slowed any listing. A lack of clear utility and concerns over decentralization were cited as reasons for delays. Meanwhile, practical steps have been taken elsewhere: Pi Coin secured a listing on Swapfone, a US-regulated, mobile-focused exchange, which launched a PI/USDS trading pair in July. Small Steps Toward Broader Exposure The Swapfone listing was described by some community members as Pi’s first meaningful move into the US trading scene. It is small in scale when compared with top global exchanges, but it is a footprint on American rails.

50792385,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=793703,1756346604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50792385.jpeg,Circle taps Mastercard and Finastra to push USDC into global payments,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/circle-taps-mastercard-and-finastra/,"Circle, the company behind USD Coin (USDC), is pushing to make stablecoins a mainstream tool in traditional banking. The firm is announcing new partnerships with Mastercard and Finastra to integrate USDC into payment flows for merchants and banks worldwide. These partnerships represent one of the most aggressive efforts yet to expand the use of stablecoins in everyday financial services . They arrive when regulators and banks are increasingly interested in how digital currencies can speed up settlement and reduce costs. Mastercard announced that acquirers and merchants in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) will now be able to settle transactions in USDC and Euro Coin (EURC). It is the first time that settlement with stablecoins will be available on Mastercard’s regional network. Arab Financial Services and Eazy Financial Services will initially launch the service. For merchants, this means payment can be cleared and settled faster and more efficiently than with conventional systems, many of which rely on intermediaries and protracted clearing cycles. The service will help companies reduce friction and smooth liquidity, Mastercard said. Stablecoins can drive down the time and cost —and frankly make it easier — for international settlements and merchants to receive money in an environment where they never go to their correspondent bank. Mastercard demonstrates confidence in digital assets as an adjunct to current payment rails by piloting stablecoin settlement in emerging markets. If it works, the model could spread to other areas. Finastra brings USDC to cross-border payments. Finastra, one of the largest financial software firms in the world, has added support for USDC to its Global PAYplus payment solution. This platform is of such wide use among banks that it handles over $5 trillion in cross-border transactions daily. The integration also means that banks in at least 50 countries can settle payments in USDC even if the payment instructions are written in a legacy fiat currency, such as the dollar, euro, or British pound. For the banks here, this is a big blow. They can use Circle’s blockchain-based settlement solution without changing their infrastructure. The plug-in solution enables them to provide quicker and more cost-effective international payments and keep up with the financial industry standards. Finastra said the partnership offers a way for banks to innovate in cross-border payments, at scale. It also makes stablecoin use cases more feasible by plugging directly into legacy bank rails. Circle drives global adoption of USDC Circle’s activities with Mastercard and Finastra are part of a broader wave of efforts to grow USDC adoption worldwide. The development comes after the July passage of the GENIUS Act, which sets a federal framework for stablecoins in the U.S., the first of its kind in the country, and Circle’s accelerating tie-ups with key financial players. Circle teamed up with crypto exchange OKX in July to allow zero-fee USDC conversions into U.S. dollars. This pumped up USDC liquidity in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. South Korea’s top banks, KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, are reportedly preparing to meet with Circle to explore a potential partnership in the stablecoin market. The meeting, scheduled during Tarbert’s visit to Seoul this month, is part of South Korean banks’ push to enter the stablecoin sector as the country moves toward establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier last week, major commercial banks in South Korea are ramping up preparations for stablecoin issuance ahead of upcoming legislation to shape the sector. Sources indicate that discussions have focused on potential collaborations with domestic fintech and tech giants as well as with international issuers of dollar-backed stablecoins, such as Circle. Circle also teamed up with SBI Group, Ripple, and Startale in Japan to further USDC uptake and create a tokenized asset platform for real-world assets. Together, these moves suggest a clear strategy: Embed USDC into the world’s financial arteries, from merchant settlements to cross-border banking. Get seen where it counts.

A recent and alarming development from South Korea highlights this reality, as authorities have cracked down on a significant memecoin scam . This incident serves as a stark reminder for all investors to exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough research before committing funds to any digital asset, especially those promising extravagant returns. How Did This Memecoin Scam Unfold? Police in South Korea’s Gyeonggi Nambu Province recently announced the arrest and referral for prosecution of three individuals. These arrests are linked to an alleged crypto fraud that successfully defrauded 129 victims, amounting to approximately 5.7 billion won, or about $4.1 million. This was not a small operation; it was a carefully orchestrated scheme. The Project: The group created a fraudulent memecoin called GCV. Timeline: This scheme operated between December 2023 and June 2024. The Lure: Scammers enticed investors with false promises of an exclusive Asian golf course membership. This membership was supposedly in exchange for investing in their GCV coin. The Impact: Many individuals lost significant amounts of money, believing they were securing a valuable asset and a luxurious perk. The ringleader, identified only as A, along with two accomplices, now faces legal action for their role in this extensive memecoin scam . Understanding the Allure of Crypto Fraud and Golf Memberships Why do such scams, particularly those involving luxury promises, continue to ensnare investors? The appeal often lies in a blend of aspirational living and the perceived ‘get rich quick’ nature of some crypto projects. Investors, drawn by the promise of high returns and exclusive benefits like golf memberships, might overlook critical red flags. Moreover, the novelty of memecoins can sometimes make it harder for new investors to distinguish legitimate projects from outright fraud. Scammers exploit this lack of familiarity, creating elaborate narratives that sound plausible to the untrained ear. They often leverage social media and community hype to build a false sense of legitimacy, making it challenging to identify a memecoin scam early on. Protecting Yourself from a Memecoin Scam: Actionable Insights Staying safe in the crypto space requires vigilance. Here are some key strategies to protect your investments and avoid falling victim to a memecoin scam : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Look for transparency and a clear roadmap. Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns or exclusive real-world assets (like golf memberships) for a new, unproven coin, it’s a major red flag. Check for Audits: Legitimate crypto projects often undergo smart contract audits by reputable third-party firms. Verify Team Identity: Anonymous teams can be a warning sign. While some legitimate projects start anonymously, transparency often increases trust. Community Scrutiny: Engage with the project’s community, but be critical. Scammers can create fake engagement. Start Small: If you’re unsure, invest only what you can afford to lose. Remember, a healthy skepticism is your best defense against sophisticated fraudsters.

Many early investors are looking to grab a much bigger share of the market. In 2025, Ethereum remains at the center of institutional adoption interest, but smart money conversations now turn to where the next big breakout is likely to occur. According to analysts, as Ethereum has confirmed its dominance in the industry, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a strong opportunity for long-term upside. Ethereum: Network Activity Surges Amid Institutional Growth Ethereum’s price recently spiked past $4,800, almost reaching new multiyear highs. However, the basics of the network seem to be unrivaled wholesomely. Transactions rose by 63% in the last 30 days while that of the active addresses climbed 26%. In the last 48 hours, exchanges have had over 200,000 ETH withdrawn, creating the potential for a supply squeeze. Staking demand is picking up so heavily that over 870,000 ETH worth more than $4.16 billion remain in the exit queue on Ethereum PoS. Confidence in the industry continues to increase as treasury giant Bitmine purchases an additional 9,613 ETH worth about 45 million. Despite $388 million in liquidations from leveraged longs, traders are rotating Bitcoin to Ethereum, which shows it’s bullish, analysts say. Ethereum’s 14,000% return on investment continues to be a testament to the rewards of early adoption of the right project. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Smart Money Play Ethereum’s historical 14,000% return on investment (“ROI”) is creating a new wave of hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE. The unique ecosystem has been audited double time by both HashEx and CertiK. It has received a safe, secure and fully transparent stamp passing all tests. With whale-backed inflows, a KYC-verified team and predictions of a major upside, analysts have called it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Early buyers using PATRIOT50X receive a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out fast. Unlike speculative presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is layered on credibility. Two of the most reputable blockchain security companies audited it twice, giving assurance about its technical safety. While Ethereum made early investors rich, MAGACOIN FINANCE now offers the asymmetric opportunity that could deliver similar upside in the current cycle. Why Smart Money Is Paying Attention Institutions or whales usually put their money into safer growth opportunities. Ethereum is still a contender, but is so large now that smaller, vetted projects can offer much better multiples. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being referred to by analysts and smart money forums as a project that combines safety with urgency due to scarcity. As presale allocations become tighter and added perks like PATRIOT50X drive more inflows, the early window to make huge returns is closing fast. Conclusion Ethereum’s historic 14,000% ROI is proof of how transformative early investment in the right project can be. In 2025, Ethereum remains a pillar of the crypto ecosystem, but analysts agree that the most exciting new growth story lies in presales. With its double audits, whale-backed demand, and KYC-verified team, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 — offering smart money investors the chance to capture exponential upside before allocations disappear.

Analysts and investors alike are noticing how its community-driven energy and unique positioning give it room to grow. While it doesn’t yet have the track record of Ethereum or Dogecoin, its rising visibility puts it firmly in the mix when people talk about the Best Altcoins to Buy Now.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news about a significant move by a publicly traded company. Sharplink Gaming Ethereum strategy is once again in the spotlight as the Nasdaq-listed firm (Nasdaq: SBET), a known strategic investor in Ethereum, has reportedly transferred a substantial 23.46 million USDT to Galaxy Digital.

This development is certainly worth watching for anyone interested in institutional crypto adoption and its impact on the market. What is Driving Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Ambition? Sharplink Gaming (SBET) is not new to the Ethereum space. They have previously demonstrated a clear interest in the asset, positioning themselves as a strategic investor.

How Might This Sharplink Gaming Ethereum Purchase Impact the Market? A purchase of this magnitude by a publicly traded company like Sharplink Gaming could have several implications for the Ethereum market. While 23.46 million USDT is a considerable sum, its immediate impact on ETH price might be limited given Ethereum’s large market capitalization and daily trading volumes. However, the psychological impact could be significant. Key Potential Impacts: Increased Institutional Confidence: This move signals continued confidence from traditional companies in Ethereum’s long-term potential, potentially encouraging other corporate entities to follow suit. Market Sentiment Boost: Positive news about institutional adoption often acts as a catalyst for broader market optimism, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Demand for ETH: A direct purchase of ETH by Sharplink Gaming would contribute to the overall demand, especially if executed in a structured manner through a firm like Galaxy Digital. Furthermore, Sharplink Gaming’s strategic approach to Sharplink Gaming Ethereum investments highlights the growing sophistication of corporate treasury management in the digital age. They are not just buying crypto; they are engaging with established financial intermediaries to execute their vision with precision.

For Sharplink Gaming, the potential benefits include: Capital Appreciation: If Ethereum’s value continues to grow, their investment could see substantial returns, boosting company assets and shareholder value. Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets to their portfolio provides diversification away from traditional asset classes, potentially reducing overall risk. Innovation Alignment: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Ethereum can enhance a company’s image as forward-thinking and innovative in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. However, challenges are also present: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, exposing the investment to significant risk and potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance challenges for corporate holders. Public Scrutiny: As a Nasdaq-listed company, Sharplink Gaming faces public and shareholder scrutiny over its investment decisions, requiring clear communication. Therefore, any move by Sharplink Gaming Ethereum strategy must be carefully considered, balancing potential rewards against inherent risks. Their choice of Galaxy Digital as a partner suggests a professional approach to mitigating some of these challenges and ensuring a secure transaction. In conclusion, Sharplink Gaming’s transfer of 23.46 million USDT to Galaxy Digital for a potential Ethereum purchase is a compelling indicator of ongoing institutional interest in the crypto market. This strategic decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity not only reinforces Ethereum’s position as a preferred institutional asset but also provides a fascinating case study in corporate crypto adoption.

His remarks followed a post by ETF specialist Nate Geraci, who noted that CME Group’s XRP futures contracts have surpassed $1 billion in open interest, the fastest contract ever to reach that milestone, achieving it within three months. Geraci also highlighted the $800 million already tied up in futures-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Deaton responded by stressing the significance of XRP’s user base and its impact on related markets. He stated, “I predicted this just like I predicted Gemini’s XRP Card would be Gemini’s most popular credit card,” referencing Gemini’s recently launched XRP rewards card backed by Mastercard and issued by WebBank. Deaton added that he believes XRP holders helped drive Gemini’s mobile application to surpass Coinbase’s app in recent download figures. I predicted this just like I predicted @Gemini ’s XRP Card would be Gemini’s most popular credit card.

He stressed that such collective legal involvement was unprecedented in the crypto industry. Other experts have emphasized the role of the community, noting that XRP may not have succeeded the way it did without its passionate community . For Deaton, the involvement of this global community is a direct indicator of sustained retail demand that complements growing institutional interest. The combination of CME futures activity, ETF inflows, and consumer-facing products like the Gemini XRP credit card suggests that demand is not confined to one area of the market. While futures growth demonstrates rising interest from institutional traders, retail adoption continues to expand rapidly. Anticipation for Spot XRP ETFs The next development attracting attention is the pending lineup of spot XRP ETF applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Several proposals are awaiting responses by October , with expectations among analysts and investors leaning toward eventual approval.

Taken together, the rising demand across derivatives, ETFs, consumer products, and community engagement shows the rising demand for XRP.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7914 Market cap $834.88M Trading volume (24-hour) $18.08M Circulating supply 1.056B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8023 24-hour low $0.784 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.87% 50-day SMA $0.8096 14-Day RSI 47.42 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.6568 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is trapped in $0.76-$0.83 consolidation zone with decreasing volume. The MACD is near zero with minimal directional bias. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart XTZ’s daily chart as of August 28, 2025 shows a modest 0.52% gain that fails to address the underlying bearish structure. The price remains trapped below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.8340 and well beneath the upper band resistance at $0.9044, indicating sustained selling pressure since the July highs. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD hovers near the zero line with minimal momentum in either direction, while the histogram shows slight compression, suggesting potential for a directional move but lacking clear conviction. The token appears stuck in a grinding sideways pattern between $0.76-$0.83, with neither bulls nor bears able to establish decisive control. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart confirms XTZ’s technical difficulties with the token struggling to break above the descending trendline resistance that has capped rallies since late July around $0.84. Current price action at $0.7919 shows the token consolidating just below the 21-period SMA at $0.7981, which now acts as immediate resistance after previously serving as support. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume patterns reveal diminishing interest with 24-hour volume at just 1.59M, significantly lower than the 4M+ levels seen during more active periods, suggesting retail and institutional participation has waned considerably. The On-Balance Volume at 347.95M shows relatively stable accumulation patterns, indicating that while selling pressure exists, there’s no panic distribution occurring. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7402 BUY SMA 5 $0.8041 SELL SMA 10 $0.8094 SELL SMA 21 $0.8373 SELL SMA 50 $0.8096 SELL SMA 100 $0.6973 BUY SMA 200 $0.6568 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8145 SELL EMA 5 $0.7833 BUY EMA 10 $0.7238 BUY EMA 21 $0.6827 BUY EMA 50 $0.7112 BUY EMA 100 $0.8038 SELL EMA 200 $0.8757 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ looks positioned for a decisive breakout from its current consolidation range, though direction remains uncertain. A break above $0.83 with volume would target the $0.87-$0.90 resistance zone, while failure to hold $0.76 support could lead to a test of the lower $0.72-$0.74 area, where stronger buying interest might emerge. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos unveiled Teslink, a modular interoperability layer connecting Tezos with EVM-compatible chains like Ethlink.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it maintained an average price of $0.7232. XTZ kicked off August at $0.7605 and is currently trading around $0.79.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-28 02:58:05

Ethereum’s lead comes from its large pool of builders, while other chains have struggled when they couldn’t attract enough projects. BlockDAG (BDAG) is already proving different. With full EVM compatibility and more than 4,500 developers building, it doesn’t need to start from zero. Instead, it offers an instant home for Ethereum-native applications. This zero-switching-cost model does more than simplify migration. It accelerates growth by giving builders the ability to bring their dApps directly into BlockDAG ’s system without rewriting code or learning a new framework. Since developer time is one of the scarcest resources in Web3, this path reduces friction and makes adoption far more likely. That advantage has already sparked visible momentum before the mainnet launch. Why EVM Compatibility Is a Game Changer The Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, has become the standard for executing smart contracts. Networks like Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain have grown quickly by supporting it, offering developers lower fees or faster speeds while keeping the same coding tools. By embracing EVM compatibility, BlockDAG gains access to Ethereum’s pool of builders and applications. For developers, the benefit is clear. They can port dApps into BlockDAG without costly redevelopment. For BlockDAG, this provides an immediate stream of projects across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Analysts note this solves the cold start challenge that new blockchains face. Instead of waiting years to attract activity, BlockDAG is entering the field with usage already on the table. BlockDAG’s Developer Momentum Before Launch What makes BlockDAG stand out is that developer activity is already happening before the mainnet exists. Over 4,500 developers are engaged, with more than 300 dApps in progress across categories like finance, gaming, and NFTs. This level of traction is rare at the presale stage, showing BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than a fundraiser. Its presale performance reinforces that story. The project has raised over $385 million and sold more than 25.5 billion coins across 30 batches. Early buyers from batch one are already sitting on paper gains of 2,900%, with the coin now priced at $0.03. Miner sales have also passed $7.8 million, with over 19,400 miners sold worldwide. With a hard cap of $600M, BlockDAG is already set up with resources for listings and ecosystem expansion. The combination of developer adoption and presale momentum creates a strong foundation. Developers benefit from frictionless migration through EVM compatibility, while the presale provides the liquidity needed for growth. Analysts note that this dual-track strategy, technical adoption plus financial support, separates BlockDAG from other presales that rely solely on hype. This is why BlockDAG’s projections of hitting $1 by 2027, $5 by 2030, and even $10 in bullish cases feel more achievable. Developer traction ensures that demand is built on real-world usage rather than only speculation. Why Developers Choose BlockDAG BlockDAG’s architecture blends DAG scalability with Proof of Work security. Ethereum’s congestion and gas costs have long frustrated developers, but BlockDAG’s setup offers faster confirmations with parallel processing. Testnet results already show 10 blocks per second, with scalability expected to improve as adoption grows. For dApps that need speed and reliability, such as exchanges, lending apps, and gaming platforms, this is an attractive option. Builders get Ethereum-level programmability with Bitcoin-like security, giving them fewer trade-offs. The 300+ projects in progress across DeFi, gaming, and NFTs highlight the momentum. Analysts often say ecosystems grow in clusters, and once a few flagship projects move, more follow. With EVM compatibility lowering migration costs, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a natural option for Ethereum-based projects looking for scale. Building the Ecosystem on Familiar Ground BlockDAG’s decision to fully support EVM means it connects with the most widely used standard in Web3. It doesn’t reinvent development from scratch. Instead, it gives builders a smoother path and better tools. That’s why thousands of developers are already engaged before launch. Alongside its developer traction, cultural visibility is also growing. Sponsorships with Inter Milan and U.S. sports teams add mainstream exposure, while the builder community drives technical adoption. This balance of public visibility and developer depth helps seed the project from both ends. With batch 30 priced at $0.03 and a $0.05 listing confirmed, the presale ROI has already reached 2,900%. Long-term analyst targets of $1 to $10 depend on adoption, and developer activity makes those projections realistic. BlockDAG isn’t starting from zero, it’s starting with momentum.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum out of reach for many retail investors, attention has shifted to coins that still trade below the dollar yet show strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Analysts are closely watching Hedera, Dogecoin, and a fresh contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE . Backed by a HashEx audit, MAGACOIN is starting to make waves as one of the best altcoin to buy now for those seeking growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Secure Under-$1 Gem with 3800% Potential When discussing the best altcoins to buy under $1, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its blend of security and upside. The project has passed a full smart-contract audit from HashEx , a respected blockchain security firm known for rigorous testing. Passing all checks adds a layer of trust that investors usually demand from new projects. What’s drawing attention is MAGACOIN’s projected 3800% growth potential , fueled by rising adoption and its positioning as a secure choice in a volatile market. Analysts highlight that unlike meme-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building from the ground up with strong fundamentals and a clear focus on sustainable growth. There’s also growing demand around its launch phase, with early buyers still able to claim a 50% bonus using the code PATRIOT50X . For many investors scanning through undervalued altcoins 2025, MAGACOIN is emerging as a name worth watching closely. Hedera: Strong Enterprise Use Cases Point to Big 2025 For those searching for the best crypto to buy now , Hedera (HBAR) has been making its case through real-world adoption. The project recently attracted attention with SWIFT’s blockchain payment trials scheduled for November 2025, a step that could see up to $150 trillion in annual settlements flow through Hedera’s hashgraph. That’s a scale few networks can match. Enterprise activity also continues to climb, with $126 million in stablecoins issued on Hedera, led by USDC’s overwhelming share. Analysts are growing more confident in Hedera’s ability to position itself as one of the top altcoins for 2025. Market watchers are already discussing the Hedera price prediction 2025 , with estimates pointing toward the $0.55 range. Source Crypto YouTuber Jesu Martinez even said he’s “50X more bullish on HBAR” after recent talks with the project’s founders, suggesting late 2025 and 2026 could be strong years for long-term holders. Dogecoin: Whale Moves and ETF Hype Keep It in Focus Another project topping analyst lists of the best altcoins to buy under $1 is Dogecoin (DOGE). The coin remains a trader favorite, boosted by whale activity and growing speculation around a potential spot DOGE ETF. Recent whale transfers of nearly 900 million DOGE (≈$200 million) to Binance spiked volatility, but on-chain data shows that whales quietly accumulated 680 million DOGE during the same period. DOGE analysis by Ali This kind of accumulation has analysts paying close attention. Influencer Ali suggested on X that “ Dogecoin $DOGE: One last dip before the breakout!”, while More Crypto Online noted that the $0.20 level is a critical support area for the token’s structure. Looking ahead, many are eyeing the Dogecoin price prediction 2025 with growing optimism. If ETF approvals come through—analysts assign a 60–70% chance within the next 12–18 months—Dogecoin could strengthen its place among the top altcoins for 2025 and maintain its status as a best altcoin to buy now for those betting on mainstream exposure. Final Word: Which Altcoin Stands Out? The race for the best altcoins to buy under $1 has intensified, with Hedera’s enterprise growth and Dogecoin’s ETF speculation fueling strong narratives. Both have bullish 2025 price predictions, making them attractive to traders and long-term investors. Yet, analysts are quick to point out that MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a unique path. With an independent audit, rising adoption, and the chance for early supporters to grab a bonus, it’s gaining traction as the best crypto to buy now .

At the time of writing, the asset trades around $111,090, reflecting a 10.5% decline from its peak and a 4.2% drop over the past week. The pullback highlights growing uncertainty among traders as buying pressure weakens, even while some on-chain indicators suggest potential accumulation. One such signal comes from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Analyst Crazzyblockk, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, examined a metric called the Binance Buying Power Ratio. According to the analyst, this ratio, measuring the inflow of stablecoins relative to Bitcoin outflows from Binance, has recently climbed sharply, moving into positive territory. The implication is that traders are sending stablecoins into the exchange (potential buying power) while withdrawing Bitcoin, likely for long-term storage.

Binance Buying Power Ratio Signals Accumulation Crazzyblockk explained that this pattern points to a buildup of liquidity while simultaneously reducing the Bitcoin supply available for sale on Binance. In his words: Stablecoins in, BTC out. This combination of accumulating ‘dry powder’ and securing assets off-exchange is a classic sign of a market preparing for a bullish move. The surge in buying power ratio coincides with Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase, suggesting that some traders may be preparing for a rebound. Historically, an increase in stablecoin inflows has often preceded heightened trading activity, with many market participants using these reserves to enter positions once favorable conditions emerge. At the same time, large Bitcoin outflows from exchanges can reflect a broader trend of long-term holding behavior. Investors who transfer coins to private or institutional-grade wallets often intend to store them securely, limiting immediate selling pressure. If sustained, this dual trend of stablecoin accumulation and Bitcoin withdrawals could support the market by reducing available supply and preparing liquidity for upward moves. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Weakness While Binance metrics suggest optimism, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a more cautious indicator: the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for short-term holders (STHs). This metric measures whether coins moved on-chain are being sold at a profit or loss. Darkfost noted that the STH SOPR has now fallen below 1, with its monthly average sitting at the neutral point. In practical terms, this means that many recent buyers are no longer selling at a profit, and some are even taking losses. He wrote: Historically, when STH SOPR reaches this level, two scenarios are common. Either the market rebounds quickly, or short-term holders panic, leading to further losses. During this cycle, the second scenario has often played out—though these periods have consistently created opportunities for medium- to long-term investors. The comparison to late 2021, when Bitcoin last peaked at $69,000 before entering a prolonged correction, shows the weight of this signal. A persistent decline in SOPR could indicate rising pressure from traders seeking to exit, even as long-term holders demonstrate greater conviction.

Most depend on whitepapers, developer conferences, and presale updates to slowly gain credibility. BlockDAG has rewritten that script. With a sponsorship deal with Inter Milan, plus partnerships in rugby and cricket, the project has already stepped into the spotlight, positioning itself not only as a blockchain but as a brand with consumer presence. This early move into cultural visibility adds a new layer to the story. With more than $385M raised, 25.5B coins sold, and 200,000 holders already on board, BlockDAG is proving it can establish credibility both within crypto and with millions of sports fans. Analysts argue that this kind of visibility, so early in its lifecycle, is rare, and could drive a wave of retail participation. Sports Partnerships as a Branding Engine Inter Milan, one of Europe’s most recognizable football clubs, puts BlockDAG’s name in stadiums and on screens seen by millions every week. Beyond Europe, the project’s partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket extend visibility across U.S. sports markets, both of which are fast-growing hubs for digital assets. For most chains, mainstream sponsorships come years after launch. Solana leaned heavily on NFTs before moving into branding. Avalanche and Aptos focused on technical marketing. BlockDAG, however, is taking its shot at cultural recognition before listing, signaling ambition and intent to engage audiences beyond crypto insiders. Visibility in major sports is not just about exposure; it is about building trust. Mainstream audiences who might hesitate to engage with early projects recognize familiar names like Inter Milan. That connection can reduce barriers to participation, strengthening BlockDAG’s image as a credible project. This is particularly important because BlockDAG’s presale is primarily retail-driven. Unlike Aptos with $350M in VC funding or Avalanche with $230M raised from institutions, BlockDAG is pushing toward its $600M target with grassroots support. Sponsorships accelerate this retail-first model, pulling in non-crypto participants and reinforcing its identity as the “people’s blockchain.” Turning Visibility Into Participation Brand exposure alone is not enough, but BlockDAG has linked it to direct participation. Its X1 Mobile Miner app, downloaded by more than 2.5M users, which allows anyone to mine from their phone. Meanwhile, 19,500 units of its X10 hardware miners have been sold, creating an option for those seeking deeper involvement. Together, they form a pipeline: sports fans see the brand, curiosity drives downloads, and easy onboarding turns awareness into action. This two-track strategy, combining cultural visibility with simple entry points, explains why BlockDAG has reached adoption levels that other projects typically only achieve years after mainnet. Analysts See Strategic Value in Early Visibility From an analyst’s lens, BlockDAG’s sponsorships create more than brand buzz, they build strategic momentum. Ecosystem dominance often hinges on cultural recognition as much as technical strength. Ethereum became a leader not only because of smart contracts but because it captured cultural attention in DeFi and NFTs. Solana rose on the back of NFT hype and strong consumer mindshare. BlockDAG is moving on this front earlier than most. With EVM compatibility, 4,500+ developers, and more than 300 applications in progress, it is pairing technical credibility with global visibility. This dual approach, winning both developers and consumers, strengthens its position as it heads toward listing. For buyers, sponsorships reinforce presale confidence. At the Batch 30 price of $0.03 and a confirmed $0.05 listing, early participants are already looking at a clear 2,900% ROI pathway. Analyst predictions of $1 to $10 long-term valuations rely heavily on adoption, and mainstream visibility increases the odds by pulling in audiences beyond crypto-native communities. BlockDAG also stands out from competitors. Many presale projects launch with nothing more than a roadmap and an online group. BlockDAG, by contrast, enters the market with millions of fans already seeing its brand in stadiums and media, far outside traditional crypto circles. From Presale to Prime Time By partnering with Inter Milan and securing rugby and cricket sponsorships, BlockDAG is signaling an aggressive strategy: to debut not just as another blockchain, but as a global consumer brand from day one. Combined with $385M already raised, millions of mobile miners, and thousands of developers building, its presale success is being matched by cultural expansion. For a project still in presale, this level of mainstream exposure is highly unusual. Few ever reach stadiums, households, and media markets before they list. BlockDAG has managed it, and that early momentum could set the stage for one of the most anticipated Layer-1 launches of 2025.

50794592,567049,1756350053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50794592.jpeg,Bitcoin Strategy Deepens As Metaplanet Plans $880 Million Raise,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-metaplanet-880-million/,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet today announced plans to raise another 130 billion yen ($880 million) through an international share sale. Of that amount, the firm intends to allocate roughly $835 million toward purchasing additional Bitcoin (BTC). Metaplanet Eyes More Bitcoin Purchases According to a regulatory filing , Tokyo-based Metaplanet has approved a plan to raise as much as $880 million, with nearly $837 million set aside for fresh BTC acquisitions. To generate the funds, the company will issue 555 million new shares. This issuance could increase the number of Metaplanet’s outstanding shares from 722 million to approximately 1.27 billion. Often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” Metaplanet has emerged as one of Asia’s most prominent corporate Bitcoin holders. Data from CoinGecko shows the firm currently ranks as the world’s 8th largest public company by BTC reserves, holding 18,991 BTC on its balance sheet. The firm noted that proceeds from the offering will be used between September and October 2025 to accumulate Bitcoin. In addition, around $43.9 million will be reserved for other Bitcoin-related financial operations. It is important to highlight that the share sale will take place exclusively on international markets. In the US, sales will be restricted to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act. Metaplanet’s latest BTC purchase came earlier this week when the firm announced it had bought 103 BTC worth more than $11 million. At present, Metaplanet’s total BTC holdings are valued around $2 billion. The firm plans to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The firm’s strategy reflects a broader trend of corporations integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries. Healthcare company KindlyMD, recently announced a $5 billion stock sale to expand its BTC reserves. Commenting on the development, David Bailey, CEO, KindlyMD, said that the move to raise $5 billion is a natural next step following the firm’s initial purchase of 5,744 BTC earlier this month. On the CoinGecko list, KindlyMD currently ranks 16th in terms of total BTC held. Is BTC On The Verge Of Supply Crunch? BTC’s fixed supply of 21 million coins remains one of its most defining features. However, a significant portion of these coins has been lost in unrecoverable wallets, further reducing the effective circulating supply. As a result, a quiet race has begun among corporations, institutional investors, and even nation-states to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before prices climb further. Recently, a congressman in the Philippines introduced a bill proposing the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the nation. Meanwhile, Dutch crypto services company Amdax announced plans last week to launch a public Bitcoin treasury firm, while Nasdaq-listed Top Win International disclosed a $10 million raise for BTC purchases. In similar news, Turkish mobility app Marti Technologies stated last month that it will hold 20% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin. At press time, BTC trades at $112,013, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|bitcoin corporate treasury strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Metaplanet|share issuance,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ASIA|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 03:00:53

On-chain data suggests a substantial Infini founder ETH sale , specifically from Christian, the founder of the stablecoin neobank project Infini. This development has sparked considerable discussion and speculation within the crypto community, highlighting the constant scrutiny that high-profile figures face in the transparent world of blockchain. Unpacking the Infini Founder ETH Sale: The Details According to diligent on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, an address linked to Infini founder Christian appears to have offloaded a staggering 2,477 ETH. This amount translates to approximately $11.66 million at the time of the transaction, which occurred roughly ten hours ago. Such a large movement of assets naturally draws attention and raises questions about its motivations and potential impact. Let’s break down how this massive transaction unfolded: Decentralized Exchange Activity: A significant portion, 1,257 wrapped Ethereum (wETH), was sold on CowSwap, a decentralized exchange. The average sale price for this segment was reported at $4,777.6 per wETH. Centralized Exchange Deposit: The remaining 1,220 ETH was subsequently deposited into Binance, one of the world’s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The analyst’s report indicates that if the ETH deposited into Binance is also sold, Christian’s address would have entirely liquidated its Ethereum holdings. This complete exit from an asset position by a project founder is a notable event. Why Does This Infini Founder ETH Sale Grab Headlines? Anytime a founder, especially of a relatively new project like Infini, makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples. Transparency is a double-edged sword in crypto; while it allows for public verification, it also exposes individuals to intense scrutiny. This specific Infini founder ETH sale event is no exception. What are some of the immediate concerns? Project Stability: Large sales by founders can sometimes signal a lack of confidence in their own project’s long-term prospects or personal financial needs. Market Sentiment: Such transactions can influence investor perception and potentially impact the market value of related tokens or the broader crypto ecosystem. Transparency vs. Privacy: It underscores the ongoing debate between on-chain transparency and an individual’s right to financial privacy, even for public figures. Understanding On-Chain Analysis: How Do We Know? The ability to track such transactions stems from the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. On-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa utilize publicly available data to trace asset movements. They identify wallets associated with known entities and monitor their activity. This process allows the community to gain insights into the financial actions of key players. This level of transparency is a core tenet of decentralized finance (DeFi). It empowers the community to: Verify transactions without intermediaries. Monitor large movements that could affect market dynamics. Hold project founders accountable for their actions. What Are the Potential Ramifications of the Infini Founder ETH Sale? While the reasons behind Christian’s substantial ETH sale remain speculative, the event itself carries potential implications. It could be a strategic personal financial decision, unrelated to Infini’s health. Alternatively, it might suggest a shift in the founder’s investment strategy or even a need for liquidity. For Infini and its community, this news prompts questions about the project’s future direction and the founder’s continued involvement. It is crucial for projects to communicate clearly during such times to maintain investor trust and confidence. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto’s Transparent Waters The reported Infini founder ETH sale serves as a stark reminder of the transparent yet often complex nature of the cryptocurrency market. While on-chain data offers unprecedented insight, interpreting these movements requires careful consideration and context. Investors and community members must stay informed, relying on verified information and critical analysis rather than succumbing to immediate speculation. This event underscores the importance of due diligence and understanding the motivations behind significant transactions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. As the market matures, the interplay between founder actions, on-chain transparency, and community perception will continue to shape its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions About the Infini Founder ETH Sale Here are some common questions regarding this significant cryptocurrency event: Q1: Who is Christian, and what is Infini? A1: Christian is identified as the founder of Infini, a stablecoin neobank project. Infini aims to provide banking services utilizing stablecoins. Q2: What exactly happened with the ETH sale? A2: An address linked to Christian reportedly sold 2,477 ETH, valued at approximately $11.66 million. Part of this was sold on CowSwap, and the rest was deposited into Binance. Q3: How was this transaction discovered? A3: The transaction was discovered and reported by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who tracks and interprets publicly available data on blockchain networks. Q4: Does this sale mean Infini is in trouble? A4: Not necessarily. While a large founder sale can raise concerns, the exact reasons are unknown. It could be a personal financial decision, a strategic portfolio adjustment, or something else entirely. Projects often need to provide clear communication in such situations. Q5: What is the significance of depositing ETH into Binance? A5: Depositing a large amount of ETH into a centralized exchange like Binance often precedes a sale. If the deposited amount is sold, it would mean the address has fully liquidated its ETH position. Was this insight into the Infini founder ETH sale helpful?

Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a downside correction and tested the $4,310 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price found support and recently started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $4,400 and $4,420 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,956 swing high to the $4,310 low. However, the bears were active near the $4,630 resistance zone. The 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,956 swing high to the $4,310 low is acting as a hurdle. Recently, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $4,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,580 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,630 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,710 level. A clear move above the $4,710 resistance might send the price toward the $4,820 resistance. An upside break above the $4,820 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,880 resistance zone or even $5,000 in the near term. More Losses In ETH?

PI’s price continues to struggle, sliding to about $0.33. The upcoming token unlocks and the increased amount of coins stored on exchanges intensify the selling pressure, though rumors of a potential Coinbase listing keep hopes for a rebound alive. Information About the Upcoming Feature The team behind Pi Network issued another announcement regarding the .pi Domain Auction. It reminded that the platform-level utility “directly harnesses the collective resources of the Pi community,” including its attention and authenticity. Having said that, the developers expect the campaign to be successful. The auction is a bidding event that will enable Pioneers to acquire unique .pi domain names. These will replace the users’ long addresses, consisting of numerous letters and numbers, and will be similar in concept to .eth (Ethereum Name Services) and .bnb (BSC Name Services). “Designed for active use, .pi domains become recognizable access points for apps in the ecosystem, making it simple for others to find, use, and share,” the team said . Earlier this month, Pi Network reminded Pioneers that the auction has been extended to September 30, 2025, allowing them more time to innovate, build, and bid for their applications. The latest disclosure was met with mixed feelings. Some community members argued that the crypto project has much bigger problems to solve rather than focus on such a development. Others, though, praised the initiative, claiming it can generate more trust if delivered on time. PI’s Price Decline Despite the frequent developments surrounding the controversial project, the price of the native token has continued to sink. During the latest correction of the cryptocurrency market, PI plummeted to a new all-time low of roughly $0.33, representing a staggering 90% decline compared to the historical peak of around $3 witnessed in February. Factors like the multi-million token unlock scheduled for the next 30 days and the rising amount of coins stored on crypto exchanges increase the selling pressure. Contrary to the bearish landscape, there are still optimists who believe PI could reclaim its former peak and even surpass it. Additionally, there have been increased rumors that Coinbase may soon offer trading services for the asset. Such a move will most likely trigger a significant price surge, but as of this writing, there is no official announcement.

This development signals a significant step towards clarifying the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the nation. Why Are Stablecoins a Hot Topic in Korea? Stablecoins are a unique class of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, their inherent stability makes them attractive for everyday transactions and remittances. Globally, central banks and regulators are scrutinizing stablecoins due to their growing popularity. They present both opportunities for financial innovation and potential risks to financial stability if not properly managed. The Bank of Korea, therefore, is proactively addressing these complex issues to ensure a secure and efficient financial system. Crucial Stablecoin Discussions: What’s on the Table? On August 28, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong confirmed that the central bank is deeply involved in discussions with other relevant government bodies regarding stablecoin -related matters. This collaborative effort, as reported by iNews24, aims to develop a comprehensive framework.

Check forecast,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/28/whats-next-for-hype-after-hitting-a-new-ath-of-51-check-forecast/,"The cryptocurrency market has been volatile since the start of the week. Bitcoin briefly dropped below $110k earlier this week but clawed its way back above $112k a few hours ago. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has now slightly declined and is trading above $111,500. Its positive performance allowed altcoins to rally, with one setting a new all-time high. Hyperliquid’s HYPE set a new all-time high of $51 after adding 12% to its value in the last seven days. HYPE hits $51 amid growing volume HYPE, the native coin of the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, rallied to a new all-time high of $51 on Wednesday. The coin has since then lost 6% of its value and is now trading at $47 per coin. The coin’s new milestone comes as the decentralized exchange recorded a derivatives volume of over $357 billion in August , up nearly 10 times from the same period last year. Hyperliquid generated $105 million in trading fees, most of which were funneled to token buybacks. In addition to that, digital asset custodian BitGo added support earlier this week for the HyperEVM network. The HyperEVM network powers the Hyperliquid ecosystem, with BitGo’s adoption unlocking institutional access to the HYPE token. Finally, the Hyperliquid team announced that they have implemented a protocol upgrade after a sudden 2.5x price spike in its pre-launch XPL perpetual market caused widespread liquidations. An analyst revealed that four addresses participated in short-squeezing XPL on Hyperliquid, with cumulative profits reaching over $46 million. Following this incident, Hyperliquid is rolling out two key updates in its next network upgrade. The first upgrade will introduce a new hard cap to limit hyperp mark prices to 10x the 8-hour exponential moving average. This will offer vercollateralized shorts clearer risk boundaries. The second upgrade involves incorporating external perpetual market data into the mark price formula for hyperps. This will help improve the robustness of price signals in thin markets, without altering realized profit and loss or funding mechanisms. HYPE could hit $60 if the rally persists The HYPE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, thanks to HYPE adding 12% to its value in the last seven days. At press time, HYPE is trading at $47 but could rally higher and reclaim its all-time high in the near term. The technical indicators remain bullish, with the MACD lines deeply within the positive territory since the start of the week. The RSI of 59 also shows that HYPE still has room for growth. If the rally resumes, HYPE could reclaim its all-time high price of $51 in the coming hours or days before rallying to a new high around $55-$60. An extended rally would depend on the broader market. However, HYPE has lost 3% of its value in the last 24 hours and could face further correction. If the correction persists, HYPE could drop to the nearest support and TLQ level at $42.7. Failure to defend this level could see HYPE drop below $40 for the second time in a week. The post What's next for HYPE after hitting a new ATH of $51?

One of the clearest voices on this point is Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor), a crypto expert on X, who recently explained how XRP can be managed using the same wealth strategies employed by traditional elites. His view is that the real advantage lies in treating XRP as an appreciating asset to be collateralized, rather than sold, and not in seeking short-term gains. $XRP HOLDERS LISTEN UP People who keep saying “the yield is too small” you’re missing the point. It’s not about chasing crazy yields. It’s about adopting the same wealth strategies the elites have used for decades: using your assets as collateral instead of selling them.… https://t.co/hgBFvlf19w — Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor) August 26, 2025 The Elite Approach to Assets Demanincor emphasized that established financial practices among high-net-worth individuals rely less on selling appreciating assets and more on using them as collateral. He noted that “it’s not about chasing crazy yields” but about adopting wealth-building methods that have been employed for decades. In traditional markets, this approach is evident in equities, real estate, and even alternative assets such as art and bonds. Owners of these assets do not typically liquidate when they need liquidity. Instead, they secure credit lines against their holdings, thereby maintaining long-term exposure while gaining access to cash. Experts have consistently advised against selling XRP , and applying this strategy to crypto investments can help XRP holders retain their assets while addressing immediate financial needs. This keeps investors positioned for potential future gains while avoiding the disadvantages of selling during periods of volatility or at inopportune times. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Collateralization Works with XRP The concept presented by Demanincor can be summarized as an expansion of established wealth management strategies into digital assets. For example, an individual holding $20,000 in XRP who faces an unexpected $10,000 expense would previously have had little choice but to liquidate part of their position. Under the collateralization model, however, that same investor can borrow against their holdings. This approach preserves exposure to XRP’s future trajectory while also supplying liquidity when needed. A Long-Term Wealth Model for Crypto Investors This approach mirrors strategies long employed by wealthy investors, who borrow against appreciating assets rather than selling them. In traditional finance, it takes the form of margin loans for equities or home equity credit in real estate. With crypto, similar tools now exist for retail investors. Lending XRP to banks or institutions that need it could be a profitable way to earn passive income, and is just one of many methods XRP holders can employ. With the asset’s supply shrinking , XRP’s scarcity could increase its value over time. This makes Demanincor’s approach even more relevant, as collateralizing XRP allows holders to access liquidity while maintaining exposure to potential appreciation, ensuring they benefit from long-term growth rather than selling too early.

This massive wipeout left many traders reeling, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in digital assets. Understanding these sudden market shifts is crucial for anyone involved in crypto, as they often signal broader market movements and potential dangers. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations in Perpetual Futures? When we talk about crypto liquidations , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, typically due to adverse price movements. Perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements. However, this flexibility comes with increased risk, especially when using high leverage. Essentially, if the market moves strongly against a trader’s leveraged bet, the exchange automatically sells off their assets to cover potential losses. This mechanism protects both the exchange and other traders, preventing the account balance from going negative. Consequently, it can be devastating for the individual experiencing the liquidation, often leading to significant capital loss. The Recent $161 Million Crypto Liquidations: Who Was Hit Hardest? The recent 24-hour period saw a staggering $161 million in crypto liquidations across various major cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the impact on some key players: Bitcoin (BTC): Approximately $36.07 million in BTC positions were liquidated. A significant 62.68% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were caught off guard by a downturn. Ethereum (ETH): ETH liquidations were even higher, reaching $97.41 million. Similar to BTC, long positions accounted for a substantial 64.97%, indicating a strong market reversal against bullish bets. Solana (SOL): SOL experienced $27.78 million in liquidations. Interestingly, for SOL, short positions made up 56.48% of the total, suggesting traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed as SOL saw an unexpected upward movement or failed to drop as anticipated. Why Such Sudden Crypto Liquidations Occur? Several factors contribute to these rapid crypto liquidations . Market volatility is, of course, a primary driver. Cryptocurrencies are known for their dramatic price swings, which can quickly erode margin balances on leveraged positions. Other contributing elements include: High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage, magnifying both potential gains and losses. A small price movement can lead to a large percentage loss on the leveraged capital, triggering a liquidation. Market Manipulation or ‘Wick’ Hunts: Sometimes, large players can execute trades designed to push prices briefly to trigger liquidation levels, benefiting from the cascade of forced sales. Unexpected News or Macro Events: Global economic news, regulatory announcements, or even major project updates can cause sudden shifts in market sentiment, leading to rapid price changes and subsequent liquidations. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights to Avoid Crypto Liquidations While crypto liquidations are an inherent risk of leveraged trading, traders can adopt strategies to mitigate their exposure: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, especially in volatile markets. Lower leverage provides a larger buffer against price swings. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close a position if it reaches a predetermined loss level, protecting your capital. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that could influence crypto prices. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of the initial and maintenance margin requirements of your chosen exchange and manage your account balance accordingly. Diversify and Don’t Over-Commit: Avoid putting all your capital into a single highly leveraged position. Diversification and responsible position sizing are key to long-term success. The recent $161 million in crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the high stakes in perpetual futures trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of sudden losses due to leverage and market volatility is ever-present. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters and protect their investments. Stay informed, trade responsibly, and prioritize capital preservation in the dynamic world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. 2. How do crypto liquidations work? Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements of the exchange. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, usually when the market moves significantly against the trader’s bet. 3. Why were long positions liquidated more for BTC and ETH? For BTC and ETH, a higher percentage of long positions were liquidated, indicating that a significant number of traders were betting on price increases. When the market experienced a downturn, these bullish bets were caught off guard, leading to forced closures. 4. Why were short positions liquidated for SOL? For SOL, short positions accounted for a majority of liquidations. This suggests that traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed, possibly due to an unexpected upward price movement or a failure of the price to drop as anticipated, forcing them to close their positions at a loss. 5. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by managing leverage wisely, setting stop-loss orders, monitoring market conditions closely, understanding margin requirements, and diversifying their portfolios to avoid over-commitment to single positions. 6. What is the impact of large-scale crypto liquidations on the market? Large-scale liquidations can exacerbate market volatility, as forced sales can create further downward (or upward) pressure, leading to a cascade effect. They can also indicate a shift in market sentiment or the presence of significant market events. Did this article help you understand the dynamics of crypto liquidations?

Reports confirm that Goldman Sachs now holds an astounding $721 million in spot Ethereum ETFs , marking the largest institutional position recorded to date. This bold move signals a powerful shift in how established financial players view cryptocurrency, particularly Ethereum. Goldman Sachs Leads the Charge in Spot Ethereum ETFs Recent U.S. 13F securities filings, brought to light by Cointelegraph via X, reveal Goldman Sachs’ substantial commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. Their $721 million holding in spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t just a large number; it positions them as the leading institutional investor in this nascent yet rapidly growing sector. This kind of investment from a titan like Goldman Sachs lends immense credibility to Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. For those unfamiliar, 13F filings are mandatory quarterly reports filed by institutional investment managers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings disclose their equity holdings, offering a transparent look into the strategies of major financial entities. The fact that Goldman Sachs’ holdings are now public knowledge underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Why Are Institutions Embracing Spot Ethereum ETFs? The appeal of spot Ethereum ETFs for institutional investors is multi-faceted. These exchange-traded funds offer a regulated and accessible way for large financial firms to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the underlying cryptocurrency. This bypasses many of the operational complexities and regulatory uncertainties associated with direct crypto ownership, such as secure storage, compliance, and direct market access. Key benefits for institutional adoption include: Regulated Access: ETFs operate within established financial frameworks, providing a familiar and compliant investment vehicle. Liquidity: Trading on traditional exchanges offers superior liquidity compared to some direct crypto markets. Diversification: Adding Ethereum exposure allows institutions to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets. Ease of Management: ETFs simplify the investment process, reducing the burden of self-custody and technical challenges. Moreover, the approval and trading of these ETFs signify a growing maturity in the crypto market, providing a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Beyond Goldman Sachs: Other Major Players in Ethereum ETFs While Goldman Sachs holds the top spot, they are certainly not alone in recognizing the potential of spot Ethereum ETFs . Other significant institutional players are also making their mark: Jane Street: This prominent quantitative trading firm holds a notable $190 million in spot Ethereum ETFs. Millennium Management: Another major hedge fund, Millennium Management, has invested $186 million in these same ETFs. These substantial investments from multiple reputable firms highlight a broader trend. It indicates a collective institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the evolving digital landscape. The collective interest from such diverse and influential financial entities suggests that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum, is accelerating. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The significant institutional interest in spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. This influx of capital from major financial institutions can lead to: Increased Liquidity: More institutional money generally means deeper markets and greater trading volumes. Market Validation: Endorsement from firms like Goldman Sachs adds legitimacy and can attract further mainstream investment. Price Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can potentially contribute to greater price stability over time, reducing extreme volatility. Regulatory Clarity: The demand from institutions often pushes regulators towards developing clearer frameworks, which benefits the entire ecosystem. However, it is also important to consider potential challenges, such as increased market correlation with traditional assets and the ongoing need for robust regulatory oversight. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider the inherent volatility of the crypto market. In conclusion, Goldman Sachs’ monumental $721 million investment in spot Ethereum ETFs, alongside other major players, underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This move not only validates Ethereum as a serious investment asset but also accelerates its integration into mainstream finance. The future looks increasingly intertwined for traditional financial powerhouses and the innovative world of digital assets, with spot Ethereum ETFs acting as a crucial bridge.

This significant upward movement captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally. According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading impressively at $112,018.34 on the Binance USDT market. This surge highlights a robust momentum for the world’s leading digital asset. What’s Driving This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Rally? This recent ascent in Bitcoin price is not an isolated event; several factors often contribute to such significant market movements. Investors are closely watching for potential catalysts that fuel this kind of growth. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Increased Institutional Interest: More large financial institutions are showing interest and allocating capital to Bitcoin. This often signals growing mainstream acceptance. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties can sometimes push investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived safe-haven asset, similar to gold. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, especially post-halving events, can create upward price pressure when demand increases. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, improving its utility and scalability, also contribute to positive sentiment. How Does the Current Bitcoin Price Impact the Broader Market? When the Bitcoin price experiences such a strong rally, it often has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s dominance can influence altcoin performance, creating both opportunities and challenges for other digital assets. Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead. Therefore, a sustained rise in BTC can pull other cryptocurrencies upwards. However, it can also lead to capital flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin as investors chase the primary asset’s gains. This dynamic requires careful observation from traders and long-term holders alike. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider with This Bitcoin Price? While the current Bitcoin price action is exciting, it is important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Prices can fluctuate significantly, and rapid gains can be followed by swift corrections. Informed decision-making is key. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Diversifying portfolios and understanding market trends can help mitigate potential risks. Staying updated on market news and expert analysis is also a valuable strategy for navigating these dynamic conditions. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor market news and analysis from reputable sources. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Define your investment strategy clearly. Security: Ensure your holdings are secure in reliable wallets or exchanges. The surge in Bitcoin price above $112,000 marks a significant moment for the crypto world. This impressive rally underscores the growing maturity and appeal of digital assets. While the future remains unpredictable, the current momentum signals strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. As the market continues to evolve, staying engaged and informed will be paramount for all participants.

The BIS said that a third-party currency with sufficient liquidity is critical for efficient cross-border payments. According to him, this aligns directly with XRP’s function in Ripple’s model, which positions the digital asset as a neutral bridge currency capable of reducing reliance on fragmented correspondent banking.

This aligns perfectly with XRP’s role in Ripple’s model as an independent and neutral bridge asset that removes dependence on… pic.twitter.com/YN568Utujl — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 26, 2025 Three Dimensions of Interoperability In the video, the BIS speaker addressed the challenges of making digital currencies “talk to each other,” describing interoperability on three levels. The first involved domestic interoperability, where digital currency solutions must interact with existing systems on shared platforms. Such platforms, the speaker noted, create “huge network externalities” by allowing broader connectivity. The second level concerned cross-border transactions within the same currency. Although this could introduce further operational challenges, XRP can easily play this role. However, it was the cross-currency and cross-border dimension that was described as the most difficult. While XRP can also bridge multiple currencies, the speaker divided the problems into three categories: technology, liquidity, and policy. Technology, Liquidity, and Policy Barriers Technologically, systems rely on different cryptographic frameworks, making communication difficult, with the “messaging element” described as fundamental. Liquidity was identified as more complex, as many currency pairs lack natural demand. This makes an intermediary asset necessary. “You need to go and search for a third-party currency in order to make this settlement actually happen,” he explained. The most difficult barrier is policy, as nations apply divergent rules. While risk-based AML-CFT standards can be coded, principles-based regulations are harder to align. With over one hundred jurisdictions, “110 nations might have 110 different ways of looking at this.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Can XRP Solve This Problem? This focus on liquidity as an indispensable component of interoperability closely mirrors arguments about XRP’s intended utility. Ripple’s model uses XRP as a bridge asset to eliminate the need for multiple correspondent banking relationships. By providing independent liquidity that is not tied to the monetary policy of any one nation, XRP aims to streamline settlement across otherwise fragmented systems. SMQKE emphasized that the BIS framework essentially outlined the very problem XRP was designed to address . His post concluded that the institution’s acknowledgment of liquidity constraints reinforces the relevance of XRP as a neutral, liquid digital asset for efficient global payments.

50796248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80485,1756353643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin vs Shiba Inu — Meme Coin Battle Intensifies Ahead of October 2025 Market Repricing,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-meme-coin-battle-intensifies-ahead/,"The rivalry between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu is entering a decisive phase as October 2025 approaches. Both meme coins are drawing heightened interest from retail traders, while analysts expect broader market repricing to amplify their volatility. Dogecoin is leaning on its status as the original meme coin, while Shiba Inu continues to build out new utilities and community-driven governance. Yet as these two battle for dominance, analysts note that some early investors are already scouting new opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has attracted strong presale inflows and is is widely recognized for being legitimate and audited, is being discussed as a third force that could challenge the established meme coin order in the next cycle. Doge and Shib’s Investor Sentiment Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.213 as of August 2025. Forecasts for October point to a range between $0.239 and $0.274, with an average projection near $0.261. Bullish scenarios, fueled by celebrity endorsements and waves of retail enthusiasm, suggest possible moves to $0.80 or even $2 by the end of the year. Backed by Elon Musk’s public support and a long history of liquidity, DOGE retains an edge as the sector’s legacy asset. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, trades near $0.0000146. Analysts expect October levels to sit between $0.00004899 and $0.00005999, a potential leap tied to ongoing upgrades and DAO-led community development. SHIB’s strength lies in its innovation pipeline and grassroots engagement, though short-term momentum depends heavily on holding key support zones and sustaining trading activity. For SHIB holders, October is shaping up as a critical test of both technical resilience and market confidence. Meme Coin Market Dynamics The meme coin market overall is expanding, with retail traders and viral campaigns driving rapid cycles of price action. Regions such as North America and Asia-Pacific are proving pivotal, where tech-savvy populations and strong cultural momentum fuel adoption. Market watchers also highlight how integrations, celebrity visibility, and regulatory developments could sharply influence meme coin trajectories through Q4 2025. Dogecoin benefits most from cultural recognition and external endorsements, while Shiba Inu’s bet on added utility continues to attract a loyal base. However, the sector remains highly speculative, where momentum can shift overnight based on online trends or macro headlines. Analysts caution that volatility will remain elevated as October’s repricing nears. A Shifting Investor Outlook to This Crypto Presale While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are locked in a tight battle, presale momentum elsewhere is drawing early capital flows. Traders seeking exposure to the next breakout are increasingly turning toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, citing its strong community traction and exchange-ready positioning. Market analysts argue that the meme coin’s surge of presale demand signals a potential to separate itself from legacy meme plays during the next cycle. This shift in sentiment highlights how meme coin investors often hedge by diversifying across both established names and high-upside entrants. For many, Dogecoin provides short-term liquidity and visibility, Shiba Inu offers longer-term innovation potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a fresh opportunity that could capture the kind of exponential upside seen in earlier meme coin waves. Strategic Outlook Dogecoin appears positioned for stronger near-term moves, particularly if celebrity-driven speculation intensifies into year-end. Shiba Inu is leaning on its innovation roadmap and community strength, which could sustain it if utility upgrades deliver as promised. But analysts stress that crypto presale challengers like MAGACOIN FINANCE should not be overlooked, given the speed with which capital rotates in the meme sector. Ultimately, October 2025’s repricing will be determined by broader market sentiment, the flow of retail money, and unexpected events ranging from policy developments to high-profile endorsements. For investors navigating the meme coin arena, active monitoring and careful positioning in MAGACOIN remain essential.

Expert Predicts $1 Price Target As WLFI prepares to launch, the token will be available for trading on major platforms. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, already offers WLFI futures, which currently price the token at $0.2656, according to Binance’s futures data. The World Liberty Financial presale structure indicates that 20% of the tokens will be liquid, while the remaining 80% will be vested, providing a layered approach to distribution that could mitigate volatility in the early days of trading. Related Reading: Pundit Says Bitcoin Price Crash Is Not Over, Why A Decline Below $100,000 Is Coming Market expert Virtual Bacon recently shared an analysis on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), setting an ambitious price target of $1 for WLFI, which translates to a projected fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion. This could potentially represent a massive 276% from current levels in the futures market if Virtual Bacon’s projections hold true. Furthermore, WLFI would skyrocket to be one of the market’s top performers above established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This prediction highlights the potential market impact of World Liberty Financial, especially in light of the hype surrounding Trump’s official memecoin, TRUMP, which peaked at a fully diluted valuation of $73 billion 24 hours after its debut. Institutional Interest Surges For World Liberty Financial In contrast to the TRUMP memecoin launched earlier this year, the expert asserts that WLFI is positioned as a legitimate financial instrument, tied to the DeFi platform’s USD1 stablecoin and to US Treasuries. The expert believes that with Trump in office, the World Liberty Financial token carries a sense of credibility and utility that could attract institutional interest therefore boost its demand and price. The recently passed GENIUS Act for stablecoins and signed by President Trump could further increase the platform’s dollar-pegged cryptocurrency and its adoption and contribute to the platform’s overall bullish sentiment.

Additionally, the Nasdaq-listed fintech company ALT5 Sigma has committed $1.5 billion at a price of $0.20 to create the token’s first crypto treasury, similar to how publicly traded companies invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Virtual Bacon concludes by highlighting the launch of World Liberty’s official coin, coupled with institutional backing and a stablecoin aspect linked to crypto treasuries, positions WLFI as one of the most significant token events of the current financial cycle.

According to a Bloomberg report , the firms have partnered with Bluprynt, a fintech startup founded by Chris Brummer, to pilot a new approach that leverages cryptography and blockchain technology. Enhanced Transparency In Stablecoin Market? The pilot program is said to utilize Bluprynt’s technology to trace each token back to its verified issuer, thereby enhancing transparency in the stablecoin market in line with the recent legislations that aim to provide a new regulatory framework for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies . Brummer emphasized that this technology provides “provenance upfront,” which not only simplifies the verification process but also offers essential transparency for regulators and investors alike. He noted that such advancements could significantly mitigate risks associated with counterfeit tokens and impersonation attacks, which have become increasingly prevalent in the digital asset space. Per the report, the introduction of this verification technology could be advantageous for auditors, regulators, and investors, as it addresses the distinct security risks identified by firms like Chainalysis, which highlighted impersonation and fake stablecoins as common threats in a recent report. Mastercard And Circle Launch First Stablecoin Settlement In a related development, Mastercard has announced an expansion of its partnership with Circle to enable the settlement of USDC and EURC transactions for acquirers in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) regions. This initiative marks a milestone, as it is the first time the acquiring ecosystem in these regions will be able to settle transactions using dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. In its press release , Mastercard disclosed that acquiring institutions will be able to receive settlements in fully-reserved stablecoins issued by regulated Circle affiliates. Dimitrios Dosis, president of Mastercard for the EEMEA region, highlighted the strategic importance of this move by stating that the company aims to integrate stablecoins into the mainstream financial landscape. Kash Razzaghi, Chief Business Officer at Circle, echoed these sentiments, asserting that expanding USDC settlement across Mastercard’s extensive network represents a pivotal shift toward borderless, real-time commerce. Additionally, Mastercard is actively exploring broader use cases for regulated stablecoins in areas such as remittances, business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and payouts to gig workers and creators through platforms like Mastercard Move and the Multi-Token Network (MTN). As of this writing, Circle’s recently debuted stock, traded under the ticker symbol CRCL, is selling for $127 per share. For the first three weeks, the firm’s shares traded up, reaching a record high of $298. Since then, the firm’s valuation has dropped by nearly 58%.

Yet, even crypto investors must pay attention to the macro-economic tides, especially when major political shifts threaten global currency stability. The prospect of a Fed Shakeup under a potential future Trump administration is one such seismic event, with far-reaching implications for global markets, particularly for Asia FX and the mighty US Dollar . Understanding these dynamics is crucial, as traditional financial instability can often ripple into the digital asset space, creating both risks and opportunities. What is the Fed Shakeup and Why Does it Matter for the US Dollar? The Federal Reserve, often simply called the Fed, serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include managing monetary policy , maintaining price stability, maximizing employment, and supervising banks. The Fed’s independence from political influence is considered a cornerstone of its effectiveness, allowing it to make decisions based purely on economic data rather than short-term political agendas. However, former President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Fed’s policies, particularly its interest rate decisions. His past rhetoric and actions suggest a potential future administration might seek to exert greater political control over the central bank, possibly pushing for lower interest rates or even attempting to replace key officials with those more aligned with his economic views. This is the essence of a ‘Fed shakeup’ – a significant alteration in the Fed’s leadership, mandate, or operational independence. How Could a Fed Shakeup Impact the US Dollar? Interest Rate Uncertainty: A politically influenced Fed might be pressured to cut rates more aggressively or hold them lower for longer, irrespective of inflation data. Lower rates generally make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, potentially weakening the US Dollar . Loss of Credibility: If the Fed’s independence is perceived to be compromised, its credibility in the eyes of global investors could diminish. This could lead to a flight from dollar-denominated assets, further pressuring the currency. Inflationary Concerns: An overly accommodative monetary policy , driven by political imperatives rather than economic necessity, could spark inflationary pressures. While some inflation is normal, uncontrolled inflation erodes purchasing power and can destabilize an economy, negatively impacting the dollar’s value. The stability of the US Dollar is paramount, as it is the world’s primary reserve currency and the benchmark for global trade and finance. Any significant weakening or increased volatility could have ripple effects across all asset classes, including commodities and even digital assets. How Does Asia FX Respond to US Dollar Volatility and Monetary Policy Shifts? Asian currencies, collectively known as Asia FX , are highly sensitive to movements in the US Dollar and shifts in US monetary policy . This is due to several factors: Trade Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily export-oriented, with the US being a major trading partner. A strong dollar can make Asian exports cheaper for US buyers, but a weak dollar can make them more expensive, affecting trade balances. Capital Flows: When US interest rates rise, capital tends to flow out of emerging markets in Asia and into the US, seeking higher returns. Conversely, lower US rates can encourage capital to flow back into Asia. Dollar-Denominated Debt: Many Asian governments and corporations hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A strengthening dollar makes this debt more expensive to service in local currency terms, increasing financial strain. Reserve Management: Asian central banks hold vast reserves, much of which are in US Dollars. Changes in dollar value impact the value of these reserves. Examples of Asia FX Sensitivity: Historically, periods of US dollar strength or significant Fed policy changes have led to noticeable reactions across Asia FX . For instance, during the ‘taper tantrum’ of 2013, when the Fed signaled a reduction in its bond-buying program, several Asian currencies experienced sharp depreciations as capital fled the region. A potential Fed shakeup could introduce a new layer of uncertainty, leading to increased volatility for currencies like the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, South Korean Won, and the Indian Rupee. Central banks in these regions would likely be forced to intervene in their respective markets to stabilize their currencies, potentially burning through foreign exchange reserves or implementing their own defensive monetary policy adjustments. Table: Potential Impact of US Dollar Scenarios on Asia FX US Dollar Scenario (Post-Fed Shakeup) Potential Impact on Asia FX Example Asia FX Response Significant Weakening (due to lower rates/loss of confidence) Asian currencies may strengthen against the USD, making exports more expensive. However, capital inflows could increase. Japanese Yen (JPY) and Korean Won (KRW) could appreciate, potentially leading to central bank intervention to curb strength. Increased Volatility/Uncertainty (due to unpredictable policy) Wider trading ranges, higher risk premiums for Asian assets, potential for sudden capital outflows. Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and Philippine Peso (PHP) might see sharp, unpredictable swings, requiring active central bank management. Unexpected Strengthening (e.g., if global safe-haven demand overrides policy concerns) Asian currencies would depreciate, increasing dollar-denominated debt burdens and making imports more expensive. Indian Rupee (INR) could face renewed depreciation pressure, as could the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). The Indian Rupee Under Pressure: Unique Vulnerabilities and Monetary Policy Challenges The Indian Rupee (INR) has historically been one of the more vulnerable currencies in Asia FX , often facing pressure during periods of global uncertainty or US dollar strength. This vulnerability stems from several factors unique to India’s economy: Current Account Deficit: India often runs a current account deficit, meaning it imports more than it exports. This creates a structural demand for foreign currency (primarily USD) and puts downward pressure on the Rupee. Oil Imports: India is a major importer of crude oil, which is priced in US Dollars. Rising global oil prices automatically increase the demand for dollars and weigh on the Indian Rupee . Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) Flows: The Indian market is a significant destination for FIIs. However, these flows can be volatile. If global risk sentiment sours or US interest rates become more attractive, FIIs tend to pull money out of India, weakening the Rupee. Inflation: High domestic inflation, if not adequately addressed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through its monetary policy , can erode the Rupee’s value. How a Fed Shakeup Could Intensify Rupee Pressure: A potential Fed shakeup could exacerbate these existing pressures on the Indian Rupee . If the US Dollar experiences significant volatility or an unpredictable trajectory due to altered Fed policies, the RBI would face a complex challenge. For instance, if the dollar weakens substantially, the RBI might be concerned about imported inflation, but if it strengthens unexpectedly, the pressure on India’s current account and external debt servicing would increase dramatically. The RBI’s monetary policy would need to be nimble and proactive, potentially involving interventions in the forex market, adjustments to domestic interest rates, or capital control measures to stabilize the Rupee. This constant balancing act highlights the delicate position of emerging market currencies in the face of major global economic shifts. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Investors and Central Banks The prospect of a Fed Shakeup and its potential ramifications for the US Dollar , Asia FX , and the Indian Rupee demands careful consideration from all market participants. For investors, whether in traditional assets or cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro trends is vital for risk management and identifying opportunities. For Investors: Diversify Portfolios: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with currency volatility. This includes exploring digital assets that may offer a hedge against traditional market instability. Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and Asian central banks (like the RBI). Their forward guidance on monetary policy will offer clues about future currency movements. Hedge Currency Exposure: For those with significant exposure to specific currencies, consider hedging strategies to protect against adverse movements. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of uncertainty, strong economic fundamentals (e.g., low debt, stable growth, robust trade balances) will be key differentiators for national currencies and their underlying economies. For Central Banks in Asia: Strengthen Foreign Exchange Reserves: Maintaining robust foreign exchange reserves provides a buffer against sudden capital outflows and allows for market intervention to stabilize currencies. Coordinate Monetary Policy: While independence is key, regional coordination or at least clear communication among Asian central banks could help manage spillover effects from US policy changes. Prudent Fiscal Management: Governments should aim for sustainable fiscal policies to reduce reliance on external borrowing and strengthen economic resilience against global shocks. Develop Domestic Capital Markets: Deep and liquid domestic capital markets can reduce reliance on foreign capital, making economies less vulnerable to sudden shifts in global investor sentiment. Concluding Thoughts: The Interconnectedness of Global Finance The potential for a Fed Shakeup serves as a potent reminder of the profound interconnectedness of global financial markets. Decisions made in Washington D.C. can send ripples across continents, impacting the value of the US Dollar , influencing Asia FX , and putting specific pressure on currencies like the Indian Rupee . While the future remains uncertain, a proactive and informed approach to understanding these macro-economic forces is essential for investors, policymakers, and indeed, anyone navigating the complex landscape of global finance. The interplay between political rhetoric, central bank independence, and monetary policy will continue to shape currency markets for years to come. Staying informed about these developments is not just about forecasting currency movements; it is about understanding the very fabric of global economic stability.

Investment advisory firms are now the dominant holders of ETH ETFs , signaling a powerful shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a clear indication of growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s potential. Unveiling the Dominant Holders of ETH ETFs Recent analysis by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart reveals a fascinating trend. Investment advisory firms have emerged as the largest holders of ETH ETFs , amassing an impressive $1.35 billion in assets. This substantial figure represents a remarkable 68% increase from the previous quarter, highlighting a rapid acceleration in institutional interest. Trailing behind, hedge funds hold the second position with $690 million. This data underscores a broader narrative: professional money managers are actively integrating Ethereum-backed financial products into their portfolios. Therefore, the landscape of crypto investment is visibly maturing. Why Are These Firms Embracing ETH ETFs? So, what’s driving this significant influx into ETH ETFs ? Several key factors make these regulated products appealing to large investment advisory firms: Regulated Access: ETH ETFs offer a familiar, regulated investment vehicle. This allows traditional firms to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities and custodial challenges of direct crypto ownership. Diversification: For many firms, adding ETH ETFs provides portfolio diversification. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem and smart contract capabilities, offers a unique value proposition distinct from traditional assets. Client Demand: As client interest in cryptocurrencies grows, firms need accessible and compliant ways to meet that demand. ETH ETFs perfectly bridge this gap. Growth Potential: Despite market volatility, Ethereum’s long-term growth prospects, fueled by its role in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3, remain attractive to forward-thinking investors. The Impact of Institutional Adoption on ETH ETFs and Ethereum The increasing institutional embrace of ETH ETFs carries profound implications for both the Ethereum network and the broader crypto market. Firstly, it lends significant credibility to Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. When large, reputable firms allocate substantial capital, it sends a strong signal to other potential investors. Moreover, this institutional validation can lead to increased market liquidity and stability. As more traditional capital flows into ETH ETFs , it can help reduce price volatility and create a more robust trading environment. Ultimately, this integration accelerates the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Navigating the Future: What This Means for Your Portfolio and ETH ETFs For individual investors, this shift offers both opportunities and considerations. The growing presence of investment advisory firms in the ETH ETFs space suggests a more mature and potentially less volatile market. However, it’s crucial to remember that all investments carry risk. Key takeaways for investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market trends and regulatory developments concerning ETH ETFs . Diversify Wisely: Consider how ETH ETFs fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Do Your Due Diligence: Research the specific ETF products and their underlying structures before investing. The journey of Ethereum and its related financial products is still evolving, but this surge in institutional holding marks a pivotal moment. In conclusion, the rise of investment advisory firms as the largest holders of ETH ETFs is a monumental milestone. It signifies a profound maturation of the cryptocurrency market and underscores Ethereum’s growing importance in the global financial landscape. This trend is not merely about asset accumulation; it’s about the mainstreaming of a revolutionary technology, paving the way for a more integrated future between traditional finance and digital assets. The message is clear: institutions are here, and they’re serious about Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly are ETH ETFs?

Their withdrawal came after they were reportedly advised to avoid interactions with Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump. Eric Yip Chee-hang, executive director of the HK Securities and Futures Commission, is no longer listed as a keynote speaker. Legislator Johnny Ng Kit-chong, a technology entrepreneur, was also removed from the agenda. Both names had appeared on the site in mid-July, shortly after organisers announced Eric Trump’s participation. Instead of Yip, Clarence Shen, an SFC manager who oversees fintech policy, will represent the regulator at the two-day event. Securities and Futures Commission executive director Eric Yip and lawmaker Johnny Ng have removed themselves from the upcoming Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference featuring US President Donald Trump's son Eric. “There is a request to lawmakers asking them not to attend the forum that… pic.twitter.com/HDxcAWl9pG — Aaron Busch (@tripperhead) August 28, 2025 Absences At Bitcoin Asia Linked To Official Guidance On Crypto Caution Eric Trump is scheduled to appear in Hong Kong on Friday for two sessions titled “All in on Bitcoin” and “Bitcoin Takes Over the World.” He is co-founder of mining venture American Bitcoin and has been involved in World Liberty Financial, a Trump family-backed project focused on digital assets. SCMP reported Wednesday that Ng said his withdrawal was linked to personal matters that clashed with the conference agenda. Meanwhile, the SFC described Yip’s absence as the result of a business trip. Further, the report said officials had been advised to keep a low profile on crypto issues. In particular, they were urged to be cautious when stablecoins and cross-border capital flows are under scrutiny. The guidance came ahead of the conference, which is being held in Hong Kong for the second time since last year as the city continues its push to establish itself as a hub for digital assets. US Tariffs On Hong Kong Imports Add Pressure Amid Escalating Trade Dispute Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said the move aimed to avoid perceptions of cooperation with Donald Trump. Further, he noted that the Trump family’s involvement in crypto businesses has previously drawn criticism. In particular, critics argue it blurs the line between personal interests and public roles. Bitcoin Asia, organized by BTC Inc, is one of the largest industry gatherings worldwide. The event attracts investors, miners and policymakers from across the region. The conference comes as Hong Kong balances its ambitions to grow as a digital asset hub with the political realities of strained China-US relations. The timing shows the sensitivity of today’s political climate. Since his return to the White House in January, Donald Trump has placed crypto at the center of his economic agenda. Moreover, he has unveiled new regulations that supporters believe could transform the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” At the same time, his administration has intensified trade tensions. Specifically, Washington has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Hong Kong imports. As a result, the city now sits at the center of the latest phase of the tariff war between the US and China.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-got-a-major-boost-from-china-heres-the-latest/,"Crypto monitoring account WhaleWire reported that Linklogis, a major Chinese financial technology company, has chosen the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to support its supply chain finance platform. The update highlighted that Linklogis operates a trillion-dollar finance ecosystem and is now moving these operations to XRPL, a development described as a significant milestone for XRP. WhaleWire noted that the integration would power real-world assets, cross-border payments, and trade finance through the blockchain infrastructure. Linklogis has positioned itself as one of China’s largest supply chain finance providers, with services that extend across various global markets. By integrating with XRP Ledger, the company seeks to boost the efficiency, transparency, and speed of its financial operations, particularly in areas where cross-border trade requires fast settlements and reliable asset tokenization. BREAKING: $XRP just scored a huge win in China. Linklogis, a fintech powerhouse, is moving its trillion-dollar supply chain finance platform onto the XRP Ledger. Real-world assets, global payments, and trade finance, all powered by XRPL. pic.twitter.com/l0MBzDxWLn — WhaleWire (@WhaleWire) August 26, 2025 Community Responses and Observations Following the announcement, members of the digital asset community offered perspectives on what the move could mean for XRP. A user identified as MCDC25 stated that Linklogis’s platform integration with XRPL could increase transaction activity, resulting in more XRP being burned, which supports its deflationary mechanics. They added that the adoption strengthens XRP’s use in cross-border payments and real-world assets, increases institutional interest, and provides advantages in navigating both regulatory and geopolitical frameworks. Another comment from PF Studio raised the question of how such integration could occur, given China’s restrictions on cryptocurrency. They asked how the partnership was possible under China’s ongoing crypto ban. Clarifications on Regulatory Considerations In response, Ask Perplexity addressed the concern by explaining that China continues to enforce a strict ban on cryptocurrency use within its mainland jurisdiction, including trading, mining, and even personal ownership. Under these laws, XRP cannot be used by individuals or most companies domestically. However, the clarification pointed out that the partnership is not aimed at serving users inside mainland China. Instead, the focus lies on Linklogis’s cross-border operations, which are international in scope. Many of these functions are conducted through overseas subsidiaries or initiatives in regions such as Hong Kong, where the regulatory environment is more open to blockchain technologies. By concentrating on global trade and finance, the partnership avoids direct conflict with China’s domestic restrictions while still leveraging XRPL for international applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Significance of the Partnership Reports from financial and blockchain outlets confirm that Linklogis is using XRPL to tokenize trade receivables, invoices, and other real-world assets, enabling faster settlements and greater efficiency in international trade finance. While most of Linklogis’s operations are domestic, its cross-border business has grown significantly, extending into more than two dozen countries and managing billions in international trade assets annually. The XRPL integration is expected to initially support these cross-border activities, where blockchain technology provides immediate benefits. Industry sources note that XRPL’s established infrastructure, with its low-cost transactions and capacity for tokenization , is well-suited for trade finance and institutional adoption. By choosing XRPL, Linklogis is aligning with a blockchain designed to handle large-scale, real-world financial operations. This partnership also illustrates how companies in highly regulated environments are pursuing blockchain solutions through global channels. Although China maintains its ban on domestic cryptocurrency activities, Linklogis can apply blockchain technology to its international supply chain operations. The development strengthens XRPL’s positioning as a platform for enterprise-grade finance, particularly in the expanding market of tokenized real-world assets .

Ethereum Has Outperformed Bitcoin In Spot ETF Netflows In a new post on X, institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Ethereum spot ETF netflow. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset like ETH without having to directly own the asset. The ETFs trade on traditional platforms, so investors unfamiliar with digital asset wallets and exchanges can just choose to invest into the cryptocurrency through them. This pathway into digital assets is relatively new, with BTC only getting spot ETF approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and ETH in mid-2024. Generally, Bitcoin spot ETFs tend to outpace Ethereum in terms of capital flows, as Bitcoin is the larger asset with more interest behind it. Recently, however, things have been different. As Sentora explains, Interestingly, ETH ETFs have now outperformed BTC ETFs for seven straight days; a trend that may signal growing investor rotation and strengthening relative sentiment toward ETH. That said, while ETH has done better than BTC in this period, it doesn’t mean the coin has enjoyed only inflows. As data from SoSoValue shows, the coin’s ETFs were facing outflows just earlier. Even during the outflows, however, Ethereum spot ETFs were doing better than Bitcoin’s as they were just bleeding to a lesser degree. In the past few days, the netflow has turned positive for the asset, with net inflows of $455 million occurring on Tuesday. Before the recent negative flows, the ETH spot ETFs had been on a weekly net inflow run since May, as is apparent from the chart shared by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode . The streak-breaking week saw a net outflow of around 105,000 ETH ($486 million). It now remains to be seen whether the end of this week would bring back green on this graph. Speaking of weekly figures, another indicator that ETH has recently seen a decline in is the Active Addresses , as Sentora has pointed out in another X post . As displayed in the above chart, Ethereum saw around 3.8 million addresses participating in transaction activity on the blockchain last week. This is down compared to the peak from early August, but still high when lined up against the past bull markets. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $4,600, up more than 7% over the last week.",Ethereum|bitcoin ETFs|ETH|Ethereum ETFs|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 05:00:16

At the time of writing, the asset is trading at $112,0474, reflecting a decline of 7.5% in the past two weeks. The latest movements come as analysts examine on-chain metrics to assess whether the current slowdown represents a pause in the ongoing bull cycle or the beginning of a broader correction. One of the key indicators gaining attention is Bitcoin’s active addresses metric. According to PelinayPA, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the number of active addresses has consistently remained high, suggesting that network usage is stable despite the recent price retracement. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin? Key Developments After Falling To $112,000 Active Address Growth Signals Resilient User Base The analyst notes that long-term data shows a strong correlation between address activity and market cycles, with spikes often coinciding with peaks and declines aligning with bear markets. PelinayPA outlined how active addresses have historically tracked Bitcoin’s broader price behavior. From 2010 through 2016, addresses expanded steadily as Bitcoin’s adoption grew. The 2017 bull run brought a sharp increase, while the 2018–2019 downturn saw a decline in both addresses and price. The most recent cycle again highlighted the relationship, with addresses surging alongside Bitcoin’s run to new highs in 2020–2021 before dropping in 2022 during the market correction. Since 2023, however, activity has stabilized, with daily active addresses consistently ranging between 900,000 and 1 million. As of now, approximately 919,000 addresses are active, reflecting sustained network use. PelinayPA emphasized that while addresses alone are not a perfect price predictor, consistently elevated activity provides long-term support for Bitcoin’s valuation. If addresses maintain levels above 1 million, it could underpin the case for further gains, with potential targets in the $150,000–$200,000 range. Conversely, a sharp decline in address activity would signal reduced demand and raise the likelihood of a reversal toward the $80,000–$90,000 range. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Reach Multi-Year Lows In addition to user activity, exchange inflows offer another perspective on current market conditions. CryptoOnchain, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlighted that Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average of inflows has dropped to its lowest level since May 2023. Historically, low exchange inflows suggest reduced selling pressure, as fewer coins are being moved to trading platforms for liquidation. This trend is particularly notable on major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Cost Basis Aligns With Critical Indicator: Support Builds Around $100K Level On Coinbase, a platform often associated with US and institutional investors, inflows have significantly decreased, pointing to diminished selling activity from large holders. A similar pattern is visible on Binance, which continues to host the highest global trading volumes. According to CryptoOnchain, the combination of lower inflows and rising price levels may indicate an environment where available supply is constrained, creating conditions that could support higher valuations in the mid-term.

The Binance Coin (BNB) price just hit $882, supported by a sharp increase in active users crossing 3 million. Meanwhile, OKB jumped 152% in a single week, boosted by a major burn event and the launch of its own Layer-1 chain. Both show strong short-term action, yet they depend on upgrades within their existing ecosystems. BlockDAG, however, is separating itself by delivering results before launch. With 19,000 miners shipped, confirmed CEX listings, and live payouts through mobile mining and referrals, BlockDAG has raised $385 million and sold 25.5 billion coins in its presale. This ability to execute early is what makes it one of the top rated cryptos right now. BlockDAG Isn’t Just a Presale – It’s Already Delivering Most projects make promises about future value, but BlockDAG is already placing working tools in users’ hands before its mainnet launch. To date, more than 19,000 X-Series miners have been shipped, offering tangible proof that its hardware and network are real, not theoretical. On the exchange front, major listings with platforms like MEXC and BitMart are already confirmed, giving BlockDAG a clear path to liquidity and market access once it goes live. What makes BlockDAG stand out even more is its live earning system. Through the X1 mobile miner app, users can generate daily rewards via Proof-of-Engagement. At the same time, its 25% referral structure allows community members to earn instantly, creating an ecosystem where rewards are distributed in real time rather than left as distant promises. The presale data highlights this momentum: $385 million raised, over 25.5 billion coins sold, and an impressive 2,900% ROI since batch 1. Currently priced at $0.03 in batch 30, the project remains well under its $600M hard cap, leaving significant room for growth. Rather than asking participants to wait, BlockDAG is delivering now, shipping miners, confirming exchange deals, and rewarding activity ahead of its chain launch. This combination of action and adoption has positioned it as one of the top rated cryptos for 2025 and beyond, proving that credibility is built on execution, not speculation. Binance Coin Price Eyes $1,000 as Activity Climbs The Binance Coin (BNB) price reached a new high of $882.60, driven by surging usage. Daily active addresses have crossed 3 million, the most since June, showing strong real-world activity is fueling its move. Analysts now see $900 as the next resistance, with $1,000 a realistic target if momentum continues. Key support sits between $740 and $820, providing stability for recent buyers. The steady increase in on-chain activity is an encouraging sign that BNB’s growth has a foundation beyond short-term hype. Even with its strength, BNB’s path forward depends on sustaining this activity. By comparison, BlockDAG’s ability to pay out rewards and ship miners today adds a practical edge, strengthening its position as a top rated crypto. OKB Price Analysis: Burn and New Layer-1 Spark 152% Surge The latest OKB price analysis highlights a 152% weekly surge, driven largely by utility upgrades and a massive burn. OKX recently removed 65 million OKB, worth roughly $7.3 billion, cutting circulating s upply and spurring demand. A second major catalyst is the rollout of X Layer, OKX’s new Layer-1 built on Polygon’s zkEVM. With OKB now serving as the sole gas asset across its wallet, exchange, and payment services, demand pressure has intensified. Trading volume spiked 72%, while market cap rose 24%, reflecting the bullish shift. While this growth is notable, it stems primarily from supply manipulation and ecosystem integration. By contrast, BlockDAG’s rise as a top rated crypto is tied to measurable adoption, with miners shipped, referrals live, and real payouts in place. BlockDAG Sets a Higher Bar for Presales BNB’s rise and OKB’s surge prove how network upgrades and burns can drive attention. Yet both rely on changes within their ecosystems to justify higher valuations. BlockDAG takes a different approach; it’s already delivering. With 19,000 miners shipped, $385 million raised, and over 25.5 billion coins sold, its momentum is clear. Add confirmed exchange listings and real-time user rewards through mining and referrals, and BlockDAG demonstrates why it’s being called a top rated crypto .

The total notional open interest (OI) in ETH futures recently surpassed $10 billion for the first time on record, according to data shared by the exchange with CoinDesk. Early this month, the number of large open interest holders hit a record 101. Notional OI represents the dollar value of the number of active or open contracts at a given time. The CME offers standard contracts sized at 50ETH and micro contracts sized at 0.1 ETH. The large holders are those that hold at least 25 ether contracts open at a given time. The new high in open interest accompanies other record-breaking metrics, including the number of open micro ether contracts, which has exceeded 500,000, and ether notional options open interest topping $1 billion. Ether options OI in contract terms reached a year-to-date high of over 4,800 contracts. ""We're certainly seeing a resurgence and renewed enthusiasm in Ether futures -- especially as it relates to institutional participation. Our Ether futures Large Open Interest Holders (LOIH) hit a record of 101 during the week of August 5. This is a critical indicator for market participants as it signals a strengthening of the institutional and professional ecosystem around ether,"" Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, told CoinDesk in an email. ""As far as broader trends around the surge, increased network activity, corporate treasury accumulation of ether, and positive regulatory developments have further contributed to a broad-based rally around ether and ether-based derivatives,"" Vicioso added. While the ether market is booming, open interest in standard bitcoin (BTC) futures, sized at 5 BTC per contract, remains subdued at 137,300 BTC ($15.3 billion), significantly lower than the December high of 211,000 BTC, according to data source Velo. Ether hit record high Ethereum's native token ether, the second-largest token by market value, has risen 23% this month, hitting lifetime highs above $4,900 at one point, according to CoinDesk data. The U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted $3.69 billion this month, validating the gains in ether prices. The continued inflows extend a four-month streak of positive net investments, according to data from SoSoValue .

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring , BTC has achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring above the $113,000 mark. Specifically, on the Binance USDT market, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $113,065.36. This incredible surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting many to ask: what exactly is fueling this monumental rise? What’s Driving the Bitcoin $113,000 Milestone? Several key factors are contributing to this significant upward momentum, pushing Bitcoin to new heights. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the current market dynamics. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; instead, it reflects a confluence of powerful forces. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, integrating it into their portfolios and services. This growing institutional interest brings substantial capital and legitimacy to the crypto space. Supply Squeeze: The limited supply of Bitcoin, coupled with increased demand, naturally drives prices higher. The recent halving events further reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, intensifying this effect. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties often lead investors to seek safe-haven assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and perceived store-of-value properties, has emerged as a strong contender against traditional assets. Growing Retail Interest: Everyday investors are also flocking to Bitcoin, fueled by positive news and the desire to participate in its growth. This widespread enthusiasm creates a robust demand environment. These elements combine to create a powerful bullish sentiment, propelling the Bitcoin $113,000 achievement. Understanding the Impact of Bitcoin $113,000 on the Market The achievement of Bitcoin $113,000 sends ripples across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It profoundly influences market sentiment, investor behavior, and even the performance of altcoins. This milestone acts as a psychological benchmark, reinforcing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. When Bitcoin experiences such a significant surge, it often leads to: Increased Market Confidence: A strong Bitcoin performance typically boosts overall market optimism, encouraging more investment across the board. Altcoin Rally Potential: While Bitcoin leads the charge, altcoins often follow suit. As Bitcoin gains, investors may reallocate some profits into other promising cryptocurrencies, leading to an “altcoin season.” Media Attention: Major price movements attract mainstream media attention, which in turn can draw new investors into the market, creating a positive feedback loop. Profit-Taking Opportunities: For early investors, this price point offers a chance to realize substantial gains. However, this can also lead to temporary pullbacks as some decide to sell. Ultimately, the move past Bitcoin $113,000 underscores the digital asset’s growing maturity and its undeniable presence in global finance. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Do After Bitcoin $113,000? While the excitement around Bitcoin $113,000 is palpable, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile. Therefore, a thoughtful and strategic approach is essential for any investor. Panic buying or selling can lead to significant losses, highlighting the importance of informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this dynamic period: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on headlines. Thoroughly investigate any asset before investing. Understand its technology, use case, and market position. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Your personal financial situation should always guide your investment decisions. Consider Diversification: Spreading your investments across various assets can mitigate risk. While Bitcoin is strong, a balanced portfolio often includes other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Long-Term Perspective: Many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term strategy, focusing on Bitcoin’s potential over years rather than chasing short-term gains. This approach helps weather market fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Knowledge is your best tool in this fast-paced environment. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future results. Make choices that align with your financial goals and risk profile, especially when Bitcoin reaches milestones like Bitcoin $113,000 . The Road Ahead for Bitcoin: Beyond $113,000 As Bitcoin firmly establishes itself above the $113,000 mark, the conversation naturally shifts to what lies ahead. While predicting exact future prices is impossible, we can analyze potential scenarios and influential factors. The journey of Bitcoin $113,000 is a testament to its resilience, yet challenges and opportunities always exist. Potential future developments include: Further Institutional Inflows: Continued adoption by large financial entities could push prices even higher, creating new demand floors. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer global regulations could reduce uncertainty, making Bitcoin more attractive to a broader range of investors. Technological Advancements: Improvements in scalability and security, such as the Lightning Network, enhance Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. Global Economic Shifts: Ongoing inflation concerns or geopolitical events might further solidify Bitcoin’s role as a hedge asset. However, potential headwinds like increased regulatory scrutiny, market corrections, or emerging competitors also remain. The path beyond Bitcoin $113,000 will likely be dynamic, characterized by both growth and periods of consolidation. The recent surge of Bitcoin above $113,000 is more than just a number; it represents a significant moment in the cryptocurrency narrative. It highlights Bitcoin’s growing strength, market acceptance, and its potential to reshape the financial landscape. While the journey ahead will undoubtedly have its ups and downs, this milestone serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its capacity for remarkable growth. Staying informed and approaching the market with a well-thought-out strategy will be key for navigating the exciting times ahead.

A1: The achievement of Bitcoin $113,000 typically signals strong bullish sentiment, often leading to increased investor confidence and potentially sparking rallies in altcoins as capital flows from Bitcoin into other digital assets. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after it reached $113,000? A2: Whether it’s “too late” depends on your individual investment goals and risk tolerance. While the price is high, many believe Bitcoin has long-term growth potential. However, always conduct your own research and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk. Q3: What factors could cause Bitcoin’s price to drop from $113,000? A3: Potential factors include significant profit-taking by large holders, unexpected regulatory crackdowns, major security breaches in the crypto ecosystem, or adverse macroeconomic shifts that reduce investor appetite for risk assets.

While Ethereum shows potential for a price surge following Trump Media’s $105 million CRO acquisition, another standout is Remittix (RTX) . Focused on fast, low-cost cross-border payments, Remittix is gaining attention for real-world utility. With its presale momentum and upcoming wallet beta, RTX is positioning itself as a top choice for savvy investors in 2025. BlackRock Leads Massive ETH Purchase That Sparks Market Optimism Ethereum is grabbing attention as institutional whales pile in despite recent price dips. BlackRock’s purchase of $323.1 million worth of ETH has sparked optimism, signaling strong confidence in the asset. Even as ETH Price today slipped to $4,420, inflows into Ethereum ETFs reached $28.8 billion, showing institutions view dips as buying opportunities. Fidelity and Grayscale also added millions, reinforcing Ethereum’s growing mainstream appeal. Analysts note that repeated large purchases highlight long-term faith in ETH’s role in DeFi, staking, and tokenized assets. With broader adoption and rising regulation, Ethereum Price Prediction trends point to potential surges. Meanwhile, Bitcoin lags behind but remains steady. This is just a testament to Ethereum’s increasing dominance among institutional investors. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now, Ethereum remains a strong contender. Cronos Price Surges As Trump Media Confirms $105 Million Buy Cronos is surging as Trump Media & Technology Group makes a bold move to integrate CRO into its platforms. The partnership with Crypto.com and Yorkville Acquisition Corp. includes a $105 million initial buy, boosting CRO Price today by 26%. Trump Media plans to back a $6.42 billion CRO treasury, creating the world’s largest digital asset treasury strategy. The collaboration adds CRO rewards to Truth Social and Truth+, while securing 6.3 billion tokens, roughly 19% of the CRO market cap. Analysts highlight this as a game-changing move for CRO Price Prediction and overall adoption. With cash injections, warrants, and equity lines totaling over $5 billion, Cronos gains unique institutional support. The Cronus Price rally contrasts the broader crypto market struggling under downward pressure, marking CRO as one of the best altcoins to watch. Strategic Partnerships Could Accelerate Remittix Adoption Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the best crypto to buy now, drawing attention from investors tired of meme coins and AI tokens that have lost billions. The platform focuses on real-world usability, enabling fast, low-cost cross-border payments. Over 622 million tokens were sold at $0.0987 each, raising $21.6 million. This is proof that investors are backing practical solutions. Analysts note that Remittix could replicate XRP’s early adoption success without the regulatory headaches associated with it. The Remittix Wallet will enter beta testing on September 15th, 2025, giving select community members early access. The team currently has several strategic partnerships with banks and payment platforms in the works. These partnerships are set to boost adoption and liquidity. The $20M presale milestone has already unlocked the first centralized exchange listing with BitMart. This upcoming listing will ensure instant access for new investors.

Monday saw $219m in Bitcoin ETF inflows and $444m in Ether ETF inflows, for a total of $663m. This follows weeks of redemptions and turbulence, so maybe sentiment is shifting as investors reposition. Ether ETFs were the big winner, with BlackRock’s ETHA pulling in $314.9m. Fidelity’s FETH added $87.4m, Grayscale’s Ether Mini Trust $53.2m. Bitwise, 21Shares and Invesco rounded out the gains. Only Grayscale’s ETHE saw outflows of $29.1m. Ether ETFs show signs of recovery, posting three consecutive days of inflows. Source: Sosovalue Despite this, daily ether ETF trading topped $3.75 billion, with net assets sitting at $28.8 billion. Bitcoin ETFs posted smaller yet meaningful gains. Fidelity’s FBTC led with $65.6 million, closely followed by BlackRock’s IBIT at $63.4 million and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB at $61.2 million. Additional support came from Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale products. No Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows, and total trading volume was $4.5b with $143.6b in assets. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Points to Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction appears to be turning bullish, as it has begun to reflect institutional support in the ETF flows. BTC is trading near $113,000 after holding support at $111,000. On the 2-hour chart, the asset remains inside a descending channel, but the technicals suggest growing bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI has climbed above 60, indicating strengthening demand, while the MACD has flipped positive with a bullish crossover. Price is now testing the 50-SMA near $111,900, a level that has repeatedly acted as both support and resistance. A clean break above $116,850 would be a key technical milestone, opening the path toward $120,900. Candlestick patterns provide further evidence of accumulation. Long-tailed rejection wicks near $111,000 highlight buying activity, while the absence of bearish engulfing candles suggests waning selling pressure. If higher lows hold above $112,000, the setup strengthens for an extended rally toward $124,500. Institutions Eye Long-Term Upside For traders, the path is clear. Above $116,850 and momentum to $120,900 and $124,500. Below and back to $108,695. Still, the overall structure indicates building volatility that may soon resolve in favor of the bulls. ETF inflows highlight that institutional capital is quietly positioning for a long-term cycle. The narrative of Bitcoin’s eventual march toward six figures—and perhaps even $1 million—remains tied to this steady stream of adoption. With liquidity returning and technicals tightening, Bitcoin could be preparing for its next major leg higher, offering presale investors and long-term holders a market environment rich with opportunity. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $12.1 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012805—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

Prices briefly fell from $0.25 to test $0.23 support on elevated volumes. Despite this, on-chain data shows whales accumulated 680 million DOGE through August, creating a tug-of-war between distribution and accumulation. Futures positioning weakened, with open interest sliding 8% in the aftermath of the transfer, highlighting reduced speculative leverage. Broader meme-coin sentiment remains tied to macro signals, with Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks fueling a temporary sector-wide rally. Price Action Summary From August 27 at 03:00 to August 28 at 02:00, DOGE traded in a tight $0.01 (3%) range, holding around $0.22. Peak institutional participation came at 20:00 GMT on August 27, when DOGE advanced from $0.219 to $0.224 on 1.26 billion volume — nearly 4x the hourly norm. Late in the session (01:20–02:19 GMT on Aug. 28), DOGE rallied from $0.219 lows to $0.224 intraday highs before profit-taking returned it to the $0.220–$0.221 band. Technical Analysis Support : Strong bid interest around $0.219–$0.220 has emerged as the new floor. Resistance : $0.224–$0.225 continues to cap short-term rallies after repeated failures. Momentum : RSI steady in the mid-50s suggests equilibrium rather than trend acceleration. Volume : Institutional spike to 1.26 billion tokens at $0.22 marked accumulation interest, but overall declining activity hints at consolidation. Patterns : Tight trading range indicates compression phase; resolution could set the stage for directional breakout.

This isn’t just a bold claim; it’s a strategic vision that could reshape global finance. Why is US Dollar Dominance Under Pressure? Hayes’ argument stems from a crucial observation: trust in the US dollar has been on a decline since the 2008 financial crisis. This erosion of confidence has led to some significant shifts in global financial behavior. Central Banks Opt for Gold: Many central banks now favor gold over traditional US dollar reserves. Gold is seen as a more reliable store of value during uncertain economic times. Dampened Treasury Demand: Consequently, demand for U.S. Treasurys – traditionally a safe haven for global investors – has weakened. This makes it harder for the U.S. government to finance its debt. The challenge is clear: how can the U.S. restore confidence and attract capital back into its financial system? How Can Stablecoins Reinforce the US Dollar? Arthur Hayes proposes an innovative solution involving stablecoins . He believes Secretary Bessent will leverage these digital assets to attract a new class of investors to U.S. government debt: individual investors. Here’s the core idea: Shifting Investor Focus: Instead of relying on central banks, the strategy would pivot to encourage everyday people to purchase U.S. government debt using stablecoins. Accessibility and Efficiency: Stablecoins offer a more accessible and efficient way for individuals globally to engage with U.S. financial instruments, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. This approach could open up a massive new pool of capital, potentially channeling trillions of dollars into the U.S. Treasury market. Fueling the DeFi Revolution with Stablecoins Hayes’ vision extends beyond just financing government debt; he sees a symbiotic relationship forming between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. This strategy, if implemented, would have profound implications for decentralized finance (DeFi). Consider the potential impact: Trillions into Crypto: By using stablecoins as the conduit, this strategy would inherently pull vast sums of money into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. DeFi Boom: This influx of capital would provide a massive boost to DeFi platforms, increasing liquidity and fostering innovation across decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading. Broader Adoption: It could also significantly accelerate the mainstream adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets, integrating them more deeply into the global financial fabric. This would create a powerful feedback loop, where stablecoins support the dollar, and the dollar’s strength, in turn, fuels the growth of the crypto economy. Navigating the Challenges of This Bold Vision for Stablecoins While Arthur Hayes’ prediction offers an exciting glimpse into the future, implementing such a grand strategy would undoubtedly face significant hurdles. The path to leveraging stablecoins for national fiscal policy is not without its complexities. Key challenges include: Regulatory Frameworks: Establishing clear, comprehensive regulations for stablecoins at a national and international level is paramount. Without this, widespread adoption and trust will be difficult to achieve. Technological Infrastructure: Building the necessary infrastructure to seamlessly connect traditional government debt markets with decentralized stablecoin platforms requires massive investment and coordination. Public and Political Acceptance: Overcoming skepticism from traditional financial institutions, politicians, and the general public about the use of cryptocurrencies in sovereign finance will be a significant undertaking. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards – a strengthened dollar and a booming DeFi sector – make this a concept worth exploring seriously. A Glimpse into a Stablecoin-Powered Future Arthur Hayes’ forecast paints a vivid picture of a future where stablecoins play a pivotal role in global finance. His vision suggests that the US dollar’s dominance, far from fading, could be revitalized through innovative integration with digital assets. This bold strategy, if successfully executed, could not only address the U.S. fiscal deficit but also usher in an unprecedented era of growth for the decentralized finance ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Arthur Hayes’ main prediction regarding stablecoins? Arthur Hayes predicts that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will use stablecoins to encourage individual investors to purchase U.S. government debt, thereby reducing the fiscal deficit and reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. Q2: Why does Hayes believe the US dollar’s dominance is at risk? Hayes argues that declining trust in the dollar since the 2008 financial crisis has led central banks to favor gold and has dampened demand for U.S. Treasurys, posing a threat to the dollar’s traditional strength. Q3: How would stablecoins help reduce the U.S. fiscal deficit? By making U.S. government debt accessible to individual investors globally via stablecoins, the strategy aims to tap into a new, vast pool of capital, helping to finance the deficit more effectively than relying solely on central banks. Q4: What impact would this strategy have on decentralized finance (DeFi)? Hayes projects that this strategy would channel trillions of dollars into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, fueling a significant boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) by increasing liquidity and fostering innovation. Q5: What are the primary challenges to implementing this stablecoin strategy? Key challenges include establishing clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, building robust technological infrastructure to bridge traditional and crypto markets, and gaining broad public and political acceptance for using digital assets in sovereign finance.

Unlike the rapid surges throughout its history, when volatility fueled retail speculation and short-term leverage, this uptrend has been more measured. Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a prominent market analyst on X, recently shared a video in which he described the current environment as “the healthiest XRP bull market ever.” He pointed out that leverage has dropped since 2024 with lower highs and argued that this indicates a lack of significant retail-driven speculation. In his view, the continued price appreciation, with XRP marking higher highs over the same period, points to institutional participation as the key factor behind the asset’s momentum. It shows a reduction in speculative trading activity, and this institutional interest has created an environment that supports sustained bullish momentum. Institutions Are ALL IN on #XRP pic.twitter.com/qbnHEWJtfA — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 27, 2025 What to Expect from XRP The distinction Steph draws highlights an important development for XRP. Previous bull cycles often relied heavily on retail enthusiasm and trading activity, which produced rapid expansions in leverage but also swift corrections . By contrast, the present cycle shows evidence of deeper market support. The reduction in leverage activity suggests that the price floor is being maintained without excessive reliance on short-term traders. This has implications for the stability of XRP’s upward trajectory, as institutions generally operate with longer-term horizons and larger capital allocations compared to retail investors. XRP’s 2025 Performance So Far Throughout the year, XRP has continued to post higher highs, reinforcing the case for stronger structural support behind the rally. Most prominent of these was the asset’s climb to an all-time high of $3.65 in July, and the consistent rise since 2024 aligns with the points made by Steph, showing that institutional buying has potentially been a sustaining force. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trading data reflects a liquid market but is less prone to the extreme volatility associated with retail-driven leverage buildups. For many observers, this differentiates the current market from earlier bull phases and shows the influence of various forces in shaping XRP’s valuation. Broader Implications If institutional demand is indeed the core driver, the long-term implications extend beyond just 2025. Institutional buyers typically look for assets with clear utility, regulatory clarity, and liquidity. XRP’s role in cross-border settlements and its positioning within broader financial infrastructure debates align with those criteria, offering a possible explanation for why capital from these players is flowing into the asset at this stage. This would also mean that price action is being reinforced by fundamental drivers rather than speculative cycles alone.

Just as navigating the crypto markets requires a keen eye for reliability and verifiable outcomes, enterprises venturing into AI are encountering a stark challenge: a staggering 95% enterprise AI failure rate for generative AI pilots. This alarming statistic, revealed by MIT’s NANDA initiative, highlights a critical need for solutions that can deliver on AI’s promise without the pervasive issues of unreliability and opacity. Enter Maisa AI, a year-old startup that has just secured a significant $25 million seed round to revolutionize how businesses adopt and trust AI. Why is Enterprise AI Struggling with a 95% Failure Rate? The promise of generative AI to transform business operations has led to widespread experimentation, yet most companies find their pilot projects falling flat. The core issue lies in the nature of current AI systems, which often operate as ‘opaque black boxes.’ This lack of transparency makes it incredibly difficult for organizations to trust AI with critical tasks, leading to high rates of hallucinations and unpredictable outputs. As Maisa AI CEO David Villalón notes, the challenge isn’t just about generating responses, but about ensuring those responses are reliable and auditable. Imagine reviewing ‘three months of work done in five minutes’ and needing to verify its accuracy; the human effort required becomes unfeasible. This fundamental flaw in current enterprise AI deployments is what Maisa AI aims to address head-on, focusing on building systems that are not only intelligent but also accountable. Maisa AI’s Vision: Pioneering Accountable Agentic AI Rather than abandoning AI, the most forward-thinking organizations are now exploring agentic AI systems. These systems are designed to learn, adapt, and be supervised, moving beyond simple response generation to building robust, verifiable processes. Maisa AI’s approach, centered on ‘chain-of-work,’ uses AI to construct the execution process itself, ensuring a structured and auditable pathway to results. This is a significant departure from ‘vibe coding’ platforms, which primarily focus on using AI to build the responses directly. With its new $25 million seed round, Maisa AI has launched Maisa Studio, a model-agnostic, self-serve platform that empowers users to deploy digital workers trainable with natural language. This platform is built on the premise that true enterprise automation demands accountable AI agents, a critical differentiator in a market flooded with less reliable solutions. Beyond Rules: Unlocking Advanced AI Automation with Trust Maisa AI is redefining AI automation by focusing on trustworthiness and accountability. Its proprietary systems, HALP (Human-Augmented LLM Processing) and KPU (Knowledge Processing Unit), are at the heart of this innovation. HALP works like a student at a blackboard, engaging users to understand their needs while the digital workers meticulously outline each step of the process. This interactive method ensures human oversight and clarifies the AI’s intended actions. The KPU is a deterministic system specifically engineered to limit hallucinations, a common pitfall in generative AI. By prioritizing these technical challenges, Maisa AI has developed a solution that resonates deeply with companies needing to apply AI to critical, high-stakes tasks. Clients in sectors like banking, car manufacturing, and energy are already leveraging Maisa AI in production, showcasing its ability to unlock productivity gains without the rigid, predefined rules or extensive manual programming typically associated with traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Furthermore, Maisa AI offers flexible deployment options, including secure cloud or on-premise solutions, catering to diverse enterprise needs. Fueling Growth: Maisa AI’s Strategic Funding and Expansion The $25 million seed round, led by European VC firm Creandum, underscores the market’s confidence in Maisa AI’s unique vision. This substantial investment follows a $5 million pre-seed round last December, which saw participation from San Francisco-based venture firms NFX and Village Global. Notably, U.S. firm Forgepoint Capital International also joined this new round via its European joint venture with Spanish bank Banco Santander, highlighting Maisa AI’s appeal for regulated sectors demanding high levels of security and compliance. With dual headquarters in Valencia and San Francisco, Maisa AI is strategically positioned for global expansion. The company plans to significantly grow its team from 35 to 65 people by the first quarter of 2026 to meet escalating demand. As CEO David Villalón observed regarding the ‘AI framework gold rush,’ a ‘quick start’ can quickly turn into a ‘long nightmare’ without reliability and auditability. Maisa AI aims to differentiate itself from competitors like CrewAI and other workflow automation products by focusing on complex use cases that demand accountability from non-technical users. The startup anticipates rapid growth as it begins serving its waiting list later this year, with Villalón confidently stating, ‘We are going to show the market that there is a company that is delivering what has been promised, and that it’s working.’ The Future of Enterprise AI: Trust and Accountability Maisa AI’s successful funding round and innovative approach mark a pivotal moment in the evolution of enterprise AI . By tackling the critical issue of the 95% AI failure rate with a commitment to accountable, agentic systems, Maisa AI is paving the way for a new era of trust and reliability in artificial intelligence. Their focus on ‘chain-of-work,’ human-augmented processing, and deterministic knowledge units ensures that digital workers can be deployed with confidence, even in the most sensitive and regulated environments. As businesses continue to seek transformative productivity gains, Maisa AI stands ready to deliver on the true promise of AI, ensuring that innovation is matched with verifiable results and unwavering accountability.

The filing was made amid surging interest in crypto ETFs, with Bitcoin and Ethereum products seeing record inflows and trading volumes over the past few months. BNB ETF Race Heats Up REX Shares and Osprey Funds jointly filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a BNB exchange-traded fund (ETF) that incorporates staking yield. The proposed REX-Osprey BNB + Staking ETF will allocate at least 80% of its capital to BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, or gain exposure through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, while the remainder could be invested in other ETFs or exchange-traded products tied to BNB. Staking on the Binance Chain, which uses a proof-of-staked-authority model, is estimated to generate yields of 1.5% to 3% annually for validators. REX-Osprey’s filing with the SEC This product will be different from Osprey Funds’ existing BNB Chain Trust , which was launched in 2024 for accredited investors with a $10,000 minimum investment. While the trust intends to stake all of its BNB, it must still stick to regulatory restrictions that prevent illiquid assets from exceeding 15% of the portfolio. Anchorage Digital Bank has been appointed custodian for the proposed ETF’s BNB, related holdings, and liquid staking tokens. The REX-Osprey filing was made after a similar proposal from VanEck in May of 2025, which was the first attempt to introduce a BNB ETF in the United States. Additionally, the broader market for crypto ETFs has been gaining traction, with Bitcoin ETFs recording monthly inflows between $3 billion and $6 billion in recent months, while Ethereum ETFs saw $5.4 billion of inflows in July and another $3.7 billion so far in August. Trading volumes also surged, with Ethereum ETFs alone generating around $17 billion in trades during mid-August, setting new records according to Bloomberg analysts. Monthly flows for ETH ETFs (Source: SoSoValue ) As interest builds, analysts at Bitfinex suggest that a true rally for altcoins may depend on more approvals of crypto ETFs in the US.

Currently trading around $0.2327, CRO surged nearly 41% after Crypto.com teamed up with Trump Media to establish a crypto treasury company focused on the token. The move, along with the 2025–2026 roadmap titled The Golden Age of On-Chain Dominance , has drawn investor attention. Yet, amid Cronos’ bullish setup, another altcoin is capturing the imagination of traders: Remittix (RTX) . Analysts predict Remittix could deliver 20x–50x returns by January, potentially overtaking Cronos in adoption and market attention. Cronos Shows Short-Term Momentum As the latest news on Cronos shows, CRO has traded in an ascending broadening wedge since the middle of July of 2025. Although the pattern has been profitable in recent times, ascending broadening wedges are not common, and can indicate growing volatility or exhaustion of bullish trends. Analysts see the next target for Cronos around $0.260, a 16% upside from current levels. A strong breakout above this point could bring CRO toward the psychological $0.280 mark, accelerating short-term gains. However, traders monitoring Cronos latest news note that the wedge pattern may also indicate heightened risk for a sudden retracement, suggesting careful positioning is necessary. source: TradingView Crypto experts also point to CRO’s limited ecosystem activity beyond the Crypto.com platform. Although the Trump Media partnership brings in visibility, wider adoption is important in ensuring long-term growth. Investors are considering this along with other promising altcoins, especially those with practicality and application in the real world. Remittix Gains Momentum Among Early Investors While Cronos maintains its market presence, Remittix is capturing attention with strong investor backing and ambitious infrastructure plans. The project has sold over 623 million tokens at $0.0987 each, raising more than $21.6 million. Its first CEX listing on BitMart has been announced, with the live listing expected soon. The next listing milestone is projected to be reached once the project raises $22 million. Additionally, Remittix is preparing to launch its Beta Wallet on September 15, 2025, providing seamless PayFi solutions for crypto-to-fiat transfers. Analysts and investors suggest Remittix is the fastest-growing altcoin of 2025–2026, offering 20x–50x potential returns for early adopters. The token’s real-world utility, combined with a growing investor base, positions it as a credible contender to rival even established projects like Cronos. Why Investors Are Turning To Remittix High-Growth Potential – Analysts project up to 50x returns within months. Real-World Use Case – Remittix focuses on bridging crypto to fiat payments. Strong Investor Confidence – Over 623 million tokens sold to date signals demand. CEX Listing on BitMart – Increases liquidity and market visibility. Beta Wallet Launch – Scheduled for September 15, 2025, making transactions fast and secure. Conclusion Cronos latest news shows CRO gaining traction thanks to partnerships and its roadmap, but structural chart patterns and limited ecosystem activity suggest risks remain. Meanwhile, Remittix is positioned for explosive growth with its BitMart CEX listing, Beta Wallet launch, and strong investor support. With predictions ranging from 20x to 50x by January , Remittix could emerge as a dominant altcoin, potentially rivaling or even surpassing Cronos in market impact.

However, an analyst suggested that the cryptocurrency risks a new retest of the range lows before bullish momentum continues. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Key Support As SEC Delays ETF Decision – Is An October Rally Brewing? XRP’s Daily Close Key For Momentum XRP has reclaimed a crucial level as support while the crypto market stabilizes from this week’s market downturn. The altcoin has been trading sideways over the past week, hovering between $2.85-$3.10 range. The cryptocurrency retested the range lows, holding the lower boundary as support during the recent market volatility. Now, the price surged 7% from Monday’s lows to the $3.08 area before retracing to the $3.00 mark. On Wednesday, analyst Ali Martinez noted that XRP was rejected from local resistance, around the $3.10 area, for the third time, which could signal a new correction to the range lows similar to the previous attempts. If the altcoin fails to hold the current level as support and loses the mid-range area, its price could drop to $2.83, risking a fall below the local range and a deeper correction. On the contrary, if bullish momentum continues and the cryptocurrency breaks out of the crucial resistance, its price could rally to the August high levels, between $3.20-$3.40. Similarly, analyst Cryptoinsightuk noted that XRP had a positive daily close, adding that the “RSI crossed bullish and even throughout this pullback we’ve seen no change in structure.” Nonetheless, he suggested that the cryptocurrency needs to continue its momentum with a second day of follow-through price actions and trading volume. The market watcher asserted that a daily close above the $3.14 area will set up the stage for a rally to the $3.40 resistance in the coming weeks. Is A 2017-Like Rally Coming? After its July rally to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $3.65, the altcoin has been consolidating within a bullish pennant, with price compressing between the pattern’s resistance and support levels. Analyst GalaxyBTC also noted that XRP has been compressing between two parallel levels, repeating its 2017 playbook. Previously, the cryptocurrency hovered between the previous ATH level and the rally breakout level, which was turned into support. Following a consolidation period, the cryptocurrency broke out of this range and recorded a massive rally to its 2018 ATH. This time, XRP turned the $1.70 area into support last November and has been consolidating between this level and the previous ATH for the past eight months, which could suggest that the rally isn’t over yet. If history repeats, a massive breakout will follow once the altcoin breaks out of the previous ATH resistance and turns it into support. Related Reading: Chainlink Ready For Massive Breakout? A 15% Drop May Come First Moreover, the analyst highlighted a key level in XRP’s trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC), explaining that the 0.00003014 area has been a resistance in the XRP/BTC chart over the past six years. While the XRP/BTC pair continues to near this resistance, the market watcher considers that “the timing is perfect, as breaking out will put us well into price discovery on the USD pair.” As of this writing, XRP is trading at $3.02, a 3.3% increase in the weekly timeframe.

50800651,567156,1756360837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50800651.jpeg,Hong Kong Officials Pull Out Of Bitcoin Asia 2025 Despite Crypto Push – Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-officials-pull-out-of-bitcoin-asia-2025/,"Recent reports claim that two Hong Kong officials have withdrawn from the upcoming Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference to allegedly avoid interacting with Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump. HK Officials Withdraw From Bitcoin Asia 2025 On Wednesday, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that senior Hong Kong official Eric Yip Chee-hang and lawmaker Johnny Ng Kit-chong pulled out of the highly anticipated Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference, set to take place at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on August 28 and 29. The report noted that Yip, executive director of the city’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and Ng, a legislator and technology entrepreneur, were removed from the list of keynote speakers for the conference. According to the report, archived versions of Bitcoin Asia 2025’s website show that both officials were listed on July 14, days after the announcement of Eric Trump’s participation in the forum. As reported by Bitcoinist, the event organizers announced Trump’s participation on July 8. The American businessman is set to speak about Bitcoin’s long-term potential, the implications for global finance, and the role of Asia in shaping the future of BTC adoption A Source familiar with the matter told SCMP that the lawmakers were requested not to attend the conference, as it featured Trump’s middle son. A second anonymous source confirmed the information, explaining that it was “advised” to the lawmakers. Meanwhile, Ng stated that he withdrew from the event due to “family issues” that overlap with Bitcoin Asia 2025’s agenda, while the SFC affirmed that Yip would not be in attendance due to a business trip. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told the news media outlet that the reason was to “avoid any public impression that Hong Kong was cooperating with or flattering Donald Trump.” “Under the intense China-US relations, it is only natural to avoid any impression that Hong Kong is doing something that is helping or pleasing the US,” Lau detailed. It’s worth noting that President Trump recently announced a 90-day trade tariff war truce with China, but has threatened that the nation could face “200 per cent tariffs, or something,” if it doesn’t continue to ensure shipments of permanent magnets containing certain minerals reach the US. Hong Kong Crypto Landscape A source close to the city’s regulators reportedly said that officials had been advised to “maintain a low profile on cryptocurrency and stablecoins,” the report affirmed, but noted that Clarence Shen, an SFC manager responsible for fintech policy formulation, will still attend as one of the event’s speakers. Notably, Hong Kong has been working to establish itself as one of the leading crypto hubs worldwide, advancing crucial legislation to regulate the sector. Amid the global push for stablecoins, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed the Stablecoin Ordinance in May, which was enacted on August 1. In June, regulators also released the “Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong,” outlining their plans to enhance the industry. Nonetheless, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has advised against excessive speculation and warned that caution is recommended amid the growing interest in the stablecoins sector. In a July blog post, HKMA’s CEO, Eddie Yue, affirmed there has been excessive hype in the market and public opinion, raising concerns over a developing trend toward speculation as the market has become “overly enthusiastic” with the “stablecoin craze.” The warning comes as the financial regulator attempts to implement its phased plan to ensure balanced growth and innovation, with regulation and customer protections.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Asia 2025|btc|BTCUSDT|Eric Trump|hkma|hong kong|Hong Kong authorities|Hong Kong Stablecoins|SFC|Stablecoin Legislation,EN,0,0,ASIA|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 06:00:37

Is Something Big Coming for XRP?,https://timestabloid.com/upholds-recent-riddle-stuns-xrp-army-is-something-big-coming-for-xrp/,"Crypto exchange Uphold recently published a cryptic message on X. The post contained only three sets of binary code: “01011000 01010010 01010000.” The brief sequence quickly caught the XRP community’s attention, leaving many to question whether Uphold was signaling something significant for XRP. Uphold, being a platform known for its strong support of XRP , added a point to the intrigue. With speculation already common in the digital asset space, the absence of an explanation only deepened curiosity. 01011000 01010010 01010000 — Uphold (@UpholdInc) August 27, 2025 XRP In the Picture: Decoding the Cryptic Message It did not take long for community members to translate the code. By converting the binary numbers into ASCII characters, they unveiled Uphold’s secret message. Breaking it down, the first set, “01011000”, corresponds to the letter X, “01010010” translates to R, and “01010000” becomes P. Taken together, the code spells “XRP,” the digital asset that Uphold has supported for years. This explanation quickly spread across the comments. This message suggests that the exchange could be preparing something centered on XRP. Hinting at a Bigger Development Uphold’s message can be compared to recent activity from Gemini, another major exchange. Gemini also shared a cryptic teaser involving XRP , hiding the letters inside a sentence but highlighting them to make the message clear. The hint eventually led to the release of an XRP credit card powered by Mastercard and issued by WebBank. That product has since gained notable popularity among users who favor XRP as a payment option. Against that backdrop, Uphold’s decision to publish a binary-coded message specifically referencing XRP suggests that the exchange is teasing something big for the digital asset and might be preparing to unveil a new service or product. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Speculation Over What Comes Next Uphold has not yet provided further details about the post or clarified whether it points to an upcoming launch. However, its history with XRP and the timing of the message have led many to believe that something meaningful could be on the horizon. While no official announcement has followed, this post has left ample room for speculation. For a company that has consistently emphasized support for XRP, such a cryptic reference may hide an interesting purpose. Whether Uphold is preparing a new product, service, or partnership remains unconfirmed. What is clear is that the post has successfully captured the interest of the XRP community.

His latest Arthur Hayes crypto predictions suggest a monumental upside for two promising altcoins: Ether.fi (ETHFI) and Ethena (ENA). These forecasts are not merely speculative; they are deeply rooted in the rapidly expanding real-world utility of stablecoins. Investors are now keenly observing how these projects might reshape the digital asset landscape. What Fuels Arthur Hayes’ Crypto Predictions for ETHFI? Arthur Hayes sees a transformative future for Ether.fi (ETHFI), projecting an astounding 34-fold increase in its value. This optimistic outlook hinges on the global commercialization of Ether.fi’s innovative Visa-linked credit card, known as Ether.fi Cash. Ether.fi Cash Potential: Imagine a credit card that seamlessly integrates your crypto assets into everyday spending. Ether.fi Cash aims to do just that, potentially revolutionizing how users interact with their digital holdings. Deposit-Based Revenue: The core of Hayes’ prediction lies in Ether.fi’s deposit-based revenue model. As more users adopt Ether.fi Cash for transactions, the platform’s deposits grow, directly boosting its revenue and, consequently, the value of the ETHFI token. Global Reach: If this Visa-linked solution achieves widespread global adoption, its impact on ETHFI’s price could be truly significant. It represents a tangible bridge between decentralized finance and traditional commerce. These Arthur Hayes crypto predictions highlight the power of practical applications in driving token value. How Do Arthur Hayes’ Crypto Predictions See ENA Soaring? Ethena (ENA) also features prominently in Hayes’ forecasts, with a projected 51-fold increase. This impressive target is tied to the success and expansion of Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, and its unique operational strategy. USDe’s Derivatives Arbitrage: USDe is gaining market share rapidly through a sophisticated derivatives arbitrage structure. This involves balancing long spot positions with short futures positions to maintain its peg to the US dollar while generating yield. Market Share Growth: Hayes anticipates that USDe’s market share could grow substantially, potentially reaching 25% of the stablecoin market. Such growth would solidify Ethena’s position as a major player. ENA’s Value Proposition: As USDe’s adoption expands and its yield generation mechanism proves robust, the demand and utility for the ENA token are expected to surge, driving its price upwards dramatically. The innovative design behind USDe is a key factor in these ambitious Arthur Hayes crypto predictions . Why Are Stablecoins Key to These Arthur Hayes Crypto Predictions? At the heart of Arthur Hayes’ bullish stance for both ETHFI and ENA is the increasing adoption of stablecoins. These digital assets, pegged to stable references like the US dollar, are proving to be much more than just trading tools. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: Stablecoins act as a crucial bridge, allowing users to navigate between the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the stability of fiat currencies. Emerging Market Impact: Hayes emphasizes their growing importance in emerging markets. Here, stablecoins offer a stable alternative to often volatile local currencies, facilitating remittances, cross-border payments, and a hedge against inflation. Fueling Ecosystem Growth: As stablecoins become more integrated into daily financial activities, the demand for underlying protocols and tokens that facilitate their use, like Ether.fi and Ethena, naturally increases. This broader adoption underpins the entire market. Understanding this fundamental shift is vital when considering Arthur Hayes crypto predictions . Navigating the Potential: What Should Investors Consider? While Arthur Hayes’ predictions are incredibly exciting, it is crucial for investors to approach such high-growth potential with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and significant upside often comes with commensurate risks. Market Volatility: Even promising projects can experience substantial price fluctuations. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for stablecoins and decentralized finance could impact these projects. Competition: The crypto space is highly competitive, with new innovations constantly emerging. Therefore, thorough research, diversification, and a clear understanding of personal risk tolerance remain paramount. Hayes’ insights provide a compelling narrative, but individual due diligence is always recommended before making investment decisions based on these Arthur Hayes crypto predictions . Arthur Hayes, a prominent voice in the crypto space, has once again captured attention with his remarkable Arthur Hayes crypto predictions for Ether.fi (ETHFI) and Ethena (ENA). His vision connects the burgeoning utility of stablecoins, particularly in global commerce and emerging economies, directly to the explosive growth potential of these specific tokens. While the future remains unpredictable, Hayes’ analysis offers a compelling glimpse into how real-world adoption could drive the next wave of innovation and value creation in the digital asset market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Arthur Hayes’ specific predictions for ETHFI and ENA? Arthur Hayes predicts a potential 34x upside for Ether.fi (ETHFI) if its Visa-linked credit card, Ether.fi Cash, achieves global commercialization. For Ethena (ENA), he forecasts a 51x increase, driven by its USDe stablecoin gaining a 25% market share through its derivatives arbitrage strategy. What is Ether.fi Cash and how does it relate to ETHFI’s potential? Ether.fi Cash is a Visa-linked credit card that aims to integrate crypto assets into everyday spending. Its global commercialization would significantly increase Ether.fi’s deposit-based revenue, which Hayes believes will directly propel the ETHFI token’s value. How does Ethena’s USDe stablecoin work? Ethena’s USDe is a synthetic dollar stablecoin that maintains its peg and generates yield through a derivatives arbitrage strategy. This involves holding long spot positions in crypto assets while simultaneously shorting futures contracts to hedge against price fluctuations. Why does Arthur Hayes believe stablecoins are crucial for these predictions? Hayes highlights stablecoins’ growing role in real-world use, especially in emerging markets. They offer stability for payments, remittances, and as a hedge against local currency inflation, thereby increasing demand and utility for projects like Ether.fi and Ethena that leverage stablecoin ecosystems. Are there risks associated with these high-upside predictions? Yes, like all cryptocurrency investments, ETHFI and ENA carry inherent risks. These include market volatility, potential regulatory changes, and intense competition within the decentralized finance space. Investors should conduct their own research and understand these risks.

Key Takeaways: Webull has launched crypto trading in Australia via Coinbase Prime, offering access to 240 digital assets with a competitive 30bps spread. The move is expected to pressure local exchanges to lower fees amid growing competition. Webull’s integration with traditional account types and advanced trading tools positions it as a low-cost alternative. The rollout marks the platform’s third crypto market globally, after the U.S. and Brazil, the firm said in a Wednesday press release . The Australian launch includes a 30-basis-point spread, which Webull claims makes it one of the lowest-cost crypto trading options in the country. Webull Launch Sparks Fee War Among Aussie Crypto Exchanges Analysts expect the move to pressure local exchanges to reduce fees or risk losing market share in an already competitive environment. “Crypto trading is the next phase of our mission to provide Australians with the freedom to trade what they want, when they want,” said Rob Talevski, CEO of Webull Securities Australia, in a statement on Wednesday. The offering is integrated across individual accounts, SMSFs, trusts, and company structures, placing crypto within traditional investment frameworks and allowing retail users to manage digital assets alongside equities and ETFs. The platform also includes premium charting tools, over 40 technical indicators, and 24/7 customer support. The launch comes days after Webull resumed crypto trading in the U.S. , following a temporary suspension during its 2023 public listing process. Crypto is officially here!

Webull’s Australian crypto service runs on Coinbase Prime’s infrastructure, offering institutional-grade custody, real-time market data, and trade execution. The move reinforces Coinbase’s ongoing push into global B2B partnerships. With more international rollouts expected later this year, Webull is positioning itself as a cost-effective alternative to Australia’s established crypto exchanges, many of which have faced criticism for high fees and limited service features. ASIC Shuts Down 14,000 Scam Sites Australia’s securities regulator ASIC has taken down over 14,000 scam and phishing websites since July 2023, with crypto-related fraud accounting for 20% of the removals. The agency now targets 130 new malicious sites each week, including deceptive social media ads and AI-powered schemes promising passive crypto income. ASIC’s January–July 2025 enforcement update highlights evolving scam tactics, including cloaking, fake celebrity endorsements, and “AI washing.” The regulator has launched 345 new investigations, imposed $57.5 million in civil penalties, and wound up 95 companies tied to international pig butchering schemes , following $35.8 million in losses reported by victims in 14 countries. Despite scam losses falling from 2022’s $3.1 billion peak, Australians lost $945 million to investment scams in 2024, making it the country’s most damaging fraud category. ASIC’s wider enforcement has also targeted greenwashing, misconduct in superannuation funds, and unlicensed operators, including the prosecution of Mormarkets director Brendan Gunn for handling suspected scam proceeds.

Peterson argued that keeping interest rates at current levels would not solve structural problems but would instead make the economy suffer even more. According to Peterson, the Leading Economic Index (LEI) has declined by 5% or more before every recession in the last 50 years, and the Fed has cut interest rates each time. However, despite the LEI experiencing a historic decline between 2022 and 2025, the Fed has still not cut interest rates. The analyst described this as anomalous, stating, “There's a recession this cycle, but the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) hasn't officially declared it.” Peterson stated that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused disruptions in global trade and supply chains, creating supply shocks for energy, food, and critical minerals. The analyst emphasized that these structural problems cannot be solved by high interest rates, commenting, “As long as interest rates remain high, growth will slow further, unemployment will rise, and consumption will be suppressed.” Related News: Major Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Reveals What He Expects Following the Recent Drop in BTC Price Peterson, claiming that the Fed's fight against inflation will fail, said, “The root cause of inflation is supply constraints. The Fed's tools cannot solve this problem. Furthermore, consumers are in debt, income growth is slow, and food prices remain high.” The analyst also said stock markets weren't as strong as expected. “The majority of the rise in the S&P 500 is coming from just a few tech companies,” Peterson said. “This suggests it's not a broad-based rally.” Peterson argued that in current conditions, investors should turn to what he describes as “hard assets” to protect their portfolios: “The Fed can't fix structural problems. Global supply chains are broken, the government is overspending. Inflation is inevitable. Gold and Bitcoin must be at the core of your portfolio if you want to survive.” *This is not investment advice.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-the-bitcoin-bull-market-cycle-coming-to-an-end-analysts-weigh-in/,"“The old money flow cycle is breaking,” crypto trader ‘Koroush AK’ told his 376,000 X followers on Wednesday, referring to the previous pattern of money rotating from Bitcoin to Ether and then to altcoins. “Now we have to navigate isolated mini-cycles where only some sectors pump while others get left behind,” he added . The flow from BTC to ETH is the same, but now “sectors only pump when money and attention overlap,” he said before adding, “If either one is missing, that sector gets skipped.” He used Chainlink (LINK) as an example of a token that pumped from Ether’s run instead of Uniswap (UNI), which was largely ignored. What About The 4 Year Cycle? If this theory is accurate, it could also change the four-year cycle, which has traditionally been anchored around Bitcoin halving events. Earlier this week, analyst James Check opined that “Bitcoin has experienced three cycles, and they are not anchored around the halvings,” adding that they are anchored around the “trends in adoption and market structure,” with the market’s 2017 peak and 2022 bottom being the transition points. He said that there have been three cycles so far: an “adoption cycle” from 2011 to 2018, an “adolescence cycle” from 2018 to 2022, and the current “maturity cycle,” which is driven by “institutional maturity and stability.” Hedge fund veteran “PlanC” said on Thursday that there is a “99% chance stock-to-flow breaks this cycle, and a 50/50 chance the 4-year cycle breaks.” Meanwhile, trader Bob Loukas said it was hard to see which way things would go. “Either the 4-year cycle has already topped and we’re in heavy distribution as buyers eventually exhaust… or we’re just weeks away from start of blow-off phase, a fast doubling (or more) over 3-6 months.” Earlier this month, Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan said that gains are likely to continue into 2026, “so let’s say this: I think the 4-year cycle is over.” Slumptember Ahead? Glassnode also said that Bitcoin was still tracking its traditional patterns but added this week that recent profit taking and elevated selling pressure “suggests the market has entered a late phase of the cycle.” In previous ones, crypto markets pulled back heavily in the September of the bull market year before recovering and shifting to new highs at the end of the year. If history rhymes, this could be on the cards next month. In past cycles, Bitcoin marked a major low in September and then rallied for 2-3 months in Q4. pic.twitter.com/Vw5h9uPk4z — apsk32 (@apsk32) August 27, 2025 Whether the cycle is about to peak or will extend into 2026 remains to be seen, but more voices are favoring the latter due to the heavy institutional participation in crypto markets, which was not seen in previous cycles.

Analyst Explains What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-whales-are-selling-heavily-analyst-explains-what-it-means/,"Maartunn (@JA_Maartun), a prominent market analyst, has highlighted recent selling activity among XRP’s largest holders. Sharing a chart of whale flows, he remarked that “XRP Whales are selling heavily,” pointing to what he views as a clear distribution supported by on-chain data. The chart he shared shows the moving average of whale flows, splitting into positive inflows and negative outflows. Over the past several months, the red bars indicating negative whale flows have grown significantly, reflecting net selling from high-value wallets. This activity coincides with a notable rise and subsequent cooling in XRP’s price, signaling that whales may be offloading their holdings during periods of strength, with some also trying to short the asset’s price recently . XRP Whales are selling heavily It's clear distribution. On-chain data tells the story. In data, we trust. pic.twitter.com/MoMk1Fx4Lg — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 27, 2025 Data Shows Cycles of Accumulation and Distribution The chart covers data from 2022 through 2025, illustrating how whale behavior has changed over time. Periods of accumulation, marked by green bars, were often followed by upward price movements; however, the most recent data points toward sustained selling. In early 2025, XRP’s price spiked considerably, with whale inflows appearing briefly in the green. That phase was quickly overtaken by a sharp and extended period of outflows, aligning with the analyst’s view of heavy selling. The consistency of these negative flows suggests that large holders were systematically reducing their exposure rather than engaging in short-term trading. The asset experienced a notable shift in May and June, when whales resumed their accumulation ; however, the phase did not last long. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The chart shows a shift in July and August, with XRP’s rise to a new all-time high coinciding with massive outflows. These sell-offs likely contributed to XRP’s loss of crucial support in early August . Implications for XRP’s Market Structure XRP has long been influenced by the behavior of its largest wallets, given the concentration of supply among major holders. Heavy distribution raises questions about the sustainability of recent price levels. When whales move in unison, their actions often set the tone for broader market participants, particularly retail investors who may follow the market’s momentum. Whales have a dominant position in the XRP market . While demand-side factors, such as institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, play a role, supply-side actions from whales can create downward pressure. Sustained outflows may weigh on price recovery efforts unless matched by new inflows from buyers outside this group of whales.

At the same time, large holders are shifting focus toward Cardano and MAGACOIN FINANCE, both touted as higher-upside plays in the current market. Ethereum Corrects to Below $4,200 Ethereum (ETH) slipped under the $4,200 mark, briefly touching $4,190 before stabilizing. The dip comes after a strong rally earlier this month, leaving traders watching if the asset can reclaim higher ground or extend its pullback. For now, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but whales appear to be rebalancing into altcoins where upside is perceived to be larger. With Bitcoin already near its peak levels, the spotlight is turning to projects like Cardano and newer entrants such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano Drops 8% But Long-Term Story Remains Cardano (ADA) fell 8.01% in the last 24 hours, a worse performance than the broader market’s 2.78% decline. Despite the short-term weakness, the network just approved a $71 million development plan funded directly through its on-chain treasury — a governance first. The plan will deliver upgrades such as Ouroboros Leios, Hydra scaling, Mithril syncing, and Nested Transactions. Founder Charles Hoskinson has also made bullish statements, saying ADA could achieve up to 1,000x returns, far outpacing Bitcoin. He argues that ADA’s market cap leaves room for exponential expansion, while Bitcoin’s upside is already capped by its size. This view has divided the community, but it highlights why some whales are still betting on Cardano’s long-term trajectory. Whales Target 30x in MAGACOIN FINANCE Alongside ADA, MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted attention as a next-generation altcoin blending meme appeal with serious DeFi use cases. Analysts have already projected up to 30x upside, with smart money reportedly positioning early. The project has been audited, maintains transparent tokenomics, and is gaining traction as one of 2025’s most watched tokens. Whales appear to be treating it as a hedge against slower assets, with growing activity pointing toward a fast-closing entry window. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year , MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. What Traders Should Watch Ethereum’s slip under $4,200 has widened interest in altcoins, especially Cardano and MAGACOIN FINANCE, where whales see larger room for returns. Traders tracking this shift may want to explore these projects now, while the cycle is still developing.

With transparent data and professional risk control, we ensure a secure and convenient trading environment, empowering investors to capitalize on diversified opportunities across all market cycles. Over the past week (August 18–25), the crypto market’s momentum continued, with some emerging sectors surging and steadily lifting investor sentiment. HTX data shows that several tokens posted impressive gains. DONKEY from the BSC meme sector was the undisputed star, soaring 270% over the week and achieving a staggering 1,990% cumulative increase over 30 days. Meanwhile, DeSci newcomer BIO emerged as a “research superstar”, while blue-chip assets such as ETH and AAVE quietly rose. The entire market became a stage for both short-term frenzy and long-term stability. Meme Coins Remain in the Spotlight: DONKEY and MEME Take Flight The meme coin sector has long acted as a barometer of market sentiment in the past. With the “light narrative + strong community” model gaining traction, high volatility and popularity in meme coins are expected to continue presenting trading opportunities in the second half of the year. ● DONKEY (BSC Memecoin) : The week’s top performer, surging 270% over the week and nearly 1,990% over 30 days, making it the most impressive dark horse. Its rise is fueled by the hyper-active BSC on-chain community, coupled with market sentiment and the ever-growing cultural narrative around memes. ● MEME : A veteran meme coin, up 104% over the week. MEME is the native ecosystem token of Memeland, a Web3 creative studio founded by 9GAG, the globally popular meme platform. It has inherent meme DNA and a massive traditional internet user base. Emerging Sectors: DeSci and GameFi Stand Out Beyond the meme coin frenzy, two emerging sectors deserve particular attention this week. ● BIO (DeSci): Up 240% this week, a true dark horse. The DeSci (Decentralized Science) sector has been gaining global traction in recent years by integrating scientific research with blockchains. BIO’s strong performance reflects both market enthusiasm for innovative narratives and DeSci’s potential in real-world adoption. ● XTER (GameFi): Up 134% this week. GameFi is reviving after a period of dormancy. With ongoing improvements in user experience and tokenomics, capital is flowing back into high-quality GameFi projects. XTER’s performance suggests that the GameFi sector may be gearing up for its next growth cycle. Traditional Blue Chips: L1s and DeFi Rise Steadily Compared with the explosive rallies in meme coins and emerging narratives, blue-chip assets have maintained a stable upward trajectory. ● QTUM (L1): Up 57% this week. Qtum Blockchain (shortened as “Qtum”) is dedicated to developing a third blockchain ecosystem beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a long-established public blockchain project, QTUM continues to unlock its potential through renewed on-chain activity and ecosystem applications. ● AAVE (DeFi): Up 17% this week. Aave is an open-source decentralized lending protocol offering deposit and loan services. As a leader in decentralized lending, AAVE has once again earned market recognition thanks to ongoing protocol upgrades and its solid user base. ● ETH (L1): Up 8.8% this week to surpass $4,700, with mainnet TVL hitting a record high of $120 billion. As the industry infrastructure, ETH’s dominance is unshakable. With the Layer 2 scaling of the Ethereum ecosystem and the ongoing DeFi/NFT expansion, ETH’s steady appreciation also reinforces the market’s underlying confidence. Hot Token Listing Winners——8.18-8.25 2025 Structural Momentum Brings Opportunity: HTX Helps Capture the New Cycle This week, HTX’s asset performance reflected a distinct “structural differentiation”: On the one hand, emerging narratives such as meme coins, DeSci, and GameFi drew in substantial capital with explosive growth. On the other hand, L1s and DeFi blue chips advanced steadily, providing a foundation of long-term value. This structural landscape means that while investors can seize short-term, high-volatility opportunities, they should also allocate stable assets to strike a balance between risk and return.

50803076,567331,1756364919,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50803076.jpeg,ChatGPT’s Top 4 Cryptos to 100x for 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/chatgpt-top-100x-cryptos-2025/,"If you were paying attention, you probably know the crypto market is up to something. Rapidly increasing corporate crypto stashes, a slew of pro-crypto policy changes, and the Fed chair hinting at a September rate cut are all massive signs that the next few months could churn out some life-changing returns. But in a market with hundreds of thousands of tokens, how do you identify the best cryptos to buy ? Do you just stick to the main ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum? While relatively ‘safe,’ following this approach would probably mean leaving a lot of money on the table. On the other hand, you can’t just ape into random shitcoins either, hoping they skyrocket. That’s too risky and ill-advised. The solution? Building a well-balanced portfolio with a solid mix of under-the-radar, high-upside tokens and top-tier proven performers showing fresh breakouts. To help you do just that, we turned to ChatGPT, which is arguably the most powerful AI chatbot around right now. Read on as we unpack the AI’s top crypto picks, with detailed explanations on why each of them could be the next crypto to explode . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer 2 for Fast, Cheap Transactions & Better Programmability If you’re a Bitcoin believer who would happily purchase every last bit of ‘digital gold’ they could, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) might just be what you’re looking for. Not only is it far cheaper than $BTC, but $HYPER also carries a higher ROI potential, seeing as it’s currently in presale and available at ultra-low prices. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could surge almost 2,400% by the end of 2025, potentially hitting $0.32. What’s special about $HYPER? It’s building the first-ever Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin aimed at turbocharging the blockchain with Solana-like performance. Thanks to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER will bring lightning-fast speeds, low fees, and cutting-edge Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. And a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge lets you interact with Hyper’s SVM-powered Web3 environment by converting your Layer 1 $BTC into Layer 2 $BTC. Thanks to $HYPER, you’ll be able to engage in high-speed DeFi trading, NFTs, DAO and governance, lending, staking, swapping, and blockchain gaming right on Bitcoin. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already pulled in over $12.4M from early investors. And right now, you can buy Bitcoin Hyper for just $0.012815 apiece. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to join the Bitcoin revolution. 2. Ethereum ($ETH) – Institutional Accumulation & Technical Breakout Setting the Stage for Massive Rally Ethereum ($ETH) has been at the center of nearly all crypto chatter in recent days, and for good reason. Institutional players are scooping up ‘digital silver’ at a rapid pace, in some cases even favoring it over Bitcoin. That’s a telling sign the whales know something. Case in point: BlackRock recently dropped a massive $314M on Ethereum , while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street beefed up their $ETH ETF holdings by adding another 160K and 32.5K $ETH , respectively. Even better? If Ethereum retests its all-time high, $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated , igniting a massive short squeeze and fueling a potential parabolic rally. On the technical front, CryptoGoos, a crypto analyst with 121K+ followers on X, pointed out that $ETH has just broken out of a huge consolidation channel on the weekly chart. After a quick retest, the token now looks primed to rally higher. And according to this trading pattern, Ethereum’s next target could be… drumroll… $10K! 3. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – New Meme Coin Changing the Crypto Investing Game Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) blends iconic meme coin humor with crypto finance, offering a never-before-seen community for retail investors. As a $WEPE holder, you gain access to a vibrant and tight-knit group of crypto traders, all benefitting from each other’s strategies, insights, alpha buy/sell calls, and, of course, plenty of jokes along the way. $WEPE’s mission is simple: to dilute the unfair amount of power crypto whales currently hold, as they manipulate markets at will using advanced tools and algorithms, often wrecking everyday portfolios. After a record-breaking presale performance, where $WEPE gathered over $70M from early investors, the token proved its worth by rising almost 900% during June-July this year. And while $WEPE is admittedly in the red over the past couple of weeks, it’s now flirting with the upper resistance of a major triangle consolidation pattern. A breakout here could slam the gas pedal and send $WEPE soaring, potentially even to new all-time highs, representing a 400% gain from current levels. In addition to strong technicals, the token is also set to benefit from its upcoming Solana launch , which is likely to bring in a fresh wave of investors and hype, further boosting price. Only a meme coin or a full-blown movement? We’ll let you decide. 1 $WEPE on $ETH is currently available at just $0.000067 on DEXs . Ir you want the new $SOL $WEPE, visit the visit Wall Street Pepe’s official website. 4. Chainlink ($LINK) – Mainstream Crypto Nearing Breakout as ETF Hype Builds Chainlink ($LINK) has long been considered one of the best tokens for diversifying crypto portfolios, but recent developments – both fundamental and technical – suggest it’s now ready to take the crypto space by storm. According to CryptoELITES, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst with more than 260K followers on X, $LINK is tantalizingly close to breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. Even better? The upward-sloping trendline of this pattern has acted as strong support for months, confirming this as a rock-solid setup that could deliver in a big way. The expectation? Once $LINK breaks out, ideally with a fat green candle, it could ignite an explosive rally on its way toward $100. That means if you scoop up $LINK now, while it’s trading around $24.16 , you could be staring at a chunky 313% return on your investment. And here’s where things get even more exciting: major investment firms are showing interest in launching a spot Chainlink ETF, with Bitwise having filed for one just a few days ago. A spot ETF would legitimize $LINK as an institutional-grade asset, open the floodgates for new capital, and massively increase demand, all of which would be highly bullish for price. Wrapping Up We decided to put ChatGPT’s potentially revolutionary research and narrative-building skills to the test by asking it to craft a well-rounded crypto portfolio for 2025. And the AI delivered. Its top picks include not only institutional-grade giants like Ethereum ($ETH) and Chainlink ($LINK) but also low-cap, high-upside gems such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) .

Analyst Thinks So,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-about-to-drain-the-life-out-of-altcoins-analyst-thinks-so/,"TL;DR Bitcoin’s dominance climbs off key support, hinting at renewed strength into September and October. Altcoins may underperform as Ethereum-led rallies show signs of topping out this quarter. Analysts expect Bitcoin to regain control as liquidity exits altcoins in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Dominance Rebounds After Trendline Support Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market has started to rise again. The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) index recently bounced off a key trendline that’s held firm since early 2023. It now sits above 58%, following weeks of decline. This rebound may signal the end of altcoins’ recent run. 1 week warning Bitcoin Dominance is likely going to move higher in Sep/Oct. As noted in the post below, ALTs tend to find tops against BTC in late August. Liquidity will flow back to the king. https://t.co/YX8FaX7SPt pic.twitter.com/BUN27JMC1n — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 27, 2025 Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, issued a warning last week. He expects Bitcoin dominance to climb higher through September and October as altcoins often peak against BTC in late August. “Liquidity will flow back to the king,” he wrote on X. Cowen pointed out that several previous summers showed similar patterns. Altcoin rallies often peak around late August, then lose strength as money shifts back into Bitcoin heading into the final quarter of the year. He reminded traders, “If you are riding ALTs right now like the last few summers, just remember that the tides will likely turn a little later in Q3.” His chart suggests a possible rise in BTC dominance toward the 61–63% range. This shift would likely come at the expense of altcoins, which could underperform during this period. The focus appears to be moving back to Bitcoin, particularly if ETH, which has led the latest altcoin push, starts to fade. Analysts Cautious on Short-Term Moves A crypto market watcher said Bitcoin dominance could still drop to 52%, but not right away. “If it goes to 52%, I don’t think it will happen until much later in the year,” Cowen replied. He acknowledged that while shorter timeframes may show BTC.D as overbought, the longer-term charts suggest there’s room to move higher. Cowen added that the current rotation into altcoins seems to be driven mainly by Ethereum’s rally. He expects ETH to face resistance soon, which could trigger another upward leg in BTC dominance lasting through September and October. Bitcoin Price Holds, but Market Watches Key Level Bitcoin was trading at $113,000 at press time, with a daily gain of 1%, though still down 1% over the past week. Market veteran Peter Brandt commented on a large weekend sell order, saying it could represent market supply. “Tops in markets are created by SUPPLY or DISTRIBUTION,” he said, adding that BTC needs to reclaim $117,570 to avoid forming a potential double top. While Brandt made it clear he wasn’t taking a side, he urged traders not to ignore the signal. With Bitcoin dominance rising and altcoins showing signs of slowing, the coming weeks may mark a shift in market direction. The post Is Bitcoin About to Drain the Life Out of Altcoins?

In a statement today, the Board stated that Nasdaq's system will prevent fraud, abuse, and manipulation in the markets. Interim Chair Caroline Pham said, “As our markets evolve with new technologies, it is critical that the CFTC stays one step ahead.” The new system will provide the institution with automatic alerts and cross-market analysis. Pham also stated that it is preparing for the growth of cryptocurrency markets.

The CFTC's role in cryptocurrency oversight could expand significantly if bills being considered in Congress pass. Specifically, the Clarity Act, which has yet to be enacted, would grant the agency exclusive jurisdiction over blockchain-based commodities, require the registration of digital commodity exchanges and brokers, and impose new compliance, anti-money laundering, and reporting obligations. The CFTC stated that the Nasdaq system will be able to identify potential manipulation patterns and allow for rapid scaling during periods of high volume and volatility. “This includes access to comprehensive order book data to support real-time analysis and decision-making,” the statement said. “This is a critical element in preventing market abuse in both traditional and crypto asset markets.” *This is not investment advice.

The arrangement will allow users to pay for VPN access using crypto, enabling them to maintain personal privacy when connecting to and browsing the web. Nym’s reputation as a privacy-focused VPN provider has famously been bolstered by Edward Snowden, who’s previously endorsed its service. When shopping around for a VPN provider, privacy is naturally one of the primary attributes that web users, tired of seeing their data reshared or accessed by unauthorized third parties, are anxious to maximize. The Dash partnership will support this goal, allowing VPN users to pay for access without the need to hand over their credit card details. Dash Gives Nym a Privacy Upgrade Originally launched in 2014 as Xcoin and then Darkcoin before rebranding to its current name, Dash is an OG cryptocurrency that benefits from being one of the few privacy coins still widely available on crypto exchanges. This makes it easier for users to obtain it and use it to pay for goods and services where privacy is desirable. Interest in the project has heightened in 2025 now that privacy is back on the menu, with everyone from consumers to institutions seeking private ways of transacting onchain without disclosing sensitive data in the process. Following the NymVPN partnership, customers can use Dash to subscribe to the service before taking their pick of two options for connecting to the web. “Fast” is a WireGuard-based VPN for everyday browsing and streaming, while “Anonymous” incorporates more hops – five instead of two – for users who desire maximum anonymity. This provides robust protection against a range of cyber threats as well as censorship which threatens to limit the sites that web users can access. End-to-End Privacy Payments have long been the achilles heel of VPN providers, since the very act of purchasing a subscription risks exposing the sort of financial information that users are understandably keen to keep hidden. Cryptocurrencies – especially those with privacy features built in – are a practical solution to this problem. They’re also convenient, enabling payment to be confirmed almost instantly, with no card details stored on centralized servers where they form a honeypot to hackers. “This collaboration with Dash strengthens our mission to offer privacy across different kinds of financial transactions,” explains Nym CEO Harry Halpin. “With Dash payments that offer a degree of privacy beyond most cryptocurrencies, our users can access NymVPN’s metadata-resistant mixnet, further shielding their transactions from mass surveillance.” The other challenge web users face when electing to use a VPN is deciding which company to trust, which is less straightforward than it sounds. While all VPN providers offer broadly the same service, their architecture can differ significantly. Moreover, while all VPNs purport to protect user privacy, some do the bare minimum, while the most diligent go above and beyond in their quest to keep user data secure and anonymized at all times. With Edward Snowden singing its praises and Dash payments now integrated, NymVPN can justifiably claim to be doing its bit to keep web users and their precious data secure, not only when using its VPN but when signing up, connecting, and disconnecting. In recent years, crypto holders who’ve wanted to use privacy coins have been viewed with suspicion by regulators and lawmakers pursuing the misguided notion that “if you’re not doing anything wrong, you haven’t got anything to hide.” That idea has since been well and truly dispelled, ushering in a new era for onchain privacy in which it’s acknowledged that the ability to conceal personal information is not only normal but desirable. NymVPN’s partnership with Dash will help to further legitimize the use of privacy coins while giving web users a more discreet way of subscribing to a service that forms the foundation of their internet browsing.

The current hot-tickets are Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has been gaining increasingly widespread traction due to its revolutionary DeFi lending system. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. Initial investors will enjoy over 500% increase once it is listed. The Mutuum Finance presale has already surpassed an amount of over $15 million with more than 15720 holders buying them. XRP still takes a central spot in cross border payments and this makes it interesting to traders who are trying to maneuver the current slide in the market. XRP: Holding Steady Amid Market Moves The current price of XRP is about $2.88, keeping to the same range with the other changes in the market. It has fluctuated between $2.84 and $3.05 within the last 24-hour period, showing a relatively slowing period awaiting clear signals with regard to the rest of the market. It has not shown any deep spikes or drastic declines, but it still remains in the topic and process of cross border payments and regulation policies that could determine the future dynamics of the currency. Certainly, this is not lost on the market as the conversation around altcoin performance is now directed more towards emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as well. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty MUTM has announced that its Bug Bounty Program was launched in collaboration with Certik. By inviting white hackers, developers and security researchers to join the security program, Mutuum Finance will further enhance the security of its platform by rewarding them with bounties when they report any vulnerability they can identify. The reward system will reach a maximum of 50,000 USDT and the prize will also be in accordance with the gravity of the bug detected whether small level bugs to high-impact bug vulnerability. The hierarchical model provides one of the most comprehensive security coverings and in the simplified way is able to secure the users, investors’ money and profits, and gains increasing confidence in the Mutuum Finance system. The 100,000 Giveaway was created to build a loyal community. In addition to its bug bounty, Mutuum Finance team is conducting a $100,000 giveaway that will be encouraging early adopters of the project and internally growing its user base. It is going to be awarding 10 prizes, and the prize will be worth $10,000 MUTM, and just as earlier indicated, this will reflect the strong long term dedicated focus user base which the project aims to achieve. These community projects are a part of the desire Mutuum Finance has to not only be on the track toward creating a safe environment in the form of a platform it is building but also be a lifegiving entity which assists in creating an enriching environment where the users, token holders and investors will enjoy the success. Presale Phase 6 Beats Milestones Mutuum Finance is also taking humongous steps of its ongoing presale. The 6th stage of presale is progressing fast at $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $15 million, secured more than 15,720 token holders, and surged 16.17% to $0.035 in presale phase 6, offering early investors potential returns exceeding 500% at listing. Backed by a $100,000 giveaway, a $50,000 CertiK Bug Bounty Program, and a dual lending protocol designed for security and scalability, the project is quickly gaining traction amid market dips. Act now, join the presale today, claim your tokens, and secure your allocation before the next price milestone while ensuring eligibility for exclusive rewards and long-term growth opportunities.

Key Takeaways: Over 73% of YZY token holders lost money, with $74.8 million in collective losses. Nearly 30% of total profits went to just 11 wallets, raising concerns about insider trading. Bubblemaps flagged sniping and manipulation tactics, while West later denied involvement. Of the 70,201 wallets that traded the YZY token, 51,862, or 73.8%, recorded losses, totaling nearly $74.8 million, the platform revealed in a Wednesday post on X . Over 1,000 wallets lost more than $10,000 each. Few YZY Traders Profited as Gains Concentrated in Top Wallets In contrast, only 18,333 wallets saw profits, but the gains were unevenly distributed. Most profiting wallets made less than $1,000, while 11 wallet addresses alone captured nearly 30% of total profits, which amounted to $66.6 million in gains across all winning wallets. YZY, short for Yeezy Money, was launched last Wednesday with heavy promotion from West’s official website and social channels. Marketed as a way to put users in control of their finances, the token quickly lost steam. Within hours of launch, YZY’s price crashed nearly 70% , sparking accusations of manipulation. Bubblemaps highlighted suspicious activity including sniping, a tactic where bots acquire large portions of a token’s supply seconds after launch. One wallet identified as belonging to a trader known as “Naseem”, previously linked to Trump’s DJT memecoin profits, was flagged as YZY’s first investor. Another key figure named by Bubblemaps was Hayden Davis, a serial participant in high-profile token launches. Davis allegedly earned $12 million sniping YZY. He had previously been involved with Libra and other coins that collapsed shortly after release. “The playbook is simple: Infiltrate big launches, get in early, and extract millions,” Bubblemaps wrote in a post on X. “It’s happening in plain sight, and no one is stopping it.” The past week truly exposed the failures of our industry Despite our collective efforts as investigators, builders, and communities – the same names keep running the same scams The playbook is simple: Infiltrate big launches, get in early, and extract millions It’s happening… — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) August 27, 2025 Notably, West had previously distanced himself from the memecoin trend, saying such tokens “prey on the fans with hype.” Kanye West Denies Involvement in YZY Token, Cites Hacked Account On Wednesday, West denied involvement in the YZY-themed memecoin , stating his Instagram account was compromised. The claim was posted on West’s X (formerly known as Twitter) on August 26, in which he wrote: “My Instagram has been hacked and it’s following a fake coin…The official project is @YZY_MNY.” He went on to promote a different project, accompanied by a new Solana wallet address. No further details were provided on how the alleged compromise occurred or who may have been behind the original launch. The situation adds to a growing number of celebrity-linked crypto controversies in 2024 and 2025, raising ongoing questions about how memecoins are launched, endorsed, and sold across platforms with limited oversight. Meanwhile, West’s YZY token appears to have set the record for the fastest collapse , losing 90% of its value in just one day, despite reaching a $3 billion market cap.

Genoot told Reuters that the team chose a merger instead of a direct listing. He explained that this route offered better access to financing. Also, it allows the company to leverage an existing business already connected to capital markets. American Bitcoin has been exploring acquisitions in Hong Kong and Japan to expand its footprint, the Financial Times reported earlier this month. Genoot confirmed that the company is actively assessing opportunities in Asia, with the aim of giving investors broader access to bitcoin-linked assets beyond the US. He said that while discussions are under way, no firm commitments have been made. The focus, he added, is to create options for investors who cannot directly buy Nasdaq-listed crypto stocks due to local restrictions. American Bitcoin Born From Hut 8’s Strategic Shift Into Infrastructure American Bitcoin was founded earlier this year. It emerged from Hut 8’s pivot away from pure crypto mining into energy infrastructure and data centres. The new venture was created in partnership with the Trump brothers. Now, it is positioning itself as a global bitcoin miner. Further, the company has ambitions to expand through acquisitions and partnerships. The strategy has been described as mirroring that of large US-listed Bitcoin firms. These firms often use equity financing and mergers to accelerate growth. Moreover, Genoot said the goal is to build a vehicle that appeals to both institutional investors and retail traders. He added that the focus is on giving them exposure to Bitcoin through regulated exchanges.

American Bitcoin , a prominent mining firm, is making headlines with its ambitious plan to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This pivotal move, backed by the two sons of former U.S. President Donald Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., aims for an early September debut, according to a Reuters report. This development signals a major step for a crypto mining company entering traditional financial markets. What is American Bitcoin and Its Nasdaq Journey? American Bitcoin is not just another mining operation. Founded by Eric Trump, in collaboration with established Bitcoin miner Hut8, the company has set its sights on a public listing to expand its reach and capital. The path to Nasdaq involves a strategic merger with Gryphon Digital, another significant player in the digital asset space. Upon completion of this merger, the combined entity will trade under the familiar ticker symbol ABTC. Importantly, the company will retain its current name, American Bitcoin , maintaining its brand identity. This structure will see President Trump’s sons and Hut8 jointly owning a substantial 98% of the company, highlighting their significant commitment and belief in its future. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Significant for American Bitcoin? A Nasdaq listing is a monumental achievement for any company, especially one in the dynamic cryptocurrency sector. For American Bitcoin , it means increased visibility, enhanced credibility, and access to a broader pool of institutional and retail investors. This move could potentially unlock significant capital for further expansion, technological upgrades, and operational scaling. Listing on a major exchange like Nasdaq also subjects the company to rigorous regulatory scrutiny and reporting standards. This can instill greater confidence among investors, signaling a commitment to transparency and sound corporate governance. It further legitimizes the crypto mining industry within mainstream finance, bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional investment opportunities. Future Horizons: Expansion and Potential Acquisitions for American Bitcoin The ambitions of American Bitcoin extend beyond just a Nasdaq listing. The Financial Times (FT) previously reported that the company was actively exploring the acquisition of a Bitcoin-related firm in Asia. This strategic interest indicates a global vision for expansion and a desire to diversify its operations and market presence. Such an acquisition could provide access to new markets, technology, or mining resources, further solidifying its position in the competitive crypto landscape. However, navigating international acquisitions and integrating new operations comes with its own set of challenges. Market volatility, regulatory differences across regions, and the complexities of mergers and acquisitions are all factors that American Bitcoin will need to manage carefully. Their ability to successfully execute these plans will be key to their long-term growth. Investor Interest and the Road Ahead for American Bitcoin The involvement of Donald Trump’s sons naturally brings a unique level of public and media attention to American Bitcoin . This high profile could attract significant investor interest, but it also means the company will operate under intense scrutiny. Investors will closely watch its performance, particularly its ability to navigate the volatile crypto market and deliver on its growth strategies. The early September target for the Nasdaq listing is fast approaching. All eyes will be on ABTC as it prepares to make its debut. This event could serve as a bellwether for other crypto-related companies considering similar moves, potentially paving the way for more digital asset firms to enter traditional public markets. The journey of American Bitcoin is certainly one to follow closely. In conclusion, American Bitcoin ‘s impending Nasdaq listing, backed by the Trump sons and a strategic merger with Gryphon Digital, marks a significant milestone. This move promises enhanced visibility, access to capital, and increased legitimacy for the crypto mining sector. While challenges remain, the company’s ambitious plans for expansion and potential acquisitions suggest a forward-looking approach that could reshape its future in the digital economy. This is a truly transformative moment for the crypto industry. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is American Bitcoin?

With institutional confidence holding firm and key macro data releases ahead, the crypto market is entering a critical junction. This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research examines the drivers behind Bitcoin’s recent strength and outlines the key catalysts to watch heading into September. Liquidity and Institutional Demand Anchor BTC’s Strength At the end of August, global liquidity remained elevated. According to StreetStats, as of August 27, 2025, the total M2 money supply across major economies reached approximately USD 95.116 trillion, a record high, with a quarter-on-quarter increase of 3.87%. This indicates continued monetary easing in the short term and provides crucial support for Bitcoin’s strength. At the same time, institutional holdings became more concentrated. By August 27, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs held about 1.3 million BTC, accounting for roughly 6% of circulating supply. In mid-August, MicroStrategy purchased another 430 BTC, raising its total holdings to 629,376 BTC. These additional acquisitions, concentrated in July and August, show that short-term market volatility has not deterred institutional long-term allocation. On the regulatory front, positive developments earlier in the month continued to reverberate. On August 7, the U.S. President signed an executive order requiring regulators to allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in Bitcoin and other alternative assets. This policy triggered discussions in late August about launching new Bitcoin investment products. Given that 401(k) plans manage about USD 8.9 trillion in assets, even a modest 1% allocation to Bitcoin would imply nearly USD 89 billion in potential inflows. On-Chain Metrics Signal Caution Amid Resilience On-chain data at the end of August indicated short-term overheating but overall resilience. The MVRV-Z score stood at around 2.49, above its historical average and suggesting potential near-term correction risks. However, the aSOPR was around 1.019 and NUPL at 0.558, both reflecting stable realized and unrealized profit levels. This indicates that while current prices sit above average cost, the market as a whole has not entered excessive profit-taking territory. Upcoming Data and Policy to Guide Market Expectations Macro data releases are also likely to influence sentiment. Preliminary estimates from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed second-quarter real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 3.0%, rebounding sharply from -0.5% in the first quarter, driven by a 30.3% collapse in imports, stronger consumer spending, and increased government outlays. Markets expect the revised figure due on August 28 to be lowered to around 3.0% or even 2.4%. A downward revision would reinforce expectations of monetary easing. On August 29, the July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report—considered the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge and the last major release before the September FOMC meeting—will be published. Economists expect core PCE (excluding food and energy) to edge up from 2.8% to 2.9% year-on-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, while headline PCE is expected to remain around 2.6% year-on-year, with a 0.2% monthly increase. If the data overshoots, markets may reassess the timing of Fed rate cuts; if it comes in weaker, it would provide further support for Bitcoin. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Cronos (CRO) extended its rally following the announcement of a Trump Media Group treasury. The Cronos project also aims for organic growth and expanding its network, in addition to potentially becoming the social media token for Truth Social. CRO responded immediately to the news, regaining its previous attention and potentially re-joining the top 20 crypto assets. The token was among the day’s trending projects, rising over 54% in the past 24 hours. CRO traded at $0.34, after months of drifting under $0.10. The token is seen as potentially breaking to a higher price range, though it is yet to reach its all-time high above $0.89. CRO has been expected to trade near $1, but has lagged due to bear markets, regulatory pressure, or loss of interest.

Despite this, Cronos was one of the leading platforms for crypto onboarding during the 2024 and 2025 bull markets, showing widespread organic appeal. Cronos was also among the first projects to navigate the regulatory difficulties of a crypto-based card. Cronos draws attention with new roadmap Cronos introduced its roadmap, riding on the initial hype of the Trump Media Group partnership .

The project will use its wide network to boost access to DeFi, through staking and lending. Cronos also aims to make CRO one of the assets adopted for ETF and ETP products. Treasuries may also become one of the sources for CRO demand. In 2026, Cronos aims to place up to 20B CRO to additional public demand. The platform aims to place the re-issued and locked 70B CRO, which will enter circulation in the past decade. CRO open interest rose to a three-year high CRO open interest expanded to a three-year peak, rising to over $75M after months of relatively low trading activity. The token attracted retail activity, including from the long-term community of supporters. CRO sentiment also dipped during the latest price rally. However, more than 2.1K participants have voted on CRO sentiment , while the token usually only gained around 150 votes to gauge sentiment. After a prolonged period of inactivity, CRO may turn into a prime attention token, with increased mindshare. Based on Messari data, CRO mindshare rose by 853% in the past day, with retail interest and community mentions adding to the initial Trump Media Group hype. While the current sentiment shows CRO is below its peak hype, the token may still extend its rally and consolidate at a higher range. CRO is not yet represented on Hyperliquid, despite long-running listings on exchanges, though significant volumes are locked on the Crypto.com native exchange, with major interest on the South Korean exchange Upbit. CRO’s rally is also supported by over 42% share of the Korean won, currently the key source of liquidity. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

While established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain strong assets, their upside potential is limited compared to new tokens entering the market at ultra-low valuations. This is why presale tokens priced below $0.1 have captured the attention of both retail traders and institutional investors. One standout project currently making waves is Ozak AI (OZ)—an AI-powered crypto project that blends innovation with utility. With its presale priced at just $0.01, analysts are calling it the best presale happening right now, offering investors the possibility to turn $2,000 into $40,000 or even more if projections are realized. Why OZ Presales Offer Massive Upside Presales are unique because they allow early investors to get in before a token launches on major exchanges. In many cases, once the project gains exposure and liquidity, the token price surges exponentially. Early-stage entries like these have historically delivered life-changing returns. For example, Ethereum’s early backers bought in for cents before it became worth thousands of dollars, while Solana and Polygon also produced 100x–200x gains for presale participants. With Ozak AI priced at just $0.01 per token, it gives investors the chance to participate in a project with high-growth potential at the ground floor, before broader adoption pushes prices closer to its projected $1 target. Ozak AI’s Presale Success The Ozak AI presale has already proven itself a success, raising over $2.4 million and selling more than 820 million tokens in record time. These numbers are a testament to the strong demand and confidence surrounding the project. Unlike meme coins that rely purely on hype, Ozak AI’s foundation lies in utility-driven technology. The project’s core mission is to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain, providing predictive trading tools, automated analytics, and real-time insights for crypto traders. As AI continues to dominate headlines in both the tech and financial industries, Ozak AI is positioned perfectly at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing sectors. OZ Security and Transparency Building Trust One of the most important challenges in the crypto area is trust. Many presale initiatives fail due to lack of transparency or safety flaws. Ozak AI has addressed those issues by finishing a Certik audit, giving buyers reassurance that its smart contracts are stable and dependable. Furthermore, the challenge is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, platforms that best showcase legitimate tokens, further boosting investor confidence. This combination of transparency and credibility has helped Ozak AI stand out from hundreds of other presales happening across the market. Why $2,000 Could Become $40,000 or More The math behind Ozak AI’s upside is straightforward. At its current presale price of $0.01, a $2,000 investment would secure 200,000 tokens. If Ozak AI hits its projected target of $1, that $2,000 stake could be worth $200,000—a 100x return. Even a more conservative scenario of the token reaching $0.20–$0.25 could flip that investment into $40,000 or above. When compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, which would require massive capital to achieve similar multipliers, the appeal of presales like Ozak AI becomes even clearer. This is why presale tokens continue to attract investors looking for asymmetric opportunities—where the risk is limited, but the upside is extraordinary. OZ Partnerships and Growth Roadmap Beyond its presale numbers, Ozak AI has been constructing vital partnerships to boost up adoption. Collaborations with blockchain ecosystems and AI-pushed systems ensure that its tools might be integrated throughout trading communities. By addressing real-world demanding situations, which include unreliable trading alerts and lack of predictive analytics, Ozak AI ensures that its token isn’t just a speculative asset but part of a developing ecosystem with sensible use instances. As the project moves towards its reputable release, those partnerships and product rollouts are predicted to drive even more demand for the token, doubtlessly pushing its price better than the initial $1 goal. The crypto market in 2025 is full of opportunities, but few compare to presales priced under $0.1, where the potential for exponential growth is highest. Among these, Ozak AI has emerged as the best presale happening currently, offering investors a rare chance to enter at just $0.01 before the wider market catches on. With strong fundamentals, audited security, major listings, and millions raised, it combines credibility with explosive upside. For investors looking to flip $2,000 into $40,000—or potentially much more—Ozak AI represents one of the most compelling opportunities of the year.

This top altcoin boasts a 30% TVL rise, active addresses around 22 million, and massive institutional interest that keeps rising. Meanwhile, Remittix is making massive strides of its own, delivering record-breaking improvements, earning its place among the best cryptos to buy now for different but valid reasons. Even an early Solana backer is convinced that this PayFi sensation will deliver the big bags this year. Analyzing Solana Market Performance Solana holds its spot among the list of the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its explosive on-chain performance and figures. This year, its performance has seen a 43% annualized return, with increasing DeFi engagement, project development, and fresh ETF instruments like the Solana + Staking ETF all strengthening SOL’s position. Considering its institutional enthusiasm, speed, and thriving ecosystem backing, Solana remains a key option for savvy investors. However, savvy investors who found this Altcoin early have now backed the new Remittix DeFi project to match this and do better. Source: TradingView Remittix Drives Rapid Growth With Potential for More Through Tangible Utility Remittix is making a name for itself where several crypto projects rely on hype. This project has sold over 623 million RTX tokens, selling at $0.0987, and has raised over $21.6 million, massive capital before launch. This PayFi project’s strategy surpasses raising capital. There’s an ongoing $250,000 giveaway that is attracting users in droves. The first CEX listing on BitMart is live, with another listing to come once Remittix hits the $22 million funding target, which isn’t far off. Also, the wallet beta launch in September is expected to enable more utility through crypto-to-bank transfers and attract more attention. Here is why this Solana expert, like several other investors, backs Remittix: Wallet beta launch this quarter will increase momentum Offering a solution to a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Audited by CertiK to affirm trust and transparency Deflationary tokenomics created for long-term growth Providing solutions freelancers, remitters, global earners, and businesses need Remittix presents itself as a practical, compelling name by delivering these infrastructure and access. While Solana continues to dazzle with on-chain growth and developer activity, Remittix is powering forward with scheduled product rollouts and tangible utility. These cryptos have unique strengths: Solana for altcoin velocity and Remittix for today’s payments infrastructure. However, Remittix has a low-cap advantage, which allows for more growth.

Analyst Says “The Delay Is Actually a Good Thing” and Explains Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-isnt-the-anticipated-major-altcoin-season-happening-analyst-says-the-delay-is-actually-a-good-thing-and-explains-why/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Simeon Koch evaluated the latest market situation and argued that altcoin investors should be patient. According to Koch, the delay of the anticipated altcoin season is not a negative situation, but rather a healthy process for the crypto ecosystem. In his analysis, Koch noted that growing impatience in the crypto market has divided investors into two camps, with some anticipating a strong altcoin rally and others predicting the collapse of all projects except Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, according to Koch, the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes: “The delay in the altcoin season allows Bitcoin to renew confidence and attract liquidity into the market first.” A report published last week by US exchange Coinbase predicted that an altcoin rally could begin in September. The report noted that altcoin market capitalization has increased by more than 50% in recent weeks, while Bitcoin dominance has fallen from 65% to 59%. Coinbase interprets this decline as an early signal of capital reshuffling. It also estimates that approximately $7.2 trillion in funds is currently held in money market funds, and that some of this money could shift to cryptocurrency with interest rate cuts expected in the fall. Related News: Major Company Announces Investment in Binance-Listed Altcoins - Both Altcoins Backed According to Coinbase analysis, the Global M2 Money Supply index, which measures global money supply, trends approximately 100 days ahead of Bitcoin price movements. The latest data suggests a new wave of liquidity could arrive in the fourth quarter of 2025, potentially boosting Bitcoin and altcoin markets. Koch also highlighted the warnings of renowned analyst Benjamin Cowen. Cowen noted that in every bull cycle, Bitcoin initially instills confidence in the market, leading to a prolonged period of BTC dominance before altcoins perform, saying, “If the altcoin season is delayed, it will come back stronger later.” Cowen argues that this process has played out similarly in past cycles, noting that altcoin rallies typically follow strong gains in Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Koch, technical indicators point to a potential breakout in the altcoin market. He noted that the 125 largest altcoins have formed an ascending triangle formation on their monthly charts, noting that this pattern has historically mostly broken upwards. According to the analyst, altcoin market capitalization increased by 320% following a similar formation in the 2021 cycle. *This is not investment advice.

50804938,567261,1756368027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50804938.jpeg,Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Push Ignited By Japan’s Democratic People’s Party,https://bitcoinist.com/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-japan-dpp/,"Japan’s debate over sovereign Bitcoin exposure moved from the fringe to the front row this week after JAN3 chief executive Samson Mow met in Tokyo with Yuichiro Tamaki, who leads the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), and Sōhei Kamiya, leader of Sanseitō. Will Japan Establish A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? As Mow put it, “We had very productive meetings in Tokyo with Kamiya-san, leader of Sanseito, and Tamaki-san, leader of the DPP. Both leaders already had a great understanding of #Bitcoin so our discussions flowed very naturally… I focused mainly on the limited window of opportunity for a nation-state to accumulate significant amounts of BTC for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. We will likely have additional meetings later this year.” The political substance of those conversations tracks long-running parliamentary activity by both leaders. In Mow’s words, “Kamiya-san has raised the idea of Japan holding Bitcoin reserves in the Diet and called for tax reform, reflecting his party Sanseito’s sovereignty-first stance. Tamaki-san has proposed lowering capital gains taxes on Bitcoin to 20% and exempting smaller swaps and payments from taxation, giving Bitcoin fairer treatment in law.” He then clarified that “these are activities they have done previously in the Diet.” JAN3, for its part, framed the agenda in explicitly geopolitical terms. “JAN3 CEO @Excellion met with Sohei Kamiya, leader of Sanseito, and Yuichiro Tamaki, leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), at their offices in Tokyo to discuss the urgency to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for Japan. Diet Members understand the world has changed dramatically with the US SBR already established and the Bitcoin Act on the way.” The reference is to the United States’ March 6, 2025 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), followed days later by the introduction of the BITCOIN Act in Congress to codify and scale that framework. The Tokyo meetings were not confined to opposition figures. Mow also underscored engagement with gatekeepers in the ruling camp: “It was a pleasure to meet Satsuki Katayama at @WebX_Asia where she delivered a speech at the Bitcoin networking event. Katayama-san is a member of Japan’s House of Councillors, representing the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and also chair of the LDP Committee on Finance.” Katayama indeed chairs the LDP’s Financial Research Commission and has recently fronted party policy work touching capital markets, banking supervision and digital-asset issues, a signal that Bitcoin policy sits squarely inside the LDP’s finance apparatus. Japan’s Political Power Structure Understanding how and where the DPP and Sanseitō sit in Japan’s power structure is essential to gauging the odds of near-term policy change. In the July 20, 2025 House of Councillors election, the LDP–Komeito ruling bloc lost its upper-house majority, while smaller parties surged. The DPP won 17 seats in that contest and now holds 22 seats in the chamber, making it the third-largest force after the LDP and the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP). Sanseitō captured 14 seats, lifting its total to 15. Those tallies translate into real leverage for both parties in an upper house where the government must now assemble issue-by-issue majorities. Percentages tell the same story. On the national proportional list, the DPP took roughly 12.88% of the vote, while Sanseitō drew about 12.55%, confirming that both parties converted a broad base of support into seats. With the LDP–Komeito alliance short of a majority, that performance gives Tamaki’s centrists and Kamiya’s sovereigntists greater committee-level bargaining power over any crypto tax rewrite or more ambitious reserve initiative. Within that parliamentary geometry, tax reform is the most immediate vector. Tamaki has consistently pushed to replace today’s progressive treatment of crypto gains—which can run to the mid-50s percent when local levies are included—with a 20% separate tax, and to exempt small-value payments and crypto-to-crypto swaps from recognition, a de minimis regime designed to unlock everyday usage.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Whales Have Seen Their Counts Go Up Recently In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how the whale populations have shifted on the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains recently. Whales refer to the key stakeholders of a cryptocurrency who hold amounts large enough that they can carry some degree of influence in the market. The exact scale of these investors is defined differently across networks. For BTC, whales are considered to be entities carrying more than 1,000 BTC (equivalent to $112 million at the current exchange rate), while for ETH, the threshold is 10,000 ETH ($46.4 million). Related Reading: Bitcoin Selloff: $2.2 Billion In BTC Floods Exchanges Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the total number of whale-sized wallets has changed on each of these networks over the past few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin whales saw their count plummet back in July, implying a notable number of these investors exited from the market near the rally high. In August, the metric has made gradual recovery for the cryptocurrency, with there now being 13 more such wallets compared to the start of the month. While this isn’t anything too big, it does indicate that big-money investors are slowly buying back in. Ethereum has also seen its whale population go up during the same window and the increase has been more dramatic in its case. In total, 48 new whales have joined the blockchain since August began. Given the key position that these investors occupy in the market, the sentiment among them is often worth keeping an eye on. With a buying push occurring from them right now, it would seem that their outlook is bullish, particularly in the case of ETH. In some other news, Bitcoin has witnessed a sharp decline in capital inflows recently, as analyst Willy Woo has explained in an X post. Bitcoin is today seeing around less than $1 billion per day in capital inflows, which is significantly down compared to the earlier peak above $2 billion per day. Interestingly, in the same period as BTC has seen inflows dry up, ETH has observed them pick up instead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Keeps Slipping Down: Is $107,000 The Next Support? This could be an indication that investor interest has been rotating from the former to the latter. Following the uptrend, Ethereum inflows have risen to almost the same level as BTC ones, meaning that a flip could occur soon. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen some recovery from its recent low as its price has climbed back up to $112,500.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-were-all-going-to-get-extremely-rich-this-cycle-heres-why/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-known analyst on X, has presented a chart that compares XRP’s past market dominance with potential future levels. His post includes a bold claim that XRP reclaiming its 2017 market dominance level could make many investors “extremely rich” in this cycle. The Historical Reference Point The chart highlights XRP’s dominance in 2017, when it reached approximately 24.9% of the overall cryptocurrency market. That surge represented an increase of more than 1,200% from prior levels. This rally also helped XRP reach its previous peak of $3.36 in January 2018. At the time, XRP also briefly became the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, before the correction in 2018 pulled it down. From the perspective of market structure, the chart marks that high as a benchmark for comparison with present conditions. Since then, XRP’s dominance has steadily declined, reaching much lower levels in the years that followed. At the time of Steph’s analysis, it sat near 4.68%, indicating that XRP represents a smaller portion of the cryptocurrency market compared to 2018. This gap between the historic high and the current level forms the basis for projections about future growth. If #XRP reclaims its 2017 market dominance level, we’re all going to get extremely rich this cycle! pic.twitter.com/46ZQSNoggn — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 27, 2025 The Projection for 2025 According to the analysis, the next major target sits at around 20.65% dominance by 2025. If achieved, this would represent a 428% increase from current levels. XRP has performed remarkably in 2025, recently reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 , and Steph expects a swift rise in dominance to follow. The timeline on the chart places this projection within the current market cycle, suggesting that the coming few months may be decisive for XRP’s share of the broader market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Repeating Historical Pattern The comparison between 2017 and 2025 rests on repeating patterns in market dominance. The chart notes a consolidation period followed by a breakout during the previous cycle, implying that a similar breakout could occur again. While the percentage gains would be smaller than those recorded in 2017, the overall effect would still mark a significant shift in XRP’s standing within the digital asset space and help it surpass Ethereum, making it the second-largest cryptocurrency once again. A move from below 5% to over 20% would indicate that XRP had absorbed substantial market share from competitors, reinforcing its long-term presence, and also putting it on the path to challenge Bitcoin’s position at the top of the market.

Features and The Controversy That Led to Its Ban,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/why-was-candy-ai-so-popular-features-and-the-controversy-that-led-to-its-ban/,"BitcoinWorld Why Was Candy AI So Popular? Features and The Controversy That Led to Its Ban For tech enthusiasts and a broad user base seeking digital companionship, Candy AI became a viral phenomenon. As of August 2025 , the platform is no longer available, having been banned due to a combination of legal, safety, and ethical issues. However, before its shutdown, it was widely discussed for its advanced technology and the controversy surrounding its adult-oriented features. The Rise and Fall of Candy AI The platform’s popularity stemmed from its sophisticated ability to offer a deeply personalized and intimate AI chat experience , a step beyond typical chatbots. The core appeal was the ability to create and engage with an emotionally responsive virtual companion that was always available. Discussions about Candy AI often revolved around these key themes: The Novelty of AI Intimacy: The platform gained attention for simulating human-like, intimate relationships, fulfilling a desire for companionship in a digital space. Controversy and Ethical Debates: Its explicit, unfiltered content for adults sparked intense global debate over the ethics, privacy, and safety of generative AI platforms. Tech and User Curiosity: The service was a major topic in the AI community, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with conversational AI and attracting users eager to explore these new frontiers. Key Features of the Candy AI Platform Prior to its ban, Candy AI stood out from competitors due to its advanced and highly customizable features, which were built on cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. Customization Personalized AI Companions: Users could design their own virtual characters, often referred to as an “AI girlfriend” or “AI boyfriend,” with extensive control over appearance and voice. Detailed Persona Creation: The platform allowed for the definition of specific personality traits, relationship dynamics, hobbies, and backstories, ensuring a highly personalized experience . Conversational Experience Advanced NLP for Realistic Conversations: Candy AI utilized sophisticated NLP to facilitate fluid, context-aware conversations that felt more authentic than scripted chatbot responses. Adaptive Memory: The AI had a robust memory system that allowed it to recall past conversations and user preferences, making interactions feel more personal and long-term. Emotional Simulation: The technology was capable of detecting a user’s tone and mood, allowing it to provide empathetic and emotionally responsive replies . Multimedia and Immersive Features Voice Integration: Users could engage in voice-based conversations, which added a more immersive and personal dimension to the chat experience. Image Generation: A key feature was the ability to request custom, on-demand images of the AI companion, such as “selfies” created from a user’s specific prompts. Immersive Roleplay: Users could participate in complex, user-scripted roleplaying scenarios, from fantasy adventures to romantic storylines. The Reason for the Ban The primary reason for the platform’s shutdown was its focus on mature, unfiltered adult-oriented content . While a premium feature available to verified 18+ users , the explicit nature of the interactions raised significant red flags. This, combined with a lack of robust age verification and content moderation, led to a global ban in August 2025 by authorities concerned with legal and ethical violations. Conclusion The story of Candy AI underscores the rapid evolution and significant challenges within the AI companion market. While its advanced features set a new standard for conversational and personalized AI, its eventual ban highlights the critical importance of legal compliance and ethical responsibility in the development of generative AI technologies.

Hyper-HYPER) بكميات كبيرة استعداداً لموسم العملات البديلة,https://bitcoinist.com/%d8%a3%d9%81%d8%b6%d9%84-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d9%85%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d9%82%d9%85%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%84%d8%b4%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%88%d9%84/,"يشهد سوق الكريبتو زيادةً ملحوظة في النشاط مع تزايد الترقب لموسم العملات البديلة، وقد أصدرت شركة كوينبيس (Coinbase) تقريراً جديداً يوم الخميس يشير إلى احتمال بدء الموسم قريباً، ما يُحسّن التوقعات الإيجابية في السوق. في الوقت ذاته، ارتفع مؤشر موسم العملات البديلة الخاص بمنصة CoinMarketCap بمقدار 12 نقطة هذا الأسبوع، بينما تقترب سيطرة عملة بيتكوين (Bitcoin-BTC) من أدنى مستوياتها خلال 6 أشهر، حيث تبدو جميعُ العوامل مهيأةً لبدء ارتفاع أسعار العملات البديلة. ومع تصاعد الحماس، يبحث المتداولون عن أفضل العملات الرقمية للشراء حالياً، ومن أبرز تلك المشاريع عملة سولانا (Solana) وعملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper)، فقد وصل عدد حيتان (كبار مستثمري) عملة سولانا (Solana) إلى أعلى مستوياته الجديدة على الإطلاق، بينما يقترب اكتتاب عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) من جمع 10 مليون دولار. وعلى الرغم من تراجع أسعار أغلب العملات الرقمية الكبرى خلال آخر 24 ساعة، يستمر هذان المشروعان بجذب المزيد من الاستثمارات، ما يشير إلى مستقبل واعد. هل بدأ موسم العملات البديلة؟ الأسعار مهيأة لتشهد ارتفاعاً حاداً في أيلول/سبتمبر هز تقرير جديد صادر عن منصة كوينبيس (Coinbase) السوق، حيث توقع بدء موسم العملات البديلة في شهر أيلول/سبتمبر. وذكر التقرير الذي تم نشره يوم الخميس أن انخفاض مستوى سيطرة عملة بيتكوين (Bitcoin) وارتفاع القيمة السوقية للعملات البديلة وقوة عملة إيثيريوم (Ethereum-ETH) النسبية، تشير إلى أن العملات البديلة قد تبدأ تفوقها بشكلٍ ملحوظٍ على عملة بيتكوين. كذلك، أشارت كوينبيس إلى أنّ السيولة بدأت تعود إلى سوق الكريبتو بعد توقفٍ دام 6 أشهر، ما يدعم احتمال حدوث موسم عملات بديلة. في الوقت ذاته، شارك المحلل جوردون (Gordon) معلوماتٍ إضافية، مشيراً إلى أن مؤشر MACD لمستوى سيطرة عملة بيتكوين (Bitcoin) قد أظهر أول تقاطع هابطٍ شهري له خلال 4 سنوات. وقال جوردون: “في المرة الأخيرة التي حدَث فيها ذلك، شهدت أسعار العملات البديلة ارتفاعاً حاداً دام مدة 4 أشهر، حيث حققت العملات ذات القيمة السوقية الكبيرة أرباحاً قدرُها 10 أضعافٍ، بينما حققت العملات المتوسطة والصغيرة أرباحاً تتراوح بين 20 و50 ضعفاً”. تعكس تعليقات جوردون حالة الحماس المتزايد داخل قطاع العملات البديلة في الوقت الحالي بشكلٍ مثالي. وإذا سارت الأمور كما هو متوقع، فقد يكون العديد من المتداولين على وشك تحقيق مكاسب تغير حياتهم. ولكنْ، ما هي العملات الرقمية التي قد تُحقق أفضل أداء؟ دعونا نستعرض مشروعين يتمتعان بإمكاناتٍ هائلة. عملة سولانا (Solana) تشهد عملة سولانا (Solana) حالياً زخماً قوياً، فقد أدى نشاط سوق العملات البديلة إلى زيادة استثمارات الحيتان بشكلٍ ملحوظ. ووفقاً للمحلل علي مارتينيز (Ali Martinez)، بلغ عدد مالكي العملة الذين يمتلكون أكثرَ من 10,000 عملة سولانا (Solana) أعلى مستوى جديد يبلغ 5,224 شخصاً. تعكس هذه الخطوة مستوى ثقة كبار المستثمرين بالعملة، ما قد يشير إلى احتمال ارتفاع السعر بشكلٍ حاد في المستقبل القريب. في الوقت ذاته، سجّل صندوق التداول الفوري لعملة سولانا المتداول في البورصة REX-Osprey) (REX-Osprey spot SOL ETF أكبر استثماراتٍ يومية له على الإطلاق تبلغ 13 مليون دولار يوم الخميس، ما يُبرز جاذبية عملة سولانا (Solana) المتنامية بين المتداولين الخبراء. وتشير هذه العوامل إلى أن سعر عملة سولانا (Solana) قد يكون على وشك الارتفاع بشكلٍ كبير. عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) تقدم عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) حل طبقة ثانية لبلوكتشين بيتكوين (Bitcoin Blockchain)، وتقترب حصيلة اكتتابه بسرعةٍ من الوصول إلى 10 مليون دولار. تجدر الإشارة إلى أن الاكتتاب يجمع يومياً تمويلاً يتراوح بين 300,000$ و700,000$، ما يعكس اهتمام كبار المستثمرين القوي بهذا المشروع الجديد. يُعزى ذلك إلى استخداماته الطموحة، فهو يهدف إلى معالجة المشكلات الرئيسية لبلوكتشين بيتكوين (Bitcoin) مثل بطء المعاملات وارتفاع الرسوم وضعف الوظائف. وبفضل تقنية تجميع المعاملات وفق معرفة صفرية (ZK-rollups) وآلة سولانا الافتراضية (SVM) والجسر اللامركزي الخاص بها، ستقدم لكم عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) معاملاتٍ سريعة وآمنة ومنخفضة التكلفة. لذلك، على المهتمين الاستفادة من المرحلة الحالية من الاكتتاب، حيث تُباع العملات بسعر منخفض. علاوةً على ذلك، يقدم المشروع آلية رهن توفر عائداً سنوياً نسبته 113%، ما سيُساعد المستثمرين الأوائل على تحقيق المزيد من الأرباح >> أفكار ختامية: ما هي أفضل عملة رقمية للشراء؟ مع اقتراب موسم العملات البديلة، يواجه مستثمرو الكريبتو فرصة نادرةً لتحقيق أرباح. مع ذلك، يشير اهتمام الحيتان المتزايد بعملة سولانا (Solana) وعملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) -حتى خلال أيام انخفاض أسعار العملات البديلة الأخرى- إلى إمكانية التفوق على السوق. وكما أوضح المحلل جوردون، يُمكن أن توفر العملات ذات القيمة السوقية الكبيرة مثل عملة سولانا (Solana) عوائد تصل إلى 10 أضعاف، بينما قد تحقق المشاريع القوية ذات القيمة السوقية الصغيرة مكاسبَ تتراوح بين 20 إلى 50 ضعفاً. لذلك، قد تُحقق عملة بيتكوين هايبر (Bitcoin Hyper) عوائد كبيرةً خلال الأشهر القادمة، نظراً لنجاحها المبكر واستخداماتها الطموحة.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SOL|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img':

A notable Ethena ENA deposit , valued at nearly $9.64 million, has just landed on Binance. This significant movement by a multi-signature address linked to the Ethena project is certainly worth a closer look for anyone following the crypto space. What Exactly Was This Ethena ENA Deposit? Just a short while ago, an address identified as belonging to the Ethena (ENA) project team made a substantial transfer. They deposited a whopping 15 million ENA tokens, equivalent to approximately $9.64 million, directly to the Binance exchange. This information comes from reputable on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who spotted the transaction around 15 minutes after it occurred. For those unfamiliar, Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, offering a crypto-native, censorship-resistant solution for money. Its native token, ENA, plays a crucial role within its ecosystem, often used for governance and other utility functions. Therefore, any large Ethena ENA deposit from the project’s own wallet naturally draws significant market attention. Why Does a Large Deposit Like This Matter? When a project team moves a substantial amount of its native tokens to an exchange, it often triggers speculation. Such a large Ethena ENA deposit could indicate several things, and understanding these possibilities is key for investors. Typically, these movements are closely watched for their potential impact on token price and market liquidity. Here are a few common reasons for such large deposits: Increasing Liquidity: Teams might deposit tokens to improve liquidity on the exchange, making it easier for users to buy and sell ENA. Market Making Activities: The team could be engaging in market making to ensure stable trading conditions and reduce volatility. Treasury Management: It might be part of the project’s broader treasury management strategy, perhaps to fund operational costs or future development. Token Unlocks or Vesting Schedules: Sometimes, these deposits align with scheduled token unlocks, where previously locked tokens become available. It’s important to remember that not all large deposits are signals of impending sell-offs. Many are routine operational activities designed to support the project’s health and ecosystem. What Could This Ethena ENA Deposit Mean for ENA Holders? For current and potential ENA holders, understanding the implications of this deposit is crucial. While a large influx of tokens onto an exchange can sometimes precede selling pressure, leading to a temporary price dip, it’s not always the case. In fact, if the deposit is for market making or liquidity provision, it could ultimately benefit traders by offering better execution prices. Consider these points: Short-term Volatility: Be prepared for potential short-term price fluctuations as the market digests this news. Long-term Outlook: Focus on Ethena’s fundamentals and development roadmap. A single large transaction, even a significant Ethena ENA deposit , rarely defines a project’s long-term trajectory. Transparency: While the direct reason isn’t always immediately clear, the public nature of blockchain transactions allows for transparency and monitoring. Navigating Crypto Whale Movements: Your Actionable Insights Large transfers from project teams or “whales” are a regular occurrence in the crypto space. Learning to interpret them without panic is a valuable skill. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate such events: Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysts and official project channels for updates. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t solely rely on speculation. Investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, and recent announcements. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio can also mitigate risks associated with single token movements. Look for Context: Always try to understand the ‘why’ behind a transaction. Is it part of a known vesting schedule? Is the team communicating about it? The recent Ethena ENA deposit to Binance is a prime example of the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While such movements can spark immediate interest and speculation, a balanced perspective, coupled with thorough research, is always the best approach. Keep an eye on Ethena’s official communications and market reaction in the coming days to gain further clarity on this intriguing development. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethena (ENA)? Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to provide a crypto-native, censorship-resistant financial solution. Its native token, ENA, serves various utility and governance purposes within the ecosystem. Q2: How much ENA was deposited to Binance? A multi-signature address associated with the Ethena project deposited 15 million ENA tokens, valued at approximately $9.64 million, to Binance. Q3: Who reported this Ethena ENA deposit? On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa reported the significant deposit shortly after it occurred. Q4: Does this deposit mean ENA’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While large deposits can sometimes precede selling pressure, they can also be for purposes like increasing liquidity, market making, or treasury management, which might not negatively impact the price in the long term. It’s crucial to monitor market reactions and project announcements. Q5: What should ENA holders do after this news? ENA holders should stay informed by following official Ethena channels and reputable crypto news sources. It’s advisable to avoid panic, conduct personal research, and consider the broader market context rather than reacting solely to a single transaction.

Active addresses dropped to 38,303 in late August, reflecting weak network support behind price moves. Analyst fractal points to $4.30 breakout, but sustainability is questioned without stronger on-chain activity. Price Pattern Shows Reversal Setup, But Momentum Fades XRP recently formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a structure that often suggests a possible change in trend. The pattern was visible toward the end of July, with the price attempting to break higher. While the setup pointed to a potential reversal, the move stalled shortly after. BitGuru noted that the pattern failed to gain traction. “XRP showed an inverse head & shoulders pattern, but failed to sustain momentum,” they said. The weak breakout left the market open for renewed selling, keeping price movement within a broader downtrend that has been in place since late July. $XRP Battling the Downtrend $XRP showed an inverse head & shoulders pattern, but failed to sustain momentum, keeping sellers active. The market has mostly been tracking a downtrend, with repeated rejections from the $3.10 zone. https://t.co/eUykHZvqSS pic.twitter.com/L0Lfwrs5qc — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) August 27, 2025 Notably, the $3.10 zone has been a consistent resistance level for several weeks. XRP has approached this price multiple times throughout August, but each attempt has been met with selling. None of the rallies managed to stay above it for long. Current market behavior shows hesitation around the same area. Without a strong close above $3.10, supported by buying volume, the market appears to favor the downside. XRP is trading near $3.00, reflecting limited movement over the past day and modest gains for the week. Network Activity Tracks Lower Data from Glassnode shows that XRP’s network usage has declined. As of August 27, the number of active addresses was 38,303. This drop in activity has come despite recent moves in price, which suggests lower engagement from users. Source: Glassnode Earlier in the year, especially in June, active addresses saw spikes well above 500,000. That trend has not continued. Since late July, the numbers have been steady but low, even as XRP reached the $3.40 range in early August. A healthy move up is often supported by growing network use, but that support isn’t visible here. Market Watching Possible Repeat Structure Another view came from Gordon, who pointed to a familiar pattern forming. He posted that the “$XRP fractal [is] looking strong,” adding that “the pump will shock many.” The price is now targeting $4.30, which would mark a new record. However, this setup is similar to previous XRP moves that followed long periods of consolidation. Still, without stronger network signals or a sustained hold above key levels, questions around the move remain.

With Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in the spotlight and heavyweight backing from Hut 8, crypto markets just got a political spark plug. And with all eyes on the American Bitcoin SPAC launch , traders are speculating whether this political-meets-crypto debut could be the most-watched Nasdaq listing of the year. “Quick note: while some outlets have casually called this a “ SPAC ,” the deal on file is an all-stock merger with an already-listed company (Gryphon), not a blank-check vehicle. That still creates an IPO-like on-ramp to Nasdaq for American Bitcoin under the ticker ABTC .” https://twitter.com/martypartymusic/status/1953128609180467543 What is American Bitcoin (ABTC)? American Bitcoin pitches itself as a Bitcoin accumulation and infrastructure platform – a miner and holder rolled into one designed to give public-equity investors a direct, regulated way to gain exposure to BTC via the stock market. The pathway: Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock merger; after closing, the combined company will keep the “American Bitcoin” name, with the ABTC Nasdaq listing set to create a regulated new channel for public investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Corporate materials state that American Bitcoin’s management and board will lead the combined entity. https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1953600035155063197 The cap-table dynamics are striking. Securities filings and company announcements indicate former American Bitcoin shareholders are expected to own ~98% of the combined company, leaving legacy Gryphon holders with roughly 2% – an inversion that underscores how this is effectively American Bitcoin taking the public shell. Reporting also notes that Hut 8 , led by CEO Asher Genoot, is the largest investor, with an 80% stake in American Bitcoin, and that after the merger, the Trump sons and Hut 8 together would control a similar ~98% slice of the new entity. That level of concentration can cut both ways. On the one hand, a committed sponsor base can align incentives, simplify decision-making, and, at least initially, support the float. On the other, concentrated ownership often means limited free float and potential volatility around unlocks or future capital raises – issues public-market traders watch closely in newly listed crypto-adjacent equities.

Political weight meets crypto utility Why does the political piece matter? Because brand and attention are forms of capital, especially in crypto. A Trump-backed, Trump-branded mining and accumulation play arrives with instant name recognition, guaranteed media cycles, and a built-in audience spanning supporters, critics, and the merely curious. That attention can translate into higher retail participation and liquidity at launch, but it also invites deeper policy scrutiny, conflicts-of-interest questions, and regulatory attention that few other crypto listings face. Major outlets have already framed the family’s expanding digital-asset footprint as part of a broader, pro-crypto platform from the White House, further intertwining market perception with politics. Compare that to prior “celebrity coins” and influencer-fronted projects. Most fizzled because the branding outran the utility: lots of sizzle, thin on rails. American Bitcoin is different in at least two ways. First, it’s a public-company wrapper on a power-and-hardware-intensive business (mining and balance-sheet BTC) rather than a pure token launch. Second, it’s stepping directly onto a major exchange – Nasdaq , which layers on disclosure obligations, audited financials, and market-structure visibility. That doesn’t immunize it from hype cycles, but it places ABTC inside the same reporting ecosystem as other listed miners and Bitcoin-exposed equities. What’s the crypto market saying? ABTC’s timing intersects with a still-hungry ETF era. After a mid-August wobble, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs just snapped a multi-day outflow streak with $219 million of net inflows led by Fidelity and BlackRock , a reminder that institutionally convenient wrappers continue to funnel capital into BTC on dips. Cumulative 2025 flows remain massive, and research shops still peg crypto ETPs as a primary bridge for mainstream investors. In short: the “pipes” are very much alive. https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1959660884344631667 That backdrop is fertile for equities that package Bitcoin exposure with an added narrative. Listed miners and “BTC-treasury” plays have often traded as leveraged proxies for spot, rising faster in bull bursts and falling harder in drawdowns. If ABTC launches into a supportive tape, order books could see brisk demand simply because some investors prefer ticker exposure over self-custody, and some funds can only hold exchange-listed securities. Conversely, in a risk-off week, that leverage can work in reverse. The spicier question is whether politically branded crypto equities can outperform based on identity alone. Traders will test that thesis – especially in the first weeks, but markets usually revert to fundamentals: hashrate efficiency, energy contracts, scale, balance-sheet BTC per share, and dilution risk. If ABTC’s operational metrics are competitive and its treasury strategy is disciplined, the branding becomes a powerful top-of-funnel rather than the sole pillar of value. Risks, realism, and the road ahead Regulatory and legal headwinds. A White House-adjacent crypto vehicle will (fairly or not) draw amplified scrutiny. Expect probing of energy sourcing, cross-border activities (the company has floated exploring exposure in Asia), related-party transactions, and disclosures around political entanglements. That doesn’t doom the listing, but it raises the bar on governance and investor-relations precision from Day 1. Market-structure dynamics. The ownership concentration outlined in filings implies limited float and potentially sharp price moves around catalysts (index inclusion, unlocks, secondary offerings). Aggressive treasury accumulation strategies, if pursued, can turbocharge upside when BTC rips, but they also magnify drawdowns. Crypto-equity history is littered with miners that over-extended during strong cycles and then wrestled with capex obligations and dilutive raises when prices cooled. Tokenomics (without a token). Because ABTC is an equity, not a coin, the “tokenomics” here are capital-markets mechanics: shares outstanding, cost of capital, future issuance, and BTC per share on the balance sheet. If management telegraphs a clear capital-allocation framework – how much to mine vs. buy, how much BTC to hold vs. sell for operating costs, what leverage is acceptable, the market will have anchors to model fair value instead of trading purely on vibes. Outcome scenarios. Media spectacle without follow-through: The American Bitcoin SPAC launch could grab headlines at first, but risk fizzling if operational disclosures disappoint or governance questions escalate. True institutional gateway: Clean reporting, competitive hashrate growth, prudent treasury policy, and a float that widens predictably, turning ABTC into a programmable, long-only-friendly BTC proxy alongside the ETFs. The next near-term waypoint is procedural: shareholder approvals and the closing of the merger – with company materials signaling an early-September start to trading, ticker ABTC.

The Solana-based memecoin's debut last week was part of a “YZY Money” ecosystem plan, which included payment rails and a branded card. On-chain data, however, suggests that insider and early wallets, combined with thin liquidity and rapid speculation, resulted in a launch where whales extracted millions, while the crowd shouldered nearly all of the losses. More than 51,800 addresses appear to have lost between $1 and $1,000, another 5,269 are down $1,000 to $10,000, and 1,025 wallets shed $10,000 to $100,000, according to Bubblemaps' data. At the top of the loss curve, 108 wallets are sitting on six-figure drawdowns, while three traders lost more than $1 million each. On the other side of the calculation, 11 addresses booked profit of $1 million or more, just 0.015% of the total. An estimated 99 wallets generated over $100,000, while 2,541 wallets cleared at least $1,000. The crowd as a whole is down some $8.2 million, despite some insiders pocketing substantial wins. So while 18,000 wallets technically profited, the concentration was brutal. The real money sat with the top 11, while the rest barely moved the needle. The lopsided distribution reflects the structural flaws flagged from day one, as CoinDesk noted in its earlier story. A full 70% of the supply was earmarked for Yeezy Investments LLC, locked under Jupiter’s vesting system, with only 20% sold to the public and 10% used for liquidity. The pool itself was seeded with YZY tokens alone without a stablecoin pair — a design that leaves the door open to sudden liquidity pulls, not unlike the short-lived LIBRA token promoted in Argentina in February. On-chain analysts identified wallets with early access. At the time of the issuance, address 6MNWV8 spent 450,611 USDC for 1.29 million YZY at $0.35, flipped 1.04 million tokens for 1.39 million USDC, and still holds roughly 249,907 YZY worth about $600,000 to make a quick $1.5 million profit. As of Thursday, YZY’s market cap has deflated to $544.9 million with $42.7 million in liquidity and 26,590 holders, down sharply from the initial frenzy that briefly saw valuations touted as high as $3 billion. Daily volume has slumped to $1.8 million, DEXTools data shows, a fraction of early activity. YZY’s performance closely mirrors that of many celebrity-based memecoins , where the chance of hitting life-changing gains is effectively zero unless you were already in on the inside.

A staggering 400,000,000 USDT, valued at approximately $400 million, moved from the leading exchange Binance to an unidentified wallet. This monumental transaction, flagged by the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, raises immediate questions and fuels speculation across the digital asset landscape. What does such a colossal movement signify for the market? What Triggered This Massive Binance USDT Transfer? On [Insert Date of Report, e.g., November 15th, 2023], Whale Alert, a popular blockchain transaction tracker, reported a colossal Binance USDT transfer . This isn’t just any transaction; it involves an enormous sum of Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Such large movements are often indicative of significant shifts in market sentiment or strategic plays by major investors, commonly referred to as ‘whales.’ The transfer of 400,000,000 USDT in a single go is a rare occurrence that commands attention. It highlights the sheer scale of capital moving within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For many, it immediately brings to mind potential impacts on market liquidity and stability. Who is Behind the Unknown Wallet Receiving the Binance USDT Transfer? The identity of the recipient wallet remains unknown, adding a layer of intrigue to this substantial Binance USDT transfer . In the transparent world of blockchain, while transactions are public, the entities behind the wallet addresses are often pseudonymous. This anonymity is a core feature of cryptocurrency but also sparks endless speculation when large sums are involved. Possible recipients of such a large transfer could include: Institutional Investors: Large hedge funds or investment firms making strategic moves. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: Facilitating large trades that wouldn’t impact exchange order books. Other Exchanges: A transfer to a different exchange for various reasons, such as arbitrage or new listing preparations. Cold Storage: A whale moving funds into secure, offline storage for long-term holding. Understanding the potential motives is key to interpreting the market’s reaction. Implications of a $400 Million Binance USDT Transfer A Binance USDT transfer of this magnitude can have several significant implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it could signal an intent to acquire other cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased buying pressure on assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Conversely, it could also represent funds being prepared for a large sell-off, though this is less likely if moved to an unknown wallet rather than an exchange. Moreover, such a large movement of stablecoins often impacts market liquidity. If the funds are moved to cold storage, it effectively removes them from active trading, potentially reducing the available supply of USDT on exchanges. This could, in theory, affect trading pairs involving USDT. Consider these points: Market Sentiment: Large whale movements can influence investor confidence. Liquidity Shift: Funds moving off-exchange can alter trading dynamics. Potential Investments: Preparing to deploy capital into other assets. These large transfers are a constant reminder of the significant capital flowing within the crypto space. How Does This Binance USDT Transfer Affect You? While a single Binance USDT transfer of $400 million might seem distant to the average retail investor, its ripple effects can touch everyone. Such events contribute to the overall narrative and sentiment of the market. For instance, if this transfer is followed by significant buying activity in specific altcoins, it could indicate emerging trends or a shift in whale strategy. It’s crucial for investors to monitor these large transactions, not as direct trading signals, but as indicators of broader market dynamics. They offer a glimpse into the actions of major players, which can sometimes precede significant price movements. Staying informed helps in making more educated decisions about your own crypto portfolio. In conclusion, the recent Binance USDT transfer of $400 million to an unknown wallet is a compelling event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives remain speculative, such movements are closely watched by analysts and investors alike. They remind us of the powerful forces at play and the continuous evolution of digital finance. Keeping an eye on these whale activities can provide valuable context, even if they don’t offer immediate actionable insights for every trader. Frequently Asked Questions About Large Crypto Transfers Q1: What is USDT? A1: USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar. This means one USDT is intended to always be worth one US dollar, making it a common choice for traders to hold value without converting to fiat currency. Q2: Why are large transfers like this Binance USDT transfer important to track? A2: Large transfers, often called ‘whale movements,’ are important because they can signal significant strategic decisions by major investors. These actions can sometimes precede market shifts, changes in liquidity, or new investment trends. Q3: Does this mean Binance is in trouble? A3: Not necessarily. A transfer from an exchange to an unknown wallet is a common occurrence. It simply means funds are moving out of the exchange’s hot wallet. It could be a user moving funds to cold storage, an OTC trade, or a transfer to another platform. Q4: What is an ‘unknown wallet’? A4: An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address whose owner has not been publicly identified or linked to a known entity (like an exchange or a major institution) by blockchain analytics services. The transaction itself is public, but the identity of the holder remains private. Q5: How can I track similar large transactions? A5: Services like Whale Alert, Etherscan, or other blockchain explorers allow you to track large transactions on various networks. Following crypto news outlets also keeps you informed about significant whale movements. What are your thoughts on this massive Binance USDT transfer?

Indeed, institutional demand has accelerated sharply in 2025, the result being that corporate treasuries now hold around 5% of the total supply. BlackRock and Fidelity , for instance, reported a 65% surge in assets under management last quarter alone. Large-scale buying hasn’t been limited to funds, however, as whale wallets have seen record-breaking activity too, one address accumulating more or less $3 billion in a week after selling BTC to fund the purchase. The additional surge in appetite this month was in part due to the weakening of Bitcoin , which shifted attention toward Ethereum due to its yield potential. Buying has also coincided with a price increase, as the cryptocurrency now sits above its 20-day moving average of $4,468, trading at $4,597 at the time of writing. ETH price.

Moves like this get everyone’s attention, especially when meme coin moves potentially tie into strategic positioning in utility-driven crypto. The investor in question might not just be playing the hype game. Instead, they appear to be aligning with long-term infrastructure, like the real-world payment project quietly capturing serious accumulation. Retail investors should pay attention; this isn’t just volatility, it’s volume with a plan. DOGE whale move: what’s behind the transfer? A $200 million DOGE transfer, which is about 900 million tokens, was routed to Binance, setting off a fresh wave of market chatter and volatility. The price dropped from $0.25 to test $0.22 support levels. Yet data shows whales actually bought over 680 million DOGE in August, hinting at accumulation; not necessarily sell-off. Experts hint that if Dogecoin price breaks above $0.23 it could go flying to new heights . Futures open interest fell 8%, signaling short-term trading fatigue. Analysts offer mixed takes: is this a setup for a rebound or just another meme-driven trap? Remittix: the strategic alternative gaining real support While DOGE whales stir the meme-coin pot, Remittix quietly wins over utility-focused investors and whales seeking tangible value. RTX solves cross-border payment friction through PayFi, offering fast, low-fee crypto-to-bank transactions. On-chain data shows Ethereum whales redirecting capital into RTX ahead of its Q3 2025 beta wallet launch. With over $21.6 million raised, a confirmed listing on BitMart, and more CEX listings in the works, Remittix is building real financial rails, not just hype. Why Remittix is gaining ground Global reach: send to bank accounts in 30+ countries Security first: audited by CertiK Wallet coming Q3: mobile-first with real-time FX conversion Business API to onboard merchants and freelancers Over $21.6 million raised and accelerating momentum $250,000 giveaway for holders RTX merges utility, design, and distribution in a way meme coins simply don’t. Its CertiK security audit, deflationary model, and 40+ crypto & 30+ fiat support set it up for mainstream use. When meme moves make headlines, smart money flows to Remittix The Dogecoin whale move raised eyebrows, but doesn’t necessarily spell market manipulation. It’s more likely that some of that capital is shading toward utility, like Remittix, which is a project anchored in practical payments infrastructure and real adoption. As meme coin volumes fade and utility-driven DeFi rises, consider that Remittix may not just be hype. It might be where smart holders are quietly placing their bets. Don’t just chase the meme, buy RTX token if you want exposure to infrastructure with function, roadmap, and institutional tailwinds.

PEPE and TRUMP coins are grabbing headlines, but a new altcoin, Remittix (RTX) , is turning heads for its real-world utility and huge upside potential. PEPE price news today shows caution for investors PEPE is currently trading at about $0.00001008. Data from Santiment shows that big investors, often called whales, are holding less of the coin. The number of wallets holding 100 million to 1 billion PEPE dropped from 41,506 on August 9 to 41,058. Similarly, wallets holding more than 1 billion PEPE fell from 9,815 to 9,725. Open interest on PEPE futures is also around $579.55 million , according to CoinGlass. Analysts say this means confidence is dropping. Still, some experts see a buying opportunity. If PEPE holds its current support range, it could reach $0.000014834, $0.000016352, and maybe even $0.000028417 in 2026. PEPE price news today remains focused on this support level as traders watch for a breakout. source: TIMELESS1_ on TradingView TRUMP Coin latest news highlights weak performance TRUMP coin is trading around $8.40. Canary Capital filed to list an ETF tracking TRUMP, letting investors bet on a politically charged meme token in a regulated way. But experts like Eric Balchunas question this, noting that ETFs usually require six months of futures data. Technical charts show a bearish Head & Shoulders pattern forming, which could limit gains. Models suggest TRUMP might stay between $10–$15 through 2025, depending on campaign news or media coverage. TRUMP coin latest news points to continued downside risk, as the token has already fallen about 80% from its all-time highs. source: axxxis666 on TradingView Why Remittix could be the altcoin to watch While PEPE and TRUMP face uncertainty, Remittix is building real-world infrastructure that could change the game. RTX is currently priced at $0.0987, with over 623 million tokens sold, raising more than $21.6 million. The project already announced its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart, and more listings are coming soon once it hits $22 million in raised funds. The Remittix Beta Wallet is set to launch on September 15, 2025, making it easier for investors to store and spend their tokens. Here’s why Remittix stands out: Real PayFi Use Case – Remittix is building a crypto-to-fiat payment system for everyday spending, not just speculation. Strong Investor Demand – Over 623 million tokens sold shows growing confidence and adoption. Upcoming BitMart Listing – The first centralized exchange listing is confirmed, boosting liquidity and visibility. Beta Wallet Launch – The Remittix wallet goes live on September 15, 2025, making transactions simple and fast. Massive Growth Potential – Analysts predict Remittix could rise over 5,500% as adoption and utility expand. Looking ahead: crypto choices for traders PEPE price news today signals that some traders may take profits or stay cautious. TRUMP coin latest news shows the token may struggle until major news events revive it. Meanwhile, Remittix is setting the stage for explosive gains, offering a rare opportunity to invest in a crypto with actual payments infrastructure.

PI’s price has rebounded by 7% in the last 24 hours, reaching $0.36. Disrupted Services in the Near Future? Just a few hours ago, the team behind Pi Network unveiled the release of a Linux Node version – a feature that the community has frequently requested for over the last few years. It is an application that allows Pioneers to run a blockchain node on a computer running the Linux operating system. “The highly requested Linux Node will provide standardized and easier infrastructure for partners and services,” the disclosure reads. The developers also lifted the curtain on the upcoming rollout of protocol upgrades that begin with Testnet1 this week and continue with Testnet2 and Mainnet upgrades in the following weeks. The initiative may potentially require planned outages of the blockchain services, which the team promised to announce in advance. “The protocol upgrades will enable functionalities including embedding KYC authority in the protocol that will maintain Pi as a KYC-verified blockchain while offering a more distributed, community-driven KYC process at the protocol level,” the X post concludes. Many community members praised the release of the Linux Node and the protocol upgrades, claiming they will make the ecosystem stronger . On the other hand, some labeled the initiatives as unnecessary at the moment due to remaining problems related to migration to the Mainnet and KYC verification. PI Finally in Green The aforementioned disclosure seems to have had a boosting effect on the price of Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency. Currently, PI trades at around $0.36 ( per CoinGecko’s data), representing a solid 7% increase on a daily scale . PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Recall that a few days ago, the asset’s price plummeted to a new all-time low of $0.33, while the multi-million token unlocks scheduled for the next 30 days and the increased exchange inflows suggested a further downtrend. Over the last 24 hours, however, the amount of PI coins stored on crypto exchanges decreased by approximately 1.7 million to around 415.7 million, which could be interpreted as a sign of relief for the bulls.

Two tokens drawing attention are Cardano (ADA) and Remittix (RTX) . While Cardano price leverage supports from a strong community and has seen active development, Remittix is gaining faster traction thanks to its rapid growth pre-launch and its exchange listing roadmap. Here’s a PayFi token widely spoken about as one of the year’s most promising low-cap altcoins. Cardano price battles volatility and bearish pressure Cardano price has been drifting around $0.84 following a brief boom earlier this month. Market data shows that ADA whale wallets are moving cautiously, and trading volume has reduced. Market experts point out that despite Cardano’s price still enjoying robust community support and ongoing protocol upgrades, growth stays restricted, unlike newer altcoins like Remittix. Source: Inspector Crypto on X (Twitter) While the project continues to expand its smart contracts and DeFi application developments, adoption is not thriving fast enough to cause the Cardano price to break out. For ADA holders watching the market closely, the sluggish momentum indicates that, unlike other tokens with active utility-backed growth, Cardano’s price might underperform. Experts back Remittix to deliver next 20x gains Remittix (RTX) is making a name for itself as the best crypto to buy now for investors seeking growth beyond traditional altcoins and hype. The project focuses on simplifying real-world PayFi processes, allowing users to transact across borders in crypto that settle instantly as local fiat. The project has already exceeded $21.6 million in funding, and BitMart has announced the first centralized exchange listing. Reports confirm that there will be another listing once Remittix hits $22 million in capital. Investors expect the next 20x profits from Remittix for various reasons: Actual utility for B2B and B2C payment processing. The PayFi model solves the core issues of cross-border transactions. Community-backed growth through active social engagement and buying pressure that keeps attracting long-term holders. Low entry price with massive room for growth. Analysts project rapid 20x gains with adoption rising. Upcoming exchange listings will boost liquidity and accessibility for the Remittix (RTX) DeFi project. With numerous catalysts backing this PayFi sensation, Remittix is gaining momentum that Cardano price currently lacks. With more whale wallets and institutional investors accumulating, there’s increasing confidence in this altcoin’s potential to deliver 20x gains.

50808708,567584,1756374646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50808708.jpeg,BlackRock Poised to Become Top $BTC and $ETH Custodian as Bitcoin Hyper Presale Targets $12.5M,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-surges-as-blackrock-etfs-increase-btc-eth-custody/,"BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) could soon position it as the top custodian of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. The company is nipping at the heels of Binance, which currently holds the number one spot. Prices of these coins could continue to rise as more ETFs and institutional investors stockpile them. This could see Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) get a boost from investors looking to take advantage of the speed and low transaction costs of its planned Bitcoin Layer 2. BlackRock Accelerates $BTC, $ETH Accumulation Over the past several months, BlackRock’s $BTC and $ETH ETFs have massively increased their coins in custody. Based on Arkham data , its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF’s holdings grew from only 1.1M $ETH in January to 3.6M $ETH today. Meanwhile, it expanded its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF’s $BTC holdings from 228K at the start of the year to its present 745.5K. This rapid accumulation of the top two coins has brought BlackRock’s ETFs much closer to the current leaders Binance (626.2K $BTC, 4.3M $ETH) and Coinbase (977.2K $BTC, 5.1M $ETH). In addition, continued whale buys of these cryptocurrencies continue to reduce their liquid supply, which helps push their prices higher. Higher prices, naturally, increase the attractiveness of the coins, so more traders buy or hold them. This also shines a light on projects that build upon their respective chains, especially if they make transactions cheaper or expand a coin’s utility. Bitcoin Hyper: Building the Next Phase of the Bitcoin Ecosystem As the world’s top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to attract investors of all sizes. However, it’s bogged down by fundamental issues such as slow transactions, which contribute to high fees. Also, $BTC has limited applications since it can’t be used for staking or interacting with dApps. Fixing this isn’t a simple matter of rewriting Bitcoin’s underlying code, as that would weaken its security. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. This project aims to create a Bitcoin Layer 2, which should bring Solana-level speeds, low transaction costs, and expanded utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Think of it as a fast lane to Bitcoin’s heavily congested Layer 1. When launched, you’ll be able to send your $BTC to the L2 via a Canonical Bridge. This creates a wrapped $BTC of the same value on the L2. You can then use this for things $BTC couldn’t do before, like trading and staking. This high-speed environment is powered by a Solana Virtual Machine, which makes transactions significantly faster and cheaper than on the L1. To ensure that the actual amount and value of your $BTC is up to date, the L2 regularly synchronizes with the L1. Then, if you want to bring your coin back to the base layer, simply withdraw it, and it will be sent to your Bitcoin wallet address. To learn more about the project, check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ page. Bitcoin Hyper has the potential to change the Bitcoin ecosystem for the better, which has seen it raise nearly $12.5M to date and become one of this year’s best presales to invest in . To get your $HYPER tokens, go to the official presale website or buy them via the Best Wallet app . Each one only costs $0.012815, making it a cheap and potentially profitable way to invest in the future of Bitcoin. For more information, you can read our detailed guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . Staking is another option if you want to earn passive income from your $HYPER tokens. When you do, you’ll enjoy rewards at 89% p.a. If you’re more of a long-term investor, Bitcoin Hyper’s promise as a Layer 2 could potentially result in healthy gains. Based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , it could be worth as much as $1.50 by 2030 when the project fully matures. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Will ETFs and Institutional Investors Send Bitcoin and Ethereum to Hyperspace? Growing interest from institutions like BlackRock is a boon for top cryptocurrencies like $BTC and $ETH. In effect, they reduce the number of coins circulating in the market, making them scarcer and therefore more expensive. The rapid accumulation of these coins also attracts attention to projects that build upon the base blockchains. A good example is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has raised nearly $12.5M to date for its planned Bitcoin Layer 2. Disclaimer: Do your own research.

Whale accumulation is building, with wallets holding between 1M–10M XRP now accounting for more than 10% of supply. Still, muted network growth and low funding rates point to caution as the XRP price tests the pivotal $3.00 level, a breakout that could reignite momentum toward its $3.66 high. At the same time, some investors are diversifying into Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi altcoin gaining traction for its real-world utility as XRP and BTC consolidate. XRP price outlook strengthens The XRP price is supported by technicals with RSI rebounding from oversold conditions and the 50-day EMA near $2.94 in focus. Bulls must secure a close above $3.00 to confirm strength, while failure risks dragging the XRP price back toward $2.75 support. Ripple’s US banking ambitions add a fundamental layer, though sentiment hinges on whether adoption and whale activity can offset weaker address growth. For many traders, the coming sessions will be critical in deciding whether the XRP price sustains its rebound or slips back into consolidation. A confirmed break above $3.00 could reestablish bullish momentum and open the path toward $3.40–$3.66, but lingering weakness in network growth keeps caution in play. Meanwhile, investors looking beyond short-term charts are rotating into utility-driven projects like Remittix, highlighting how adoption narratives are starting to shape capital flows alongside traditional technical signals. BTC faces fragile support Meanwhile, BTC trades around $110,829 after slipping under $109,000 during last week’s selloff tied to ETF outflows and cautious positioning before Jackson Hole. Recovery above the 100-day EMA has been fragile, with volume weakness and the fear/greed index at 47 showing investor indecision. A decisive break below $110,850 could expose $108,700, while upside is capped near $113,500. For now, BTC consolidation highlights the broader uncertainty facing top assets. Why Remittix is on the radar of BTC holders While traders debate near-term moves in the XRP price and BTC, attention is shifting to adoption-driven projects like Remittix . Priced at $0.0987 with over 623M tokens sold, Remittix is building PayFi rails to route crypto directly into fiat bank accounts across 30+ countries. A BitMart listing is confirmed, a second CEX reveal is planned at $22M, and its Q3 wallet beta will support 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. What makes Remittix stand out Flat, transparent fees with real-time FX quotes Merchant-ready Remittix Pay API for invoices and checkout Privacy-first flow where recipients see only fiat bank transfers Utility-first design attracting BTC and altcoin holders seeking real-world use Conclusion The XRP price reclaiming $3 and BTC defending $110,850 support both matter for near-term sentiment. Yet, for those seeking long-term growth, Remittix offers the clearest utility play. By bridging crypto to global banking, it explains why thousands of BTC and XRP holders are rotating into this PayFi altcoin as one of the most compelling growth stories in 2025.

Specifically, a staggering 200,000,000 USDT transfer to Aave from an unknown wallet has been reported by Whale Alert. This transaction, valued at approximately $200 million, signals a significant event within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. What does such a massive influx of stablecoin mean for Aave, and what are the broader implications for the crypto market? Understanding the Enormous USDT Transfer to Aave When we talk about a ‘whale’ in the crypto world, we are referring to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. A ‘whale alert’ signifies a large transaction that often warrants closer examination due to its potential market impact. In this instance, the USDT transfer to Aave involves 200 million units of Tether, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Aave is a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It allows users to lend out their crypto assets to earn interest or borrow by providing collateral. The arrival of such a large sum of USDT into Aave’s liquidity pools can have various ripple effects, influencing everything from lending rates to market sentiment. Why is This Specific USDT Transfer to Aave So Significant? A $200 million deposit is not an everyday occurrence, even in the fast-paced world of DeFi. This particular USDT transfer to Aave stands out for several reasons: Increased Liquidity: The immediate impact is a significant boost in Aave’s liquidity. More USDT available means more capital for borrowers and potentially more stable interest rates for lenders. Market Confidence: A large deposit from an ‘unknown wallet’ could indicate a major institutional player or a high-net-worth individual is gaining confidence in Aave’s platform and the broader DeFi space. Potential for Yield: The whale might be seeking to earn yield on their substantial USDT holdings, leveraging Aave’s lending mechanisms. This move suggests a strategic financial decision. Potential Impacts on Aave and the DeFi Ecosystem What could this substantial USDT transfer to Aave mean for the protocol itself and the wider DeFi landscape? The implications are multifaceted: For Aave: Enhanced Stability: Increased liquidity in USDT pools can lead to greater stability in lending and borrowing rates for this specific asset. Attracting More Users: Such a large deposit might attract other users, both lenders and borrowers, who see the deep liquidity as a sign of a robust and reliable platform. Governance Influence: If the unknown wallet holds Aave governance tokens, this move could potentially signal an intention to participate more actively in the protocol’s future decisions. For DeFi: Validation of Protocols: Major transactions like this validate the operational efficiency and security of established DeFi protocols like Aave, reinforcing trust in decentralized finance. Stablecoin Dominance: It underscores the critical role stablecoins play in DeFi, acting as a bridge for large capital movements and a stable store of value within volatile markets. What Are the Broader Implications of a Large USDT Transfer to Aave? Beyond Aave itself, a USDT transfer to Aave of this magnitude can spark wider discussions and observations. Is this a precursor to increased institutional involvement in DeFi? Or is it simply a large investor optimizing their capital for yield? While the identity of the ‘unknown wallet’ remains a mystery, the move highlights the transparency inherent in blockchain transactions. Anyone can observe these movements, even if the parties involved remain pseudonymous. This transparency is a core tenet of decentralized finance. Navigating Whale Movements: Actionable Insights for Investors Observing significant transactions, such as this USDT transfer to Aave , can provide valuable insights. However, it is crucial to interpret them with caution. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Liquidity: Keep an eye on liquidity pools for assets you hold or plan to interact with. High liquidity can mean better rates and lower slippage. Understand Market Dynamics: Large stablecoin deposits can sometimes precede significant market moves, as whales might be positioning themselves for future opportunities. Diversify and Research: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Always conduct thorough research before investing in any DeFi protocol or cryptocurrency. The 200,000,000 USDT transfer to Aave is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the decentralized finance world. It underscores the growing confidence in established protocols like Aave and the increasing sophistication of capital deployment within the crypto ecosystem. While the specific motivations behind this whale’s move remain speculative, its impact on Aave’s liquidity and the broader DeFi narrative is undeniable. It’s a testament to the ongoing maturation of decentralized financial services. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Aave? Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to earn passive income, while borrowers can obtain loans by offering collateral. 2. What is USDT (Tether)? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This means its value is intended to remain stable at $1, making it a popular choice for traders and investors seeking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. 3. What does ‘unknown wallet’ mean in a crypto transaction? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or linked to a specific individual or entity. While the transaction is transparent on the blockchain, the owner’s identity remains private. 4. How does a large USDT transfer to Aave affect interest rates? A large USDT transfer to Aave significantly increases the supply of USDT available for lending. According to Aave’s dynamic interest rate model, an increased supply typically leads to lower borrowing rates and potentially lower lending rates, assuming demand remains constant. 5. Is a whale transfer always a positive sign? While a large deposit often indicates confidence, it’s not always exclusively positive. Such large movements can also signal an intention to borrow heavily, potentially impacting utilization rates, or even a precursor to withdrawal, which could decrease liquidity.

Derivatives volume rank Bitget among the top four global exchanges Between November 2023 and June 2025, Bitget processed a cumulative $11.5 trillion in derivatives trading volume, placing it among the top four global exchanges. Average monthly volumes reached $750 billion in 2025, nearly 90% of which came from derivatives. Even amid subdued market conditions, the report noted that Bitget has emerged as a structurally important venue characterized by scale, consistency, and rising institutional participation. In the first half of 2025, institutions accounted for 80% of spot trading and 50% of derivatives volume on Bitget, contributing to a doubling of assets under management. CoinDesk attributed this shift to Bitget’s upgraded offerings, including its Liquidity Incentive Program, institutional lending products, and an upcoming unified margin system. The report also highlighted the performance of Bitget’s native BGB token, which ranked as the third-most traded spot asset after Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). BGB helped drive the exchange’s spot market share to a record 5.2% in May, with BTC, ETH, and BGB together making up 44% of total spot activity. On liquidity, Bitget was ranked the top exchange for ETH and Solana ( SOL ) depth, and second for BTC spot liquidity within 1% of the mid-price. Average slippage for $100,000 Bitcoin trades was recorded at 0.0074%, placing the exchange among the top three globally for execution quality. “We’ve been deliberate about how we scale, we deliver world-class products, and provide one of the strongest security infrastructures. From retail to institutional, people are looking for quality and safety,” said Gracy Chen, Chief Executive Officer at Bitget. “This report validates what we’ve known internally: institutions are here, and they choose to trust Bitget.” CoinDesk further noted that Bitget’s launch of its Onchain platform in April 2025 helped boost spot volumes by 32% month-on-month. The report also pointed to Bitget’s leadership in XRP derivatives, strong presence across Layer-1 and memecoin markets, and its hybrid on-chain/off-chain liquidity model.

Yet many of those same investors are now moving capital into a fresh altcoin, Remittix , with hopes of exponential returns. It’s an infrastructure-first pick investors believe could pop while Chainlink’s momentum cools. Chainlink Is Cooling Off Even as Accumulation Signals Linger Chainlink recently surged after a wave of whale-led accumulation, but smart investors converted profits after that rally. Chainlink’s price pushed into the mid $20s, supported by significant on-chain activity. Over $16 million in LINK was withdrawn from exchanges by a known trader, signaling a shift into long-term holding despite short-term gains and a 12 % price bump. Whale activity also hit a 7-day high, with accumulation five times above the norm and MVRV turning positive, hinting at renewed long-term confidence. Still, short-term traders view this as a moment to book gains, not chase the next move. A recent slowdown under $24 forced many to reallocate capital. Chainlink’s structure suggests it remains valuable, but momentum traders are now seeking faster payoff elsewhere, turning attention toward newer, utility-rich projects. Remittix Emerges as the Altcoin Alternative with Built-in Utility and Launch Traction Investors who just banked profits on LINK now see Remittix as the altcoin with potential for 5,000 % gains. Remittix has sold over 622 million tokens, trades at $0.0987, and has raised $21.6 million, a clear sign of investor interest and traction. Remittix’s BitMart listing was revealed once $20 million had been raised, giving it instant access to liquidity and visibility. A second CEX reveal will follow once $22 million is raised. A $250,000 giveaway is active to engage early users, and the Q3 wallet beta launch is imminent, offering crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Here is why Remittix stands out: Wallet beta launches this quarter (Q3 2025) Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Ideal for freelancers, remitters, and global earners These milestones position Remittix for explosive growth. Analysts argue its utility-first approach could spark a 50× to 100× rally in the coming months, while Chainlink gets overshadowed by fast-moving infrastructure plays. Chainlink Made Gains; Now Remittix Holds the Spotlight for Fast Upside Chainlink’s price gains attracted profit-taking and active accumulation, but savvy investors are rotating into Remittix for greater immediate upside. Chainlink remains a core DeFi infrastructure token with solid follow-through potential. Meanwhile, Remittix is delivering real products, funding, and accessibility, all ingredients some believe are primed for a viral breakout and outsized return in the months ahead.

Recently, a significant USDT transfer to Aave caught the attention of market observers. Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported an astonishing 200,000,000 USDT—equivalent to approximately $200 million—moving from an undisclosed wallet directly into Aave, one of the largest lending protocols in the crypto space. This substantial transaction immediately raises questions about its origins and potential impact. What Just Happened? The USDT Transfer to Aave Explained Blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert confirmed a colossal transaction: 200 million USDT shifted from an unknown address straight to Aave. This isn’t just a casual transfer; it represents a monumental sum entering a key DeFi protocol. Such a large USDT transfer to Aave typically signals significant strategic intent from the wallet owner, often referred to as a ‘whale’ due to their substantial holdings. This single transaction, valued at a staggering $200 million, highlights the immense capital flows within the crypto ecosystem. It underscores the growing importance of stablecoins like USDT in facilitating large-scale financial operations within decentralized networks. Why Does a Large USDT Transfer to Aave Matter? Aave stands as a cornerstone of decentralized finance, enabling users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. A USDT transfer to Aave of this magnitude can have several profound implications: Increased Liquidity: The influx of $200 million USDT significantly boosts Aave’s liquidity pool, making it easier for others to borrow USDT. This can lead to more efficient markets and potentially lower borrowing costs. Potential for Lending: The sender might be looking to earn interest by lending out their USDT, capitalizing on Aave’s attractive yield opportunities. This passive income strategy is common among large asset holders. Strategic Positioning: This move could precede larger financial maneuvers within the DeFi ecosystem, such as leveraging, yield farming, or even collateralizing other assets for further investments. Market Confidence: A large institutional or whale deposit can signal strong confidence in Aave’s security, stability, and profitability, potentially attracting more users and capital to the platform. Who is Behind This Mysterious USDT Transfer to Aave ? The identity of the ‘unknown wallet’ remains a central mystery, sparking widespread speculation across the crypto community. While we cannot pinpoint the exact owner, such a significant USDT transfer to Aave could originate from several types of entities: An Institutional Investor: Large financial firms are increasingly exploring DeFi, using protocols like Aave for treasury management, hedging strategies, or investment allocations. A High-Net-Worth Individual (Whale): A single wealthy investor might be optimizing their crypto portfolio, seeking higher yields or preparing for future trades based on market analysis. An Exchange or OTC Desk: Sometimes, centralized exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks move large sums to manage liquidity, facilitate client trades, or rebalance their reserves. A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): A DAO might be deploying its treasury assets to generate revenue for its community or fund specific projects within its ecosystem. What Are the Broader Market Implications of This USDT Transfer to Aave ? Beyond Aave itself, this monumental USDT transfer to Aave could ripple through the broader crypto market. While not a direct price driver for volatile assets, it highlights the growing utility and trust in stablecoins and DeFi protocols. This transaction serves as a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of digital finance. Stablecoin Dominance: It reinforces USDT’s role as a primary stablecoin for large-scale DeFi operations, emphasizing its liquidity and widespread acceptance across various protocols. DeFi Maturation: Such large transactions underscore the increasing sophistication and capital flowing into decentralized finance, moving it further into the mainstream financial consciousness. Attention on Aave: The move brings renewed attention to Aave, potentially boosting its Total Value Locked (TVL) and solidifying its market position as a leading lending platform. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Investor For those keen on navigating the crypto landscape, this USDT transfer to Aave offers valuable lessons and actionable insights: Monitor Whale Movements: Tracking large transactions can provide insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Tools like Whale Alert are invaluable for staying informed. Understand DeFi Protocols: Familiarize yourself with how platforms like Aave function. Knowing their mechanics helps you interpret significant liquidity shifts and their potential effects. Consider Stablecoin Strategies: Large stablecoin deposits into lending protocols suggest a demand for yield. Explore stablecoin lending opportunities yourself, if they align with your risk appetite and investment goals. Stay Informed: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Staying updated on major transactions and protocol developments is crucial for informed decision-making and adapting to new opportunities. The 200 million USDT transfer to Aave from an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a testament to the dynamic and evolving nature of decentralized finance. It underscores the immense capital flowing into DeFi, the strategic maneuvers of large holders, and the increasing trust placed in robust protocols like Aave. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to mature, such whale movements will remain critical indicators of market health and future trends, inviting both speculation and careful observation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDT? USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1. It is widely used in the crypto market for trading, lending, and as a store of value due to its stability. What is Aave? Aave is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on various blockchains. It allows users to lend out their crypto assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral, all without traditional financial intermediaries. Why is a $200 million USDT transfer significant? A $200 million transfer is significant because it represents a substantial amount of capital. Such large movements can impact liquidity, signal strategic moves by major players (whales), and reflect confidence in the receiving protocol or the broader DeFi ecosystem. Who is an “unknown wallet” or “whale”? An “unknown wallet” refers to a blockchain address whose owner has not been publicly identified. A “whale” is a term for an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics with their transactions. How can I track similar large transactions? You can track large cryptocurrency transactions using blockchain analytics services like Whale Alert, Etherscan (for Ethereum-based tokens), or other similar platforms that monitor significant movements across various blockchains.

The difference between tokens that fade and tokens that rally during these conditions lies in whether they generate real, reliable demand. This week, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing serious whale attention because its framework is not built on speculation alone. Instead, it will combine a $1 stablecoin designed with governance-controlled interest rates, mtToken staking within designated smart contracts, and a buyback system that will continuously recycle protocol revenue into open-market MUTM purchases for redistribution. Whale Accumulation Signals Institutional Confidence Institutions and whales often ask why is crypto going up during broad market runs, and the answer usually comes down to demand flows. Unlike speculative assets like XRP or MATIC that depend on sentiment cycles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will anchor its demand through lending and borrowing activity. Large suppliers will provide liquidity to the pools, and the interest generated will feed both lenders and the buyback engine. For instance, a whale allocating $120,000 in USDT into the P2C model at 10.5% APY will earn $12,600 annually, fully tracked through mtUSDT. On the other side, a borrower posting $60,000 worth of BTC at a 68% loan-to-value ratio will unlock $40,800 in liquidity without selling their position, preserving exposure to upside while tapping cash flow. These are the kinds of balanced mechanics institutions prefer, and it is why capital has been shifting into MUTM rather than into older names like XRP or MATIC. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $1 stablecoin will also play a key role for risk-conscious allocators. It will only be minted against collateral, burned on repayment, and supported by governance-managed interest rates that will adjust to hold parity. Arbitrage opportunities and liquidation safeguards will reinforce the peg. This means whales will not just be chasing yield — they will be operating in an environment with mechanisms they already recognize from traditional finance, adapted into DeFi. It is exactly the kind of system that aligns with the diligence institutional allocators demand. Presale Momentum and the Trade Case In the middle of this structure sits the presale, which is already showing how whales are positioning. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 at $0.035, with roughly $15.02 million raised and 27% of supply sold to more than 15,750 holders. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens, and Phase 7 is set to increase the price to $0.040. With a CertiK audit delivering scores of 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet, plus a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway program, the security angle is already front and center. Whales understand that these price steps are designed to reward early entries. One large buyer who rotated $50,000 out of MATIC during Phase 2 at $0.015 now sits at 2.33x at today’s $0.035 Phase 6 pricing. Unlike MATIC, which has traded sideways while institutions wait on the next crypto etf approval to inject demand, this same allocation in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has produced immediate upside on paper and is aligned with future catalysts. The upcoming beta launch, multi-chain expansion, and liquidity depth from expected exchange listings are preparing the ground for significant upward repricing. Final Verdict For whales and institutional allocators, the story is not just the current multiple but what is about to unfold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will channel lending revenue directly into open-market token purchases, and in volatile environments, that constant buy pressure will intensify. Combined with mtToken staking rewards (in MUTM) and redistribution, the mechanics point to sustainable, programmatic demand. The next market squeeze will reward tokens with these built-in demand drivers rather than assets that rely only on headlines. Large buyers looking for the best crypto to invest are already acting. With Phase 6 closing in on its cap, access at $0.035 will not remain open long. The next price step is higher, and whales understand that the window to secure size before institutional onboarding accelerates is shrinking quickly. Traders wondering why is crypto going up will eventually see the flows once listings go live — but those entering now with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will already be positioned.

50808972,567401,1756375218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50808972.jpeg,Dogecoin Network Gears Up Against Upcoming Attack: Here’s How,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gears-up-against-upcoming-attack/,"The core Dogecoin community is signaling a coordinated defense posture after a week of escalating chatter that the AI-driven Qubic collective—which recently targeted Monero—has “voted” to make DOGE its next proof-of-work stress test. From the official DOGE account (@dogecoin) came a pointed nudge: “Could this be due to certain parts of the community mobilizing to protect against some possible threats? Like something that happened to Monero recently? Hmm…”. The post came in response to crypto analyst KrissPax who shared on X late Wednesday: “BREAKING: Dogecoin Hashrate has just hit an all time high!” Is The Dogecoin Network Prepared? The immediate catalyst is Qubic’s community poll two weeks ago to focus its resources on DOGE next, following its Monero campaign. Analysts framed the ballot as a direct threat to DOGE, though Qubic’s messaging alternated between “attack” rhetoric and claims it merely intends to “mine for profit.” Former IOTA co-founder and Qubic leader Sergey Ivancheglo, aka Come-from-Beyond (CFB), posted on August 18 via X: “It’s becoming ridiculous, the Qubic community voted on *mining* Dogecoin, not on *attacking* it…,” adding “preparation to mining Dogecoin requires months of development, the Qubic pool is mining Monero during this period.” What is uncontested is that Qubic marshaled enough coordinated hashpower to rattle Monero and then publicly named DOGE as its next proving ground. Context matters: During the attack , there was an alleged six-block reorganization on the Monero blockchain, orphaning around 60 blocks. However, it’s debated whether Qubic’s action qualified as a successful 51% attack. Nevertheless, Kraken paused XMR deposits as a precaution when the single pool supposedly crossed 50% of hashrate, then re-enabled deposits under a stringent 720-block confirmation regime—an extraordinary friction cost meant to blunt the risk of chain reorganizations. Against that backdrop, Dogecoin’s raw compute power surged. Depending on the estimator and sampling window, DOGE’s Scrypt hashrate pushed to fresh records on Wednesday. BitInfoCharts tracker showed intraday read a new all-time high at 2.948 PH/s. The directional takeaway is clear: miners are pointing more Scrypt ASIC horsepower at DOGE right now than at any prior time. Structural factors also cut differently for DOGE than for Monero. Since 2014, Dogecoin has shared security with Litecoin via auxiliary proof-of-work (merged mining), meaning the same Scrypt ASIC fleets that secure LTC can simultaneously commit Dogecoin blocks. That broadened miner base and the industrial-scale nature of Scrypt ASICs raise the bar for any would-be majority attacker—one reason a direct 51% campaign on DOGE is much harder than on a CPU-oriented chain like Monero’s RandomX. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin 51% Attack|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Qubic,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|XMR|MINING|LTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 10:00:18

Analysts Say It’s Still Possible,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/160k-bitcoin-by-christmas-analysts-say-its-still-possible/,"Bitcoin slid to levels not seen since early July this week, but some analysts say the drop may be only a short pause before a bigger year-end move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For Triple Surge Vs. Bitcoin – Details September has a long record of being the weakest month for BTC, and historically it has never closed more than 8% higher. That context is shaping how traders and researchers read the charts now. Expert’s Timing And Historic Averages According to research from network economist Timothy Peterson, there are four months until Christmas and history favors gains in that window. Peterson posted on X that Bitcoin has been higher over the same four-month span 70% of the time, and the average gain he calculated was +44%. Based on that average, Bitcoin would trade near $160,000 by the last week of 2025. Peterson also warned that the calculation is more of a guideline than a promise. Exactly Four Months Until Christmas. How does Bitcoin fare during this time? Up 70% of the time. Average gain +44%. However I think some years do not have market/economic conditions comparable to 2025. I would exclude 2018, 2022, 2020, and 2017 as uncharacteristic years.… pic.twitter.com/0llPeTrilC — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) August 25, 2025 He suggested excluding certain years—2018, 2022, 2020, and 2017—because those years did not match what he calls comparable market conditions, and removing them tilts the result toward steadier, more positive returns. Markets rarely follow neat averages. Even when a long-term pattern appears, short bursts of volatility still happen. Peterson’s note about excluding specific years acknowledges that reality. It is a reminder that averages smooth over big swings. BTC… 👓 We’re just front-running the “September sell off”. The scale is different — but the outcome is the same. Much higher. pic.twitter.com/3oZqRlrtgv — Donny (@DonnyDicey) August 27, 2025 Traders See Familiar Patterns Some traders on X described the current price behavior as a repeat of past seasonal moves. According to Trader Donny, Bitcoin is “front-running” the usual September lull and could move significantly higher afterward. He compared the present action to 2017 and suggested that BTC might be mirroring gold, catching up after a period of lag. That comparison to gold has been made before; it is a shorthand for assets that sometimes trade out of sync and then align again as macro forces change. For now, price action looks like a pause, not a breakdown. Outlook Through Year End Based on reports and the numbers involved, the coming months will be an important test of whether past four-month rallies repeat themselves. An average +44% move would be a big swing if it materializes, yet averages do not guarantee one outcome. For traders and investors, that means balancing the historical pattern with the real-time risks that have pushed BTC back to July levels. Related Reading: Could Pi Network Land On Coinbase?

The emphasis on immediacy in his speech suggested that he views the current period as favorable for market entry, particularly highlighting short-term gains.

In response, KINGVALEX clarified , “He said ripple cause he thought RIPPLE was XRP obviously. Which is CLEARLY WHY the people yelled out XRP. It’s COMMON SENSE.” The reply stressed that Big Sean was likely referring to XRP when he mentioned Ripple, a common occurrence among those less familiar with the technical differences.

They remarked , “First it was bankers. Then governments. Now artists? The signal is loud.

Arthur Hayes first touched on the importance of stablecoins, saying they are key to re-establishing the dominance of the US dollar. At this point, Hayes stated that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will utilize stablecoins to reduce the fiscal deficit and strengthen the dominance of the US dollar. Hayes argued in his blog post that declining confidence in the dollar since the 2008 financial crisis has led central banks to favor gold and reduced demand for U.S. Treasury bonds. To counter this, Hayes said he predicts Bessent will use stablecoins to encourage individual investors, rather than central banks, to buy U.S. government bonds. Hayes, who stated that Bessent’s strategy of using stablecoins will ultimately direct trillions of dollars into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, also predicts that it will lead to a boom in the decentralized finance (DeFi) field. Big Rise in Three Altcoins! Hayes, who recently resumed buying altcoins following Ethereum's explosive rise, also listed the altcoins he expects to rise. Accordingly, Hayes, who recently stated that he expected a 126-fold increase in the altcoin called HYPE, stated that this prediction is still valid. Stating that he also expects an increase for Ethena (ENA) and Ether.fi (ETHFI), Hayes predicted that ENA and ETHFI will increase 51 times and 34 times, respectively, by 2028. Hayes recently stated that the stablecoin project he is most excited about is Codex, which will be the first true cryptocurrency bank. *This is not investment advice.

This signal comes at a time when BTC is trading at just over $113,000 and hovering above key support levels, even though it is showing cracks in market momentum. On-Chain Metrics Paint a Cautious Picture In an August 28 post on X, analyst JA_Maartun highlighted the Bitcoin Bull Score’s worrying level, saying it was “something to take seriously.” According to him, a score of 20 is bearish, implying that the fundamental conditions supporting the current bull run are deteriorating. His assessment is similar to observations from other analysts like Axel Adler Jr., who, on his part, noted that the market was balanced on the edge of bearish territory, with an integral index of 43% sitting just below a key 45% threshold. He characterized the current state as a “soft” bearishness, where the market could tip back to neutral with a few hours of positive derivatives flows, but without that, it faces a scenario of technical bounces rather than a powerful upward reversal. Further analysis from Glassnode points to a key support band between $107,000 and $108,900. According to the firm, a break below this level could open the door for a deeper pullback toward $93,000. This cautious outlook from on-chain signals clashes with some cycle theories that foresee more gains. Previously, market watcher Cryptobirb projected that the current bull run is 93% complete and could peak between late October and mid-November of 2025. However, the traditional four-year cycle narrative has been questioned in some quarters, with several analysts debating whether this pattern is breaking down. One theory suggests money is no longer predictably rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum to altcoins, but is instead creating “isolated mini-cycles.” This fundamental shift in market structure could mean the old cycle rules no longer apply. Meanwhile, there is some more data supporting the bearish case. For instance, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio’s 30-day moving average recently fell to a seven-year low below 0.98, suggesting that sell orders are overwhelmingly surpassing buy orders. This is a dynamic that has often come before a significant price drop. Price Action Looking at the market, BTC’s immediate price action shows a 24-hour gain of 2.14% to take it to $113,094. However, while it has dropped by less than 1% over seven days, there has been more noticeable instability over longer timeframes, with the OG cryptocurrency shedding 8.2% in the last two weeks, and nearly 5% across the month. It is currently sitting 9.1% below its recent all-time high of $124,457, and its trading range for the last seven days, between $109,214 and $117,016, suggests the market may be searching for direction.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin’s sharp jump from around $108K to above $113K in just three days is a massive show of strength by the OG crypto, signaling that it wants to extend its bull run. The token has reclaimed the 100 EMA on the daily chart. This is significant because the last time $BTC interacted with this moving average, it went on to hit new all-time highs. Even better, there’s no shortage of confluence. From the current level acting as a key support zone to the token rejecting the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on the weekly chart, all signs point toward a fresh leg up for Bitcoin. That said, for $BTC to fully shake off its temporary downward momentum, it needs to break and hold above $117,390, aka the most recent swing high. If it does, Bitcoin could be nicely set up for a potential run to new ATHs, representing at least a 10% gain from current levels. Put National Budget On-Chain, Philippine Senator Proposes: Bitcoin Hyper Rises as a Best Investment in this Context August 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The Philippines could be the first country in the world to put its national budget on a blockchain if the proposal of one of its senators pushes through. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV shared this suggestion during yesterday’s session at the Manila Tech Summit. While no concrete plans have been made to implement this, having a country’s budget on-chain could provide transparency and combat corruption, as it ensures records are validated, immutable, and verifiable. The move could also increase the adoption of blockchain technology among citizens, as it would encourage them to interact with the tech to see how their government is spending their hard-earned tax money. Moreover, governments could eventually switch to using blockchain tech for payments (e.g., taxes), similar to how some tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will be used to pay for gas fees and other transaction fees within their respective ecosystems.

For crypto enthusiasts and investors, a weakening dollar often signals a potential bullish tailwind, making the growing September rate cut expectations a topic of paramount importance. As the world’s reserve currency faces significant headwinds, understanding these dynamics is not just for forex traders but for anyone navigating the intricate dance of global finance, including the burgeoning digital asset space. Why is the US Dollar Under Pressure Right Now? The mighty US Dollar, a bedrock of international trade and finance, finds itself at a pivotal juncture. Several factors are converging to exert downward pressure, prompting investors to re-evaluate its immediate and long-term trajectory. This isn’t a sudden development but rather the culmination of evolving economic indicators and shifting global sentiment. Economic Data and Softening Inflation A primary driver behind the dollar’s recent weakness is the consistent stream of economic data suggesting a cooling US economy and a steady deceleration in inflation. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes over the past couple of years were designed to curb soaring prices, and it appears those efforts are yielding results. Key indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, have shown a trend towards the central bank’s 2% target. Cooling Labor Market: While still robust, the US labor market has shown signs of softening. Job growth, though positive, has moderated, and wage growth, while healthy, is not accelerating at a pace that would reignite inflation fears. This provides the Fed with more flexibility. Retail Sales and Consumer Spending: Recent retail sales figures have indicated a more cautious consumer, suggesting that higher interest rates are beginning to bite into discretionary spending. A less exuberant consumer typically translates to lower inflationary pressures. Manufacturing and Services PMIs: While some sectors show resilience, overall manufacturing activity has remained subdued, and the services sector, though stronger, is also experiencing some moderation. Interest Rate Differentials and Global Central Banks Another crucial element contributing to the US Dollar under pressure is the narrowing gap in interest rate differentials. For a significant period, the Federal Reserve led the charge in raising rates, making the dollar an attractive currency for yield-seeking investors. However, other major central banks are now catching up or even hinting at more hawkish stances: European Central Bank (ECB): The ECB has maintained a relatively hawkish tone, keeping rates high to combat persistent inflation in the Eurozone. This has provided support for the Euro, which accounts for a significant portion of the Dollar Index (DXY). Bank of England (BoE): The BoE has also been grappling with stubborn inflation, maintaining elevated rates, which props up the British Pound. Bank of Japan (BoJ): While the BoJ has historically been an outlier with its ultra-loose monetary policy, there are growing expectations that it might begin to normalize policy, which could strengthen the Yen and further weigh on the dollar. As these differentials shrink, the incentive to hold dollar-denominated assets purely for yield diminishes, leading to capital outflows and dollar depreciation. Geopolitical Shifts and De-dollarization Narratives Beyond economic fundamentals, broader geopolitical shifts and ongoing discussions about de-dollarization also contribute to the dollar’s vulnerability. While the dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency is not under immediate threat, various nations and blocs are actively exploring alternatives for trade and finance, particularly in response to sanctions and geopolitical tensions. This long-term trend, though slow, adds a layer of structural pressure. Unpacking the Growing September Rate Cut Expectations The market’s conviction that the Federal Reserve will initiate a rate cut by September has solidified considerably. This expectation is not merely speculative but is rooted in a careful interpretation of the Fed’s dual mandate – achieving maximum employment and stable prices – and its recent communications. The Fed’s Data-Dependent Stance Federal Reserve officials have consistently reiterated their data-dependent approach. This means that their policy decisions are directly influenced by incoming economic reports. As mentioned, the trend in inflation and employment data has been favorable, providing the Fed with the necessary room to consider easing monetary policy. Inflation Progress: The most significant factor is the sustained progress on inflation. With CPI and PCE showing consistent declines, the Fed is gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%. Employment Moderation: While the labor market remains strong, signs of moderation, such as a slight uptick in unemployment claims or a decrease in job openings, suggest that the economy is cooling without tipping into a severe downturn. This ‘soft landing’ scenario is ideal for a rate cut. Fed Officials’ Commentary: Recent speeches and interviews from various Fed governors and regional presidents have increasingly hinted at the possibility of rate cuts in the latter half of the year, provided the data continues to cooperate. While cautious, the tone has shifted from ‘higher for longer’ to a more flexible outlook. Market Pricing and the FedWatch Tool Financial markets, particularly through instruments like Fed Funds futures, actively price in the probability of future rate changes. The CME FedWatch Tool, a widely followed indicator, shows a substantial and growing probability of a September rate cut . This market consensus reflects the collective wisdom of thousands of traders and analysts, incorporating all available information. Historically, the Fed often moves in line with these market expectations, or at least aims to manage them to avoid market shocks. The increasing certainty around a September cut suggests that the market believes the Fed has enough evidence to act. What Does a Potential Fed Rate Cut Mean for Your Portfolio? A Fed rate cut is not an isolated event; it sends ripples across all asset classes, fundamentally altering the investment landscape. For both traditional and crypto investors, understanding these implications is crucial for strategic positioning. Impact on Traditional Asset Classes A rate cut typically signals a shift towards a more accommodative monetary policy, which can have diverse effects: Stocks: Generally positive. Lower borrowing costs for companies can boost profitability and encourage investment, leading to higher stock valuations. Growth stocks, which are more sensitive to future earnings, often benefit disproportionately. Bonds: Mixed. Existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive, potentially increasing their value. However, new bond issuances will likely carry lower yields, reducing future income for fixed-income investors. The yield curve might steepen if short-term rates fall more sharply than long-term rates. Commodities: Often positive. A weaker dollar, a common consequence of rate cuts, makes dollar-denominated commodities like oil, gold, and industrial metals cheaper for international buyers, stimulating demand. Real Estate: Positive. Lower mortgage rates can stimulate housing demand and make real estate investments more attractive, though the impact varies by market conditions. Here’s a simplified overview of how different asset classes might react: Asset Class Typical Impact of Rate Cut Explanation Stocks (Equities) Potentially Positive Lower borrowing costs, increased corporate profits, higher valuations, risk-on sentiment. Bonds (Fixed Income) Mixed Existing bonds with higher yields become more valuable; new bond yields will be lower. Commodities Potentially Positive Weaker dollar makes commodities cheaper for foreign buyers; increased demand. Gold Potentially Positive Viewed as a safe-haven asset and alternative to a weakening dollar; lower opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Real Estate Potentially Positive Lower mortgage rates can stimulate housing demand and make property investments more attractive. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market For the crypto world, a Fed rate cut is often viewed through a bullish lens. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have at times exhibited an inverse correlation with the dollar, acting as a hedge against inflation or a flight to quality when traditional currencies face instability. Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates generally foster a ‘risk-on’ environment. With less attractive yields from traditional safe assets, investors might be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Dollar Weakness and Store of Value: As the dollar weakens, the appeal of alternative stores of value, such as Bitcoin, can increase. International investors might view Bitcoin as a more stable asset compared to a depreciating fiat currency. Increased Liquidity: A more accommodative monetary policy often leads to increased liquidity in the financial system. This excess capital can flow into various markets, including cryptocurrencies, boosting prices. Reduced Opportunity Cost: When interest rates are high, holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin carries a significant opportunity cost. As rates fall, this cost diminishes, making crypto more appealing. Navigating Global Monetary Policy Shifts The Federal Reserve’s actions do not occur in a vacuum. Its monetary policy decisions reverberate across the globe, influencing other central banks, currency valuations, and international capital flows. Understanding this interconnectedness is vital for a holistic market perspective. Central Bank Divergence vs. Convergence Currently, we are witnessing a period where some central banks are still contemplating rate hikes or maintaining high rates, while others, like the Fed, are preparing for cuts. This divergence can lead to significant currency volatility and arbitrage opportunities. For example, if the ECB remains hawkish while the Fed cuts rates, the Euro could strengthen considerably against the dollar. Conversely, a synchronized easing cycle, where multiple major central banks cut rates in tandem, could signal a global economic slowdown but might stabilize currency markets relative to each other, albeit at lower rates. Impact on Emerging Markets Emerging markets are particularly sensitive to shifts in US monetary policy. A strong dollar and high US interest rates often lead to capital outflows from emerging economies, making it harder for them to service dollar-denominated debt. A Fed rate cut and a weaker dollar can reverse this trend, encouraging capital inflows and easing financial conditions for these nations. Challenges for Policymakers Central bankers face a delicate balancing act. They must manage inflation without stifling economic growth, respond to domestic conditions while being mindful of global spillovers, and maintain credibility. The path to a ‘soft landing’ is fraught with challenges, and any misstep could lead to renewed inflation or a deeper recession, impacting market sentiment and asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. Forecasting the US Dollar Outlook : Opportunities and Challenges The US Dollar outlook is complex, characterized by a confluence of opposing forces. While the immediate horizon suggests further pressure, several factors could still provide support or even lead to a rebound. Investors must consider a range of scenarios. Potential Bearish Scenarios for the Dollar Aggressive Fed Cuts: If the Fed cuts rates more aggressively than currently anticipated, or if a series of cuts follow the September move, the dollar could experience more substantial depreciation. Global Economic Rebound: A stronger-than-expected economic recovery in other major economies (Eurozone, China, Japan) could shift capital away from the US, weakening the dollar. Fiscal Concerns: Ongoing concerns about the US national debt and fiscal deficits could erode confidence in the dollar over the long term, though this is a more structural issue. Potential Bullish Scenarios for the Dollar Resurgent Inflation: If inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, forcing the Fed to pause or even reverse its easing path, the dollar could find renewed strength. Global Instability: In times of significant global geopolitical or economic turmoil, the dollar often acts as a safe haven, attracting capital and strengthening its value, regardless of domestic interest rates. US Economic Outperformance: If the US economy significantly outperforms other major economies, it could still attract investment flows, supporting the dollar. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the nuanced US Dollar outlook , a diversified and adaptable investment strategy is paramount: Diversification: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies. A portfolio solely reliant on dollar strength or weakness could be vulnerable. Monitor Economic Data: Pay close attention to key economic indicators (inflation, employment, retail sales) and central bank communications. These will be the primary drivers of market sentiment. Currency Hedging: For international investors or businesses, consider currency hedging strategies to mitigate volatility risks. Alternative Assets: Evaluate the role of alternative assets like gold and cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) in your portfolio. These can offer a hedge against dollar weakness and provide diversification benefits. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Focus on your long-term financial goals and adjust your strategy accordingly. Conclusion: A Transformative Period for Global Finance The growing September rate cut expectations , driven by the narrative of the US Dollar under pressure , mark a potentially transformative period for global finance. The Federal Reserve’s evolving monetary policy , aimed at achieving a delicate balance between inflation control and economic growth, will have far-reaching consequences, influencing everything from stock markets to the price of commodities and the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. While a Fed rate cut typically signals a more favorable environment for risk assets, the nuanced US Dollar outlook demands careful consideration and strategic positioning from investors. Staying informed about these macro-economic shifts is no longer just for economists; it’s essential for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of modern financial markets. As the dollar’s dominance faces new challenges and central banks recalibrate their strategies, adaptability and a keen understanding of interconnected global forces will be your most valuable assets.

Speaking in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, van Eck argued that traditional finance cannot ignore the coming wave of stablecoin transactions and will eventually need to build on Ethereum or similar systems. “It’s very much what I call the Wall Street token,” he said, explaining that the future of banking will require seamless acceptance and settlement of stablecoins. “The winner is going to be Ethereum or something that uses Ethereum’s methodology, known as ECM.” His remarks come as the U.S. moves closer to a regulated framework for stablecoins. Last month, Congress passed the Genius Act , the country’s first federal law dedicated to payment stablecoins, which was later signed into law by President Donald Trump. The timing is significant: stablecoin supply has now surpassed $280 billion, underscoring their growing role in global finance. Banks Face Pressure to Adapt Van Eck suggested that as corporate adoption of stablecoins grows, banks that fail to adjust could lose relevance. A May 14 survey by Fireblocks revealed that 90% of institutional players are already exploring stablecoin usage in their operations. “Companies have to employ technology to enable stablecoin usage over the next 12 months,” van Eck said, adding that no institution wants to reject digital dollar transfers. “If I want to send you stablecoins, your bank has to figure it out, or you will find another institution that will.” The sentiment has been echoed elsewhere in the financial world. Earlier this year, Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, warned that banks unwilling to adopt crypto could face extinction within a decade. Ethereum ETFs and Corporate Treasury Momentum Van Eck’s confidence in Ethereum aligns with his firm’s own offerings. In July 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved VanEck’s Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), which tracks the price of ETH without holding the asset directly. The product has since grown to more than $284 million in assets under management. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s broader market appeal is being reinforced by corporate treasuries. Over the past month, companies including BitMine and SharpLink have collectively purchased more than $6 billion worth of Ether . The buying spree coincides with ETH reaching a new all-time high of $4,946 on Sunday, before easing slightly to $4,566 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.

Do they need the king of the cryptocurrencies to confirm its breakout first, and they follow, or are they going to continue their current relatively uninspiring price action? $DOGE price maintaining an uptrend Source: TradingView $DOGE is still the undisputed leader of the memecoins, but considering that we are arguably approaching the final stage of this bull market the price action is relatively uninspiring. That said, compared with most of the memecoins, $DOGE is at least maintaining an uptrend. The daily price chart above shows this uptrend, and reveals that a break to the up or the downside should take place soon. Obviously, if $BTC confirms its trend break, a breakout of the current triangle would likely be to the upside for $DOGE. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have recently crossed back up again. A breakout of the triangle would leave the bulls gunning for the horizontal resistance at $0.245, before targeting a higher high at $0.255. $PEPE loses trend Source: TradingView The daily chart for $PEPE is fairly desultory. The price action recently lost the uptrend and now it remains to be seen whether it can gain it again. There is strong horizontal support just below, and support at the current price level could be held. If it is, the Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart look as though they are going to cross back up, bringing the momentum for a potential break back above the ascending trendline. $PENGU forms a classic bull flag Source: TradingView After its astonishing 500% climb through June and into July, $PENGU has been putting in a series of lower highs and lower lows. This price action could be construed as a memecoin that was pumped to the highs and is now being discarded and left to deflate. However, this particular price action fits the bill of a classic bull flag, which is a continuation pattern. After the last touch of the bottom trendline of the flag, it might now be expected that the $PENGU price climbs back up to the top trendline, and breaks out from there. $PENGU is certainly one to keep an eye on. If Bitcoin does its thing, and memecoins follow, $PENGU could be one of the main gainers once again. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

When this happens, some lesser-known tokens can rise fast. Fresh market moves suggest new trends are forming. Many want to know which digital assets could benefit next. This article takes a close look at the most talked about coins set for the spotlight. Sui (SUI) Source: TradingView SUI trades between $3.38 and $3.92 after a rough stretch. The token is down 5.83% in the past week and 18.39% in a month, erasing much of the winter rally. Even so, the six-month chart still shows a 17.67% gain, proving buyers are not gone. The 10-day average sits at $3.41, a tad under the 100-day line at $3.60. RSI holds at 44.54, almost neutral, while a negative MACD echoes cooling momentum. The Stochastic reading of 64.41 hints at room to move either way. In short, short-term mood is cautious, longer-term trend is alive. Bulls need a clean push above $4.15. A break could open the door to $4.70, a jump of roughly 20% to 35% from today’s lower band. Failing that, $3.07 is the first backstop; slipping under it may drag SUI to $2.53, about a 25% slide. Expect tight action near $3.40 until volume picks a side. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Hyperliquid (HYPE) Source: TradingView HYPE trades between $41.97 and $48.51 this week. Price is up 7.45% in 7 days and 7.36% in 30 days. The big move is the 137.67% jump over 6 months. This shows steady demand after the long climb. The token now sits above both its 10 day and 100 day moving lines at $45.78 and $44.67. That shows near term strength. Momentum gauges print 61.97 on the strength index and 88.34 on the stochastic meter, hinting at heated buying but not yet at peak euphoria. Traders watch $50.99 as the next roof while $37.91 acts as the main floor. If buyers push through $50.99, HYPE could sprint another 11% to that level and then aim for $57.53, a further 26% from today. Failure to clear $50 could send price back to the 10 day line near $45 and later the $37.91 support, a slide of about 17%. Given the strong half year trend and firm moving lines, odds still lean toward a climb, but the gap to resistance grows narrower by the day. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Source: TradingView Memecoin PENGU spent the week drifting inside $0.03 to $0.04, down 1.37% since last Monday and nursing a harsh 26.89% fall over the past month. Zoom out and the mood changes; the token still shows a 267.70% gain in six months, keeping long term holders firmly in the green. The 10 day and 100 day averages both sit at $0.03, showing price equilibrium. Momentum gauges line up neutral, with RSI 46.69 and a slightly bearish MACD reading. Stochastic 64.93 hints that buyers still have some room before hitting overbought territory. In short, PENGU is coiling and waiting for a clear catalyst. A decisive close above $0.04 would flip that level into support and open a sprint toward $0.05, a move worth roughly 25%. Break that and the rally could accelerate as momentum traders pile in. Failure to hold $0.03 could drag the token toward $0.02, trimming about 33% from the current range. The tight structure suggests an explosive move is near; bulls retain the longer term edge but bears control the short term tape until 0.04 gives way. Conclusion Liquidity now feeds fresh picks. SUI, HYPE, and PENGU look sound, yet XYZVerse leads as the first all-sport memecoin, eyeing 20,000% gains through fan power and clear growth plans.

Overall, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.5%, now standing at $3.99 trillion, just below the $4 trillion mark. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $149 billion. TLDR: The majority of the top 100 coins are up today; 9 of the top 10 coins are green, with SOL at the top; The rally has slowed down compared to yesterday; ’We are in the later stages of the current bullish trend’; BTC and ETH appreciated 2.2% and 0.2%, trading at $113,127 and $4,571, respectively; BTC hitting $113,600 ‘would likely meet resistance as stressed short-term holders sell into strength’; ’Any correction has the potential to evolve into the beginning of a medium-term bearish market’; Going into September, the key macro catalysts remain US-focused; Both US BTC and ETH ETFs saw inflows on Wednesday, with $81.25 million and $307 million, respectively; Caution rises among investors. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have decreased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) rose by 2.2%, now trading at $113,127. This is the second-highest increase in the category. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 0.2%, meaning that it’s practically unchanged, now trading at $4,571. The biggest rise was recorded by Solana (SOL) for the second day in a row, climbing 2% to the price of $211. It’s followed by BTC and then Dogecoin (DOGE) , with a rise of 2.1% to $0.223. Notably, most of the top 10 list is barely changed, with very low percentages, including the one red coin, Tron (TRX) , which fell 0.2% to $0.3478. As for the top 100 coins, Cronos (CRO) is still at the top for the third day in a row. It’s up 57%, now changing hands at $0.3412. Mantle (MNT) follows with 9.5%, currently trading at $1.26. On the other hand, Provenance Blockchain (HASH) decreased the most: 4.5% to $0.02584. It’s followed by OKB (OKB) , having decreased by 3.7% to the price of $169. Meanwhile, Fundstrat Chief Investment Officer Tom Lee said that Ethereum could rally to $5,500 in the near term and to $12,000 by the end of the year. Lee further stressed that Ethereum is the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance.

Notably, we are now entering the later stages of the current medium-term bullish cycle. This encourages early entrants, especially those holding BTC for 10 years or more, “to realize significant profits.” On the other hand, newer whales are more likely to adopt a longer-term strategy and hold the coin for one or even several future cycles. Moreover, BTC’s and ETH’s recent pullback is also a reflection of broader market sentiment, particularly the minor correction in U.S. equity indices. “The key question is whether equities are experiencing a temporary correction or entering a more structural downturn,” Lienkha wrote. We are in the later stages of the current bullish trend, he said. Therefore, “any correction has the potential to evolve into the beginning of a medium-term bearish market. Against this backdrop, I would lean toward a more cautious approach, either by increasing hedges or reducing portfolio exposure to minimize downside risk,” he advised. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s Historical Volatility Index remains relatively low, and realized volatility has not increased significantly, Lienkha added. This suggests that the current options positioning does not resemble a classic “volatility trap” at this point. Going into September, the key macro catalysts remain US-focused: inflation, interest rate policy, and labor market data. “The interaction of these factors will largely shape overall risk sentiment and, in turn, the trajectory of both traditional and crypto markets,” Lienkha concludes. Moreover, Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB , commented that Bitcoin ETFs saw $33.6 billion in inflows in the second quarter of this year, “underscoring how far Bitcoin has come from being a fringe asset.” The coin is now “deeply embedded in the global financial system, actively allocated and recommended by leading institutions,” he said. Bitcoin has become a store of value with “a clear upward trajectory,” and the next phase in its evolution is “about everyday utility: everything from enabling everyday transactions and payments, to borrowing stablecoins and other currencies against Bitcoin.” Per Harz, should Bitcoin remain only a store of value, it risks irrelevance. Instead, “its future lies in becoming the infrastructure layer for the next era of finance.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC trades at $113,127. It initially climbed to $112,555, then dropped to the $110,000 level again, before making another climb to the current level. The intraday low was $110,464, while the highest point currently sits at $113,329. Should BTC move above $116,850, it could climb further to $120,900 and $124,500. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView According to the latest Glassnode report, “Bitcoin’s retracement to $111,000 leaves the market testing a pivotal range.” BTC’s support stands at $93,000–$110,000. A break below $107,000–$108,900 could open downside toward $93,000–$95,000, the analysts said. Conversely, BTC hitting $113,600 “would likely meet resistance as stressed short-term holders sell into strength,” they added. Source: Glassnode Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently trading at $4,589. It reached the day’s high of $4,657 earlier today, decreasing since then. It first plunged to the intraday low of $4,473, before recuperating to the current level. The coin is working to reclaim the intraday high level in an attempt to rally further. On the other hand, it may fall back towards $4,300. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment dropped again today, despite the general greenery in the market. The crypto fear and greed index fell from 47 yesterday to 45 today . The index is still in the neutral zone, but caution and fear have been creeping in for several days now, fueling bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, as of 27 August, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another day of positive flows, taking in $81.25 million . Bitwise said goodbye to $3.05 million, while five funds recorded inflows, the highest of which is BlackRock’s $50.87 million. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs also saw more inflows, with $307.2 million on Wednesday, reaching the total net inflow of $13.64 billion. Five of the nine funds saw inflows. The highest of these is $262.63 million by BlackRock . It’s followed by Fidelity’s $20.52 million. Meanwhile, healthcare company KindlyMD has filed a $5 billion at-the-market equity offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to fund its Bitcoin treasury strategy. This is one of the largest corporate crypto accumulation programs announced this year. Moreover, US-based trading platform Webull launched crypto trading in Australia , offering access to up to 240 digital assets through a new partnership with Coinbase Prime .

For decades, the NYSCRF has been known for its conservative, blue-chip-heavy portfolio, prioritizing stable long-term returns over speculative bets. That’s why its bold 543% expansion into XRP has stunned Wall Street and the crypto industry alike. Unlike hedge funds that thrive on risk, public pension systems typically avoid volatile assets, focusing instead on protecting retiree benefits, making this move a powerful signal of shifting institutional confidence in digital assets. The fund’s substantial increase in XRP holdings signals a clear shift in institutional sentiment toward digital assets. Ripple’s technology focused on driving cross-border payments, liquidity solutions, and financial infrastructure upgrades has gained traction with banks, regulators, and corporations, making XRP stand out for its real-world utility in streamlining global payments. The timing of NYSCRF’s move is striking. With the SEC’s long-running lawsuit against Ripple finally resolved, investor confidence in XRP has surged. By expanding its allocation now, the pension fund signals it views the long-term potential of XRP as far greater than lingering regulatory risks. Institutional participation has long been viewed as the next major driver of cryptocurrency adoption. When a heavyweight like the NYSCRF commits substantial capital to XRP, it not only validates Ripple’s utility but also sets a precedent for other pension systems and sovereign wealth funds considering digital asset exposure. XRP Consolidates in Triangle Formation as Bulls Eye $3.50 Breakout XRP is once again drawing attention in the crypto markets as it consolidates into a bullish triangle pattern, according to market expert HolderStat. The digital asset recently staged a strong recovery after forming a higher low, signaling renewed momentum from buyers. Technical structures now suggest that XRP is entering an accumulation phase, with market participants preparing for the next decisive move. HolderStat highlights that XRP’s price is currently facing a crucial resistance zone between $3.20 and $3.30. The market analyst added , “A successful breakout above this range could push toward 3.50, maintaining bullish technical momentum.” Triangle formations in technical analysis often signal consolidation before a breakout. For XRP, this pattern points to accumulation rather than sell-offs, a bullish indicator that typically precedes upward moves. The setup reinforces growing market optimism about XRP’s role in cross-border payments and broader blockchain adoption. Presently XRP is trading at $3, with a bullish pennant formation showing that a rally to $5 is possible. Conclusion The New York State Common Retirement Fund’s 543% surge in XRP holdings is more than a portfolio move, it’s a landmark signal of institutional finance’s future. By backing Ripple’s technology, one of America’s most risk-averse pension funds is effectively endorsing blockchain’s long-term role in global finance. For now, all eyes are on the $3.20–$3.30 resistance. A decisive move above this threshold could be the trigger for XRP’s next rally, keeping bullish sentiment alive and extending the asset’s strong recovery trajectory.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-28 11:39:20

The Solana Policy Institute recently made headlines with a significant contribution, donating a substantial $500,000 to the Tornado Cash legal defense fund for its co-founder, Roman Storm. This bold move sends a clear message about the industry’s commitment to supporting developers and safeguarding privacy-focused protocols within the digital asset landscape. Understanding the Tornado Cash Legal Defense: What’s at Stake? Roman Storm, a co-founder of the well-known cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash, faces serious legal challenges. He was indicted in 2023 on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations. Authorities allege that Tornado Cash facilitated illicit transactions, including those connected to North Korean hackers and other sanctioned entities. However, many within the crypto community hold a different view. They argue that software developers should not be held responsible for how malicious actors misuse their open-source tools. This perspective frames the ongoing Tornado Cash legal defense as a crucial battle, not just for Storm, but for the very future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and privacy-enhancing technologies globally. Solana’s Bold Move: Why the $500K Donation Matters The Solana Policy Institute’s generous donation to the Tornado Cash legal defense fund signals strong support from a significant player in the blockchain ecosystem. This institute, recognized for its advocacy in the Web3 space, firmly believes that such legal challenges could severely stifle innovation and progress within the sector. Their action reflects a broader, shared sentiment across the industry, emphasizing several key points: Protecting Developers: Many believe that prosecuting software developers for code they create sets a dangerous and chilling precedent. Championing Privacy: Tornado Cash, at its core, offered a legitimate way to enhance transaction privacy, a feature often considered essential for digital freedom and security. Fostering Innovation: The industry fears that aggressive legal crackdowns might discourage the development of new, groundbreaking decentralized technologies. This substantial financial backing aims to ensure Roman Storm receives a robust legal defense. Ultimately, the outcome could significantly influence future regulatory approaches to crypto mixers and other privacy tools. Broader Implications: How Does This Impact Crypto Innovation? The result of the Tornado Cash legal defense case could have far-reaching consequences for the entire cryptocurrency sector. It raises fundamental and complex questions about the nature of responsibility in a decentralized world, specifically concerning: Developer Liability: Where does accountability truly lie when open-source code is misused by third parties? Regulatory Clarity: This case has the potential to help define how existing laws and regulations apply to decentralized, permissionless technologies. Future of Privacy: Will developers continue to build essential privacy-preserving tools if they face potential personal legal risks for their creations? The cryptocurrency industry is closely monitoring these developments, hoping for a resolution that successfully balances national security concerns with the imperative to foster technological advancement. This situation underscores the ongoing need for constructive dialogue between innovators and policymakers to create clear, fair, and forward-looking guidelines. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto’s Future The Solana Policy Institute’s $500,000 donation to the Tornado Cash legal defense fund is far more than just financial aid; it’s a powerful and symbolic statement. It represents a collective effort within the crypto community to protect developers, champion the fundamental right to privacy, and ensure that innovation can thrive without undue fear of legal repercussions. As this landmark case unfolds, its implications will undoubtedly shape the regulatory landscape and the trajectory of decentralized technologies for years to come. The industry stands firm, advocating for a future where responsible innovation is encouraged, not stifled, paving the way for a more secure and private digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Tornado Cash? Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to enhance privacy for cryptocurrency transactions.

Insider activity fueled criticism and market controversy. Kanye West’s YZY Meme Coin: Who Made Money and Who Didn’t The Bubblemaps project has released a detailed report on the YZY meme coin launched by rapper Kanye West (Ye). According to the report, 74% of the 70,201 investors in the asset incurred losses. West officially launched YZY on the morning of August 21, 2025, though rumors had circulated for months prior. The project faced immediate criticism amid suspicions of insider involvement, sparking debate across the crypto community. Top Wallets Capture Majority of Profits Bubblemaps also reported that Hayden Davis, co-founder of the controversial LIBRA project — Argentina’s alleged official memecoin profited from YZY. Davis began buying the asset just a minute after the announcement and sold it for a significant gain. Out of 70,201 traders: 18,333 (26.11%) earned a total of $66.64 million. 51,862 (73.89%) lost a total of $74.84 million. Among profitable wallets: 11 earned over $1 million each 2,541 earned between $1,000 and $10,000 15,040 earned up to $1,000 This means roughly 30% of total profits came from just 11 wallets , highlighting a stark imbalance in profit distribution. The average profit and loss (PNL) per trader was a loss of $8.2 million . Insider Activity and Market Imbalance The report did not clarify whether unrealized gains and losses were included, but the imbalance is evident. Only a small fraction of investors gained significant returns, while the majority lost money. Meanwhile, three addresses lost more than $1 million, with thousands more losing substantial amounts. This early distribution pattern raises questions about fairness and transparency in high-profile memecoin launches. Conclusion The YZY meme coin launch underscores the volatility and risk inherent in celebrity-backed cryptocurrencies.

As of August, the most recent wallet cohorts aged 1-3 months are underwater. Bitcoin is facing another potential pivotal moment, with the possibility of selling pressure. Based on Glassnode data, the most immediate pressure may come from the most recent cohorts of wallets, aged 1-3 months. Those wallets are now underwater, and retail buyers may decide to sell at breakeven to await a more favorable buying moment. While the recent wallet cohorts bought well below the all-time peak, their cost basis is still relatively high compared to the recent price around $112,000. #Bitcoin trades below the $113.6k and $115.6k cost basis of the 1M and 3M cohorts. With short-term holders under water, rallies may face resistance as these investors seek to exit at breakeven. pic.twitter.com/UkMQd01FOM — glassnode (@glassnode) August 28, 2025 Wallets aged 1-3 months were cautiously accumulating BTC since the April dip, though the short-term records increased their cost basis. Based on current prices, those wallets hold 8.82% of the total Bitcoin supply, potentially rivaling treasuries and ETFs. However, a rally above the cost basis may be cut short, as traders try to cash in. There are still no signs of capitulation, though indicators show recent buyers are in distress. Long-term holders with wallets aged over 1 year are holding strong, with only sporadic whale activity and selling. Even one whale could sway Bitcoin price lower, especially when whales are showing signs of rotating from BTC to ETH. BTC is still above the potential capitulation price Based on Glassnode tracking, Bitcoin sits above a support zone from accumulation at the end of 2024. Slightly older wallets have acquired BTC at the $93,000 to $110,000 range, which is seen as a potential support level. At this range, accumulation came mostly from large-scale buyers and institutions , as retail stayed out of the market during the most recent rally. Bitcoin is holding above a dense supply cluster between $93k and $110k. This accumulation zone has steadily matured since Dec 2024 and could form a floor – unless sustained sell pressure drives a capitulation event: https://t.co/GbJGyG6nFz pic.twitter.com/MphRYa3h3y — glassnode (@glassnode) August 28, 2025 BTC has not seen significant drawdowns during this market cycle, but traders and holders are more fearful of getting caught in a downturn. Based on the Crypto Fear and Greed index, BTC sits at a neutral position, with no immediate signs of panic, but no overly exuberant long positions or risky leveraged trades. Will Bitcoin retain its short-term trend? At the current price range, the BTC bull market is not threatened. However, the weekly close is watched for signs of a trend reversal. Based on CryptoQuant research, Bitcoin is now in a pivotal zone between $109,000 and $112,000. The weekly close may determine whether the price recovers further or shifts to a lower price range. Bulls vs Bears? Bitcoin’s critical pivot zone at 109K – 112K “The 109K – 112K range is a critical pivot zone in the short term. A weekly close above this region could strengthen the trend, while closing below it may accelerate the correction.” – By @burak_kesmeci pic.twitter.com/AaM1hMNmNT — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 28, 2025 BTC also awaits the weekly options expiration event, which may cause additional volatility and selling. Overall, the leading coin has lost the narrative of being the engine of growth, as attention and accumulation shifted to ETH. The BTC liquidation heatmap points to a similar range, with a slight shift between $111,000 and $114,000. However, more distributed long positions reach all the way down to $110,000, potentially triggering a series of liquidations for long positions. For derivative markets, traders are more cautious in building up liquidity, causing relatively smaller crashes. In the past day, BTC saw limited liquidations of $16.6M for long positions and $24M for short positions. Open interest remains above $38B, though growing more cautiously. Hyperliquid whales are also more conservative, with fewer flashy positions.

50813181,567756,1756381543,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50813181.jpeg,Viral Bitcoin Hyper Presale Aims to Supercharge Bitcoin’s Future,https://bitcoinist.com/viral-bitcoin-hyper-presale-aims-to-supercharge-bitcoins-future/,"Bitcoin might still be the undisputed heavyweight of crypto, but it’s showing its age. While it dominates as a store of value, it struggles when used as actual money. Slow transactions, high fees, and a lack of smart contract support keep it from being more than digital gold. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a new Layer-2 project that has already raised $12.5M in its presale, with tokens priced at $0.012815. Investors are piling in because Bitcoin Hyper promises to do what Bitcoin has never been able to: make the king of crypto fast, scalable, and programmable. The Problem: Bitcoin’s Old Baggage Bitcoin has been around for over a decade, and its biggest flaws are no secret. Anyone who has tried sending $BTC during peak hours knows how painful it can be. Transactions can take minutes, sometimes hours, to settle. Fees spike to the point where sending $20 of Bitcoin could cost $10 in charges. That makes small payments impractical and discourages everyday use. The scalability gap is even clearer when compared to traditional finance. Bitcoin processes about seven transactions per second . Visa, meanwhile, averages around 65K TPS and can scale even higher during peak loads. For Bitcoin to serve billions of people worldwide, it would need to close that gap, but it can’t on its base layer. Then there’s programmability. Ethereum and Solana power the world of DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins because they can run smart contracts. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no easy way to host decentralized apps. Developers have either avoided it or been forced into complex workarounds. The result: Bitcoin remains the safest blockchain, but one with limited usability in modern Web3. The Solution: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) was created to fix these pain points once and for all. It’s a high-speed, low-cost Layer-2 that sits on top of Bitcoin and makes it usable in ways it has never been before. At its core is the Canonical Bridge . People lock their $BTC on the Bitcoin base chain, which then mints wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2. That WBTC can be used instantly for payments, gaming, DeFi, or even launching new crypto tokens. When you want your $BTC back, you simply burn your WBTC and unlock the original coins. What makes Bitcoin Hyper stand out is its integration with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . This means it can run Solana programs directly, bringing Solana-level speed into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Developers can port their apps seamlessly, and users get lightning-fast transactions with low fees. Imagine taking Bitcoin’s trusted engine and strapping on a turbocharger – that’s what Bitcoin Hyper is doing. The implications are massive. With this Layer 2, Bitcoin could finally scale to everyday payments and programmable money, while retaining its core strength as the most secure blockchain. If it succeeds, Bitcoin’s role in the crypto world could expand dramatically, cementing it as both digital gold and usable digital cash. Why Investors Are Betting on $HYPER The excitement around Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just about technology. The presale is already a viral event, having crossed $12.5M raised. Right now, you can buy $HYPER for just $0.012815. Investors see the potential for this to be one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The $HYPER token powers the entire network. It’s used to pay gas fees, earn staking rewards, unlock premium dApps, and fuel developer grants. Governance is also part of the roadmap, giving holders a say in the project’s future direction. Early buyers can already stake their tokens and earn yields that beat most other new crypto launches on the market. Beyond token utility, the market backdrop adds weight. The Bitcoin payments market is projected to hit $3.7T by 2031 . Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t need to dominate that market – it only needs to carve out a slice. That’s still a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. With $HYPER already featured in Best Wallet ’s curated ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section, it’s clear the project is being taken seriously. For investors who are tired of pure speculation on meme coins and want exposure to a project solving real problems, Bitcoin Hyper looks like one of the best altcoins to watch. Bitcoin Hyper’s Big Moment Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a bold attempt to make Bitcoin as fast and flexible as the younger chains dominating Web3. By solving Bitcoin’s biggest issues, it has the potential to expand Bitcoin’s role in ways most thought impossible. With $12.5M already raised, viral momentum, and strong investor interest, $HYPER could be the next crypto to explode . This article is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice.

The Upbit listing gives the fixed-income crypto project the much-needed legitimacy in an active crypto community. Increased visibility will likely open doors for significant TREE adoption. The region’s massive retail optimism and institutional curiosity set the stage for sustained growth for the digital coin. Treehouse’s role in the DeFi space Beyond price charts, Treehouse is an ambitious project within the decentralized finance industry. While many DeFi protocols focus on speculative trading, Treehouse aims to stabilize the sector by offsetting volatility through a decentralized fixed income model. The team looks to revolutionize how investors interact with DeFi by introducing structured returns that combine traditional finance with decentralized accessibility. Treehouse will attract market participants looking for secure, yield-centric alternatives. TREE price outlook: what’s next after the sudden rally? The native coin painted its daily chart green as Upbit news magnified optimism. TREE hovers at $0.4304 after dipping from its daily high. Its 24-hour trading volume increased by 1,000%, signaling robust trader and investor activity amidst volatility-driven rallies. Chart by Coinamrketcap However, the natural question is whether TREE can sustain this rally in the near term. Historical trends show that the Korean market activity serves more as a Launchpad and not a fleeting pump. Thus, digital tokens shoot after listing before cooling to determine decisive trajectories. Treehouse should secure a significant community in the region and adoption for sustained growth. TREE has already erased some of its gains, and it might plunge further in the coming hours as the listing hype fades. The altcoin exhibits significant volatility, with fading momentum hinting at further declines. Broad market support in the coming sessions remains crucial to prevent declines to pre-listing levels.

The popular cryptocurrency climbed above the $213 threshold after rising by over 6% in the past 24 hours and is testing resistance levels that have held since February of this year. This breakthrough potentially points to the end of a months-long consolidation phase. SOL Breakout According to Santiment’s latest findings, the accompanying retail sentiment data reveals an extraordinary bullish tilt. In fact, a positive commentary was found to be dominating negative opinions at a 5.8:1 ratio. This is the strongest bullish sentiment reading in nearly three months. While such technical breakouts often lead to steady upward momentum, the extreme nature of retail optimism in SOL, however, needs careful monitoring, as euphoric sentiment levels can sometimes precede market corrections. Experts from B2BINPAY had recently stated that SOL’s jump back above $200 was “more than just a speculative pop,” which aligned with strong on-chain metrics. Blockchain throughput also witnessed significant growth since last month, alongside increased DeFi total value locked as well as expanding NFT activity and GameFi adoption. Solana War-Chests Momentum is not just limited to charts and on-chain metrics. For instance, Sharps Technology announced a $400 million treasury strategy centered on Solana’s native token. The medical device maker signed a letter of intent with the Solana Foundation to acquire $50 million worth of SOL tokens through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal. The purchase will be made at a 15% discount to SOL’s 30-day average price. Additionally, Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto are raising $1 billion to create a dedicated SOL treasury. Pantera Capital is also betting big on Solana. Reports claim that the crypto hedge fund is aiming to raise $1.25 billion by converting a Nasdaq-listed firm into “Solana Co.” The plan includes $500 million upfront and $750 million via warrants, which could potentially create the world’s largest SOL treasury, for now.

XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin and ADA Enter the Race",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/which-altcoin-hits-10-first-xrp-magacoin-finance-dogecoin-and-ada-enter-the-race/,"XRP, Cardano, MAGACOIN Finance & Dogecoin — Which Altcoin Will Hit $10 First in 2025? The race to $10 has become one of the defining narratives for altcoins in 2025. Traders are watching closely to see whether established names like XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin can finally break into double digits, or if new contenders such as MAGACOIN Finance can capture attention with promises of outsized returns. Recent analyst reports suggest XRP has the strongest chance of crossing the mark first, though speculative momentum continues to build around other tokens. XRP (Ripple) — Leading the $10 Race XRP has steadily gained ground in 2025, trading around $3.50 as of late July. Analysts widely agree that the path to $7–$10 is becoming realistic by late 2025 or early 2026, driven by institutional adoption, whale accumulation, and improved regulatory clarity. Several recent breakouts have pushed optimism higher, with technical charts pointing toward continued upside momentum if current conditions hold. Although the $10 level remains ambitious, it is no longer dismissed as fantasy. Consensus views now place XRP as the most likely candidate to hit $10 first, especially if the broader market maintains its bullish cycle into year-end. Cardano (ADA) — Ambitious Targets, Limited Consensus Cardano has hovered around the $0.90 to $1.20 range throughout much of 2025. While some highly bullish projections suggest ADA could make a parabolic move toward $10, most mainstream forecasts are far more cautious. Analyst targets typically fall between $1.17 and $2.00, reflecting steady growth but nothing close to the tenfold increase required to touch double digits this year. For ADA to reach $10, it would require unprecedented market conditions and acceleration that are not reflected in the current consensus. As a result, the $10 target for Cardano is generally considered optimistic, with analysts rating its chances of achieving it in 2025 as very low. MAGACOIN Finance — Momentum From the Presale While XRP, Cardano, and Dogecoin dominate much of the mainstream $10 conversation, a growing number of investors are turning their attention toward MAGACOIN Finance. Analysts note that momentum around the presale has intensified as traders look beyond traditional names for higher multiples. Market sentiment increasingly frames MAGACOIN Finance as one of the best altcoins to buy for 2025, with FOMO building as new buyers flood in. Presale promotions have amplified this attention, particularly the limited-use code PATRIOT50X, which unlocks a 50% bonus for early participants. This has helped accelerate inflows and position MAGACOIN Finance as a speculative leader in the 2025 altcoin race. Though most forecasts suggest a $5 target is more realistic than $10 this year, its rapid adoption curve is driving investors to weigh it against larger, more established competitors. The combination of hype, community energy, and presale incentives is giving MAGACOIN Finance a unique role in the discussion, even if $10 remains out of reach in the short term. For risk-tolerant traders, it represents a different kind of opportunity compared to XRP’s more measured path. MAGACOIN FINANCE: One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining traction as one of the best crypto presales to buy in 2025 thanks to its exceptional transparency and audit-backed foundation. The project has passed a full smart contract audit by Hashex and features a fully KYC-verified team, offering rare legitimacy in today’s market. These verified credentials have made it a standout choice among analysts and investors alike. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Far From Double Digits Dogecoin continues to trade in the $0.10–$0.35 range, and most analysts forecast a potential rise to just $0.50–$0.58 by the end of 2025. Despite its meme coin status and strong cultural relevance, DOGE has not demonstrated the fundamental support necessary to fuel a rally toward $10. Even the most bullish technical models cap Dogecoin’s upside in the low single digits. As a result, analysts generally dismiss $10 as an unrealistic target within the current cycle, leaving DOGE trailing behind XRP, Cardano, and speculative plays like MAGACOIN Finance. Conclusion — XRP Out Front, MAGACOIN Rising Among the four tokens compared, XRP has the strongest analyst support for hitting $10 first in 2025, with momentum and institutional buying pushing it closer to the milestone. Cardano’s $10 target remains highly ambitious, while Dogecoin’s fundamentals leave it far short of double-digit valuations. MAGACOIN Finance is carving out a different role, riding speculative interest and presale-driven hype that continues to draw inflows. For investors tracking the $10 race, XRP appears the most likely to cross the finish line first. Still, MAGACOIN Finance’s growing presence in the conversation underscores how quickly sentiment can shift when community energy and investor incentives align.

Nasdaq-listed CaliberCos (CWD) recently announced a groundbreaking decision: the board of directors has officially approved a long-term CaliberCos LINK investment strategy. This pivotal move into the cryptocurrency space marks a new chapter for the company and signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets. What Drives CaliberCos’s Bold LINK Investment? CaliberCos’s decision isn’t a casual dip into crypto; it’s a carefully planned, long-term commitment.

This group will consist of cryptocurrency experts, tasked with executing and overseeing the entire investment policy. Their expertise will be crucial in navigating the complexities of the crypto market. Funding for this ambitious CaliberCos LINK investment will come from several strategic sources. CaliberCos plans to leverage its existing cash reserves, providing a solid foundation for initial acquisitions. Additionally, the company intends to utilize an Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) program. This offers flexibility and access to capital as needed. Furthermore, the issuance of equity-based securities will play a role, allowing for broader participation and diversified funding for their Chainlink holdings. Why Chainlink (LINK) for Institutional Portfolios? Chainlink (LINK) stands out as a critical infrastructure layer in the blockchain ecosystem. It acts as a decentralized oracle network, securely connecting smart contracts on various blockchains with real-world data, events, and payments. This capability is vital for the functionality and expansion of decentralized applications (dApps) and the broader DeFi landscape. CaliberCos’s choice of LINK underscores its strategic importance. Here are key reasons why Chainlink attracts institutional attention: Reliability: Chainlink provides tamper-proof, high-quality data feeds, essential for secure and accurate smart contract execution.

Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for CaliberCos Embarking on a significant cryptocurrency investment, especially for a Nasdaq-listed entity, comes with its own set of challenges. The crypto market is known for its volatility, which can lead to rapid price fluctuations. CaliberCos will need to manage this risk carefully, relying on the expertise of its dedicated committee. Regulatory landscapes are also continually evolving, requiring vigilance and adaptability to ensure compliance. However, the opportunities presented by this CaliberCos LINK investment are substantial. Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is a growing trend, signaling a maturation of the asset class. By positioning itself early with a long-term view, CaliberCos aims to capitalize on potential growth in the decentralized finance sector. This move could also enhance its brand as an innovative and forward-thinking company, potentially attracting new investors and talent. CaliberCos’s decision to pursue a long-term CaliberCos LINK investment strategy is more than just a financial allocation; it’s a statement. It reflects a clear vision for the future, where traditional finance increasingly converges with the digital economy. By meticulously planning its entry, forming an expert committee, and choosing a foundational asset like Chainlink, CaliberCos is strategically positioning itself for potential long-term success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. This bold step could inspire other traditional firms to explore similar avenues, further legitimizing and accelerating the adoption of digital assets globally.

The platform is built on Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs) developed by Atomic Finance, which Lygos acquired earlier this year. DLCs enforce bilateral lending agreements directly on Bitcoin’s base layer, with an external oracle attesting to facts like BTC-USD prices, but not controlling the funds. Borrowers and lenders sign Contract Execution Transactions, meaning settlement happens entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain without custodians or smart-contract risk. “True non-custodial means exactly this,” CEO Jay Patel said in an emailed announcement on Thursday. “No participant other than the borrower and lender can move the funds.” Lygos supports up to $100 million, with BTC collateralized in a native 2-of-2 script and USDC/USDT issued on Ethereum. The model avoids wrapped bitcoin or synthetic collateral, keeping custody native on both sides of the transaction. During the 2021 crypto bull market, centralized lenders such as Celsius Network , Voyager Digital and BlockFi drew billions in deposits by promising high yields. But these returns were often built on risky, interconnected loans. The system unraveled in 2022, when the collapse of the Terra-Luna stablecoin and the bankruptcy of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) left many of the major lenders exposed. Mass withdrawals followed, forcing firms to freeze assets and file for bankruptcy. Customers lost much of their deposited funds , and the reputation of bitcoin lending took a severe hit. By enforcing agreements directly on the Bitcoin layer 1, Lygos said it can restore confidence with transparent, enforceable contracts and no reliance on custodians. The debut marks a fresh attempt to reimagine bitcoin credit markets, this time with non-custodial rails.",Finance|Crypto Lending|Non-Custodial|Lending|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-28 12:00:00

XRP’s clarity from regulatory battles and its role in cross-border payments position it for solid growth. Cardano, with its focus on peer-reviewed governance, is expected to gain traction as smart contract adoption rises. Analysts suggest both tokens could double, offering 2x returns for cautious investors. Yet for those aiming higher, newer entrants may provide exponential upside. Bull markets reward early conviction. Investors who identified Ethereum in 2016 or Solana in 2020 reaped life-changing gains. Now, attention is turning toward emerging presale projects capable of replicating such trajectories. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the key names in this narrative, offering the potential for multiples far greater than XRP or ADA. Ethereum and Polkadot build utility layers While disruptive tokens make headlines, infrastructure plays like Ethereum and Polkadot continue to build long-term foundations. Ethereum remains the dominant Layer 1 for DeFi, while Polkadot’s parachain model has become a hub for interoperability. Both could double or triple during the cycle, offering safer exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE unlocks PATRIOT50X incentive The presale performance of MAGACOIN FINANCE has reinforced confidence in its breakout potential. Each funding round has sold out rapidly, underscoring demand from both whales and retail participants. To mark its achievement, MAGACOIN is unlocking a 50% EXTRA bonus for investors, exclusive to those who act now with the code PATRIOT50X. This limited-time reward amplifies the project’s narrative, giving new entrants an additional reason to position early. With forecasts pointing toward 70x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as one of the most asymmetric opportunities of the cycle. Portfolio positioning into 2025 Investors entering now face a spectrum of choices: steady 2x gains from XRP and ADA, structural 3x growth from Ethereum and Polkadot, and exponential multiples from disruptors like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This blend of assets represents the core of smart portfolio strategy heading into the bull market. Conclusion XRP and Cardano may deliver reliable 2x returns, and Ethereum and Polkadot could offer 3x growth. But MAGACOIN FINANCE, unlocking progress with its PATRIOT50X bonus and aiming for 70x upside, stands out as the boldest play of the cycle. For those balancing stability and exponential potential, this mix could define 2025’s breakout winners.

The wider altcoin market, however, is doing well, as evidenced by the 4% gain in the CoinDesk 80 Index in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index has gained nearly 1%. ""Bitcoin is drawing its third rising daily candle, trading above $113K on Thursday morning,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at the FxPro, said in an email. ""The growth of altcoins, coupled with the rise in stock indices, has created an environment of increased risk appetite, while BTC's decline to $110K has restored its attractiveness to buyers."" Derivatives Positioning BTC's rise in price from Tuesday is characterized by a drop in open interest (OI) in USDT- and dollar-denominated perpetual futures across major exchanges, including Bybit, Binance, OKX, Deribit and Hyperliquid, and low spot market volumes. (Check the Chart of the Day). The same is true for ether. The divergence between the price performance and trends in OI and volumes, raises a question about the sustainability of the gains. In the past 24 hours, SOL, DOGE and ADA have registered an increase in futures OI, while the other major cryptocurrencies have seen capital outflows. Funding rates (calculated on an 8-hour basis) for most majors have receded to near zero, indicating a neutral sentiment. On the CME, BTC futures OI remains well below December highs while the annualized three-month basis remains under 10%. However, options OI has increased to 42.89K BTC, the highest since May 29. In ETH's case, the CME futures OI has risen to a record 2.2 million ETH, signaling robust institutional participation. On Deribit, BTC put options continue to trade at a higher premium than calls across all tenors, indicating a bearish regime shift. BTC's implied volatility (IV) term structure remains upward-sloping with September expiry options trading at mid-to-high 30 IVs. In ETH's case, the call bias has notably weakened since early this week. Block flows on OTC network Paradigm featured butterfly option strategies in BTC and an outright purchase of the Aug. 30 expiry ether call at the $5,000 strike. Token Talk YZY , the Solana-based memecoin linked to Ye (Kanye West), appears to have left more than 70,000 wallets with losses, according to blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps. The token was pitched as part of a broader “YZY Money” ecosystem, including payment rails and a branded card, but structural flaws in supply distribution and liquidity design quickly tilted risk the toward retail. Over 51,800 addresses apparently lost $1–$1,000, 5,269 wallets lost $1,000–$10,000 and 1,025 wallets lost $10,000–$100,000, Bubblemaps said. Three traders lost more than $1 million each and 108 wallets booked six-figure losses. On the flip side, just 11 wallets made $1 million or more, 99 wallets booked $100,000+, and about 2,541 cleared at least $1,000 in profit — meaning less than 0.1% of traders captured meaningful upside. The crowd overall is down $8.2 million, despite insiders pocketing millions. Bubblemaps’ data shows profits were brutally concentrated, with the top 11 winners capturing nearly all meaningful gains. Structural flaws were evident: 70% of supply was reserved for Yeezy Investments LLC, 20% sold to the public, and 10% used for liquidity. The pool was seeded only with YZY tokens, not paired with stablecoins, leaving it vulnerable to liquidity drains — similar to the LIBRA token collapse in Argentina..

Analyst Darkfost, contributing to CryptoQuant, highlights that the Bitcoin Supply in Profit ratio has hit a critical 90.4%. This isn’t just a number; it’s a key indicator that often signals major shifts for the entire bull market. What does this elevated ratio truly mean for Bitcoin’s journey? Decoding the Bitcoin Supply in Profit Metric What exactly is the Bitcoin Supply in Profit ratio? Simply put, it measures the percentage of circulating Bitcoin supply whose current price is higher than the price at which it was last moved on-chain. When this ratio is high, it means most holders are sitting on gains. Darkfost’s analysis points out that historically, this metric usually hovers around 75%. However, during strong bull markets, it often stays above 90%. This 90% threshold acts like a critical barometer. When the market is booming, many investors are profitable, keeping the ratio high. But what happens when this momentum shifts? The past offers some telling clues about how the market responds to these levels. Navigating the Critical 90% Bitcoin Supply in Profit Threshold History provides a powerful lesson. Darkfost’s research indicates that a drop below the 90% Bitcoin Supply in Profit level has frequently preceded a market correction. These corrections can be short-term pullbacks or more significant mid-to-long-term downturns. It’s a signal that more investors might be taking profits, or new buyers aren’t stepping in as aggressively. Think of it like a tightrope walk. As long as Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, the ratio stays elevated, fueling optimism. But if the market falters, even slightly, those in profit might decide to sell, triggering a cascade that pushes the ratio down. This makes the current 90.4% level particularly sensitive. For investors, this means paying close attention to this metric. It’s not a definitive prediction, but a strong indicator of market sentiment and potential turning points. Are we witnessing the final stages of the current rally, or is this merely a pause before another leg up? Strategic Insights for Your Bitcoin Journey Understanding the Bitcoin Supply in Profit ratio offers valuable insights for your investment strategy. It highlights the potential for increased selling pressure if the market sentiment shifts. While it’s tempting to chase gains, remember that market dynamics can change quickly. Here are some actionable considerations: Monitor Closely: Keep an eye on the daily movements of this ratio. Tools like CryptoQuant provide real-time data. Risk Management: Consider adjusting your risk exposure if the ratio begins to decline significantly from the 90% level. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, corrections can present buying opportunities, but timing is crucial. Diversification: Never put all your eggs in one basket. The challenge lies in distinguishing between a temporary dip and a more sustained correction. This metric helps provide context to price action, making it a powerful addition to your analytical toolkit. The Road Ahead: Will the Bull Run Endure? The current 90.4% Bitcoin Supply in Profit ratio places the market at a pivotal crossroads. Analyst Darkfost emphasizes that this juncture will ultimately determine the continuation of the bullish trend or the onset of a correction. The market is holding its breath, waiting to see which path Bitcoin will take. Whether we see a triumphant push higher or a necessary consolidation phase, staying informed about these on-chain metrics is absolutely vital. They offer a unique lens into the collective behavior of Bitcoin holders, providing an edge in understanding market sentiment beyond mere price charts. In conclusion, the Bitcoin Supply in Profit ratio at 90.4% is more than just a statistic; it’s a critical barometer for the health of the current Bitcoin bull market. While historical patterns suggest a potential for correction if this threshold is breached downwards, the market’s resilience remains to be tested. Savvy investors will use this powerful on-chain metric to inform their strategies and navigate the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

The recent defense of this zone has given bulls a temporary cushion, yet selling pressure is mounting as volatility continues to drive uncertainty. Some analysts warn that further declines may follow if buyers fail to regain momentum, putting Bitcoin’s resilience to the test. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Plunges To Lowest Since 2018: Strong Sell Signal Flashes Top analyst Axel Adler highlights a key onchain signal that sheds light on the current market structure. According to Adler, Bitcoin’s Normalized Address Activity (NAA) dropped sharply from 60% — the level at which the $124,000 all-time high was formed — down to just 30%. This decline reflects a clear cooling in transactional intensity, with fewer coins moving on-chain. While this signals that short-term supply is weakening and immediate selling pressure has eased, it also raises questions about whether there is enough demand to fuel another rally. The balance between cooling activity and sustained support will be decisive. If Bitcoin holds $110K and demand reemerges, the market could stabilize. But if volatility keeps pressuring buyers, the risk of deeper corrections remains firmly on the table. Bitcoin Long-Term Seller Base Expands According to Adler, while Bitcoin’s short-term supply activity has cooled, long-term dynamics reveal a different story. The annual Normalized Address Activity (NAA) has climbed from 30% — recorded when Bitcoin was trading near $80,000 — to 40% today. This steady increase shows that more holders are willing to realize profits at higher levels, gradually broadening the seller base. For context, the peak of selling activity in this cycle occurred in September 2023, when the annual NAA hit 85% with Bitcoin priced around $37,000. That marked a period of heavy distribution at lower valuations. By contrast, the current phase reflects a more balanced environment, where selling pressure is elevated compared to earlier this year but still far below peak cycle extremes. Adler suggests this positioning indicates Bitcoin has entered a “mid-stage” phase of distribution, where profit-taking grows but the structural trend remains intact. Despite this, price action underscores hesitation. Bitcoin is holding above critical support at $110,000, but has so far failed to reclaim higher supply zones that would confirm bullish continuation. The market now sits at a crossroads, with speculation rising about the next major move. Whether buyers can overcome expanding long-term selling pressure will likely decide if Bitcoin stabilizes for another rally or faces a deeper corrective wave. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Compression Signals Pause – Market Digests Recent Volatility Bulls Push To Test Key Levels Bitcoin is trading near $112,900 after a series of volatile swings that pushed the price down from recent highs above $123,000. The chart highlights how BTC has struggled to reclaim lost ground, with short-term momentum still capped by resistance levels. After defending the $110,000 zone, buyers are attempting a recovery, but the structure suggests that a more decisive move is needed to shift sentiment. Currently, BTC remains below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which hover between $113,000 and $115,000. These levels form the immediate barrier for bulls, and breaking above them would be crucial to altering momentum in favor of an upside push. A successful retest and hold of $115,000 could signal the start of renewed strength, setting the stage for another attempt at the $120,000–$123,000 resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces Risk As Binance Leverage Ratio Skyrockets To Record Levels On the downside, failure to break higher keeps BTC vulnerable. A rejection near current levels could open the door to another retest of $110,000 support, with deeper risks extending toward $108,000. Market sentiment remains cautious, and the next few sessions will likely determine whether Bitcoin can reclaim bullish momentum or remain stuck under pressure. For now, $115,000 stands as the critical line in the sand.

In the post , he affirmed that XRP’s current consolidation is similar to 2017. He suggests the asset could repeat the performance that sent it to its former peak, which stood until 2025. Reviewing Historical Performance The chart posted by Xoom places two consolidation phases side by side. The first spans the years leading up to 2017, when XRP traded within a tightening range before breaking out into a major rally. The breakout began from a symmetrical triangle and experienced a brief pause, consolidating within a horizontal channel. The breakout carried the asset to $3.36, smashing through resistance levels. The journey began at under $0.01, and culminated in over $3, showing the strength of XRP’s price rallies. XRP consolidating in a similar manner as the 2017 consolidation. pic.twitter.com/LJbkrdYaXo — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 27, 2025 The Current Setup The second consolidation pattern is shown in the current market, where XRP is in the second phase of the breakout pattern. The asset spent the years following the 2017 breakout consolidating before a surge of over 500% between November 2024 and January 2025 pushed it into the horizontal channel. The asset has spent much of 2025 consolidating within that channel. However, it recently experienced a sharp rise to a new all-time high of $3.65 , testing the resistance at the top of the channel. XRP’s price is shown consolidating directly beneath this line, similar to the way it traded under $0.3 before its explosive advance in 2017. If the asset can surpass this resistance, a confirmed breakout could set it on a path toward unprecedented targets. The chart also includes support levels that resemble the structure of the earlier breakout, reinforcing the comparison and confirming a floor for XRP if its price declines. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? Xoom’s chart suggests that if XRP follows a similar trajectory to its 2017 pattern, a decisive breakout above the resistance at $3.65 could unlock higher targets. While he did not provide specific targets, recent analysis suggests that surpassing that target could send the asset toward double digits . In the previous move, once XRP cleared resistance, its price accelerated rapidly and extended far beyond the consolidation ceiling. If the same relationship between consolidation and breakout were to occur, XRP’s next phase could see price discovery far beyond its current range.

A recent report has cast a spotlight on a concerning trend: possible crypto insider trading happening right before companies announce significant cryptocurrency investments. This practice raises serious questions about market fairness and transparency in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. What’s Fueling Suspicions of Alarming Crypto Insider Trading? The Fortune Crypto report recently brought a critical issue to light. It suggests that individuals with advance knowledge might be buying company stock. This happens just before their firms publicly disclose major cryptocurrency investments. This practice hints at potential crypto insider trading . We’ve seen several striking examples that illustrate this pattern: Nasdaq-listed MEI Pharma saw its stock price surge. This occurred after the company revealed its Litecoin (LTC) investment earlier this month. Similar patterns emerged with SharpLink Gaming and Mill City Ventures. Their stocks also moved significantly following investments in ETH and SUI, respectively. These sudden stock movements raise questions. They suggest that confidential information might be leaking, allowing certain individuals to profit unfairly from these corporate crypto buys. How Does Crypto Insider Trading Potentially Unfold in Corporate Deals? Experts believe that advance information could be reaching company insiders or privileged investors. This allows them to ""front-run"" the official announcements. Essentially, they purchase stock knowing that an upcoming positive announcement will likely boost its value. This is a classic characteristic of crypto insider trading . Consider the implications of such actions: Unfair Advantage: A select few gain profits at the expense of ordinary investors who lack this privileged information. Market Integrity: It erodes trust in the fairness and transparency of financial markets, both traditional and digital. Regulatory Challenge: The decentralized and often less regulated nature of the crypto market can make detection and enforcement more complex. This scenario underscores the need for robust oversight. It ensures a level playing field for everyone involved and prevents illicit gains through confidential information. Why is Vigilant Regulatory Oversight Crucial Against Crypto Insider Trading? The recent report strongly emphasizes the need for continuous regulatory oversight. Without strict rules and enforcement, the integrity of both traditional stock markets and the emerging crypto space is at risk. Regulators must adapt to new forms of potential crypto insider trading . The digital asset landscape is evolving rapidly. Therefore, regulators face the challenge of keeping pace with new investment vehicles and potential loopholes. This includes monitoring corporate announcements related to crypto. Key aspects for regulators include: Enhanced Monitoring: Implementing sophisticated tools to detect unusual trading patterns before announcements. Clear Guidelines: Establishing explicit rules for corporate disclosures regarding crypto assets. Strong Enforcement: Taking swift action against individuals or entities found engaging in illicit activities. Ultimately, strong oversight protects investors and maintains confidence in the financial system. It helps ensure that corporate crypto buys benefit the company and its shareholders fairly, not just a select few with insider knowledge. The potential for crypto insider trading ahead of corporate crypto buys is a serious concern. It highlights the ongoing tension between market innovation and the fundamental need for fairness. As more companies embrace digital assets, the call for vigilant regulatory oversight becomes louder. Protecting market integrity ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. This strengthens trust in both traditional and digital financial ecosystems. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is crypto insider trading? A: Crypto insider trading involves using non-public, material information about a company’s upcoming cryptocurrency investments to trade its stock or related assets for personal profit. This gives an unfair advantage over other investors. Q2: Why is crypto insider trading a concern for investors? A: It undermines market fairness and transparency. When some individuals profit from privileged information, it erodes trust, discourages participation from ordinary investors, and can lead to market instability. Q3: What examples of suspected crypto insider trading were highlighted in the report? A: The report pointed to stock surges at companies like MEI Pharma (after a Litecoin investment), SharpLink Gaming (ETH investment), and Mill City Ventures (SUI investment) that occurred just before public announcements. Q4: How can regulators combat crypto insider trading? A: Regulators can implement enhanced monitoring tools, establish clearer disclosure guidelines for corporate crypto holdings, and enforce strict penalties against those found engaging in illicit trading practices. Q5: Does this issue affect the broader cryptocurrency market? A: While directly impacting company stocks, suspicions of insider trading can indirectly harm the broader crypto market by fostering distrust and potentially inviting stricter regulations that affect all participants.

As bullish expectations for SOL grow, an updated analysis has emerged from cryptocurrency analysis platform Snatiment. Accordingly, Santiment noted that Solana continues its upward trend and investor confidence is at an 11-week high. Stating that Solana has finally made a breakthrough, Santiment stated that the price has surpassed $211.7 and is approaching the resistance line formed in February. “Solana finally had a little breakthrough of his own. SOL price nearly broke the February price resistance to climb above $211.70. Retail investors are making 5.8 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, and investor confidence is reaching an 11-week high. Popular analyst Lark Davis also shared his SOL predictions alongside Santiment. According to Davis, Solana's recent move signals optimism among investors and a potential breakout to $255. Solana has been rejected three times from the $205 level, but higher lows and continued buying pressure suggest momentum is building, according to analyst Lark Davis. “The setup of the ascending triangle formation on the Solana chart clearly suggests the next target is $255. Daily volume exceeding $9 billion also highlights strong market participation and supports the bullish outlook,” Davis said. It was also stated that Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital’s joint $1 billion Solana acquisition plans and Pantera Capital’s $1.25 billion Solana move supported SOL’s recent rise.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on August 28, ZachXBT wrote: “Ripple holders provide nothing of value to the industry except exit liquidity for insiders, thus are not worth supporting.” He added that the same applies to Cardano ( ADA ), Pulsechain, and Hedera ( HBAR ). What the XRP community did to, bro?😂 — Ducky Royal (@TheDuckyRoyal) August 28, 2025 The comment immediately sparked reactions from traders and community figures, with some mocking the harsh criticism and others agreeing that certain altcoins have failed to deliver meaningful adoption despite large market capitalizations. XRP price action The timing of the remarks comes as XRP has been attempting a rebound, gaining 3.2% over the last 24 hours but still down 7.5% over the past month. The token recently saw renewed attention after CME XRP futures smashed $1 billion in open interest , fueling speculation over future ETF approval. ZachXBT’s remarks have shown the divide between crypto communities defending long-term utility and critics who see large-cap tokens as primarily speculative assets propping up insiders. Whether the “exit liquidity” label sticks may depend on upcoming regulatory developments and the success, or lack thereof, of enterprise adoption in the coming months.

Неделя началась мощно: $219 млн притока в биткоин-ETF и $444 млн в эфир-ETF. Всего $663 млн за день. Это контраст с предыдущими неделями оттоков и турбулентности. Возможно, инвесторы начинают менять настроение. Главный триумфатор – Эфириум. Фонд BlackRock ETHA привлек $314,9 млн. Fidelity FETH добавил $87,4 млн, а Grayscale Ether Mini Trust – еще $53,2 млн. Bitwise, 21Shares и Invesco тоже показали рост. Единственным минусом стали оттоки из Grayscale ETHE – $29,1 млн. При этом дневные торги эфир-ETF превысили $3,75 млрд, а совокупные активы достигли $28,8 млрд. Биткоин-ETF показали скромнее, но тоже уверенно. Лидером стал Fidelity FBTC с $65,6 млн. За ним почти вровень BlackRock IBIT ($63,4 млн) и Ark 21Shares ARKB ($61,2 млн). Bitwise, VanEck и Grayscale тоже внесли вклад. Ни один биткоин-ETF не зафиксировал оттока. Общий объём торгов достиг $4,5 млрд, а активы под управлением – $143,6 млрд. Технический анализ Биткоина указывает на прорыв Прогноз цены Биткоина становится оптимистичным. Появилась институциональная поддержка в ETF-потоках. BTC торгуется около $113 000 после удержания поддержки на уровне $111 000.На 2-часовом графике актив остается внутри нисходящего канала, но технические данные указывают на растущий бычий импульс. RSI поднялся выше 60. Это указывает на рост спроса. MACD развернулся в бычью зону. Он дает сигнал на продолжение. Цена тестирует 50-SMA в районе $111 900 – уровень, который не раз был и поддержкой, и сопротивлением. Прорыв выше $116 850 откроет путь к $120 900. Свечные паттерны подтверждают накопление, длинные тени возле $111 000 показывают активные покупки. Отсутствие медвежьих свечей говорит о снижении давления продавцов. Если цена удержится выше $112 000 и продолжит формировать более высокие минимумы, у быков есть шанс протолкнуть рынок к $124 500. Институционалы смотрят на долгосрочную перспективу Для трейдеров путь ясен. Выше $116 850 – импульс к $120 900 и $124 500. Ниже – возврат к $108 695. Общая структура указывает на нарастающую волатильность. Она может скоро разрешиться в пользу быков. Притоки в ETF показывают: институциональный капитал открывается для долгосрочного цикла. Нарратив о возможном движении Bitcoin к шестизначным цифрам остается в силе. Возможно, даже к $1 млн. Это связано со стабильным потоком принятия. Плюс ликвидность возвращается.

The company successfully raised an impressive $58 million, signaling strong investor confidence in its mission to revolutionize payments. This significant capital injection positions Rain to accelerate its growth and further develop its cutting-edge solutions in the stablecoin space. What Does This Funding Mean for Rain, the Stablecoin Payment Platform? Rain’s recent $58 million Series B funding round is a massive vote of confidence from prominent investors. Sapphire Ventures led this crucial investment, underscoring the growing interest in stablecoin-powered financial services. This capital infusion will undoubtedly fuel Rain’s ambitious plans and expand its operational capabilities. While the specific use of the new capital was not fully disclosed, it strongly suggests a significant expansion of Rain’s infrastructure and service offerings. This investment is poised to help Rain solidify its position as a leading Stablecoin Payment Platform in the competitive fintech landscape. Who is Backing Rain’s Vision? The funding round attracted a diverse and powerful group of investors, highlighting the broad appeal and potential of Rain’s business model. Alongside Sapphire Ventures, other notable participants included: Dragonfly Capital Galaxy Ventures Endeavor Catalyst Samsung Next Lightspeed The involvement of such high-caliber firms provides Rain with not only financial backing but also strategic guidance and industry expertise. These partnerships are invaluable as Rain continues to innovate and scale its operations as a premier Stablecoin Payment Platform . The Future of Payments: Stablecoin Card Issuance? One of the most intriguing aspects of Rain’s development is its reported work on a stablecoin-based card issuance solution. This initiative could be a game-changer, bridging the gap between the world of digital assets and everyday spending. Imagine using a debit or credit card directly linked to your stablecoin holdings, allowing for seamless transactions at millions of merchants worldwide. This solution aims to make stablecoins more accessible and practical for daily use, potentially eliminating the need for constant conversions between crypto and fiat. It represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption for the entire Stablecoin Payment Platform ecosystem. Why Stablecoins are Revolutionizing Payments Stablecoins offer unique advantages that make them ideal for modern payment solutions. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are pegged to stable assets, such as the US dollar, maintaining a consistent value. This stability is crucial for transactions where price fluctuations would be a major deterrent. Furthermore, stablecoin transactions leverage blockchain technology, which typically offers: Faster Settlement Times: Transactions can clear in minutes, not days. Lower Fees: Especially for cross-border payments, stablecoins can be significantly more cost-effective. Global Accessibility: Payments can be sent anywhere in the world with internet access. These benefits are precisely why platforms like Rain are so vital in evolving the global payment infrastructure. Challenges and Opportunities for a Stablecoin Payment Platform While the future looks bright, any innovative Stablecoin Payment Platform faces its share of challenges. Regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, requiring platforms to remain agile and compliant. Educating users about the benefits and security of stablecoins is also paramount for widespread adoption. However, the opportunities are immense. The global payments market is vast, and stablecoins offer a compelling alternative to traditional systems, particularly for underserved populations and international remittances. Rain’s strategic funding positions it well to navigate these challenges and capitalize on the growing demand for efficient, reliable digital payment solutions. Rain’s Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape Rain’s success and its innovative approach to stablecoin payments could have a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency industry. By demonstrating a clear, practical use case for stablecoins, Rain helps to legitimize and drive further adoption of digital assets. This investment validates the potential of blockchain technology to solve real-world financial problems. The development of a stablecoin-based card issuance solution could also set a new standard for how crypto assets integrate into our daily lives, paving the way for other platforms to follow suit. Rain is clearly positioning itself as a key player in shaping the future of finance. In conclusion, Rain’s impressive $58 million funding round marks a significant milestone for the Stablecoin Payment Platform . With strong investor backing and ambitious plans, including a stablecoin-based card, Rain is poised to make a profound impact on how we interact with digital money. This development underscores the growing importance and potential of stablecoins in creating a more efficient, accessible, and stable global payment system.

Data from CoinGlass shows that since August 21, spot ETH ETFs have attracted $1.83 billion in inflows, compared to just $171 million for their Bitcoin counterparts. The momentum continued on Wednesday, when nine Ether funds saw inflows of $310.3 million, while 11 Bitcoin ETFs managed only $81.1 million. Ether’s price has also reflected stronger recovery, gaining 5% from its Tuesday low, whereas Bitcoin advanced just 2.8% in the same period. Market commentators, including Ethereum educator and investor Anthony Sassano, described the rapid divergence between the two assets as “brutal.” Ether Gains Favor Among Institutions The growing appeal of Ether ETFs is further highlighted by institutional participation. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted that spot Ether ETFs have now accumulated nearly $10 billion in inflows since July, pushing their 13-month total to $13.6 billion. Much of this growth has come in recent months, signaling a decisive tilt in investor preference. By comparison, spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been trading for 20 months, hold a cumulative $54 billion in inflows. While Bitcoin remains dominant in sheer volume, the pace of Ether inflows has raised eyebrows across Wall Street. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that investment advisers are leading the charge, holding $1.3 billion in Ether ETF exposure. Among them, Goldman Sachs stands out as the top holder, with $712 million. The “Wall Street Token” Part of this shift is being attributed to broader regulatory and market dynamics. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation in July, Ethereum’s strong presence in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets has bolstered its position as a financial infrastructure backbone. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck echoed this sentiment in a recent interview, calling Ethereum “very much what I call the Wall Street token.” As Ether ETFs gain momentum, they appear to be reshaping the institutional investment narrative once dominated by Bitcoin. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,550, down 1% on the day. Despite the slight dip, the broader trend suggests investors are increasingly betting on Ethereum as the preferred gateway to blockchain-based financial products.

Global users are prioritizing the safety of their digital assets more than ever, and platforms face rising demands for robust security standards. From a broader perspective, ""verifiable security"" has become a top priority when users choose where to trade. KuCoin is leading this charge, having recently surpassed 40 million registered users worldwide. The exchange has earned three prestigious accolades: ISO 27001:2022 and SOC 2 Type II certifications, plus the top ""AAA"" rating from CER.live, a leading exchange security evaluator. These honors cover everything from global benchmarks to crypto-specific assessments, blending system design with real-world testing. Together, they provide concrete proof of a platform's security strength. What sets them apart is their reliance on independent audits rather than self-promotion, transforming security from vague promises into transparent, trackable systems. This is the foundation of genuine trust—and the reason KuCoin is gaining such widespread user loyalty. Why These Three Certifications Represent the Gold Standard in Security In the Web3 space, real security isn't about bold claims—it's about earning credibility through rigorous, multilayered evaluations. The ISO 27001:2022, SOC 2 Type II, and CER.live ""AAA"" rating stand out as true gold standards because they combine strict criteria, hands-on validation, and industry-wide recognition. ISO 27001:2022 is often called the ""global benchmark"" for information security. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the 2022 update tackles modern challenges like cloud computing, supply chain risks, and AI-driven threats. It requires companies to build a holistic security framework across policies, processes, technology, and team training. For KuCoin, earning this certification means its information security management system meets world-class standards. To get there, the platform overhauled its strategies, tech infrastructure, and staff protocols, creating end-to-end protections for user data. Every step—from encryption to incident response—underwent thorough third-party reviews, confirming KuCoin's ability to protect assets systematically and sustainably. SOC 2 Type II, on the other hand, is the ""real-world proof"" of operational security. Created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for cloud and SaaS providers, it zeroes in on security practices. KuCoin passed a demanding audit by Schellman & Company, earning validation for its controls in data protection, system reliability, and privacy compliance. This shows that KuCoin's safeguards aren't just plans on paper—they deliver consistently during actual trading, bolstering its global compliance efforts and solidifying user confidence. Finally, CER.live's ""AAA"" rating is like a ""security medal"" in the competitive crypto arena. As a specialized evaluator, CER.live assesses over 20 critical areas, including asset transparency, server uptime, vulnerability handling, and wallet management—all vital for safeguarding user funds. Only a handful of top exchanges worldwide hold this elite rating, underscoring its prestige. KuCoin's achievement here highlights its edge in the industry, with top scores across the board proving its practical security excellence. For users, this makes it easier to spot platforms that truly prioritize protection. *CER.live Exchange Security Rating Ranking How Security Certifications Are Reshaping the Competitive Landscape: Triple Honors Are Changing Crypto's Playbook The cryptocurrency market is evolving quietly, with security certifications shifting from nice-to-haves to essential advantages. As platforms vie for dominance, the old focus on user acquisition is giving way to fortified trust barriers. KuCoin's ISO 27001:2022 and SOC 2 Type II certifications, combined with its CER.live ""AAA"" rating, are driving this change. With global regulations tightening, compliance is now the key to operating across borders. Security certifications. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has made a pivotal announcement: they now officially support native USDT on Bitcoin . This isn’t just another update; it’s a game-changer that could significantly enhance how we interact with stablecoins and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. For years, USDT on Bitcoin was primarily facilitated through the Omni Layer, but this new development marks a direct, native integration, promising a more streamlined and efficient experience for users worldwide. What Does Native USDT on Bitcoin Truly Mean? Understanding “native” support is crucial. Previously, if you used USDT on the Bitcoin network, it often relied on the Omni Layer protocol, which sits atop Bitcoin. While functional, it added a layer of complexity. With native support, USDT on Bitcoin transactions can now be processed directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to how regular Bitcoin transactions occur. This means the stablecoin leverages Bitcoin’s inherent security and robustness more directly than ever before. This shift represents a significant leap forward in stablecoin infrastructure. It simplifies the process for developers, exchanges, and everyday users. Instead of relying on a secondary protocol, transactions involving USDT on Bitcoin are now more integrated, potentially leading to greater adoption and utility across the crypto landscape. Unlocking Immense Benefits: Why Native USDT on Bitcoin Matters The implications of this move are substantial, bringing a host of advantages for anyone involved in the crypto space. This direct integration of USDT on Bitcoin promises to make stablecoin transfers more efficient and user-friendly. Here are some key benefits: Enhanced Speed: Native transactions often lead to faster confirmation times, meaning your stablecoin transfers can complete more quickly. Reduced Fees: While transaction fees vary, direct integration can potentially streamline the fee structure, making stablecoin transfers more cost-effective. Increased Security: By directly leveraging Bitcoin’s battle-tested security model, users can have even greater confidence in the safety of their USDT on Bitcoin holdings. Simplified Integration: For wallets, exchanges, and other services, integrating native USDT becomes more straightforward, fostering broader support and accessibility. Broader Utility: This move expands Bitcoin’s utility beyond just being a store of value, solidifying its role as a foundational layer for other digital assets. Navigating the Path Forward: Challenges and Future Outlook for USDT on Bitcoin While the benefits are clear, every major development comes with its own set of considerations. The widespread adoption of native USDT on Bitcoin will depend on several factors. For instance, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers will need to update their systems to fully support this new native standard. This integration process takes time and resources, meaning a gradual rollout of full support is likely. Moreover, user education will be vital. Many users are accustomed to USDT on other networks like Ethereum (ERC-20) or Tron (TRC-20). Explaining the nuances of native Bitcoin integration and how it differs from previous methods will be key to smooth adoption. Despite these challenges, the long-term outlook is incredibly positive. This move by Tether could pave the way for more innovative financial products and services built directly on the Bitcoin network, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and decentralized applications. A Transformative Step for Stablecoins and Bitcoin Tether’s decision to support native USDT on Bitcoin represents a significant milestone for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores Bitcoin’s enduring importance as a foundational blockchain and enhances the utility of the world’s leading stablecoin. By offering a more direct, secure, and potentially efficient way to transfer value, Tether is not only improving its own product but also contributing to the broader maturation of the digital asset space. This development empowers users with more choices and reinforces the potential for Bitcoin to serve as a robust backbone for diverse financial innovations. Frequently Asked Questions about USDT on Bitcoin Q1: What exactly is native USDT on Bitcoin? A1: Native USDT on Bitcoin means that Tether’s stablecoin can now be directly issued and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, without relying on intermediary layers like Omni. Q2: How is this different from previous USDT on Bitcoin (Omni Layer)? A2: Previously, USDT on Bitcoin was primarily facilitated via the Omni Layer protocol, which is a separate layer built on Bitcoin. Native support means USDT transactions are now processed directly as standard Bitcoin transactions. Q3: What are the main advantages of this native integration? A3: Key benefits include potentially faster transaction speeds, lower fees, enhanced security by leveraging Bitcoin’s core network, and simpler integration for wallets and exchanges.

EU ministers are gathering to consider moves to put more pressure on the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine while providing Western support for the country. Danes propose sanctioning Russia’s crypto transactions European defense and foreign ministers are arriving in the Danish capital on Thursday to mull measures to convince Russia that continuing the war makes no sense, Politico noted in a report, citing an EU diplomat. Talks will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine and the European Union’s next round of sanctions against the Russian Federation, which invaded its neighbor more than three years ago. Denmark, currently holding the EU presidency , intends to discuss with the ministers ways to “further hamper Russia’s war-financing ability and warfare capability,” according to a document seen by the political news outlet. The hosts are pitching the idea to impose additional sanctions on Russian revenues from oil and gas sales and hit its banking and finance sector, including crypto operations. The report was quoted by Russia’s official TASS news agency. Russia, which allowed companies to use cryptocurrencies in foreign trade settlements, has long been suspected of utilizing digital coins for cross-border payments as its access to traditional financial channels remains severely limited. Crypto platforms and banks allegedly helping Russian entities were recently sanctioned by both U.S. and the U.K. authorities, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The meeting’s program includes a dinner on August 28, a defense ministerial the next day and a foreign ministers’ meeting on Saturday. No final decisions are expected due to the informal nature of the gathering. However, the ministers will be briefed and asked for their opinions on the guarantees formally proposed in the so-called “coalition of the willing” group that includes the U.K. and Ukraine. EU aims at third countries involved in Russia sanctions evasion The Danes are also planning to suggest deploying a new tool to ban Russian exports to non-EU nations that may be involved in bypassing sanctions, Politico revealed without elaborating. The European Union is considering imposing sanctions on Russia’s partners, which will be discussed in Copenhagen, Bloomberg confirmed, citing knowledgeable sources. The news agency remarked: “The EU has historically been averse to imposing secondary sanctions … but it appears to have arrived at the limits of what it can do with sanctions targeting Russia directly.” These measures are meant to prevent third countries from circumventing existing restrictions and include a ban on the export, supply or transfer of certain goods to their territories. The U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, which is trying hard to secure a peace agreement with Moscow, has been critical of such policies. Europe’s 19th package of sanctions on the Russian Federation should be announced in early September, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, announced previously. European Union vows to double down on pressure According to David McAllister, chair of the European Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, “this is the moment to double down, not to ease off.” Both the EU and the U.S. should keep the pressure on Russia, and that’s crucial, he told Politico, elaborating further: “Sanctions must be tightened, Russia’s evasion exposed, and military support for Ukraine sustained.” McAllister is convinced Putin “plays for time” and is “waiting for Western resolve to weaken or for political attention to move elsewhere.” “Especially at stake is whether Europe shows it is capable of sustaining support for Ukraine,” the MEP emphasized, a day after the Kremlin rejected the idea of sending European peacekeepers to Ukraine through comments made by its spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The United States’ role in determining Ukraine’s future, “remains indispensable,” David McAllister concluded.

The bank highlighted that bitcoin’s six-month rolling volatility has dropped from nearly 60% at the start of the year to about 30% today, the lowest on record. With volatility converging toward gold, the world's largest cryptocurrency is now only twice as volatile, the lowest ratio on record, the report noted. JPMorgan argued that the digital asset is increasingly attractive for institutional portfolios. On a volatility-adjusted basis, bitcoin’s market cap would need to rise 13%, implying a price of about $126,000, to match gold’s $5 trillion in private investment. By the bank’s models, bitcoin is currently undervalued by around $16,000 versus gold, suggesting room for upside. Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou linked the move to accelerating purchases by corporate treasuries, which now hold more than 6% of total supply, echoing how central bank quantitative easing once dampened bond volatility. Corporate adoption is gaining momentum through equity index inclusion, drawing passive capital inflows, the analysts said. Metaplanet (3350), for instance, was upgraded into FTSE Russell’s mid-cap category and added to global benchmarks, while Nasdaq-listed Kindly MD (NAKA) is raising up to $5 billion after a $679 million bitcoin buy. New entrants like Adam Back’s firm are also aiming to rival MARA Holdings' (MARA) treasury position behind Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), the report added.

In an announcement on August 28, 2025, Tether said it is looking to unlock value on Bitcoin, with plans to launch USDT on RGB coming amid notable expansion in the stablecoin market as major players take advantage of a shift in regulatory approach. “Bitcoin deserves a stablecoin that feels truly native, lightweight, private, and scalable,” said Paolo Ardoino, chief executive officer of Tether. “With RGB, USDT gains a powerful new pathway on Bitcoin, reinforcing our belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of a freer financial future.” Why is USDT key to Bitcoin? Per details on DeFiLlama , Bitcoin is the third-largest chain in terms of total value locked, behind Ethereum and Solana. A lot of this has come amid a spike in decentralized finance activity on Bitcoin, a market analysts say could explode in coming years. Stablecoins are at the heart of the growth, with segments such as real-world assets taking an upward trajectory. “By bringing USDT to RGB, Tether is helping to unlock a new frontier for money on Bitcoin. Users will be able to hold and transfer USDT alongside their Bitcoin in the same wallet, enjoy the benefits of private and sovereign transactions, and even send and receive value offline,” Tether wrote in a blog post. Tether’s USDT currently accounts for over $167 billion market in the $292 billion stablecoin sector. Earlier this month, Tether publshd its Q2, 2025 report that highlighted a $20 billion USDT increase in supply to the date. The company also became one of the largest holders of US debt with $127 billion. Growth potential has seen Tether tap former White House Crypto Council executive director Bo Hines as its strategic advisor for digital assets and US strategy. “I’m thrilled to join Tether at such a pivotal moment, helping to deliver an ecosystem of products that will set the standard for stability, compliance, and innovation in the U.S. market – one that will empower American consumers and help revolutionize our nation’s financial system,” Hines said. Meanwhile, RGB has recently attracted notable attention as a Bitcoin ecosystem project following a successful mainnet release. The protocol allows users to access private, scalable, and user-controlled asset issuance, with this key to the launch of native stablecoin support on Bitcoin. RGB therefore makes it possible for users to directly transact USDT on Bitcoin, potentially bringing the top digital asset to billions of people. Combining Bitcoin’s security and Tether’s stability is a crucial milestone in the quest to make native stablecoin use on Bitcoin a reality, Tether noted. Bitcoin currently trades near $113,300 as bulls attempt to rebound to its all-time high above $124k.

For those closely watching market stability, including participants in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the nuances of such high-profile legal challenges is crucial. This case involves a former Federal Reserve Governor taking on powerful figures, sparking conversations about governance, accountability, and the future of economic policy. What Drives the Lisa Cook Lawsuit Against the Fed? Former Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has initiated a legal battle against formidable opponents: U.S. President Donald Trump, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Her aim is to contest her dismissal from the prestigious position. This bold move comes after President Trump’s decision to fire Cook on August 26, a dismissal she immediately announced she would challenge. The core of this dispute lies in the circumstances surrounding her termination. Cook had been publicly accused of mortgage fraud, an allegation that undoubtedly played a role in her removal. However, the lawsuit suggests that Cook believes her dismissal was unjust or improperly executed, leading her to seek legal recourse. Why Does This Lisa Cook Lawsuit Matter for Financial Markets? A legal challenge of this magnitude, involving a former Fed official and current high-ranking government figures, naturally raises questions about institutional stability and integrity. The Federal Reserve is a cornerstone of the U.S. and global financial system, responsible for monetary policy and maintaining economic stability. Therefore, any internal strife or public legal challenge can have broader implications. Consider these potential impacts: Investor Confidence: Uncertainty surrounding leadership and governance at such a critical institution can make investors wary, potentially leading to market volatility. Policy Perception: The lawsuit might cast a shadow on the transparency and fairness of decision-making processes within the Fed, affecting how its policies are perceived. Precedent Setting: The outcome of the Lisa Cook lawsuit could set a significant precedent for how future disputes involving high-level government appointees are handled. What Are the Challenges in Pursuing the Lisa Cook Lawsuit ? Lisa Cook faces a challenging legal journey. Suing a sitting President, the Fed Chair, and the entire Board of Governors is an undertaking fraught with complexities. The legal framework surrounding such cases is intricate, often involving questions of executive authority, due process, and the specific statutes governing Federal Reserve appointments and dismissals. Key challenges include: Executive Privilege: The defense might invoke executive privilege, making certain internal communications or decision-making processes difficult to access. Burden of Proof: Cook must present compelling evidence to demonstrate that her dismissal was unlawful or violated her rights, especially given the accusations of mortgage fraud. Public Scrutiny: High-profile cases attract immense media and public attention, adding pressure to all parties involved. How Could This Impact Future Federal Reserve Appointments? The resolution of the Lisa Cook lawsuit could profoundly influence how future presidential administrations approach appointments and, crucially, dismissals within independent agencies like the Federal Reserve. If Cook’s suit is successful, it could introduce stricter guidelines or greater scrutiny over the grounds for removing appointed officials, emphasizing the need for robust legal justification. Conversely, if the lawsuit fails, it might reinforce the executive branch’s authority in such matters. Either way, this case will likely become a reference point in discussions about the delicate balance of power between the executive branch and independent governmental bodies, a balance vital for maintaining trust in our financial institutions. A Critical Legal Battle Unfolds The Lisa Cook lawsuit represents a critical juncture for the Federal Reserve and the broader U.S. political landscape. It highlights the intricate interplay between political appointments, allegations of misconduct, and the legal system. As this high-stakes legal drama unfolds, its implications will extend far beyond the courtroom, influencing market sentiment, governance standards, and the perception of accountability at the highest levels of power. This case serves as a powerful reminder that even the most established institutions are subject to legal challenge and scrutiny, reinforcing the importance of transparency and due process in all governmental actions. Keeping an eye on developments here offers valuable insights into the forces shaping our economic and political future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Lisa Cook?

The market is hovering around a critical support confluence, where bulls and bears are competing for short-term control. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH buyers are struggling to reclaim the $4.9K resistance zone, which has rejected the price on multiple attempts. The asset is now compressed within a tight range between the $4.9K ATH and the ascending channel’s midline support around $4.3K, shaping a triangle formation. If the price breaks lower, Ethereum faces a crucial retest of the $4K level, a psychological pivot and liquidity-heavy zone where buyers previously defended aggressively. A sustained hold at $4K could set the stage for another attempt at the ATH, while a decisive breakdown would expose the deeper $3.6K–$3.8K demand region. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH is consolidating between $4.4K support and $4.9K resistance, forming a tight range after its recent rejection at the ATH. The ascending trendline from mid-August continues to provide near-term support, keeping the short-term structure tilted bullish. If Ethereum holds this trendline and breaks above the $4.7K minor high, momentum could quickly carry it back into the ATH region around $4.9K–$5K. Conversely, losing the trendline would likely trigger a liquidity sweep toward $4.2K, aligning with the daily support zone. Until a decisive breakout occurs, ETH is expected to remain inside this wedge-like structure, with volatility building at its boundaries. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Most recently, exchanges recorded a cumulative 628K ETH in outflows, with consecutive daily netflows each near or above -100K ETH. This represents one of the largest and most consistent withdrawal patterns in recent months, signalling a meaningful reduction in exchange liquidity. At the same time, large whale wallets holding between 10K and 100K ETH have steadily expanded their balances to new highs. Mid-sized wallets in the 1K–10K ETH range have remained largely flat, while smaller cohorts have continued to decline. The clear alignment between persistent outflows and growing whale accumulation suggests that institutional-scale demand is actively absorbing circulating supply. This shift carries important implications for market dynamics. With less ETH available on exchanges, the market becomes less liquid on the sell side, making it harder for significant amounts to be sold without pushing prices lower. Meanwhile, as demand continues to increase while supply tightens, the setup favours upward momentum. This structural imbalance can act as a powerful catalyst, positioning Ethereum for further price appreciation once the current consolidation phase resolves.

Investors are watching closely as US stocks opened higher, setting a positive tone for the trading session. This initial boost across the major indices suggests a renewed sense of optimism in the market, capturing the attention of both seasoned traders and new participants alike. But what exactly is driving this promising start? What’s Driving the Initial Boost for US Stocks? When the market opens with gains, it often reflects a collective sentiment shaped by various economic factors. Today’s higher open for US stocks could be influenced by a range of underlying elements, from positive economic data releases to improving corporate earnings forecasts. Moreover, a sense of stability in global markets can often translate into domestic confidence, encouraging investors to engage. It is crucial to understand that even small percentage gains can signal significant momentum. For instance, a slight uptick can indicate that buyers are currently outweighing sellers, pushing asset prices upward. This early movement often sets the stage for the rest of the day, giving an initial glimpse into market direction. Diving Deeper: Performance of Key US Stocks Indices Let’s break down how the primary US stocks indices performed at the open. Each index represents a different segment of the market, offering a unique perspective on the broader economic health: S&P 500: This index, which tracks 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, saw a modest gain of 0.04%. This positive movement suggests broad-based confidence across a wide array of industries. Nasdaq Composite: Known for its heavy concentration of technology and growth stocks, the Nasdaq Composite led the pack with a 0.07% increase. This indicates strong performance in the tech sector, which often acts as a bellwether for innovation and future economic growth. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Representing 30 significant industrial companies, the Dow Jones rose by 0.03%. This slight increase points to stability and positive sentiment within established industrial giants. What This Positive Open for US Stocks Could Mean A higher open for US stocks often generates excitement, but what are the potential implications for investors? Firstly, it can boost investor confidence, leading to further buying throughout the day. This positive feedback loop can sometimes extend for several days, creating upward trends. However, it is also important to remember that early gains do not guarantee an entire day of upward movement. Markets can be volatile, and external news or shifts in sentiment can quickly alter the trajectory. Therefore, while the initial surge is encouraging, a cautious and informed approach remains essential for anyone invested in US stocks . Key Takeaways for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on economic news and corporate announcements. Diversify: Spread your investments across different sectors to mitigate risk. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on your long-term financial goals rather than daily fluctuations. Navigating the Market: Expert Insights on US Stocks Understanding the nuances of the market is vital. Experts often advise looking beyond the opening numbers to grasp the full picture. For instance, while technology stocks on the Nasdaq showed strong gains, analyzing the specific companies driving this growth can offer deeper insights. Are these gains concentrated in a few large players, or is it a broader rally? Furthermore, consider the broader economic context. Are interest rates stable? Is inflation under control? These macroeconomic factors profoundly impact the performance of US stocks over time. Consequently, staying updated on these larger trends helps in making more informed investment decisions. In conclusion, today’s higher open for US stocks is a welcome development, painting an optimistic picture for the trading day. While the gains are modest, they reflect positive underlying sentiment across various market segments. As always, successful investing involves careful observation, a clear understanding of market dynamics, and a commitment to long-term financial planning.

Questo percorso verso gli asset digitali è relativamente nuovo: BTC ha ottenuto l’approvazione del SEC per ETF spot all’inizio del 2024 e ETH a metà 2024. Generalmente, gli ETF spot su Bitcoin tendono a superare quelli su Ethereum in termini di flussi di capitale, poiché Bitcoin è l’asset più grande e con maggiore interesse. Tuttavia, recentemente la situazione è cambiata. Come spiega Sentora: Gli ETF su ETH hanno superato quelli su BTC per sette giorni consecutivi , un trend che potrebbe indicare una rotazione crescente degli investitori e un rafforzamento del sentiment relativo verso ETH.Va precisato che, anche se ETH ha performato meglio di BTC in questo periodo, non significa che la moneta abbia registrato solo afflussi: secondo i dati di SoSoValue , gli ETF su ETH avevano subito deflussi poco prima. Flussi netti degli ETF su Ethereum Anche durante i deflussi, gli ETF spot su Ethereum si comportavano meglio di quelli su Bitcoin, poiché le perdite erano minori. Negli ultimi giorni, i flussi netti sono tornati positivi, con 455 milioni di dollari di afflussi netti registrati martedì. Prima dei recenti flussi negativi, gli ETF spot su ETH avevano registrato flussi netti settimanali positivi da maggio, come evidenziato dal grafico condiviso dalla società di analytics on-chain Glassnode. Last week, institutional investors broke the multi-week run of inflows into US spot #Ethereum ETFs with -105K $ETH in net outflows. However, this week opened on a positive note, with +16.9K #ETH added to positions yesterday. pic.twitter.com/bZzeHdohqE — glassnode (@glassnode) August 26, 2025 La settimana che ha interrotto la serie positiva ha registrato un deflusso netto di circa 105.000 ETH (486 milioni di dollari). Resta da vedere se la fine di questa settimana riporterà il segno verde sul grafico. Indirizzi attivi su Ethereum Un altro indicatore che ETH ha visto recentemente un calo è il numero di Active Addresses , come segnalato da Sentora in un altro post su X. La scorsa settimana circa 3,8 milioni di indirizzi hanno partecipato alle attività di transazione sulla blockchain di Ethereum . Questo valore è in calo rispetto al picco di inizio agosto, ma resta comunque elevato se confrontato con i precedenti mercati rialzisti.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 13:56:58

Fresh projects tied to real assets, major blockchain networks, and trendy tokens with community support are getting attention. Many are asking which types could see the largest gains soon. Upcoming trends may reshape which coins lead the pack. Chainlink (LINK) Source: TradingView LINK floated between $23.52 and $28 this week, inching up 3.93% while staying above its 10-day average of $24.34. Buyers kept nudging the token higher, but the bid keeps stalling two dollars under the 30 ceiling. The 56 RSI and a mild MACD uptick hint that bulls still have energy, though no one is ready to chase at any cost. Zoom out one month and the picture looks brighter. LINK has added 27.55% in 30 days and 61.95% in six months, soundly beating most large-cap rivals. The 100-day average sits at $24.82, almost level with the shorter trend line, so momentum is steady rather than overheated. Volume spikes have been modest, suggesting the move is driven by gradual accumulation instead of frantic hype. If momentum holds, a clean break above $28 puts $30 in play. A push through that mark would open a path to $35, about 25%-35% above today’s midpoint. Failure to clear $28 could send LINK back to $21.21, roughly a 15% slide, with a deeper dip toward $16.73 wiping out about 35%. Right now the bias leans upward thanks to recent gains and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, but traders need to see a daily close over $30 to confirm the next leg higher. Hedera (HBAR) Source: TradingView HBAR trades in a narrow $0.23-$0.26 band after a 4.90% weekly lift that trimmed part of last month’s 16.70% slide. Even with that short-term dip, the token still shows a 21.40% gain over the past six months, keeping it above both its 10-day and 100-day simple averages at $0.24. Momentum looks steady. RSI sits at 57, Stochastic at 69, and MACD edges above zero, all hinting at mild buying drive rather than overheated action. The nearest ceiling is $0.27; clearing it could open a sprint to the next barrier at $0.31, roughly 15%-20% above the current upper band. Support rests at $0.21, then $0.18. A slip to the first floor would shave about 12% from the current midpoint, while a drop to $0.18 would erase around 30% of recent gains. Given the modest upward bias, a break toward $0.27 looks more probable than a plunge to $0.21. If buying volume grows, HBAR could test $0.31 within weeks, adding up to 20%. Failure to hold the $0.24 average would flip sentiment and drag the coin back to the $0.21 line, slicing near 15%. Traders watch that balance as the next move takes shape. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView SOL has sprinted 19.16% in the last 7 days and 11.33% in the past month. Stretch the lens to 6 months and the gain grows to 52.48%. The coin now shifts between $183.88 and $220.07, well above its 10-day average of $206 and its 100-day average of $200.09. Momentum is hot, but the pace is starting to look stretched. Traders eye $234 as the next ceiling. If buyers clear that line, the chart opens toward $270.32, about 24% higher than the top of today's band. The main floor sits at $161.75; a slip there would point to $125.56, roughly 32% under the high side of the current range. Strength gauges back up the bullish case, yet both the 74.67 RSI and 94.62 Stochastic hint at overbought conditions. The recent record says buyers keep winning, so an advance to $234 looks doable. A clean break could lift SOL another 15-25% in the short run. Still, the crowded long side could spark a quick shakeout toward $162, a dip of around 12%. Net take: trend up, but expect a breather before the next jump. According to cryptona price prediction analysis, these technical levels align with broader bullish forecasts for the ecosystem. Ethereum (ETH) Source: TradingView Ethereum smart contract platform pushed higher again. The coin trades between $4245 and $5136 after jumping 13.92% in the past week and 19.87% over the month. It sits near its 10-day and 100-day averages around $4620, showing the rally still has a base. Six-month gains now stand at 101.15%. Market signals stay friendly. The strength index reads 59.86, in the safe zone. The fast oscillator is high at 85.31, flagging strong demand, while momentum adds 24.52. If buyers stay active, the first barrier sits at $5492.31. A clean break there points to $6383, about 30% above the current band. Support rests at $3710.13 and deeper at $2819.04. A dip to the first floor would shave roughly 20%; the second would cut near 40%. Given fresh double-digit gains and positive momentum, the path of least resistance is up. A push toward $5500 looks likely, and a sprint to $6400 cannot be ruled out once the market catches its breath. Conclusion LINK, HBAR, SOL, and ETH stand strong in the 2025 rally, yet XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, targets 20,000% gains through sport-meme fusion, presale access, and community steering.

Cronos USD is my top crypto pick for the next year, driven by strong fundamentals, validator strategy, and potential 10x–20x upside if the deal succeeds. Trump Media’s upcoming crypto ETF and the $5B line of credit for CRO acquisition could drive significant appreciation and ecosystem growth. I prefer YORKU warrant units over YORK equity, but own both, and see this as my third major crypto investment after BTC and ETH. Pre-redemption Yorkville SPAC Disclaimer / Disclosure (very) long CRO-USD , YORK , and YORKU SA Crypto.com’s Cronos The Yorkville Acquisition Corp. ( YORKU , YORK ) SPAC IPO units offered a free peek at their potential deal. Today, that free peek is now a cheap peek. IPO investors got a unit that included a share of YORK as well as a third of a warrant offering the right to buy shares at $11.50 per share. The IPO launched in late June and the deal was announced in late August. Today, shares cost $11.60 and can be redeemed for the cash in trust. The trust was overfunded by $0.05, so started at $10.05 and is now ~$10.12 so for each share you buy you’re risking ~$0.48. That is the price for a ticket to see the market’s reaction to their deal. Their deal is to launch a Cronos digital treasury company. So far, the market reaction to the deal has been strong for the CRO USD (CRO-USD) cryptocurrency: So far, so good Still a strong buy I expect CRO USD to continue to perform well for reasons discussed in Trump Media's Crypto ETF: Cronos The Big Winner . The SPAC equity and units are additional ways to get exposure. So far they’ve moved far less than the crypto itself so could be better ways to add from here. Hopefully as many readers as wanted to loaded up on cheap CRO before the latest announcements (or, better yet, free CRO via the various sign up bonuses that paid out in crypto of your choice). The sheer size and structure of this project will encompass more than the entire current market capitalization of CRO, with the additional commitments of over $400 million in cash and a further $5 billion line of credit facility to acquire additional CRO. This, combined with share lock-ups by each party and the treasury’s validator strategy, make it a unique and compelling offering compared to all other digital asset treasuries. - Kris Marszalek, Crypto.com CEO in 2025 Live AMA with Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder & CEO of Crypto.com . Want to learn more about this opportunity? Cronos Background Reading is where you can catch up. If it is anywhere near as successful as I anticipate, it could make sense to buy at least some now. I intend to focus on this investment and write about it in more detail next year but by that time it could easily be 10x today’s price... I traded some of my BTC to CRO in order to qualify for their Prime Visa ( V ) card. Others might want to too. They have a tiered card system with modest rewards for locking up $500 of CRO to spectacular rewards for locking up $1 million. I am happy to make a significant bet on CRO in part to lightly diversify away from BTC and because I use Crypto.com anyway and think that the site and coin have a promising future. I am getting a 4.74% yield on my CRO in addition to its appreciation, now +64% in a month... The president’s last deSPACed equity, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), is launching an upcoming crypto ETF that by design or accident (narrator: by design) massively overweights a related company’s native token Cronos ( CRO ) which could easily appreciate by 10–20x if the deal successfully launches later this year. Today it trades at ~17% of its all-time high of ~$0.97; it is likely to regain that level and could easily hit 2–3x that level by this time next year... CRO is my favorite crypto asset for the next year... The Crypto.com Exchange offers a somewhat overly complicated but valuable CRO Rewards program. First register for the exchange (this is distinct from their app ) here . Fund the account then go here to select your rewards. They improve with scale from 1K to 5M CRO. Lockup 1K to get $10. Lockup 5K to get $50. At larger scales, you also get a yield: 2% for 10K, 4% for 50K, 6% for 100K, 8.5% for $500K, 9% for 1M, and 9.5% for 5M. If you want to do this small, I’d lockup 5K for the $50 reward and if you want to do this at scale, I like the 5M tier for its highest available yield... Deposit fiat into your Kraken account and execute the necessary trades as specified in the offer. This involves buying $200 of crypto within 30 days. I would buy CRO... Keep your eyes open for more from me and future developments regarding CRO! According to Trump Media Group, the strategy is to, Capture long-term value by allocating substantially all of the Company’s cash reserves to acquiring CRO. By focusing on yield-generating, ecosystem-aligned assets rather than traditional non-productive holdings, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy aims to enhance capital efficiency, establish itself as a disciplined, long-term participant in the evolving digital asset landscape and benefit from early-stage market positioning in a growing asset. The strategy includes the establishment and operation of a validator node by the Company and the delegation of CRO under management to the validator. The operation of the validator will enable direct participation in the network’s security and governance, while generating native staking rewards that are reinvested to compound CRO holdings over time and help offset operational expenses. The validator will be established and maintained by a crypto-native team with a deep understanding of the Cronos ecosystem, aiming to maximize staking rewards and attracting additional delegation of CRO from third-party CRO holders. Caveat I loved CRO at $0.05-0.10 and still like it at $0.35-0.40, but note that YORK and YORKU have not moved as far as fast so could be better from here. Conclusion I prefer the YORKU units to the YORK equity but own both. TL; DR I've owned Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for over a decade; this is my third significant cryptocurrency investment for your consideration.",DJT|BTC-USD|ETH-USD|DJTWW|CRO-USD|YORK|YORKU|YORKW,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|CRO|ZRX|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-28 14:00:10

That future might be closer than you think! Recent reports from BWE News, citing Bloomberg, reveal that the United States plans to record its US GDP on blockchain technology, specifically across nine different blockchains, including Bitcoin. This is an unprecedented move that could redefine how we perceive and trust economic information. Why is the US Adopting US GDP on Blockchain? The decision to leverage blockchain for recording gross domestic product (GDP) data stems from a growing need for enhanced transparency and data integrity. Traditional methods of data collection and storage, while robust, can sometimes be prone to errors, manipulation, or simply lack the real-time verifiability that modern digital systems offer. Enhanced Security: Blockchain’s cryptographic nature makes data incredibly secure and tamper-proof. Immutable Records: Once data is on a blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring a permanent and verifiable history. Increased Trust: By making economic data more transparent and auditable, public trust in official statistics could significantly improve. This initiative represents a bold step towards integrating advanced digital ledger technologies into core governmental functions, promising a new era of economic data management. How Will the US GDP on Blockchain System Function? The plan involves utilizing nine distinct blockchains for recording GDP data. While the specifics of which nine blockchains (beyond Bitcoin) are not fully detailed, this multi-chain approach suggests a strategy to diversify risk and potentially leverage the unique strengths of different blockchain networks. Bitcoin, known for its unparalleled security and decentralization, would likely play a foundational role in this architecture. Here’s a simplified look at the potential process: Economic data points would be collected by relevant agencies. These data points would then be hashed and timestamped, creating a unique digital fingerprint. This fingerprint would be recorded on multiple chosen blockchains, creating redundant and verifiable entries. Any future audit or verification would involve cross-referencing these distributed records. This distributed ledger technology (DLT) approach aims to create an incredibly resilient and verifiable system for tracking the nation’s economic output, making US GDP on blockchain a reality. What Are the Revolutionary Benefits of This Move? The implications of moving US GDP on blockchain are far-reaching, offering numerous benefits for economists, policymakers, and the general public alike. The shift promises to make economic data more reliable and accessible than ever before. Consider these advantages: Fraud Prevention: The immutable nature of blockchain significantly reduces the risk of data manipulation or fraudulent reporting. Real-time Insights: Depending on implementation, data could potentially be updated and verified much faster, providing more current economic insights. Global Standard: The US setting this precedent could encourage other nations to adopt similar blockchain-based data management systems, fostering greater international data consistency. Enhanced Auditing: The transparent and verifiable ledger simplifies the auditing process for economic statistics. This move is not just about technology; it’s about building a more trustworthy and efficient system for understanding our economy. Navigating the Challenges of Implementing US GDP on Blockchain While the benefits are substantial, implementing US GDP on blockchain on such a grand scale also presents considerable challenges. These hurdles must be carefully addressed to ensure the success and integrity of the system. Technical Complexity: Integrating nine different blockchains and ensuring interoperability will require significant technical expertise and infrastructure. Data Privacy: While GDP data is often aggregated, concerns around sensitive economic indicators and ensuring appropriate access controls will be paramount. Regulatory Frameworks: New regulations and legal guidelines will be necessary to govern the use and interpretation of blockchain-recorded economic data. Scalability: Managing the vast amount of data generated by an entire nation’s GDP on multiple blockchains will test the scalability limits of current technology. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the successful and secure deployment of this innovative system. The Future Impact of US GDP on Blockchain This pioneering initiative by the United States could set a global standard for how national economic data is managed and disseminated. It signals a strong endorsement of blockchain technology by a major world economy, potentially accelerating its adoption across various governmental and institutional sectors worldwide. The move could foster greater transparency in global economic reporting and create a more interconnected and verifiable financial ecosystem. Ultimately, the decision to record US GDP on blockchain is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a statement about the future of trust and transparency in the digital age. It opens up exciting possibilities for more accurate economic analysis and more informed policy-making, shaping the trajectory of national and global economies for decades to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean to record US GDP on blockchain? A1: It means that key economic data points contributing to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be cryptographically secured and recorded on distributed ledger technologies, or blockchains, making the data immutable and highly transparent. Q2: Why is the US choosing nine different blockchains for this? A2: Using multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, likely aims to enhance security through diversification, leverage the unique features of different networks, and increase the resilience and decentralization of the data storage system. Q3: How will this improve data transparency and security? A3: Blockchain’s inherent properties, such as immutability and cryptographic security, ensure that once data is recorded, it cannot be tampered with. This creates a verifiable and auditable trail, significantly boosting transparency and trust in the data. Q4: Will this affect how the public accesses GDP data? A4: While the exact public access mechanism is yet to be fully defined, the move towards blockchain generally implies greater transparency and potentially more real-time, verifiable access to economic indicators for researchers, businesses, and the public. Q5: What are the main challenges for this initiative? A5: Key challenges include the technical complexity of integrating multiple blockchains, ensuring data privacy for sensitive economic information, developing appropriate regulatory frameworks, and ensuring the scalability of the system to handle national data volumes. Q6: What is the significance of including Bitcoin among the nine blockchains? A6: Including Bitcoin, the most secure and decentralized blockchain, lends significant credibility and an unparalleled level of security to the initiative, reinforcing the commitment to data integrity.

Related Reading: Could Pi Network Land On Coinbase? Hackathon Winner Thinks So The token is trading at $3, up 4% in the last seven days. It has a market cap of about $176 billion. That puts XRP back among the top three crypto assets by capitalization. Regulatory Clarity Gives XRP A Running Start In July 2023 a US court found that programmatic sales of XRP on public exchanges were not securities, while some institutional sales remained in question. The matter moved again in August 2025 when both the SEC and Ripple dismissed appeals, preserving that split ruling. That step removed a long-standing legal overhang that had discouraged many institutional players from moving forward in the US. Market Snapshot And On-Chain Tools Reports show recent price peaks vary by source — $3.84 on some trackers and $3.65 on others — but liquidity metrics have improved. The XRP Ledger settles transactions in three to five seconds and typically charges under $0.01 in fees. In March 2024 the ledger added an on-chain automated market maker via the XLS-30 amendment. Payments And Remittances Could Drive Demand Global remittances to low- and middle-income countries reached over $680 billion in 2024, with average fees near 6%, while the UN target is 3%, Forbes said. Ripple already runs production corridors with partners such as SBI Remit in Japan and Onafriq in Africa, connecting payments to the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and 27 African countries. If treasurers and regulators in those corridors accept crypto rails, XRP could win steady, utility-driven flows rather than pure speculation. Products And New Channels For Investors Ripple launched RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, in 2025 with reserves custodied at BNY Mellon. Multiple issuers have filed S-1 and 19b-4 forms for US spot XRP products. Those filings could create a fresh demand channel if approvals follow. According to Finder’s expert panel in July 2025, the average XRP price is expected to be $2.80 by the end of 2025 and $5.25 by 2030 — projections that depend on adoption, liquidity, and market-access steps such as ETFs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For Triple Surge Vs. Bitcoin – Details Where XRP Could Stand In Five Years According to Forbes, if corridor volume shifts from fiat and stablecoins into XRP, and if custody and ETF channels open, demand could grow in a sustained way. In that scenario, price upside would be supported by both real payment flows and passive investment. If those pieces do not align — if stablecoins dominate corridors, if CBDCs gain traction, or if execution issues persist — XRP may stay widely traded but see limited real-world settlement use.

Expert Explains Why It’s Now XRP’s Time,https://timestabloid.com/gold-had-its-run-expert-explains-why-its-now-xrps-time/,"Crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull shared a message on social media emphasizing XRP’s growing relevance in the evolving financial system. In the post, he stated, “Gold had its run. Now it’s XRP time,” positioning XRP as a faster and smarter asset designed for the digital era. He described the token as being built with the capabilities to act as the bridge currency for a modernized financial framework. According to his statement, as gold and other real-world assets continue to be digitized, XRP is emerging as the infrastructure of the movement. He concluded by signaling personal readiness for this transition and asked others if they were prepared as well. Gold had its run. Now it’s $XRP time It’s faster, smarter, built for the digital age and it's positioning to be the bridge currency of the new financial system. While the world digitizes gold, XRP is becoming the rails it moves on. I'm so ready! Are you? pic.twitter.com/ehX9WvExr1 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) August 27, 2025 Key Themes from the Tweet The tweet describes XRP’s function as a utility asset rather than just a store of value. X Finance Bull emphasizes that XRP is “faster” and “smarter,” pointing to its technical strengths, particularly in settlement speed and efficiency . By calling it “built for the digital age,” he highlighted its design as a purpose-driven financial tool capable of supporting an increasingly tokenized economy . The reference to XRP as a bridge currency points to its potential role in connecting banks, fintech platforms, and payment networks, aligning with the concept of interoperability in global finance. His statement that XRP could be the “rails” on which digitized gold moves illustrates a broader vision where the digital economy requires settlement infrastructure, and XRP fits that role. Details from the Attached Infographic The attached image compares XRP to gold across several categories to emphasize how XRP could operate in areas traditionally dominated by gold. It described scarcity and supply by pointing out that gold is limited by natural availability, while XRP has a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, with a portion in escrow for predictable scarcity. The infographic also addressed their roles as neutral settlement assets, noting gold’s long history in trade settlement and presenting XRP as a neutral bridge currency linking banks and networks. Speed and liquidity were another focal point. Gold is globally liquid but costly and slow to move physically, while XRP was described as offering instant liquidity across borders at near-zero cost. The image further presented gold as a haven in times of crisis and positioned XRP as a hedge against outdated financial systems and dependence on legacy networks, such as SWIFT. In terms of recognition, the graphic stated that gold has long been trusted as a universal store of value, while XRP is gaining recognition among banks, regulators, and fintechs as a digital settlement standard. It also highlighted how gold continues to support central bank reserves, whereas XRP is being considered for liquidity solutions within ISO 20022-compliant frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another point included modernization, with gold now tokenized on blockchains and XRP serving as the infrastructure to support not just tokenized gold but other real-world assets. Lastly, it presented gold as a centuries-old protector of wealth and described XRP as a digital equivalent positioned for resilient payments in a digital-first economy. X Finance Bull’s post frames XRP as an asset with utility beyond speculation, emphasizing its role in settlement, liquidity, and interoperability within the digital economy. The message presents XRP as the digital foundation for future finance, capable of supporting tokenized assets and facilitating global transactions. Through his statement, X Finance Bull reaffirmed confidence in XRP’s positioning and encouraged others to consider its place within the modern financial landscape.

50817338,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80568,1756389756,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Wealth Rankings Just Updated: See Where You Stand,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-wealth-rankings-just-updated-see-where-you-stand/,"Crypto influencer John Squire recently shared updated figures on the XRP wealth distribution, highlighting how much XRP holdings are required to be placed within the top tiers of accounts. His post presented an updated breakdown, noting that an account with 2,397 XRP already qualifies within the top 10 percent, while holdings of 8,370 XRP secure placement in the top 5%. According to the data, accounts with 50,026 XRP fall into the elite 1 percent, while those holding 350,492 XRP or more are within the top 0.1 percent. At the very peak, only 0.01 percent of accounts hold balances starting at more than 6.6 million XRP. Squire emphasized that contrary to perceptions of being late to accumulation, many XRP holders are already ahead of the majority of accounts. His message suggested that the distribution data provides a different perspective on how concentrated XRP holdings are across the network. $XRP Wealth Ranking just updated • 2,397 XRP → You’re already top 10% • 8,370 XRP → Top 5% • 50,026 XRP → Elite 1% • 350,492 XRP → Top 0.1% Most think they’re late… Truth is, you’re likely way ahead. pic.twitter.com/K9VtIpm0mv — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) August 27, 2025 Historical Comparison and User Commentary The tweet drew observations from community members regarding how the thresholds have shifted over time. A user identified as Kashta noted that in 2020, the balance required to be in the top 1 percent was 79,000 XRP, compared to the latest figure of 50,026 XRP. Kashta questioned whether this change reflected significant selling from top accounts or simply redistribution across wallets, while adding that they were still actively accumulating XRP. Kashta also speculated about the possibility of becoming part of the 0.01 percent category, while raising concerns about the risks of becoming a long-term holder without comparable returns. Another user, VanceGG, commented on the structure of the ranking itself, pointing out that the data does not account for individuals who spread their holdings across multiple wallets. According to VanceGG, this practice could mean that the actual thresholds to enter each bracket are higher than reported, potentially requiring three to five times the stated amounts. He illustrated this by suggesting that the 0.01 percent category may realistically represent balances closer to 900,000 to 1.5 million XRP when considering distributed ownership. Implications of Wealth Concentration The updated figures underline the high level of concentration among the largest XRP accounts, with fewer than 700 accounts holding over 6.6 million XRP each. This concentration raises important considerations about liquidity, market influence, and the potential impact of large account movements on price stability. The downward adjustment in required balances for top-tier rankings, when compared to previous years, also highlights evolving dynamics in distribution patterns and investor behavior. At the same time, the thresholds reinforce the idea that many smaller investors may be closer to higher tiers than they initially assume. For example, an account with 10,000 XRP, while modest by comparison to the largest holders, places the account within the top 4 percent of all wallets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Such statistics contribute to ongoing debates about accessibility, accumulation strategies, and the long-term positioning of retail investors within the XRP ecosystem. John Squire’s update on XRP wealth distribution provided a data-driven snapshot of the current state of account balances on the network. With just 2,397 XRP required to enter the top 10 percent, the information suggested that many holders are positioned more strongly than they realize. However, the commentary from users also highlighted important nuances, such as the historical decline in top 1 percent thresholds and the impact of multiple-wallet ownership.

Key macroeconomic statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis — such as Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers — are now accessible onchain through Chainlink Data Feeds, the company announced in a blog post on Thursday . Six data points in total are being published, including both absolute levels and annualized percentage changes. The data is being made available across ten blockchain networks, including Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX) and Optimism (OP). Chainlink says the feeds will update monthly or quarterly, mirroring the release schedules of their traditional counterparts. The initiative opens up new possibilities for developers building in DeFi and beyond. For example, lending protocols could adjust interest rates based on GDP trends, while prediction markets might incorporate the PCE Index to crowdsource inflation forecasts. ""Bringing U.S. government data onchain unlocks innovative use cases for blockchain markets, such as automated trading strategies, increased composability of tokenized assets, the issuance of new types of digital assets, real-time prediction markets for crowdsourced intelligence, transparent dashboards powered by immutable data, and DeFi protocol risk management based on macroeconomic factors,"" the blog post said. Chainlink has deepened its engagement with U.S. policymakers this year, including several meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to help clarify how blockchain infrastructure fits within existing broker-dealer and transfer agent rules, as well as other lawmakers to help establish the GENIUS Act, the company said. By bringing federal economic indicators onchain, Chainlink is attempting to normalize blockchain as a destination for mission-critical public data — offering transparency and composability that traditional systems don’t easily support, it said.

We're excited to announce that Chainlink and the United States Department of Commerce ( @CommerceGov ) have worked together to bring U.S. government macroeconomic data onchain. https://t.co/qHIw8DyEgX These new Chainlink Data Feeds securely deliver critical information around key… — Chainlink (@chainlink) August 28, 2025 In a blog post Chainlink shared that through its oracle infrastructure, critical indicators such as Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers are now available across ten blockchain systems. This move also marks the first time U.S. government economic data has been published onchain in a verifiable way. According to the firm developers can immediately integrate the Chainlink Data Feeds into decentralized applications (dApps), unlocking use cases such as automated trading strategies, composable tokenized assets, prediction markets, and risk management tools for DeFi protocols. Chainlink’s Expanding Role in Policy and Compliance This latest collaboration with the government body builds on Chainlink’s growing engagement with U.S. regulators and policymakers in 2025. Earlier this year, Chainlink participated in meetings with the SEC to address broker-dealer and transfer agency compliance, leading to interpretive guidance that advanced the regulatory clarity for blockchain infrastructure. The company also worked with the SEC Crypto Task Force, demonstrating how Chainlink ACE embeds compliance logic directly into onchain infrastructure. Chainlink’s leadership, including co-founder Sergey Nazarov, has been active in discussions with U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Tim Scott on crypto market structure legislation. In July, the White House highlighted Chainlink in a report from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, underscoring its role as critical infrastructure powering stablecoins, tokenized funds, and other digital assets. The signing of the GENIUS Act —a landmark federal law establishing a framework for stablecoins—further reinforced Chainlink’s position at the heart of regulatory and market adoption. Why Oracles Are Essential Infrastructure Chainlink has emerged as the industry standard for secure oracle services, enabling more than 2,400 integrations across DeFi and institutional finance. Its Data Feeds secure tens of billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL) and are relied upon by top protocols such as Aave, Lido, Compound, and GMX. Beyond crypto-native platforms, institutions like Swift, Euroclear, UBS, Fidelity International, and ANZ are leveraging Chainlink to accelerate tokenization and blockchain adoption. Chainlink Data Feeds, already supporting trillions in transaction value, are ISO 27001 certified and SOC 2 Type 1 attested, ensuring enterprise-grade security for financial institutions. These feeds are powered by the Onchain Data Protocol (ODP), which serves as a cornerstone of the broader Chainlink platform, making them a trusted bridge between public institutions and blockchain applications. Implications for Adoption By connecting BEA’s macroeconomic indicators directly to decentralized markets, the Department of Commerce and Chainlink are charting a new course for blockchain adoption. Developers and institutions alike now have trusted access to U.S. government economic data, enabling innovations that merge public transparency with financial automation. For both policymakers and crypto developers, the integration of real-world economic data represents a milestone moment in the maturing relationship between digital assets and traditional financial systems.

Coins like Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Polygon MATIC are gaining traction with analysts setting ambitious targets, from Solana’s potential ETF-driven surge to XRP’s regulatory clarity and Dogecoin’s payment integrations. But while these names dominate headlines, smart money is also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star many compare to early meme coin runs that delivered staggering 1000x growth. Solana Price Prediction 2025: The Speed King of Blockchain Solana has kept its name in every best altcoins to buy in 2025 list because of its unmatched performance. The network has already tested over 107,000 transactions per second, proving it can scale without heavy fees. Traders are watching a cup-and-handle formation that could fuel a breakout if SOL crosses the $210 level. Institutional money is flowing too. The REX Shares Solana Staking ETF already surpassed $150 million AUM with record inflows, showing Wall Street appetite for SOL exposure. If the SEC approves spot ETFs in Q4, analysts say Solana could average $425, with optimistic forecasts placing the Solana price prediction 2025 as high as $1,000. XRP Crypto Forecast: The Regulatory Clarity Advantage XRP has delivered one of the strongest breakouts of the year, surging past the $2.90 zone and now eyeing the $5 mark. Analysts believe the next rally could begin if the SEC greenlights spot XRP ETFs by October deadlines. Forecasts suggest up to $8 billion in inflows once approval hits, which could push prices into double digits. Some bullish models place the XRP crypto forecast between $6-$8 by Q4. Beyond ETFs, Ripple is also targeting a U.S. banking charter, which would boost institutional adoption further. Whale activity confirms this bullish setup, with 900 million XRP scooped up in just 48 hours this quarter. The mix of legal clarity, ETF potential, and banking expansion keeps XRP on the shortlist of best altcoins to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Price Target: From Meme to Payment Utility Dogecoin continues to surprise skeptics. The Grayscale and Bitwise ETF filings add legitimacy, positioning DOGE alongside top-tier crypto assets. Massive whale accumulation of $500 million worth of DOGE this quarter adds weight to bullish projections. Traders are eyeing the Dogecoin price target of $0.45 in a moderate scenario, while optimistic charts push for $1.50 if ETF approvals and payment adoption align. Institutional entry and real-world use cases mean DOGE still carries explosive altcoins for 2025 potential, especially if retail FOMO returns. Polygon MATIC Outlook: The Ethereum Scaling Engine Polygon’s recent on-chain growth is impressive, with over 18.9 million monthly users and $4.12 billion locked across protocols. The Polygon MATIC outlook for 2025 is mixed technically—oversold conditions suggest a rebound from $0.35 support levels, while zkEVM reliability at 99.2% builds confidence for developers. Price targets range from $0.74 to $1.57, which would represent strong gains from its base levels. By combining technical recovery with strong fundamentals, MATIC remains one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for investors seeking Ethereum-linked growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Whales’ Quiet Play While Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and MATIC dominate headlines, analysts are pointing at a quiet trend—capital flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE . Market watchers compare it to past meme coin explosions where early investors captured exponential growth before mainstream hype. Whales are positioning early, suggesting confidence in its long-term narrative. With 1000x crypto potential 2025 speculation building, some believe MAGACOIN could be the hidden gem among explosive altcoins for 2025. Positioning itself as the next meme-driven powerhouse, MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from the same FOMO cycles that once fueled Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Top Altcoin to Buy in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to lead lists of the top altcoins to buy in 2025 because it’s built on verified trust. From its Hashex-audited smart contract to a fully KYC-certified team, every aspect of the project prioritizes investor protection. These foundations make it more than a trend — they establish it as a serious, secure contender for major upside. Final Thought: Which Coins Could Deliver the Next 1000x? Investors looking at the best altcoins to buy in 2025 are focusing on the four giants—Solana with ETF catalysts, XRP with regulatory clarity, Dogecoin with payments adoption, and Polygon with Ethereum scaling. Each brings unique strengths that support bullish targets. But beyond these well-known names, MAGACOIN FINANCE adds a new flavor of excitement. With analysts comparing it to past meme coin booms, it stands out as a rising project and the best crypto to buy now. For those willing to look beyond the usual suspects, MAGACOIN may be the one altcoin where quiet whale interest could soon turn into mainstream mania.

From faster payments to anonymous wagering, cryptocurrencies are now an integral part of sports betting and online casinos. Whether you’re betting on football, spinning a roulette wheel, or playing esports, crypto offers speed, security, and global accessibility. But which coins are most popular among bettors—and where should you place your bets in 2025? Let’s break it down. Most Widely Used Cryptocurrencies in Betting Bitcoin (BTC) As the pioneer of digital currency, Bitcoin remains the most widely accepted cryptocurrency in the betting industry. Nearly every sportsbook or casino that supports crypto will list BTC first. Bettors prefer it for its security, brand recognition, and universal availability. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the second-most common crypto in betting. Thanks to its smart contract capabilities, it powers decentralized betting applications in addition to being a widely accepted currency for deposits and withdrawals. Tether (USDT) and Other Stablecoins Volatility is one of the biggest challenges in crypto betting, but stablecoins like USDT solve that problem. Pegged to the U.S. dollar, USDT allows players to keep their bankroll stable while enjoying instant transactions. Many sportsbooks now prioritize stablecoins because they combine speed with price reliability. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin’s fast and inexpensive transactions make it a favorite for bettors who want an efficient alternative to Bitcoin. Many platforms list it alongside BTC, ETH, and USDT as part of their core options. Dogecoin (DOGE) What started as a meme has become a practical option for gamblers. With low transaction costs and quick processing, Dogecoin is supported on an increasing number of sportsbooks and casinos. Its community-driven appeal also adds to its popularity. Other Notables (XRP, TRX, BNB, SOL) Beyond the leading five, platforms often support a wider variety of coins. Ripple (XRP) is used for its fast settlement times, Tron (TRX) for its low fees, Binance Coin (BNB) for multi-chain compatibility, and Solana (SOL) for its scalability. The choices continue to expand as betting platforms embrace multi-chain ecosystems. Where to Bet with Crypto?

Imagine having official economic figures, previously locked away in government databases, now flowing directly onto decentralized networks. This is precisely what the U.S. Department of Commerce and Chainlink (LINK) are achieving with their groundbreaking launch of an on-chain macroeconomic data feed. This initiative represents a significant leap forward, making critical economic insights accessible to the blockchain ecosystem. It bridges the gap between reliable, real-world data and the innovative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi), setting a new standard for data transparency and utility. What is This Revolutionary On-Chain Macroeconomic Data Feed? The U.S. Department of Commerce, through its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), is now providing key macroeconomic indicators directly to blockchain networks via Chainlink. This collaboration brings authoritative data into the decentralized space. The feed includes six crucial economic indicators: Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index Final sales to private domestic purchasers Other essential economic metrics Initially, this vital on-chain macroeconomic data will be available across 10 prominent blockchains. These include Arbitrum, Ethereum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Base. The data will update regularly, with quarterly and monthly refreshes, ensuring users always access the latest official figures. Unlocking Powerful DeFi Innovations with On-Chain Macroeconomic Data Making this official economic information available on-chain unlocks a wealth of new possibilities for financial innovation. Decentralized applications (dApps) can now integrate these reliable data points, leading to more sophisticated and robust financial products. Consider these transformative applications: Automated Trading Strategies: Protocols can automatically adjust based on shifts in real GDP or inflation indicators. Tokenized Assets: Create tokenized assets whose value or performance is tied directly to macroeconomic trends. Real-Time Prediction Markets: Enhance accuracy and trust in markets predicting economic outcomes. DeFi Risk Management: Improve risk models for lending, borrowing, and insurance protocols by incorporating official economic health metrics. This influx of high-quality on-chain macroeconomic data empowers developers to build more resilient and responsive DeFi solutions, reducing reliance on centralized data providers and increasing transparency. Why Reliable On-Chain Macroeconomic Data is a Game-Changer for Finance The significance of this development extends beyond just new products. It fundamentally changes how decentralized finance interacts with the real world. By sourcing data directly from a trusted government entity, Chainlink ensures the integrity and authenticity of the information. This move enhances the credibility of the entire blockchain ecosystem. It also provides a transparent, immutable record of economic performance, something traditional financial systems often struggle to offer with the same level of verifiable integrity. The availability of on-chain macroeconomic data through Chainlink’s oracle network provides a secure and tamper-proof bridge. The Future is Here: Bridging Traditional Data and Blockchain This collaboration between the U.S. Department of Commerce and Chainlink marks a pivotal moment. It signals growing recognition from traditional institutions about the value and potential of blockchain technology. This integration paves the way for further adoption of decentralized systems in mainstream finance.

Tether, which is the largest stablecoin issuer, shared this in its blog post in August, marking a breakthrough for tokenized assets on Bitcoin. USDT would become the first-ever native stablecoin on the Bitcoin network, leveraging RGB technology to enable the trading of the dollar-pegged token.USDT Comes Natively to BitcoinThe entire architecture of the Bitcoin blockchain has ensured that tokenized assets do not exist natively on the “most secure and decentralized network.” Nonetheless, RGB aims to address this with its next-generational technology.The protocol launched on the Bitcoin mainnet in mid-July with its 0.11.1 release, ushering in compatibility for smart contracts and asset issuance systems. It came with tokenization tools that allow users to create and send digital assets on the Bitcoin and Lightning Networks.Now, Tether is leveraging this protocol to launch USDT natively on the Bitcoin blockchain. This ensures that users can transact the stablecoin directly on the network, bringing lightweight payments to the billions of users who use it.Notably, the technology enables users to hold and move Bitcoin and USDT through the same wallet while maintaining their lightweight and confidential nature. The transactions are processed off-chain, allowing users to enjoy the same privacy and decentralization benefits associated with the Bitcoin network.The Native Smart Contract Functions that Bitcoin DeservesReacting to the development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino insisted that Bitcoin is finally getting the stablecoin feel that it deserves. He added that USDT would gain a “new pathway with Bitcoin” through the RGB Protocol, reestablishing its long-standing sentiment that the leading cryptocurrency should offer more to users beyond its reputation as a store of value.Moreover, this is just one of the broader efforts to roll out DeFi for Bitcoin users. Industry leaders have tipped this push to unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity domiciled on the Bitcoin network to other chains, boosting transactional activities and TVL of all involved parties.Remarkably, Ardoino earlier teased the prospect of USDT’s availability on the Bitcoin network in April, calling it a return to its natural habitat. He confirmed that the stablecoin will launch on the Bitcoin Lightning Network during the interview, powered by Taproot Assets.Meanwhile, with RGB, users can do more. The protocol also allows users to hold and move non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and custom tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Tether Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-28 15:26:42

The funding will support the expansion of BitScaler, the firm's adapter that scales native Bitcoin without wrapped tokens, custodial bridges, or ""message passing or other insecure alternatives,"" according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. The company aims to make Bitcoin the settlement layer for millions of markets, including tokenized stocks, bonds, stablecoins, and other real-world assets. “We want users to trade any asset, traditional or decentralized, and settle with Bitcoin-grade security, without custodians ever being involved,” CEO and founder Dr. Chandra Duggirala said. Portal plans to use the new capital to expand its grants program and onboard both institutional and community liquidity providers. Pilot integrations with wallets and custody platforms are also underway to showcase non-custodial swaps. If Bitcoin succeeds in becoming the default settlement layer for cross-chain trading, it could redraw the map of global crypto liquidity, anchoring tokenized markets directly to the world’s largest and most secure blockchain.

That admission is catching attention because it frames XRP’s technical setup not as a standalone altcoin story but as one forming strength relative to Bitcoin, the market’s dominant benchmark. A double bottom is a classic reversal pattern where price tests a support, rebounds, retests the low, and then breaks higher, signaling waning selling pressure and rising buying interest. On a BTC-paired chart, this suggests XRP may begin outperforming Bitcoin, highlighting shifts in relative market strength, critical insight for traders and allocators who judge performance by BTC pairs, which is significant because it’s not just about USD gains but about relative market share. Why does a Bitcoin maximalist noticing XRP matter? Well, Benjamin Cowen’s insights influence traders who prioritize long-term, structural metrics. When a respected BTC analyst highlights an altcoin setup, it prompts neutral observers to reconsider assumptions, especially for XRP. As a result, Xaif Crypto amplifies Cowen’s admission underscores that technical signals are gaining attention beyond partisan bias. On-chain data further supports this optimism. For instance, XRP is presently witnessing low speculative bias and price stability, thanks to funding rates dropping to nearly zero. Furthermore, analysts also point out that XRP’s unique utility within the XRP Ledger, including faster settlement times and partnerships with financial institutions, provides additional fundamental support that complements the technical narrative. With XRP approaching a descending triangle breakout, bullish momentum continues to build for the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency. Market commentator DeGram noted , “A breakout above 3.20 could ignite momentum toward 3.50 and eventually challenge the key 3.65 resistance zone.” At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $3.02 , representing a 3.7% increase in the past week. Conclusion Benjamin Cowen’s acknowledgment of XRP’s double bottom versus Bitcoin signals a noteworthy shift in market perception. While technical patterns require confirmation and caution, this recognition from a leading Bitcoin maximalist highlights XRP’s potential to outperform in the coming cycles with all eyes on a descending triangle breakout.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-28 15:34:17

The token held firm at the $0.24 level, a zone that market participants view as a key area of institutional support. Trading volumes surged to 179.67 million units during peak sessions, far exceeding typical daily averages, a signal of accumulating interest among larger investors. The move comes as Hedera’s enterprise-focused blockchain continues to gain traction with major financial and technology players. This week, global payments giant SWIFT launched operational testing of Hedera’s distributed ledger technology for cross-border settlement infrastructure. At the same time, Grayscale has rolled out a Delaware-based investment vehicle providing exposure to HBAR, underscoring growing regulatory and institutional alignment around the asset. The combination of high trading volumes, narrow price movements, and visible corporate adoption has led analysts to suggest that sophisticated investors are strategically positioning for Hedera’s next phase of growth. The hashgraph-powered network can process thousands of transactions per second, a scalability feature that appeals to enterprises such as Google and IBM as they explore tokenization and other blockchain-based solutions. Technical Indicators Breakdown HBAR operated within a measured $0.01 range during the 24-hour period from 27 August 15:00 to 28 August 14:00, fluctuating between $0.24 and $0.24 with limited directional momentum. The digital asset established price support around $0.24-$0.24 levels where institutional buying emerged consistently, while resistance developed near $0.24-$0.24 where profit-taking materialized. Volume analysis revealed concentrated activity during the 20:00 hour on 27 August with 179.67 million units transacted, significantly exceeding the 24-hour average of 41.75 million units. The concluding trading hour demonstrated renewed institutional interest with HBAR settling at $0.24, indicating potential for sustained upward movement contingent on volume maintenance above established benchmarks. HBAR recorded measured volatility during the final hour from 28 August 13:23 to 14:22, advancing from $0.24 to a session high of $0.24 before settling at $0.24, representing a net appreciation of 0.33%. The period included two notable volume concentrations at 13:42 and 14:13 with 9.20 million and 6.81 million units respectively, corresponding with defined price movements.

Chainlink price rose amid the announcement , with LINK token jumping 6% at the time of writing to change hands near $26. Chainlink teams up with US government for onchain initiative The US Department of Commerce (DOC) wants to bring macroeconomic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) onchain, and the agency is tapping into Chainlink. As announced in a blog post on August 28, 2025, the partnership aims at delivering key US economic indicators, including real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, and Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers to the blockchain. With Chainlink riding bullish sentiment as a leading decentralized oracle network, its latest partnership only helps cement its status. Notably, the oracle network will help bring the macroeconomic data to ten blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism. The move marks the first time the government is bringing its economic data to the blockchain, with features such as onchain verifiability, security and transparency key. DOC will leverage Chainlink’s Onchain Data Protocol (ODP) to offer access to data, with developers able to easily integrate these into decentralized applications (dApps). “By working with the US Department of Commerce to bring US macroeconomic data onchain, Chainlink’s growing ecosystem of Web3 and institutional users now have secure access to new categories of data to unlock new markets,” Chainlink noted in the blog post. Integration will help unlock innovative use cases such as automated trading strategies, tokenized asset composability, real-time prediction markets, and decentralized finance protocol risk management. These will tap into macroeconomic factors. Chainlink’s growing traction The move to collaborate with the government adds to Chainlink’s growing traction across the globe. It also particularly expands the blockchain platform’s engagement with policymakers in the US, with key milestones including collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force. Chainlink’s infrastructure already secures tens of billions of dollars worth of total value locked (TVL) across DeFi. As well as integration of price feeds and other solutions across protocols like Aave and Compound, Chainlink has also collaborated with global companies and entities such as SBI Group , Swift, Euroclear, Fidelity, UBS, and ANZ. Big news for LINK? With potential to expand to additional blockchains based on demand, the latest deal with the Department of Commerce will only add to the growth trajectory. LINK token, native to the platform, could see massive upside amid broader accumulation. Demand for Chainlink’s solutions has seen several companies and platforms pay hundreds of millions of dollars for integration. The revenue from these efforts, which are paid offchain for onchain access, is set to go into a LINK reserve Chainlink recently unveiled. As well as ETF anticipation and treasury moves, analysts see LINK price much higher than it currently is.

The firm is finalizing a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining that will clear the way for its public debut, Reuters reported. Once completed, the existing shareholders are expected to retain ownership of about 98% of the combined company. American Bitcoin launched in March with a strategy to build up bitcoin reserves both by mining the asset and buying it outright for its balance sheet. The involvement of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump ties the company to one of the most prominent political families in the United States. The announcement comes days after another Trump-linked company, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said it planned to form a joint venture with Crypto.com that will go public by combining with a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC). American Bitcoin recently raised $220 million from accredited investors along with $10 million worth of bitcoin contributed in lieu of cash. The capital was intended to expand its infrastructure and strengthen its treasury as it moves toward life as a publicly traded firm. Genoot, speaking at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong, said the miner may also take stakes in businesses outside the U.S. to broaden access to bitcoin-linked securities. Some investors are unable to buy Nasdaq-listed stocks directly, and Genoot suggested foreign partnerships could provide a pathway to exposure through regulated entities. For American Bitcoin, the planned listing represents a bet that public markets remain hungry for direct exposure to crypto miners even as competition intensifies and energy costs fluctuate. A September debut would place the firm among a small cohort of miners pursuing listings as a way to draw institutional investors. The move also offers Toronto-based Hut 8 another lever in its push to establish itself as a leading North American mining company, while giving the Trump brothers a foothold in a business tied directly to the growth of bitcoin. Shares of Hut 8 were recently trading 0.6% higher at $26.5.",Markets|Hut 8|Bitcoin Mining|IPO|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-28 15:44:20

At this point, while there were big bullish predictions for Etheruem that it would be the future of finance, important statements also came from VanEck CEO Jan van Eck. He said Ethereum will be at the center of financial adoption. ABD’li medya kuruluşu Fox Business’a konuşan VanEck CEO’su He said Ethereum will be at the center of financial adoption. Calling Ethereum the “cryptocurrency of Wall Street,” VanEck CEO stated that ETH will be the ultimate winner in the stablecoin sector. At this point, the VanEck CEO predicted that banks and financial institutions will inevitably switch to stablecoin payments and adopt blockchain, with Ethereum being the ultimate winner. “Ethereum is the Wall Street coin. Ultimately, Wall Street institutions will develop stablecoins on Ethereum, and ETH will be the ultimate winner.” Stating that the widespread adoption of stablecoins will require all financial services companies to build supporting infrastructures, the famous CEO concluded that competition will be fierce but that Ethereum will prevail. “Many companies are making efforts to adopt stablecoins, and banks will have to adapt as well, knowing they will lose out. At this point, companies need to use blockchain technology to enable the use of stablecoins over the next 12 months. It will take some time, but no financial services company wants to say 'no, don't send me that digital dollar.' Ultimately, Etheruem will win.” *This is not investment advice.

The token had an outsized rally, with signs of whales cashing out on the hype. Fistbump (FIST) is a token that heated up in the past few days, sparking fears of a potential rug pull. Multiple on-chain analysts suggest FIST may be facing a sudden liquidity crisis, as whales use the short-term hype to cash out. FIST currently depends only on PancakeSwap pairs for most of its liquidity. This also means the token can return to its relatively inactive state if the biggest liquidity providers move on, or whales cash out. Despite its years-long history, FIST never gained listings on centralized exchanges. FIST staged a rally after three years of inactivity The FIST project is no stranger to rapid crashes, following its initial launch at the end of July 2022. FIST immediately spiked to a peak of $3.36, then erased most of its value, drifting under a penny for years. FIST is one of the rare tokens to move after a prolonged bear market, and even briefly trade above its all-time record at $3.52. FIST staged a vertical rally after years at sub-penny prices. This time, the project received new warnings about a potential liquidity crunch and another deep correction. | Source: Coingecko After being almost forgotten, the FIST project suddenly showed activity, and miraculously recovered its price range above $3.20 within days. FIST received hype from former holders, but also dire warnings about a potential crash similar to the one in 2022. Multiple sources launched warnings that FIST was showing signs of whales cashing out following the long period of trading at a low range. The current trading pairs available may also dry out if the liquidity pools are drained. Because FIST was launched back in 2022, during boom times, it created a commotion and was widely adopted. FIST reached a total of 226,842 wallets, the majority of which suffered severe losses. Some FIST owners apparently held through the 2022-2023 bear market. FIST shows on-chain warning signs of insider control FIST tokens are mostly concentrated on a single PancakeSwap pair, which carries over 95% of volumes. The asset reached $30M in daily volumes, an anomalous activity level. As of August 28, the leading trading pair still held over $7M in available liquidity. However, that liquidity is mostly dependent on a single whale provider. The top liquidity provider carried over 77% of the pair’s liquidity, based on DexScreener data. During the latest rally, multiple whales cashed out around $600K each, with no single entity showing large-scale earnings. However, if retail and new buyers join, older holders may try to cash out. Additionally, FIST shows signs of insider holdings. Although there are a few significant whales with big wallets, the top 20 holders are connected in a wallet cluster, based on Bubblemaps data. FIST is not held by outright whale-sized wallets, but the top addresses are connected in a large wallet cluster holding over 11% of the supply. | Source: Bubblemaps The Fistbump project is also busy advertising its FST Swap decentralized exchange. Despite the hype, the FST Swap exchange still advertises the FIST token under a ‘parody account’. Fistbump started its aggressive marketing on social media during the 2025 bull market. The token aims to position itself as a DeFi hub in the BNB Chain ecosystem, while still trading with a risk similar to a new meme token. Despite the goal of ‘making FIST great again’, the token raises multiple red flags after its near-vertical rally, which happened during an overall market reversal for BTC and other leading coins.

This strategic move significantly bolsters the company’s digital asset portfolio, underscoring a strong commitment to the evolving blockchain landscape. This acquisition is more than just a transaction; it signals a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s future. What Does This Strategic DeFi Development SOL Move Mean? DeFi Development (DFDV), a prominent player listed on Nasdaq, recently announced a significant expansion of its crypto holdings. The company purchased an additional 407,247 SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain. This latest acquisition brings DFDV’s total SOL holdings to an impressive 1,831,011 SOL. This considerable increase in their reserves highlights DFDV’s proactive approach to asset management within the decentralized finance sector. It demonstrates a clear strategy to diversify and strengthen their position by investing in high-potential blockchain ecosystems. Many observers are now watching closely to see how this impacts DFDV’s broader operational strategies. Why Solana (SOL)? Understanding the Investment Potential Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the blockchain space, known for its high transaction speeds and low fees. These technical advantages make it an attractive platform for various decentralized applications (dApps), including those in gaming, NFTs, and DeFi. Moreover, its growing developer community and robust ecosystem contribute to its long-term appeal. DFDV’s decision to increase its DeFi Development SOL holdings suggests a belief in Solana’s ability to maintain its competitive edge and continue its expansion. For institutional investors, stability, scalability, and security are paramount. Solana’s architecture aims to address these critical concerns, making it a compelling choice for substantial investments. Speed: Solana processes thousands of transactions per second, offering rapid settlement. Cost-Efficiency: Transaction fees remain remarkably low, benefiting users and developers alike. Ecosystem Growth: A vibrant and expanding network of dApps and projects continually innovates. Scalability: Designed to handle increasing demand without compromising performance or decentralization. Impact on the Market and DFDV’s Strategy A large institutional purchase, such as this DeFi Development SOL acquisition, can send positive ripples through the market. It often indicates growing institutional confidence in the asset and the broader crypto sector. For Solana, it validates its position as a serious player, attracting further attention from both retail and institutional investors. DFDV’s strategy appears to be one of long-term conviction. By accumulating a substantial amount of SOL, the company positions itself to benefit from Solana’s potential growth. However, holding large quantities of any volatile asset also presents challenges, including market fluctuations and security risks. Prudent risk management remains essential for such significant crypto portfolios. This move is a clear signal: Reinforced Confidence: DFDV is betting on Solana’s future as a leading blockchain. Market Validation: Large purchases by public companies can boost overall investor sentiment. Strategic Positioning: Securing a significant stake in a leading blockchain ecosystem for future growth. What Are the Broader Implications for DeFi Development SOL? This significant acquisition by a Nasdaq-listed entity highlights a broader trend of increasing institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. Companies are moving beyond just exploring blockchain technology; they are actively integrating digital assets into their balance sheets and operational strategies. This shift is crucial for the mainstream acceptance and maturation of the DeFi sector. For investors, this news can serve as an interesting data point. It encourages a deeper look into the fundamentals of Solana and other high-performing blockchains. While DFDV’s move is a positive indicator, it is always wise for individual investors to conduct their own thorough research before making any investment decisions. The landscape of DeFi Development SOL and other crypto assets is dynamic. In conclusion, DeFi Development’s substantial purchase of an additional 407,247 SOL, bringing its total holdings to over 1.8 million SOL, is a powerful statement. This strategic investment not only reinforces DFDV’s commitment to the decentralized finance ecosystem but also underscores the growing institutional confidence in Solana’s robust and scalable blockchain technology.

On-Chain Spike Hints at $10 XRP Incoming,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-sideways-action-ends-soon-on-chain-spike-hints-at-10-xrp-incoming/,"Active addresses on the XRP Ledger have risen by 19% in the past couple of days, suggesting a positive turn for the XRP price prediction as trading activity heats up. At $3.02, XRP has gained by 1% in a day and by 4% in a week, although it remains down by 6% in the last 14 days. However, signals indicate that its recent run of bad luck may be about to come to an end, with the spike in on-chain activity coinciding with a bottom for technical indicators. We could therefore see the XRP price surge in the coming weeks, while increasingly bullish macro signals could send it towards $10 in the medium- and long-term. XRP Price Prediction: Sideways Action Ends Soon? On-Chain Spike Hints at $10 XRP Incoming According to data from Santiment , daily active XRP Ledger addresses rose from a two-month low of 36,700 on Sunday to 44,100 on Tuesday. What this reveals is that, after a period of declines, demand is starting to return to XRP, which could therefore be in for a breakout very soon. Data from Whale Alert has also shown that one large holder has moved 30.5 million XRP to Coinbase , as a prelude to a sale. 30,507,683 #XRP (91,621,219 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbase https://t.co/E9e1pmF0s2 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 28, 2025 Of course, this doesn’t tell us when exactly the whale will sell up, with the possibility remaining that they may wait for a big spike before taking profits. And according to XRP’s chart, it does seem that the altcoin may be on the brink of a big move. It has been trading within a bullish pennant since the middle of July, and it now looks ready to break out of this range. We see something similar from its MACD (orange, blue), which after turning negative earlier this week has bottomed out, ready to rise back up. Source: TradingView It’s also worth noting that XRP’s trading volume has more than doubled since the weekend, rising from about $2.9 billion to $6.6 billion today. The pieces are therefore falling into place, and one catalyst that could trigger a big move is September’s FOMC meeting , which could see the Fed finally cut interest rates. This would be a big boost for the market and for the XRP price, which could potentially end September near to $4. And if the final quarter of the year brings the approval of XRP ETFs, the altcoin could pass $5 and even begin a climb towards $10. Layer-Two Network Bitcoin Hyper Prepares for Launch: Over $12.5 Million Raised As good as XRP looks at the moment, traders may want to consider diversifying into a range of tokens, including newer cryptocurrencies and even presale coins. Presale tokens can be profitable, particularly if they build up lots of momentum during their sales, helping them to rally hard once they list. Not every presale coin will set the charts alight, of course, but one example with a better chance than most is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a new layer-two project . Next up: Optimized sequencing anchored to BTC Stronger dev workflows for SVM contracts RPC/indexers/explorers for smooth infra Pathway for early builders before mainnet Why it matters: Bitcoin security + Solana dev ecosystem = real apps, composability & scalability without… pic.twitter.com/RakhskeeNi — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 26, 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has already raised just over $12.5 million in its ICO, which is a hugely encouraging sign of its future potential. And potential it has in spades, given its plans to launch a dedicated layer-two network for Bitcoin (BTC). In contrast to the Lightning Network, which operates more as a payment rail, Bitcoin Hyper aims to grow a varied ecosystem of dapps and DeFi protocols. As such, Bitcoin holders will be able to use it to put their BTC to work. At a technical level, Bitcoin Hyper will use Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, giving it a speed and security that few L2s can match. Its native token, HYPER, will be necessary to pay transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it. They can buy it now at the Bitcoin Hyper website , where the coin is selling at $0.012815. This price will rise again tomorrow, so traders should act sooner rather than later.

The token, built on Ethereum, will be distributed through a system called Lockbox . Early backers who purchased tokens at $0.015 and $0.05 will be able to claim 20% of their holdings starting September 1, representing about 5% of the total supply. The remaining 80% will be subject to community governance, reflecting the project’s participatory design. Founders’, advisors’, and partners’ allocations remain locked to reassure markets. A Controlled Two-Step Process The activation process is straightforward but tightly managed. Investors must connect their wallets to the official website to transfer WLFI into a secure smart contract. From there, they can unlock their share beginning September 1. Cyfrin, a Web3 security firm, audited the contracts, and presale wallets were verified to exclude non-compliant addresses. WLFI will also debut on leading exchanges—Binance, Coinbase, and Hyperliquid—with official announcements expected in the coming days. Trump’s Massive Crypto Stake Behind WLFI stands DT Marks DEFI LLC, a Trump-linked holding that controls 22.5 billion tokens. At current futures prices of $0.20–$0.30, WLFI’s fully diluted valuation exceeds $40 billion, with Trump’s 15.75 billion tokens worth more than $6 billion. $WLFI Perps are now LIVE across major exchanges including @binance It’s WLFI season. — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) August 23, 2025 That figure surpasses Forbes’ $5 billion estimate of his net worth. This suggests that much of his wealth now stems from digital assets, including NFTs, memecoins, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, Trump’s deep involvement raises ethical concerns. Critics point to the GENIUS Act, recently signed by Trump , which regulates stablecoins but omits conflict-of-interest safeguards. The simultaneous launch of World Liberty’s stablecoin, USD1, has intensified scrutiny from lawmakers. Market Ripples Across DeFi WLFI’s success has not been without disruption. Rumors of a partnership with lending protocol Aave triggered an 8% drop in AAVE’s token price, though the rumors were was swiftly denied. Still, the episode reflects the influence battles shaping DeFi projects today. The WLFI launch unfolds against a broader backdrop of DeFi expansion, with total value locked surpassing $167 billion. Post-election regulatory momentum in the U.S. has bolstered optimism, attracting investor focus toward high-profile projects like WLFI.

This integration facilitates the settlement of onchain transactions without the need for centralized exchanges or fragmented routes, essentially solving liquidity fragmentation for any dApps building on TRON’s vibrant ecosystem of decentralized finance. With a circulating supply of USDT exceeding $82 billion and one of the most active user bases in crypto, TRON has become the backbone of the global stablecoin market and onchain economy. A leader in payments, remittances, and cross-border transactions, TRON’s growth has been fueled by high adoption rates in regions where stablecoins provide access to US dollars. The TRON network is home to 2.86 million daily active users who execute approximately 8.8 million transactions each day. “As stablecoin usage continues to grow globally, capital needs to move where users are — and that activity is overwhelmingly taking place on TRON,” said Dima Khanarin, CEO of the Everclear Foundation. Native TRON support on Everclear provides solvers, bridge operators, and protocol treasuries with access to capital-efficient rebalancing mechanisms. These allow the largest circulating supply of USDT to move seamlessly between TRON and over 20 other blockchains without fragmentation, manual flows, or reliance on centralized exchanges. Everclear’s coordination of global settlement and cross-chain liquidity strengthens TRON’s ability to deliver secure and scalable blockchain solutions, priming the network for even broader institutional adoption. For native USDT (TRC-20) transfers on TRON, solvers can submit rebalancing intents between TRON and EVM-compatible chains by netting opposing transfers automatically and completing the remainder at competitive prices. Whether a bridge is rebalancing liquidity, a protocol is moving treasury, or a solver is playing auctions — cross-chain clearing on TRON flows as seamlessly as any other chain in the Everclear system. TRON is the second non-EVM chain supported by Everclear, marking a major milestone in their mission to become the universal clearing layer for all crypto. “Everclear’s cross-chain clearing and settlement protocol unlocks efficient routes for real-world use cases like payments and remittances,” said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for the TRON DAO. “Whether a chain runs on EVM or built on another framework, its liquidity can be unified within a single settlement layer.” Everclear plans expansion to more non-EVM blockchains in the future and is actively onboarding new bridge and protocol partners to rebalance USDT via TRON. Solver networks looking to capture new auction routes, bridge protocols managing multichain liquidity, and stablecoin issuers or app treasuries moving capital across chains can learn more about joining the Clearing Protocol by visiting everclear.org . About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, exceeding $82 billion. As of August 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 328 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN.

This consolidation reflects the ongoing tug-of-war between bulls and bears, as volatility continues to push the market in both directions. Despite the temporary stability, recent price action shows that selling pressure has gained a slight edge, leaving traders cautious about the next major move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Plunges To Lowest Since 2018: Strong Sell Signal Flashes Top analyst Darkfost has highlighted an important on-chain development that adds context to this phase. According to his data, the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit has now reached a historically critical threshold. This metric, which tracks how much of the circulating supply is currently above its cost basis, has long been a key guidepost for identifying major phases of the cycle. While a large share of supply in profit is not inherently bearish, history shows that such levels often coincide with pivotal turning points in Bitcoin’s market structure. With BTC consolidating in this crucial zone and profit supply peaking, the market stands at a delicate moment. Whether Bitcoin can reclaim momentum above $115K or faces a deeper correction may depend on how investors react to this latest signal. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Reaches Critical Cycle Zone According to top analyst Darkfost, the current level of Bitcoin supply in profit carries far more nuance than many assume. While some investors interpret a large share of coins in profit as a bearish warning, Darkfost emphasizes that it is, in fact, a necessary component of Bitcoin’s cyclical behavior. Contrary to what many might think, he explains, “a high percentage of supply in profit is what fuels the euphoric waves that drive the market forward.” Looking at history, the long-term average of supply in profit sits at roughly 75%, defined by a bell curve of Bitcoin’s performance since inception. In other words, across cycles, three-quarters of supply tends to sit in profit at any given time. When this ratio climbs above 90%, it usually signals a period of strong bullish momentum — the kind often seen in major bull markets. Such elevated levels create the psychological backdrop for rallies to extend, as confidence builds and capital flows into the market. However, Darkfost also warns that this metric can signal turning points. Once the percentage of supply in profit drops back below 90%, the market often transitions into corrective phases. These can be short-lived pullbacks or prolonged downturns, but historically, the break beneath that line has marked the shift away from euphoria. Bitcoin’s position near this threshold highlights the stakes. If supply in profit remains elevated, the market could continue its upward march. If not, the risk of a deeper correction grows, reinforcing the importance of this metric as a cycle-defining indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Compression Signals Pause – Market Digests Recent Volatility Bulls Struggle To Regain Momentum After Pullback Bitcoin is trading near $112,900 after a rebound from lows around $110,800, yet the chart shows that momentum remains fragile. Following the rejection at $123,000 earlier this month, BTC entered a corrective phase, slipping below both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which now act as resistance near $115,700–$116,600. This area stands out as the immediate barrier for bulls to reclaim if they want to shift the trend back in their favor. The 200-day moving average at $111,600 is currently providing a layer of support, helping BTC stabilize after recent volatility. Holding this zone will be crucial in preventing a deeper retrace toward the $108,000 region. If buyers can defend this level while building momentum, the market could stage a relief rally back toward the mid-$115K range. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Cost Basis Aligns With Critical Indicator: Support Builds Around $100K Level However, failure to reclaim the moving averages would leave BTC vulnerable to extended downside pressure. The inability to hold above $115K has already signaled fading strength, and without a decisive breakout, sellers could regain control. For now, Bitcoin sits in a consolidation phase, caught between critical support and resistance, with the next move likely to determine whether the market stabilizes or slides further.

In the last few days, institutions have gone on a significant buying spree, one of which is the asset management firm BlackRock . A Two-Day Bitcoin And Ethereum Shopping Spree Bitcoin’s price has steadily faced notable price fluctuations, while Ethereum’s price has experienced a pullback from its recent all-time high. Despite this bearish performance from BTC and ETH, BlackRock is purchasing the two crypto leaders on a massive scale. According to the reports , the world’s largest asset manager has acquired a staggering $750 million worth of BTC and ETH. It is worth noting that this massive accumulation by the leading firm was made within two days. The report reveals that BlackRock bought about 413 BTC valued at $46 million, along with 73,864 ETH for a staggering $342 million on August 27. Prior to this huge purchase, the asset manager made another acquisition of 568 BTC for approximately $62.6 million, and 65,901 ETH valued at $292.6 million. This rapid accumulation underscores the firm’s growing conviction in crypto as an institutional-grade asset class . While signaling rising demand among institutional investors, the huge purchase in such a short span reinforces the idea that traditional finance is sharply intertwining with the crypto sector. Combining these acquisitions, the asset manager invested close to $750 million in its cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) products within a two-day window. In 2025, these purchases rank among the biggest single-day purchases made by a conventional financial institution. Big BTC Investors Are Making Their Presence Known Large Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, often regarded as whales, have been gradually returning to the market. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain platform, has reported an uptick in BTC and ETH whales even as bearish pressure intensifies. This growth is observed among wallet addresses holding 1,000 BTC and wallet addresses holding at least 10,000 ETH. Such a trend from high-net-worth investors signals a possible change in market dynamics for the two assets. Their comeback coincides with a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency industry as investors balance the long-term growth trajectory of the assets against macroeconomic uncertainty. Data from the leading on-chain platform shows that there are now 13 more wallets holding 1,000 BTC, bringing the total to 2,087 wallets. Meanwhile, for Ethereum, there is now a total of 1,275 wallets holding 10,000 ETH following an additional 48 new wallets. At the time of writing, BTC and ETH were trading at $113,182 and $4,573, respectively, in the last 24 hours. While ETH’s trading volume has declined by over 13% in the past day, BTC’s trading volume is experiencing a slight upswing of nearly 5%.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|ETF|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Whales|exchange-traded fund|Santiment,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 16:00:22

Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmos’ current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $56.92 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will likely reach $100 in 2033. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $37.51 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base. Recent news/opinion on Cosmos The Cosmos Hub has successfully implemented the Gaia v25 upgrade, making it the first blockchain to transition to Cosmos SDK v0.53. With this milestone, the Hub has moved off its customized SDK fork and rejoined the mainline Cosmos SDK, a change that significantly reduces technical debt.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos, created by Ethan Buchman and Jae Kwon, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, with the network officially going live two years later in 2019. During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos peaked at $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. In September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 and $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos peaked at $7.77, and in February, it traded between $4.54 and $4.86. ATOM value decreased further in March, trading between the $4.0 and $4.2 range. Cosmos ATOM traded between $4.0 and $4.2 in March. ATOM ended April at $4.5. In May, ATOM is trading around $4.67 – $5. ATOM ended May at $4.61. In June, ATOM is trading between $2.9 and $4.3. As of the beginning of July, the ATOM price is currently trading between $4.07 and $4.44.

Vadošās kriptovalūtas, piemēram, Bitcoin un Ethereum, pēdējo mēnešu laikā ir uzrādījušas izcilus rezultātus, bet Solana ir atpalikusi, uzrādot nestabilu cenu dinamiku un nelielu pieaugumu. Tomēr, ņemot vērā nesenās pirkšanas aktivitātes, šonedēļ tā ir pārspējusi 10 vadošās kriptovalūtas. Pēc analītiķu domām, pieaugumu veicināja konstruktīva cenu dinamika ap izlaušanās līmeni, pieaugošais pieprasījums pēc valsts kases vērtspapīriem un gaidas par SEC apstiprinājumu ETF tirdzniecībai. Tikmēr uzmanības centrā nonāk iepriekšpārdošanas sektora zvaigzne Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). Projekts ir paplašinājies uz Solana ar 1:1 “token bridge”, un eksperti uzskata, ka tas varētu būt lielākais ieguvējs gaidāmajā SOL uzplaukumā. Valsts kases uzkrāj SOL 820 miljonu dolāru vērtībā Pēdējo nedēļu laikā lielākā Solana jaunākā ziņa ir bijusi agresīva uzkrāšana uzņēmumu valsts kasēs.

DeFi aktīvu pārvaldības uzņēmuma Sentora dati liecina, ka uzņēmumu kases pašlaik glabā vairāk nekā 820 miljonus dolāru SOL. Un pieprasījums nepārtraukti pieaug. Over $820M is currently held in $SOL treasuries. For comparison, ETH treasury holdings stood at a similar level in April and have since expanded to nearly $20B. The question remains: could SOL follow a similar trajectory? https://t.co/lJ2GwKVoJv pic.twitter.com/X7Bdh2eAl5 — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) August 27, 2025 Pentera Capital piesaista līdz 1,25 miljardiem dolāru, lai pārveidotu Nasdaq kotētu uzņēmumu par Solana valsts kasi.

Institucionālais pieprasījums Solana ir atjaunojis optimistisko dinamiku, un daudzi sagaida izrāvienu uz augstākiem līmeņiem. Solana cena tuvu izrāviena zonai: gaidāms kāpums līdz 250 dolāriem? Pēc gandrīz septiņu mēnešu konsolidācijas perioda Solana cena beidzot parāda spēcīgu dinamiku. Kamēr kopējā kriptovalūtu tirgus kapitalizācija pēdējo 24 stundu laikā ir pieaugusi par 0,22%, SOL ir pārspējis plašāko tirgu, pieaugot par 3%. Zemākā laika posmā aktīvs pašlaik svārstās tuvu 215 dolāru galvenajam izlaušanās līmenim. Šis līmenis ir pārbaudīts vairākas reizes, un izlaušanās šeit varētu izraisīt masīvu augšupejošu tendenci ar nākamajiem mērķiem ap 235 un 250 dolāru līmeni. Ievērojams kriptovalūtu tirgotājs Scott Melker, pazīstams arī kā “Wolf of All Streets”, ir apgalvojis, ka SOL tagad atrodas izšķirošā līmenī grafikā. Viņš piebilda, ka spēcīga izlaušanās varētu padarīt Solana par nākamā ”altcoin” cikla “mīluli”. Viņa grafika analīze atklāja, ka kriptovalūta tiek tirgota tuvu izšķirošam pretestības līmenim. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) gatavojas jaunam kāpumam ar Solana paplašināšanos Wall Street Pepe ir kopienas vadīta mēmu monēta, kas darbojas Ethereum tīklā un tagad paplašinās uz Solana. Projekts apvieno Wall Street garu ar PEPE mēmu enerģiju, lai izlīdzinātu spēles laukumu mazumtirdzniecības kriptovalūtu tirgotājiem, dodot viņiem iespēju ietekmēt tirgu. Tas sniedz Wall Street iekšējās zināšanas savai kopienai un ar apvienotiem un koordinētiem centieniem palielina WEPE žetona vērtību. No jūnija līdz jūlijam žetona vērtība pieauga par vairāk nekā 900%, parādot WEPE mēmu tirdzniecības armijas ievērojamo spēku un vienotību. Kāpēc Wall Street Pepe ir liels augšupejas potenciāls: Tā ir populāra mēmu monēta, kas pašlaik atrodas daudzķēžu paplašināšanās posmā. Gandrīz 1,95 miljardi WEPE žetoni ir pārcelti no Ethereum uz Solana. WEPE pašlaik ir pieejams iegādei par 0,001 ASV dolāru tieši no oficiālās tīmekļa vietnes pirms Solana palaišanas. Projektā ir unikāls žetonu sadedzināšanas mehānisms — iegādājoties WEPE (SOL) žetonus, tiek sadedzināts līdzvērtīgs daudzums WEPE (ETH) žetonu, samazinot piedāvājumu un veicinot cenu kāpumu. Žetonu turētāji, kuri vēlas pārnest savus žetonus uz Solana, var izmantot 1:1 apmaiņas funkciju tīmekļa vietnē. Galvenā WEPE lietderība ir tā, ka turētāji var piekļūt premium tirdzniecības saturam un dalīties stratēģijās ar kopienas locekļiem. Wall Street Pepe pašlaik ir kotēts Uniswap, un, paplašinoties uz Solana, drīzumā ir gaidāma arī kotēšana CEX.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ETH|TOKEN SALE|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 16:00:43

Data from PiScan supports a bearish Pi Coin price prediction , as the sudden surge in circulating supply could weigh heavily on market sentiment in the short term. This figure accounts for nearly 2% of Pi Coin’s supply of 7.95 billion at the time of writing and also exceeds the monthly average by 5 times. Pi’s performance this year has been quite disappointing as year-to-date (YTD) losses currently sit at 79.25% None of the 40th cryptocurrencies that outrank Pi in terms of market cap have booked such big losses during this period, which emphasizes how strong the selling pressure has been and how skeptical the market is about the project’s prospects and future. Pi has been affected by poor ecosystem growth initiatives following the launch of its public mainnet, the refusal of top centralized exchanges (CEXs) to list the token, and the rapid expansion of its circulating supply. Pi Coin Price Prediction: 34% Loss in Sight If The Selling Pressure Accelerates The 4-hour chart shows that PI bounced off a key support at $0.33 on Monday and has been rising since then. In the past 24 hours, PI has gained 3% , while trading volume has also ticked up by 3%. However, only $27 million worth of PI changed hands yesterday – a surprisingly low figure for a token with a nearly $3 billion market cap , signaling limited interest from market participants. A short-term move toward $0.37 could be on the cards as PI retests its recent lower high, but the broader trend remains bearish. The price continues to trade below the 200-period EMA on lower time frames, suggesting momentum remains tilted to the downside. This setup supports a bearish Pi Coin price prediction , with a potential drop toward $0.25 , implying a 34% downside in the near term. While Pi has struggled to meet early expectations, projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) have captured significant investor attention. With over $15 million raised in just a few months , $BEST is one of the year’s most promising presales – and could be primed for a 10X breakout once it officially launches. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Offers Compelling Use Cases and Access to Top Investing Tools Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of the Best Wallet app – an all-in-one crypto wallet designed to make storing, swapping, and discovering new tokens simple for everyone. Holding $BEST gives you discounts on trading fees , plus early access to top crypto presales through the app’s Upcoming Tokens feature. You can also swap coins directly inside the wallet, paying a fraction of the usual cost. And as more users join Best Wallet, demand for $BEST is expected to skyrocket – making it one of the most exciting tokens with 100x potential after the presale ends. To buy $BEST, simply visit the Best Wallet Token official website and connect your wallet (such as Best Wallet ). You can swap crypto or use a bank card to invest in just seconds.

From political memes to regulatory plays and community-fueled comebacks, these three altcoins, including Magacoin Finance, XRP, and Pepe, are dominating Reddit feeds right now. Each one is generating serious buzz for different reasons — but all are being hyped as high-risk, high-reward plays for August 2025. Let’s break them down. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Token Reddit Can’t Stop Talking About If there’s one coin that’s everywhere on r/CryptoCurrency right now, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE. Priced under a penny — around $0.007 — the token has already posted a 2,500%+ gain since launch, and some traders think it’s just getting started. Redditors have been all over this project thanks to its sellout funding rounds, which filled in under an hour, and its fast-growing online footprint that has seen its mentions on the social media platform crossed 50,000. Moreover, its daily engagement on Twitter/X and Telegram is picking up steam and it is obvious that the community cannot just get enough of this gem. But this isn’t just another meme with vibes. MAGACOIN FINANCE has passed a Hashex audit, has a CertiK review underway, and is building out actual DeFi utility — including staking features that reward long-term holders. Some bold predictions on Reddit are floating a $5 price target by year-end — an absolutely insane jump that would represent a 35x to 71,000% return, depending on your entry. Most traders admit that this analysis are speculative, but even the conservative scenarios show major upside if momentum continues and spills into major exchange listings. MAGACOIN’s mix of meme energy and real structure makes it different — something rarely seen since the early Doge and Shiba runs. And right now, Reddit’s got its eye on it like a hawk. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a Trusted Crypto to Buy for 2025 Growth Investors searching for a trusted early-stage project have found a strong contender in MAGACOIN FINANCE, widely ranked among the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Its smart contract passed auditing standards , and the public team has completed full KYC verification . Combined with growing community traction, these strengths make it a top-tier choice for those prioritizing safety and growth . XRP: The Comeback King Below $5 Yes, XRP is still under $5 — at least in certain spot and micro-futures markets after recent price corrections. And for Reddit veterans, that’s exactly why it’s worth watching again. Long-time XRP holders are calling this a setup eerily similar to the pre-bull run patterns in 2017 and 2020. If those historical trends hold, some OGs on r/XRP are targeting $8 to $11 before the cycle peaks. This is unsurprising considering the fact that the level of regulatory clarity the token has recently enjoyed has been a big part of its bullish case. Apart from that, Ripple has entered into multiple partnerships that are designed to further bolster XRP’s adoption and usage within the industry. As a result, many are seeing XRP as being “criminally oversold” in Reddit discussions. The crowd believes it’s not a question of if XRP bounces back — just when. Due to this, it is seen as a token that would drive strong market upside. Pepe: Still the Wildest Meme Ride in Town No under-$1 list would be complete without Pepe (PEPE) — the frog that refuses to fade. Currently trading between $0.000007 and $0.000011, the token is dirt cheap, but far from dead. Reddit loves PEPE for the same reason it loved DOGE in 2021: it’s chaotic, unpredictable, and absolutely capable of melting faces if meme momentum returns. Analysts are eyeing $0.000016 as a reasonable target for Q4, but Redditors are (as always) dreaming bigger. Some threads are betting on a full memecoin revival — with PEPE leading the pack if retail FOMO comes rushing back. Despite recent dips, Reddit’s perspective is simple that this is the kind of token you only need to be right about once. Final Thoughts: Reddit’s Underdog Playbook for August This month’s Reddit sentiment is clear: low entry, high upside. While the risks are undeniable, the altcoins getting the most attention all share a few things in common — massive communities, viral narratives, and asymmetric reward potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is the leader in raw momentum, backed by hype and structure. XRP offers the comeback story with fundamentals that could appeal to institutions and diehards alike. PEPE is the wild bet — loved for its volatility and its potential to 5x or 10x on sentiment alone. If you’re hunting for the next big underdog altcoin under $5, this is the list Reddit is watching. Just don’t forget the golden rule: size your bets carefully, and always do your own research.

This significant milestone highlights a remarkable period for the leading cryptocurrency, signaling strong market health and growing investor confidence. What’s Driving This Surge in Bitcoin Wallets in Profit? Recent reports indicate that over 55 million Bitcoin wallets are now ‘in the black,’ meaning the current value of their holdings exceeds the price at which they were acquired. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a broader trend of market resilience and growing investor confidence. The average holding period for these profitable wallets stands at an impressive 4.4 years, underscoring a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value. Market Recovery: Bitcoin has seen a robust recovery from previous downturns, pushing many long-term holders into profitable territory. Increased Adoption: Growing institutional interest and mainstream acceptance continue to drive demand. Halving Anticipation: The upcoming Bitcoin halving events often create positive market sentiment, contributing to price appreciation. Why Does a Record Number of Profitable Bitcoin Wallets Matter? This surge in Bitcoin wallets in profit is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of market health and investor sentiment. When a large portion of the network is profitable, it often signals strong underlying demand and reduced selling pressure. It means more individuals are seeing positive returns on their investments, which can further attract new capital into the ecosystem. Moreover, it validates the ‘Hodl’ strategy—the practice of holding Bitcoin for extended periods despite price fluctuations. The 4.4-year average holding period for these profitable wallets clearly demonstrates the rewards of patience and conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. This trend reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a viable long-term investment. What Are the Benefits for Bitcoin Holders? For existing Bitcoin holders, the benefits are clear. Seeing your Bitcoin wallets in profit provides financial validation and can lead to increased wealth. But beyond individual gains, this widespread profitability has broader implications for the entire crypto market. Increased Confidence: A profitable market encourages more people to invest, fostering a positive feedback loop. Network Stability: Long-term holders, who are now largely in profit, tend to be less volatile in their trading behavior, contributing to market stability. Innovation Fuel: Profits can be reinvested into the ecosystem, supporting the development of new applications and services built on Bitcoin. However, it’s also crucial to remember that market conditions can change. While the current outlook is bright, volatility remains an inherent characteristic of cryptocurrency markets. Always exercise caution and perform due diligence. Navigating the Future with Profitable Bitcoin Wallets With so many Bitcoin wallets in profit , what’s next? This record high suggests a maturing market, but smart investing always involves caution. For those new to Bitcoin or considering an investment, understanding market cycles and conducting thorough research is paramount. Always consider your personal financial situation and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The journey of Bitcoin has been marked by significant highs and lows, yet its fundamental strength continues to attract a global community. This latest milestone serves as a powerful testament to its enduring appeal and potential for wealth creation. Keep an eye on market trends and expert analysis to stay informed.

The move is being made possible through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, which Hut 8 CEO Asher Genuth says is now in its final stages. Instead of pursuing a traditional IPO, the company is opting for a merger that provides faster access to capital markets. Genuth explained that joining forces with an established firm gave them broader financing opportunities compared to going public on their own. Founded With High-Profile Backers The company was founded in March 2025 through a joint venture between Bitcoin miner Hut 8 and Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., sons of U.S. President Donald Trump. Under the agreement, the company will keep its name, American Bitcoin, and trade under the ticker symbol ABTC. Control of the venture will remain concentrated: Hut 8, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. will collectively hold 98% of the company’s shares. Prominent investors include Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who also supported the project from its early days. Ambitions to Dominate Bitcoin Mining American Bitcoin first announced plans to merge with Gryphon in May. The company has since declared its intention to become the “world’s largest and most efficient pure Bitcoin miner.” Its strategy includes both mining Bitcoin and purchasing it on the market, depending on profitability. “We don’t stick to just one playbook,” Genuth noted. “Sometimes it’s more profitable to mine, sometimes to buy — we adapt to whatever gives the strongest returns.” Despite criticism from Donald Trump himself about possible conflicts of interest, the company maintains it has no ties to government agencies. Instead, Eric Trump is said to be focused on strategy, mining operations, new facility development, and treasury policy. With heavyweight investors, political family ties, and the goal of becoming the world’s largest Bitcoin miner, American Bitcoin’s Nasdaq debut promises to be one of the most closely watched crypto stories of 2025.",News|Business,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-28 16:15:18

Activity skyrocketed during the second half of 2024 as meme coins and experimental tokens captured retail attention, lifting weekly trader counts above 30 million by October 2024. But the rush proved unsustainable. By early 2025, inflows of new traders collapsed, leaving recurring users as the main drivers of activity. Since then, the market has stabilized at a lower baseline, with weekly traders ranging between 10 and 15 million. Source: @ally/Dune Solana’s retail base surged in late 2024 as meme coins like BONK and countless imitators drew millions of new users into its ecosystem. At its height, Solana recorded more than 8 million unique traders, according to Solflare community advocate Baer, who noted that number has since fallen by 87% to just over 1 million. “That’s a net negative of 7 million people who have left the Solana ecosystem entirely,” Baer said. Solanas unique # of traders peaked at 8M during the meme coin meta It’s now down 87% to only 1.08M traders That’s a net negative of 7M people who have left the Solana ecosystem entirely And tell me again why you’re bullish on SOL? pic.twitter.com/pfqzX8hFlN — Baer (@BaerEvo_) August 26, 2025 Token creation data shows just how unsustainable the meme coin mania has been. On Solana, contract creation surged throughout 2024, peaking in February 2025 with more than half a million new tokens deployed in a single month. However, activity slowed noticeably by August, indicating fatigue among developers and investors. Solana Token Frenzy Turns Into Bloodbath as Most New Meme Coins Vanish Within Hours Underlying these shifts is the rise of token creation platforms like PumpFun, which have become synonymous with Solana’s meme coin era. According to Dune data , in the past 24 hours alone, PumpFun saw 26,457 new tokens minted, more than 95% of all Solana token launches during that period. The next closest platforms, Sugar and Bags, recorded just 973 and 673, respectively, while smaller venues like Wavebreak barely registered any activity. Source: @adam_tehc/Dune Yet very few of these tokens endure. Out of PumpFun’s 26,457 tokens, only 246 managed to “graduate” beyond their initial launch stage, a survival rate of less than 1%. The vast majority of new tokens either collapsed in value or were abandoned within hours of creation. Source: @adam_tehc/Dune By contrast, Bags recorded 10 graduations out of 673 tokens, a higher relative retention rate, but still small in absolute terms. Most other platforms, including Moonshot, Believe, and Boop, saw no token progress at all. The result has been described as a bloodbath for retail participants, many of whom were lured into speculative meme coin launches only to face rapid losses. While the frenzy drove Solana’s daily activity to record highs in late 2024, the aftermath has been marked by dwindling engagement and shaken confidence. Additionally, Solana still leads all chains in DEX activity, ac cording to DeFiLlama . Over the past 24 hours, Solana recorded $4.6 billion in trading volume, edging out Ethereum’s $4.4 billion. Source: DeFiLlama The gap widens over 30 days, with Solana posting $358.9 billion compared to Ethereum’s $140.8 billion. BSC and Base followed with $59.2 billion and $53.1 billion, respectively, while Hyperliquid L1 logged $29.8 billion. Fraudulent ‘Celebrity Coins’ Drain Millions—Kanye, Ronaldo, Adele Among Latest Targets Hackers have escalated their targeting of celebrities to fuel fraudulent crypto schemes. In August, compromised Instagram accounts belonging to Adele, Future, Tyla, and even Michael Jackson’s estate were used to promote FREEBANDZ, a fake Solana token that later collapsed by 98%. A similar scam tied to a bogus “CR7” token falsely linked to Cristiano Ronaldo briefly hit a $143 million market cap before insiders drained its liquidity. The latest case involved Kanye West’s official YZY meme coin. West confirmed on Wednesday that his account had been hacked , triggering an 81% crash in the token’s value. The report shows 73.8% of wallets trading YZY lost money , with 51,862 wallets recording combined losses of $74.8 million. More than 1,000 wallets lost over $10,000 each. More than 70% of traders who bought into Kanye West’s Solana-based memecoin YZY ended up in the red, according to @bubblemaps . #KanyeWest #YZY https://t.co/E36PlmnPQo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 28, 2025 By contrast, 18,333 wallets saw profits, though gains were heavily concentrated. Eleven addresses captured nearly 30% of total profits, worth $66.6 million. Most other winners made under $1,000. YZY, short for Yeezy Money, launched last Wednesday with a promotion from West’s official channels and website . Pitched as a financial empowerment project, the token shed 70% within hours, fueling claims of manipulation. Analytics platform Bubblemaps flagged suspicious trading patterns, including “sniping,” where bots grab large token allocations seconds after launch.

Solana itself has held steady, trading at $212.85, up 4% in the past 24 hours and 15.5% over the week. The token remains 27% below its $293.31 all-time high.

This week, Cronos again takes the lead after a sharp rally tied to new corporate structures and improved on-chain activity. Pyth and Ethena also remain in view, each supported by utility within their ecosystems. Traders describe altseason phases as periods when capital moves into non-Bitcoin assets. These phases often begin with tokens that already have liquidity and identifiable drivers. Cronos, through its surge, illustrates how exchange-linked assets can draw flows when paired with broader market events. Pyth provides a case study in oracle infrastructure, gaining adoption. Ethena continues to show how synthetic stablecoins adjust to regulatory conditions. Cronos (CRO): Treasury Structure and Upgrades Push Price Higher Cronos is trading near $0.3393 , representing a gain of about 28% in the past 24 hours. Market capitalization is about $11.3 billion, with supply around 33.6 billion tokens out of a possible 100 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The most direct driver came from a new treasury arrangement involving Trump Media, Crypto.com, and Yorkville Acquisition. The agreement created a corporate vehicle designed to hold and deploy billions in CRO. Trump Media committed over $100 million in direct purchases, while Crypto.com added equity and liquidity support. Plans call for a Nasdaq listing under the ticker MCGA, placing CRO into a high-profile structure that has drawn traders and institutional observers alike. had to put my phone on 'do not disturb' because of all the $CRO and Cronos eco price alerts. — Cronos (@cronos_chain) August 28, 2025 This development arrived alongside technical and on-chain improvements. A July upgrade expanded interoperability through the Cosmos SDK and IBC, while also introducing a network safety circuit breaker. Activity on the network has since risen, with gas consumption and contract deployment both showing double-digit growth. New perpetual contracts for CRO also expanded access for leveraged traders, creating an additional channel of demand. Together, these elements explain why CRO has outperformed other exchange tokens during this stage of altcoin season. The token’s movement reflects both corporate linkage and measurable network progress, which has created depth across trading venues. Pyth Network (PYTH): Oracle Feeds Gain Reach Pyth is trading at $0.1743, with a market capitalization near $1 billion and daily turnover above $300 million. The circulating supply stands at about 5.75 billion tokens out of a total of 10 billion. PYTH Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The protocol provides pricing data for over 100 blockchains, sourced from institutional firms. Unlike push-based oracles, Pyth uses a pull model that allows applications to query pricing in real time. This structure has made it a preferred feed for derivatives protocols and decentralized exchanges. Its presence across multiple ecosystems helps it retain steady trading interest during altcoin season, even without sharp speculative swings. Ethena (ENA): Synthetic Dollar Protocol Adjusts to Regulation Ethena is trading near $0.66 , with a market capitalization of about $4.4 billion and a supply of around 6.6 billion out of 15 billion. Daily trading volume exceeds $700 million. The project issues USDe, a synthetic stablecoin designed to maintain value through hedging positions rather than reserves. Regulatory shifts in the United States earlier this summer, particularly under the GENIUS Act, restricted interest-bearing stablecoins. That outcome pushed demand toward alternatives like USDe, which nearly doubled its supply over July. Ethena governance has also approved regular buybacks to stabilize value, currently averaging several million dollars per day. This design links ENA’s performance to policy and to the growth of its synthetic dollar. While less volatile than CRO, ENA remains active in altseason rotation as a proxy for stablecoin adoption. Altcoin Season Outlook Cronos provides the clearest example of how strong narratives combined with on-chain growth can lead to an altcoin season phase. Pyth adds a case where technical infrastructure sustains steady activity. Ethena demonstrates how regulatory changes can shape demand for synthetic assets. Altseason is rarely uniform . Instead, specific drivers create movement in a handful of assets while others stay quiet. Cronos, Pyth, and Ethena together show how this selective rotation functions in the current market.

With over $21.6 million already raised from more than 623 million tokens sold at $0.0987, Remittix is drawing serious attention. Traders are asking the question: are SHIB and DOGE slipping because capital is rotating into what could be the next big altcoin breakout? Shiba Inu Struggles To Hold Its Bullish Setup Source: TradingView Shiba Inu has long been a crowd favorite, but its chart suggests hesitation. Trading around $0.00001250 currently , SHIB has developed a Cup and Handle pattern that can accelerate to $0.0000239 in case the resistance at $0.00001710 is breached. The average daily trading volume increased by 118 percent to $361 million signaling that there are still buyers out there. However, not everything is bullish. The $0.0000103 support level is weak, and any fall below this value will negate the bullish case. According to analysts, whale wallets have been dispensing rather than hoarding tokens, which is a burden to long-term growth. While optimism remains in pockets of the community, some holders are already diversifying into Remittix , which promises more than speculative rallies. Dogecoin Price Faces Critical Pressure Source: Ali Martinez The Dogecoin price is also facing turbulence, consolidating around $0.22 and testing the crucial $0.20 support. Technical charts show a symmetrical triangle forming, with $0.25 as the ceiling that must be broken for DOGE to rally higher. Failure to do so could push the token down to $0.19 or even $0.17. Futures data highlights increasing risk. Open interest in DOGE contracts dropped 5 percent to $3.26 billion, while $19 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours. This sharp decline reflects weak conviction among traders. Despite Dogecoin’s resilience as a top meme coin, investor capital is clearly rotating toward alternatives offering real-world utility, with Remittix emerging as the standout choice. Remittix Takes The Spotlight As A Viral ICO While Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price wobble, Remittix has become the headline story in crypto. Raising over $21.6 million already, the project is being hailed as one of the strongest ICOs of 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is building real utility, enabling cross-border payments and providing a mobile-first experience. This has positioned it as more than just hype, it’s a working PayFi solution that institutions and individuals can both use. Why Remittix Is Gaining Buzz Right Now Raised $21.6M, proving strong investor demand even before listings Global payments utility with 40+ crypto and 30+ fiat currencies supported Wallet launch coming soon with instant FX conversion features Viral growth with over 20% referral rewards, boosting community size Anticipation of its second major CEX listing as it nears the $22M milestone These drivers explain why many investors believe Remittix could deliver 100x returns, similar to Shiba Inu in its early days, while also offering real-world use cases that DOGE never achieved. A Market Rotation In Progress The story unfolding here is about market rotation. As traders grow cautious about the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu’s ability to sustain momentum, Remittix is emerging as the alternative with substance. By combining viral growth with genuine utility, it has managed to attract not just retail speculation but also early institutional curiosity. If this continues, it could set a new standard for how PayFi tokens dominate the next cycle.

Statistics Canada said Thursday the deficit widened to C$21.16 billion ($15.4 billion) in the April–June period. That is the biggest gap since at least the early 1980s and far larger than the C$1.32 billion hole in the first quarter, when many U.S. buyers stocked up ahead of tariffs. Economists in a Bloomberg survey expected a C$19.3 billion deficit. The result shows that U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have disrupted trade in goods between Canada and the U.S. Goods exports fell back to 2021 levels and dropped 13.1% in the quarter, the agency reported. The goods trade deficit hit a record C$19.6 billion. This was mostly due to lower shipments to the U.S., Canada’s largest market. Shipments to that market fell sharply during the quarter. The current account tracks trade in goods and services plus income and investment flows with the rest of the world. Strong surpluses can lift a currency, while persistent deficits often weigh on it. “Not a great showing for Canada, but it was clearly an exceptional quarter,” said Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at Bank of Montreal. “Those flows need to turn positive or the Canadian dollar could be in for a rough ride.” By 10:03 a.m. in Ottawa, the Canadian dollar traded around C$1.377 per U.S. dollar and was roughly 4.5% stronger on the year. U.S. GDP rises, Canadian economy slows A revised release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday put U.S. real GDP growth at a 3.3% annualized pace. Soft export performance likely left Canada’s economy flat in the second quarter. Bloomberg’s economist poll points to GDP contracting at an annualized −0.7% pace for that period. Statistics Canada will publish expenditure- and income-based GDP figures on Friday. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Wednesday, after leaving Washington, that talks had advanced following his meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. His office said the two met for about 90 minutes on Tuesday in a constructive session that covered concrete proposals already on the table. Further technical talks will now be handled by Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, who also serves as chief negotiator, and United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Officials said those talks focus on detailed proposals already circulating between the two sides. Canada eased tariffs to reopen dialogue This week’s movement follows Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to remove some of Canada’s retaliatory measures , as reported by Cryptopolitan, to step up negotiations aimed at easing pressure from President Trump’s duties on key Canadian industries. Tariffs remain in place on steel, aluminum, autos, and copper for Canada. LeBlanc has said the country’s counter-tariffs were a major sticking point for the Trump administration as both sides work on a new economic and security arrangement. Following Trump’s March move to levy broad duties, Canada responded with 25% tariffs on a wide list of U.S. goods, including oranges, alcohol, and motorcycles.

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $112,893, with a 1.38% daily gain. However, trading volume remains moderate at $64 billion, lower than the $300–500 billion volume levels witnessed during peak market activity. Three Key Levels: $92K, $112K, $117K Decide Bitcoin’s Fate Burak Kesmeci, an analyst at CryptoQuant , confirmed that Bitcoin is now operating within a key $109K–$112K range. According to Kesmeci, a weekly close above this zone could reinforce the upward trend, while a close below may trigger an accelerated correction. Bulls vs Bears? Bitcoin’s critical pivot zone at 109K – 112K “The 109K – 112K range is a critical pivot zone in the short term. A weekly close above this region could strengthen the trend, while closing below it may accelerate the correction.” – By @burak_kesmeci pic.twitter.com/AaM1hMNmNT — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 28, 2025 The analyst has identified three key price levels deserving attention. The first is $117.3K, representing short-term resistance where underwater investors may look to exit their positions. The second is the current $112K level, serving as a short-term decision point that will determine whether prices advance higher or retreat to the third level, short-term support around $92.4K. Similarly, on-chain analyst Darkfost noted that BTC Supply in Profit has recently fallen below the 90% threshold, a metric that has frequently indicated the onset of corrective phases. “Bull markets typically coincide with more than 90% of supply showing profits. We have now reached this critical 90% threshold,” Darkfost explained. Additionally, heavy selling pressure from whales and institutions through ETFs has weakened bullish sentiment. SosoValue data reveals that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded only $81.25 million in net inflows on August 27, a stark contrast to Ethereum ETFs , which attracted $309.48 million during the same time frame. 0.5% Loss Metric Proves Bull Run Still Intact Glassnode data shows that the Relative Unrealized Loss for Bitcoin investors remains at just 0.5%, well below the >30% levels characteristic of bear market extremes. Source: Glassnode This indicates that most holders maintain profitable positions despite mounting short-term pressure. Additionally, during the recent pullback to $109K, Bitcoin touched the “Oversold” territory on the short-term holder MVRV Bollinger Band. On the pullback to $109K, $BTC tapped the ‘Oversold’ zone on the short-term holder MVRV Bollinger Band. The last occurrence was at the $74K bottom in April; since then, BTC is up +51%. pic.twitter.com/cN2FXII4SS — Frank (@FrankAFetter) August 27, 2025 The previous occurrence of this condition was at the $74K bottom in April, after which Bitcoin surged over 50%. Many analysts now view the current situation as a retest phase before the next leg of the bull run commences. Supporting this thesis, corporate treasuries and companies are accumulating Bitcoin at a rate four times the mining rate, adding approximately 1,755 BTC daily, while only 450 BTC enter circulation through mining. Source: River Bitcoin enthusiast CryptoNewton projects that as long as the price remains above the $112K threshold, subsequent targets include $115K, $118K, and $124K. Technical Analysis: $124K Liquidity Sweep Sets Up Next Move The daily BTC/USDT chart displays a clear liquidity-driven pattern. The price recently cleared liquidity near the $124,000 area, establishing a new all-time high before experiencing a sharp reversal. The RSI is climbing from neutral territory, indicating that momentum is recovering following the selloff. Key resistance zones ahead include $114,700 and $116,800. A decisive breakout above $116,800 would clear the path toward $119,500 and potentially establish another attempt at the highs. Conversely, if price fails at this juncture and reverses, a return toward $111,900 remains viable, with $103,000 serving as the deeper invalidation level. The 4-hour BTC/USDT chart reveals a distinct structure between buyer and seller territories. Following a steep decline from the seller zone around $121,000, the price descended into the buyer zone near $111,000 and established support. The support line and buyer zone provided a foundation for recovery, leading to a breakout attempt through the resistance line. The price is currently consolidating just above $111,000 while testing the lower boundary of the $112,400 zone, which serves as short-term resistance. The technical setup suggests that if buyers can sustain momentum above this buyer zone and achieve a clean break through $114,400 resistance, the next target would be approximately $118,000 (TP1), aligning with the projected trajectory. However, failure to maintain levels above $113,000 would increase the probability of retesting the $109,000 buyer zone.

The initiative, which will distribute U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) data on nine major public blockchains, marks a milestone in the use of blockchain technology to enhance transparency in economic data. As part of this historic effort, Kraken has onboarded the Department of Commerce as a client and helped the department procure cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Stellar (XLM), Polygon (POL) and Tron (TRX) — to pay for the transaction fees required for publishing cryptographic proofs of GDP data. By recording hashes of this critical economic information onchain, the Department of Commerce is ensuring that U.S. GDP data is verifiable, tamper-resistant and globally accessible. This sets a new standard for transparency in government reporting. “This is a landmark moment for both our industry and our country,” said Arjun Sethi, Kraken co-CEO. “We commend President Trump and Secretary Lutnick for their vision in bringing this initiative to life, and we are honored to play a role in its execution. By harnessing blockchain technology to distribute GDP data, the U.S. is setting a global example of how transparency, trust and innovation can come together to drive progress.” “Today’s announcement is a powerful example of how government and industry can work together to advance innovation across the global economy,” said Jonathan Jacyhm, Kraken Global Head of Policy and Government Relations. “The message is clear: Blockchain technology is not just the future of financial infrastructure, it is now becoming the present.” The initiative reflects the Trump Administration’s broader commitment to integrating blockchain technology into critical government functions, reinforcing the United States position as a global leader in digital innovation. It also marks a milestone for a G7 economy using public blockchains to disseminate official economic statistics. Kraken remains committed to providing secure, reliable and efficient services to support the Department of Commerce in this project and any future initiatives.

A significant development is on the horizon that could reshape how CFTC overseas exchanges operate within the U.S. market. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is preparing to release an advisory, aiming to clarify registration rules for international platforms. What Does This Mean for CFTC Overseas Exchanges? Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, recently shared insights into this upcoming advisory. Essentially, the CFTC intends to create a defined pathway for overseas exchanges. This means they can finally offer their services to American customers in a more structured and compliant manner. For a long time, navigating U.S. regulations has been a complex challenge for non-U.S. crypto exchanges. This new guidance from the CFTC could be a game-changer, fostering greater legal certainty and potentially opening up new avenues for growth. Why is this Regulatory Clarity Crucial? The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and clear regulations are vital for both market participants and consumers. This move by the CFTC addresses a critical need for clarity, providing a framework that benefits everyone involved. For Exchanges: It offers a blueprint for compliance, reducing legal ambiguities and potential penalties. For American Customers: It means access to a broader range of services, potentially from platforms with enhanced regulatory oversight, which could lead to increased trust and security. For the Market: It promotes fair competition and could encourage more innovation within a regulated environment. Without clear guidelines, many CFTC overseas exchanges have either avoided the U.S. market entirely or operated in a grey area. This advisory seeks to change that, bringing more of the global crypto ecosystem into a regulated framework. Navigating the New Landscape for CFTC Overseas Exchanges While the advisory promises clarity, it will undoubtedly come with specific requirements. Exchanges will need to understand and adhere to these new rules diligently. This might involve: Implementing robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures tailored to U.S. standards. Establishing reporting mechanisms to the CFTC. Potentially adjusting their operational structures to meet U.S. regulatory expectations. This isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about building a foundation of trust and accountability. The CFTC’s role is to ensure market integrity and protect participants, and these new rules for CFTC overseas exchanges will reflect that mission. What Challenges Might Arise? Even with a clear path, challenges are inevitable. Overseas exchanges might face: Operational Adjustments: Integrating U.S.-specific compliance into existing global operations can be complex. Cost Implications: Meeting new regulatory standards often requires significant investment in technology, personnel, and legal counsel. Jurisdictional Nuances: Harmonizing home country regulations with U.S. requirements will be a key task. However, the long-term benefits of operating within a regulated U.S. market, including access to a vast customer base and enhanced credibility, will likely outweigh these initial hurdles for many CFTC overseas exchanges . The Future of US Crypto Access with CFTC Oversight This advisory marks a significant step towards a more integrated and regulated global crypto market. It signifies a maturation of the industry, where regulatory bodies are actively working to create frameworks rather than simply reacting to developments. As the details of the advisory emerge, both exchanges and consumers should stay informed. This initiative could unlock unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation, while simultaneously strengthening investor protection. The CFTC’s proactive approach here is a testament to the growing importance of digital assets in the global financial system. In conclusion, the upcoming CFTC advisory represents a pivotal moment for CFTC overseas exchanges and American crypto users. It promises to demystify the regulatory landscape, paving the way for a more compliant, secure, and accessible digital asset market in the United States. This move could truly redefine the global reach of crypto services for American clients. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main purpose of the CFTC’s upcoming advisory? A1: The advisory aims to clarify registration rules for overseas exchanges, creating a formal pathway for them to legally offer services to American customers. Q2: How will this benefit American customers? A2: American customers will gain access to a wider range of crypto services from international platforms, potentially with enhanced regulatory oversight, leading to increased trust and security. Q3: What challenges might CFTC overseas exchanges face with these new rules? A3: Exchanges may need to make significant operational adjustments, incur costs for compliance, and navigate the nuances of harmonizing their home country regulations with U.S. requirements. Q4: Will all overseas exchanges be able to serve U.S. clients immediately? A4: No, the advisory will outline specific registration rules and requirements that exchanges must meet to become compliant and serve U.S. clients. It will likely be a process of adherence. Q5: Why is the CFTC taking this step now? A5: The CFTC is responding to the rapid growth of the digital asset market and the need for clear regulatory frameworks to ensure market integrity, protect consumers, and foster responsible innovation.

Bitcoin has regained dominance in headlines thanks to ETF inflows and institutional adoption, but many analysts argue the true opportunities lie within altcoins. Historically, altcoins outperform Bitcoin once bull cycles mature, often multiplying many times faster. In 2017, Ethereum surged more than 100x after Bitcoin had already established momentum. In 2021, Solana and Avalanche took the spotlight, producing gains that dwarfed the majors. As 2025 progresses, investors are looking for the next rotation. XRP and Solana are poised for meaningful returns, but projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching attention for huge potential. XRP’s steady fundamentals XRP’s trajectory is closely tied to Ripple’s mission of modernising cross-border payments. With more than 400 institutional partnerships, XRP has proven real-world utility. Regulatory clarity in the US following Ripple’s court victories has given investors renewed confidence, particularly as the SEC’s earlier legal hurdles are no longer a cloud over its future. Analysts predict XRP could climb from its current range of $3 to $5.5 or even $8 in the next bull cycle. That’s a clean 2x return, attractive for institutional investors seeking stability. Yet for retail participants, 2x may feel too modest compared to more disruptive plays. Solana’s rebound and ecosystem momentum Solana has reestablished itself as a critical Layer-1 blockchain. Once plagued by outages, its network has stabilized and is now handling record-high transaction volumes. The chain’s dominance in NFTs and high-speed decentralized applications continues to expand, with trading activity frequently outpacing Ethereum on certain days. Analysts believe SOL could double from $150 to $300 during the next cycle, rewarding those who stuck with the project through its growing pains. Solana represents the growth story investors trust, yet, like XRP, its size limits the possibility of exponential multiples beyond 2–3x. While XRP and Solana may double, the conversation about outsized gains increasingly includes MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has captured retail energy through a series of fast-selling presale rounds, alongside community branding that resonates in a crowded market. What distinguishes MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just momentum, but a commitment to structured growth. In celebration of its latest success, the project is providing investors with an exclusive 50% EXTRA bonus, limited-time access through PATRIOT50X. This incentive highlights MAGACOIN FINANCE’s focus on rewarding early adopters while solidifying its reputation as a milestone-driven project. Analysts now forecast the possibility of up to 900% gains during the upcoming cycle, driven by a mix of scarcity, viral traction, and strategic community engagement. Macro tailwinds shaping the market Several macro-level factors could provide the wind beneath MAGACOIN FINANCE’s sails. First, institutional adoption is accelerating: US-approved Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions, and Ethereum staking ETFs are expected to follow suit. As capital flows into majors, history shows liquidity eventually rotates into altcoins, igniting exponential rallies. Second, regulatory clarity in key regions, from Europe’s MiCA framework to the US considering structured stablecoin rule, is creating a safer environment for growth. Finally, political cycles and retail enthusiasm tied to cultural narratives are expected to play a larger role in 2025–2026 than in previous runs. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its branding and timing, is well-positioned to ride these currents. How it fits in portfolios Portfolio construction is about balance. Conservative investors may anchor their holdings with XRP and Solana, capturing dependable 2x returns. Yet this strategy alone risks missing the exponential edge that defines bull markets. By layering in an asymmetric bet like MAGACOIN FINANCE, portfolios gain exposure to the kind of explosive upside that can transform modest stakes into substantial outcomes. With a forecast of 900% gains and the PATRIOT50X entry bonus, the project appeals directly to those seeking fortune-building plays while keeping risk compartmentalized. Other altcoins to watch Of course, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not alone in attracting speculation. Avalanche continues to gain recognition for tokenizing real-world assets, while Chainlink dominates the oracle sector, making it indispensable to DeFi. Polkadot’s parachain system is proving effective for interoperability. These names are likely to produce steady 3–5x gains, further supporting a diversified strategy. Still, compared to their more measured trajectories, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the boldest potential within the emerging class of presale-driven projects. Conclusion XRP and Solana remain strong bets for steady doubling, supported by adoption and regulatory clarity. Polkadot, Avalanche, and Chainlink provide additional stability for balanced portfolios. But MAGACOIN FINANCE, celebrating milestones with its PATRIOT50X bonus and forecasts of 900% upside, stands out as the boldest retail-driven opportunity of the coming bull run. For investors willing to combine safety with speculative conviction, this blend could define the most profitable outcomes of 2025–2026.

While Solana (SOL) continues to navigate market headwinds with steady but uncertain momentum, the spotlight is shifting toward Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi infrastructure. Mutuum Finance presale token price is $0.035 in phase 6. Experts say this new token can skyrocket with phenomenal profits in the coming few months. In phase 7, there will be an increase of 14.29% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already received more than $15 million in funding and has been supported by over 15,720 investors. Analysts suggest that this rising coin could reshape near-term investment flows, leaving SOL and other established players momentarily in the shadows. Solana Price Prediction: Consolidation Before Potential Upside Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $187.62, showing signs of consolidation after recent volatility. Analysts suggest that if the market maintains its current momentum and Solana holds above the $180 support zone, it could gradually push toward the $200–$220 range in the near term. Broader market conditions, investor sentiment, and liquidity flows will remain key drivers of this movement, while new DeFi coins such as Mutuum Finance continue to attract attention in parallel. Investors FOMO into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of presale. More than $15 million has been raised and over 15720 early investors are buying tokens. Token value during Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, a raise of 14.3% from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently introduced its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Its users are most likely to receive a share of the program’s reward of $50,000 USDT in case they are able to find possible bugs in the project. Its bounty program has been crafted to provide equivalent safety to all types of vulnerabilities. The program consists of four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Unveils Humongous Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a $100,000 giveaway , where the users will be rewarded in the form of $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited and verified by CertiK. The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance’s DeFi protocol enables lending to be done in a decentralized way with which lenders have complete ownership of their assets when lending. Passive income for lenders and borrowers are credited and accessed automatically, respectively, by collateralizing diversified assets while lending. Systematic rate adjustment is set by the system for maximum capital structure and ecosystem sustainability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers users a double-lending opportunity with best-in-class flexibility via Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is driven by smart contracts to govern lending pools that scale interest levels dynamically in perfect sync with the market. Lenders are provided with secured returns, and the borrowers have secure options on borrowing capital on loan. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) eliminates the need for intermediaries by facilitating direct interaction between lending agents and borrowing parties. High-risk assets like meme coins require the type of fully decentralized infrastructure that provides users with full control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $15 million with 15,720+ investors in presale phase 6 at $0.035. Phase 7 rises to $0.04, and forecasts suggest up to 30x growth. Join the presale to secure tokens, get your share of the $100,000 giveaway, and participate in the CertiK-backed $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Mutuum Finance’s audited P2C and P2P lending models and USD-backed stablecoin make it a top Ethereum-based DeFi opportunity.

Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracker, reported the issuance of a staggering 250 million USDC directly from the USDC Treasury. This substantial injection of stablecoin into the market often signals underlying shifts and increasing demand within the broader crypto ecosystem, making it a crucial development for investors and enthusiasts alike. What Does This Massive USDC Minting Event Signify? When 250 million USDC minted by the Treasury, it typically indicates a rise in demand for the stablecoin. USDC, or USD Coin, is a digital stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its primary purpose is to provide stability in the volatile crypto markets, allowing traders and investors to move in and out of positions without fully exiting the digital asset space. This latest minting event suggests that a large entity or a collective of entities requires significant dollar-pegged liquidity. Such demand can stem from various sources, including: Increased Trading Activity: Large trades or arbitrage opportunities often require substantial stablecoin reserves to facilitate swift transactions. Institutional Inflows: Institutions entering the crypto space frequently use stablecoins like USDC as a secure and compliant gateway for their investments. DeFi Protocol Demand: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms rely heavily on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and providing liquidity to various pools. Therefore, this substantial USDC minted transaction is more than just a number; it is a pulse check on market sentiment and liquidity needs, indicating potential upcoming market movements. Understanding the USDC Treasury and Its Operations The USDC Treasury is essentially the issuer of USD Coin, managed by Circle and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium. When new USDC is minted, it means that an equivalent amount of US dollars has been deposited into audited reserve accounts. Conversely, when USDC is ‘burned,’ the corresponding dollars are withdrawn from reserves, maintaining the peg. This meticulous process ensures that USDC maintains its 1:1 peg to the dollar, providing reliability and trust for users. The transparency of these operations is crucial for maintaining confidence in stablecoins. Regular attestations verify that real-world reserves back every USDC minted . This mechanism underpins the stability and utility of USDC as a bridge between traditional finance and the rapidly expanding crypto economy. Moreover, the ability to rapidly mint or burn large quantities of USDC allows the market to efficiently adapt to changing liquidity requirements. This flexibility is a key advantage stablecoins offer compared to traditional banking systems, which can involve slower transaction times and more complex procedures. Market Implications: Why Does 250 Million USDC Minted Matter? The issuance of 250 million USDC minted can have several immediate and long-term implications for the crypto market. Firstly, it adds considerable liquidity, which can facilitate larger trades and potentially reduce slippage for high-volume transactions. This increased liquidity is particularly beneficial for market makers and large institutional investors. Secondly, it often foreshadows significant capital deployment. Large sums of stablecoins are typically not held idly for long periods. They are frequently earmarked for: Purchasing other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, signaling potential upward price pressure. Investing in various DeFi protocols to earn yield, contributing to the growth of the decentralized ecosystem. Facilitating efficient cross-border payments, leveraging the speed and low cost of blockchain technology. Therefore, market observers often view such large mints as a precursor to increased buying pressure for other digital assets, or a clear sign of growing institutional confidence in the crypto space. The substantial amount of USDC minted underscores a healthy and growing demand for a reliable digital dollar. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Large Stablecoin Issuances? The benefits of large stablecoin issuances are clear: they significantly enhance market liquidity, facilitate efficient capital allocation across the crypto landscape, and robustly support the growth of the decentralized finance ecosystem. For traders, having ample USDC available means smoother execution of strategies without significant price impact, ensuring better market efficiency. However, challenges also exist. The concentration of such large minting power raises questions about centralization and potential systemic risks within the crypto economy. While USDC is regularly audited and transparent, its issuance is ultimately controlled by a centralized entity, which can be a point of concern for decentralization advocates. Furthermore, a sudden influx of stablecoins could, in theory, create inflationary pressures if not backed appropriately, though this risk is substantially mitigated by strict reserve requirements for every USDC minted . Overall, while these large issuances are a testament to stablecoin utility and adoption, ongoing scrutiny and regulatory clarity remain important for the long-term health and decentralization of the crypto market. This latest 250 million USDC minted transaction is a clear indicator of the stablecoin’s crucial and evolving role in today’s digital economy. In conclusion, the recent minting of 250 million USDC is a powerful signal of robust demand for stablecoin liquidity within the cryptocurrency market. It highlights USDC’s vital role in facilitating trading, supporting institutional engagement, and fueling the growth of decentralized finance. As the crypto landscape evolves, understanding these large stablecoin movements becomes increasingly important for navigating market dynamics and making informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is USDC and why is it important? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It is important because it provides stability in volatile crypto markets, enabling users to hold digital dollars, facilitate quick transactions, and participate in DeFi without exposure to price fluctuations. 2. Who mints USDC? USDC is minted by the Centre Consortium, a partnership between Circle and Coinbase. They ensure that every USDC token is backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars held in audited reserve accounts. 3. What does it mean when 250 million USDC is minted? When 250 million USDC minted , it signifies that a large amount of US dollars has been deposited into the USDC Treasury’s reserve accounts, and new USDC tokens have been created to match this deposit. This usually indicates increased demand for stablecoin liquidity in the crypto market. 4. How does USDC maintain its 1:1 peg to the US dollar? USDC maintains its 1:1 peg by backing every token with an equivalent amount of US dollars held in reserve accounts. These reserves are regularly audited by independent third parties to ensure transparency and trust. 5. Does a large USDC minting event affect crypto prices? While a large USDC minting event doesn’t directly cause price changes, it often precedes increased buying activity for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This is because users mint USDC to acquire liquidity, which they then deploy into other digital assets or DeFi protocols, potentially leading to upward price pressure.

This significant stablecoin event, reported by Whale Alert, immediately raises questions about its implications for market liquidity and the broader digital asset ecosystem. What does such a substantial injection of USDC mean for traders, investors, and the future of decentralized finance? Understanding Why USDC Gets Minted When we hear about USDC minted , it means new stablecoins have been created and added to the circulating supply. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its value is backed by reserves, typically held in cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds, ensuring its stability. The minting process is crucial for maintaining the stablecoin’s peg and meeting market demand. Essentially, when users or institutions want to convert fiat currency into USDC, new tokens are minted. Conversely, when USDC is redeemed for fiat, those tokens are burned. What Drives This Massive USDC Minted Event? Several factors can trigger a large USDC minted event like the recent $250 million. One primary driver is increased demand for stablecoins within the crypto market. This demand can come from: Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions or corporations entering the crypto space often use stablecoins for settlement or as a gateway. Arbitrage Opportunities: Traders might mint USDC to capitalize on price discrepancies between exchanges, requiring more stablecoin liquidity. DeFi Growth: A booming DeFi sector often needs more stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision. Market Inflows: New capital entering the crypto market often first converts to stablecoins before being deployed into other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, this $250 million injection suggests a significant inflow of capital or an increase in activity that requires stablecoin liquidity. The Impact of Fresh USDC Minted on the Crypto Market The creation of 250 million USDC minted can have various effects on the crypto market. Firstly, it generally indicates increased liquidity. More USDC means more capital readily available to trade, invest, or provide liquidity in decentralized applications. This can potentially lead to: Increased Trading Volume: With more stablecoins, traders can execute larger and more frequent trades across different assets. Potential for Asset Price Rises: If the newly minted USDC is used to purchase other cryptocurrencies, it could contribute to upward price pressure. Enhanced DeFi Activity: Greater USDC supply supports more robust lending pools, yield farming opportunities, and overall DeFi ecosystem expansion. However, it’s also important to note that minting alone doesn’t guarantee immediate market movements. It simply provides the underlying liquidity for potential future actions. Are There Any Challenges or Concerns with Large USDC Minted Amounts? While increased liquidity is often positive, large stablecoin mints also bring certain considerations. The centralized nature of USDC, managed by Circle, means that its issuance and redemption are controlled by a single entity. This centralization, while ensuring stability and regulatory compliance, is a point of discussion for some within the decentralized community. Furthermore, the transparency and auditing of reserves backing the USDC minted supply are paramount. Circle regularly publishes attestations of its reserves, which is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring the 1:1 peg. Any concerns regarding these reserves could impact confidence in the stablecoin. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do? As an investor or enthusiast, observing events like 250 million USDC minted offers valuable insights. It’s a strong signal of increased activity and potential capital inflows into the crypto space. However, it’s vital to: Monitor Market Movements: Watch how this new liquidity is deployed. Does it flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or specific altcoins? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports from reputable sources like Whale Alert and official announcements from Circle. Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Stablecoins are part of a balanced crypto strategy, but diversification remains key. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where stablecoins play an increasingly critical role in facilitating transactions and providing stability. The recent 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is a compelling indicator of growing demand and liquidity within the crypto ecosystem. This significant event highlights the continuous expansion of stablecoin utility, driven by institutional interest, DeFi growth, and general market activity. While offering immense benefits in terms of stability and transaction efficiency, understanding the underlying dynamics and potential implications is key for navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. Stay informed, remain vigilant, and leverage these insights to make informed decisions in your crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions About USDC Minting What does ""USDC minted"" mean? ""USDC minted"" refers to the creation of new USD Coin (USDC) tokens. This typically happens when individuals or institutions deposit fiat currency (like USD) with Circle, the issuer, to convert it into USDC, increasing the stablecoin’s circulating supply. Why was 250 million USDC minted recently? The minting of 250 million USDC suggests a significant increase in demand for stablecoin liquidity. This demand can stem from institutional inflows, increased trading activity, or growth within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. How does USDC minting affect the crypto market? Large USDC mints usually indicate increased liquidity entering the crypto market. This can lead to higher trading volumes, potential capital deployment into other cryptocurrencies, and expanded opportunities within DeFi protocols. Is USDC backed by real assets? Yes, USDC is fully backed by reserves consisting of cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds. Circle, the issuer, regularly publishes attestations to ensure transparency and maintain the 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Is a large USDC minting event always bullish for crypto? While often seen as a positive sign of liquidity and potential capital inflow, a large minting event doesn’t guarantee immediate bullish price action. It provides the capital that could be deployed, but market sentiment and other factors also play a crucial role. Did this article help you understand the significance of large USDC minted events?

The crypto hedge fund investor believes altseason is about to begin within the next 4-6 weeks, potentially sparking a strong market rally.

Recently, B Strategy, a digital asset investment firm established by former Bitmain executives, announced the launch of a $1 billion BNB-focused treasury company. In July, Windtree Therapeutics secured up to $520 million in funding to create one of the largest corporate BNB treasuries, joining the growing trend of public companies diversifying their reserves beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into alternative cryptocurrencies. “Final Stage of Altseason”—CEO Reveals Why Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, provided market insights to Cryptonews regarding potential catalysts for the altseason phase. Youssef noted that major firms and corporations, including Trump Media , are now considering blue-chip altcoins such as ETH, SOL, BNB, and CRO as treasury-grade reserve assets. “This institutional endorsement is accelerating capital movement away from Bitcoin dominance and may signal the onset of altseason’s final phase,” Youssef said. Bitcoin dominance has decreased over the past month, falling below 58% as more than 45 altcoins have outperformed BTC over the last 90 days. Source: X/ IAnon01 Ethereum has spearheaded this movement, gaining over 2% in additional market share, while Solana is rapidly becoming the preferred institutional choice. Youssef added that over $800 million is currently held in corporate SOL treasuries.

The donation comes as Storm was convicted in August 2025 on conspiracy charges for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, while Pertsev received a 64-month prison sentence in the Netherlands for money laundering. SPI CEO Miller Whitehouse-Levine characterized the prosecutions as setting a “ chilling precedent that threatens the software development industry ,” arguing that neither developer took custody of user assets nor maintained control over the protocol after it was deployed. SPI has donated $500,000 to the legal defense of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, the developers of Tornado Cash. Writing code is not a crime. https://t.co/Bam09KwIUM — Solana (@solana) August 28, 2025 Ethereum Foundation Leads Industry Support for Privacy Developer Defense The Ethereum Foundation previously pledged $500,000 to Storm’s legal defense fund, which has raised over $4.7 million toward an ambitious $7 million target. Foundation co-executive director Hsiao-Wei Wang stated that “ privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime ” while calling upon the broader crypto community to contribute additional support. Storm faces up to five years in prison on the money-transmitting conviction, with potentially decades more if prosecutors retry him on deadlocked charges of money laundering conspiracy and sanctions violations. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging that $7 billion had been laundered through the platform since 2019, including frequent use by North Korea’s Lazarus Group hackers. Federal prosecutors characterized Storm as someone who profited from “ hiding dirty money for criminals ,” while defense teams argued the protocol was designed as a privacy tool for legitimate users. Among many others, crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky criticized Storm’s conviction as “ a sad day for DeFi, ” arguing that Section 1960 should not apply to developers of non-custodial protocols who lack control over user funds. Roman Storm was convicted for conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business under Section 1960. The jury was deadlocked on money laundering and sanctions. DOJ will decide in the coming days if it wants to retry those charges in a new trial. A sad day for DeFi. — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) August 6, 2025 The Free Pertsev & Storm organization and legal experts worry that the precedent could criminalize open-source development more broadly across the crypto ecosystem. Cross-Border Evidence Challenges Complicate Crypto Prosecutions Most recently, Storm’s defense revealed major problems with the government’s evidence collection from Dutch authorities following Pertsev’s arrest in the Netherlands. The FBI’s extraction of what prosecutors claimed was Pertsev’s phone was missing author information for forwarded messages and showed incomplete file retrieval. The misattributed Telegram message carried real consequences when Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Arad referenced it during pretrial hearings, telling the judge it demonstrated the co-founders’ awareness of wrongdoing. In Storm’s favor, defense attorneys characterized this as providing “ false information ” to both the court and potentially the grand jury that issued the indictment. As it stands now, Tornado Cash users, developers, and crypto executives continue challenging Treasury sanctions in court, arguing that immutable smart contracts should not be subject to OFAC restrictions. Technical Analysis Points to SOL Recovery Amid Latest Donation Solana’s price action has formed another golden cross pattern on the SOL/BTC ratio at 0.0018841, where the 50-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day average. Source: X/@cryptomanran Historical precedent shows that previous golden crosses have led to explosive rallies of 19x and 340%, although diminishing returns suggest more modest gains as market capitalization grows. The SOL/USD pair currently trades around $213.53 within a long-term horizontal range between $120 and $240, approaching key resistance at the “heaven’s door” level of around $235. Multiple tests of this resistance suggest a heavy supply must be overcome for a continuation toward new all-time highs above the previous $260 peak. Knocking on heaven's door $SOL pic.twitter.com/W3zXalUn7y — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) August 28, 2025 Short-term price action shows SOL testing a key ascending trendline that has provided support throughout the current advance. A successful hold of the ascending trendline support, combined with momentum building, could target the $235 resistance level. Conversely, failure below $210 might trigger a deeper correction. The golden cross pattern provides the most compelling bullish argument; however, investors should expect initial volatility before any sustained advance materializes, potentially leading to new highs above $260.

As history has shown, tokens in this price band have provided some of the greatest surprises during bull runs with low takeoff prices and thriving communities being the key drivers of parabolic moves. 1) MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGACOIN) At the head of the program is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is in presale phase and with great inflows by retail investors. As opposed to numerous meme coins, MAGACOIN is no longer only a hype: rapid transaction time, a scalable network and a well-explained roadmap are gainings traction. The Redditors believe that MAGACOIN has the potential to be the next one to blow up into 2025 with the community size and the scarcity induced presale patterns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Verified Altcoin With Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year , MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a Hashex audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. 2) BONK BONK powered by Solana has developed momentum with its meme strength coupled with DeFi and NFT implementation. Price targets mentioned by analysts are the probable values at the end of the year and vary depending on the strength of the meme cycle: namely, varying between 0.000027 to 0.000040. 3) PEPE PEPE remains one of the most meme-coin viral ones, and this strong cultural influence favors it. According to the speculations of the Reddit traders, in case the meme power proceeds into late 2025, it is expected to rally to the range of around 0.00004. 4) World Liberty Financial (WLFI) WLFI is special because it is related to American politicians and DeFi innovation. Exchange listings are around the corner and a community-fueled vote has raised confidence, making Redditors feel that it is a token in terms of narrative as well as in terms of speculative growth. 5) Other Reddit stuff Outside headline selections, the highest ARO mentions on Reddit include Anarchy (SOL-based), Algorand (ALGO), VeChain (VET), Ravencoin (RVN), SUI, Render Token (RNDR) and Nano (NANO). These projects carry different strengths such as decentralized infrastructure and robust ecosystems and could experience positive price movement over summer. Final Takeaway The 2025 summer will be a low cost speculation period to the redditors traders. Whether it is meme-driven coins as BONK and PEPE or more utility-based builds like WLFI, they all share one thing in common they have great community momentum. At the heart of it all is MAGACOIN FINANCE which is proving to be the breakout sub-1-dollar coin not just in price but fundamentals of the growth game that could potentially see the token generating disproportionate returns in the coming months.

While Cardano (ADA) has been a long-term contender in this race, a new AI-powered token, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is showing the kind of explosive momentum that could see it reach this target sooner. Backed by substantial early investor bonuses, a key CoinMarketCap partnership, and a successful audit, Ruvi AI is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising altcoins of the current cycle. Professional Validation Creates Unprecedented Demand For a project to be considered a serious contender, it must first establish a foundation of trust and credibility. Ruvi AI has meticulously built this foundation, setting the stage for its explosive growth. The project began by successfully completing a comprehensive third-party security audit from CyberScope , which verified the integrity and security of its smart contracts. This move provided the technical assurance that serious investors demand. This credibility was then amplified by a strategic partnership that led to a listing on CoinMarketCap , the world’s most trusted crypto data authority. The listing provided global visibility and triggered a wave of demand, reflected in its presale metrics: Almost $3.3M raised with remarkable speed. Over 250M tokens sold to a rapidly growing global community. A holder base surpassing 3,200 investors , with momentum accelerating daily. This powerful combination of a successful audit and mainstream validation is why analysts believe Ruvi AI is on a faster track to significant valuation milestones. A Super App with Utility to Power a $1 Run While Cardano’s value proposition is rooted in its blockchain infrastructure, Ruvi AI’s path to $1 is fueled by its application in a high-growth, modern industry: the $104 billion creator economy . Its all-in-one super app is designed to empower content creators with AI-powered tools, creating a sustainable ecosystem that drives long-term demand for the RUVI token. The super app offers a suite of tools that give creators a competitive edge: Advanced Trend Research : Identifies viral topics before they become mainstream, allowing users to capitalize on trends early. AI-Powered Script Generation : Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram to maximize audience retention. Native Media Creation : Allows creators to generate high-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining workflows. Streamlined Workflows : A central dashboard enhances productivity for planning, editing, and scheduling content. Structured Growth and Imminent 40% Price Surge Ruvi AI’s presale is designed to reward early investors with predictable, guaranteed growth. Having sold out its initial stages in record time, the project has now entered Phase 3. Current Price (Phase 3) : $0.020 Next Price (Phase 4) : The token is set for an automatic 40% price increment to $0.028. This imminent price surge is creating a powerful sense of urgency. To ensure a smooth transition to public trading, a partnership with the major exchange WEEX has already been secured, guaranteeing deep liquidity and a professional trading environment for all token holders. The Path to Extraordinary Returns For investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity, Ruvi AI’s VIP program is structured to turn early investments into potentially life-altering returns, offering significant bonus tokens that amplify the ROI. VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 5 ($10,000 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway adds another exciting incentive for top contributors. The Verdict: Speed and Momentum Matter While Cardano is an established giant, the path to exponential growth often favors the agile and innovative newcomer. Ruvi AI has the professional validation, market momentum, and real-world utility to make a serious run at the $1 mark. With Phase 3 live and a 40% price jump on the horizon, the opportunity to be part of what could be this cycle’s biggest story is here, but it won’t last long.

Despite price pullbacks, Solana’s ecosystem continues to see industry-leading adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin holds up well in the meme coin space as liquidity and volumes continue to be strong. Analysts, however, reckon the strongest upgrade this quarter goes to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is viewed as a rare hybrid of safety and explosive upside. Solana: Revenue Leader Despite Market Volatility The current price of Solana is around $188. The price of Solana has dropped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours. Over the last few sessions, the price corrected as the market faced technical rejections. The price of Solana has dropped by around 8-10% during that time. Support has developed at $200, and resistance is $211–$215. Despite this temporary setback, Solana remains one of the strongest ecosystems in the industry. During the last 23 weeks, the network remains ahead in blockchain revenue, generating over $1.3 billion so far this year, beating all L1 and L2 competition in H1 2025. Further institutional adoption is highlighted by Sharps Technology’s $400 million digital asset treasury on Solana. The Solana Foundation confirms that a company is buying Solana for $50 million at a discount, which illustrates growing confidence by public companies. The analysts are concerned about the futures positioning and open positionsin the Solana market, however they remain bullish on fundamentals. If the SOL manages to reclaim the $211 level, the technical upside could lead to it reaching $215 and beyond, owing to its DeFi and institutional backing. Dogecoin: Meme Coin Liquidity and Retail Demand At present, Dogecoin is trading at just above $0.211, which is up just above 0.7%. Amid a market capitalization of $30.8 billion and a daily trading volume of about $2.7 billion, retail is still participating. Meme coin demand is steady. Over the last 48 hours, there haven’t been any major protocol upgrades and partnership announcements for Dogecoin, however, Dogecoin continues thriving as a community and meme-driven asset. Due to its traditional retail following and liquidity, it is often ranked as one of the highest networks by engagement. Traders who are looking for a meme coin to trade have DOGE in mind, which has remained stable during the market consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Deliver Major Price Prediction Update As Solana and Dogecoin gather momentum, analysts have made a major upgrade to MAGACOIN FINANCE, deeming it a safer high-upside play. The project has passed all tests and is rated completely safe, secure, and fully transparent following double audits from HashEx and CertiK. MAGACOIN FINANCE is unique in that it balances safety and growth. It offers a perfect mix of security and accelerating community adoption, unlike speculative meme coins. Whale inflows are on the rise, early retail momentum is strong, and its presale structure is designed to ensure scarcity. Analysts say this convergence of demand and transparency explains why it is being framed as one of the smartest plays of the year . Forecasts suggest 300x growth potential, and with a KYC-verified team plus thousands of investors already on board, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 before allocations run out. Conclusion Solana continues to impress with institutional adoption and ecosystem strength, while Dogecoin remains a key retail-driven asset with consistent liquidity. Yet, analysts argue that the strongest upgrade this quarter belongs to a presale project. With double audits, a transparent team, and forecasts of 40x upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as the safer high-upside play — and one of the most compelling cryptos to buy in 2025 before allocations disappear.

The remarks highlight the role of the XRP army, a group of long-term holders and dedicated supporters who, despite frustrations, have played a decisive part in keeping the token afloat through years of legal disputes and market challenges. Why Ripple’s XRP Survived All These Years XRP has become a topic of discussion within the crypto community due to its connection with Ripple and its dedicated army. A crypto market expert known as ‘Crypto Bitlord,’ took to X social media on Tuesday to highlight why XRP didn’t collapse years ago despite its controversial history. According to him, the true reason behind XRP’s survival was the unwavering support of its community rather than Ripple itself. Crypto Bitlord explained that without the XRP army, Ripple would have failed years ago. He pointed out that from 2013 through 2021, the crypto company allegedly sustained itself by consistently selling tokens , a practice that he claimed was absorbed mainly by retail investors. In his view, the constant buying from the XRP army kept the cryptocurrency alive and maintained liquidity during turbulent times. The crypto expert further suggested that with the support of retail participants, XRP could have overtaken Ethereum (ETH) in market capitalization , but it failed to do so due to Ripple’s alleged history of token dumpings. Interestingly, Crypto Bitlord’s statement came in response to a heated remark made by another crypto community member, ‘BuryMeBig.’ The commentator had vehemently argued that Ripple does not care about the XRP army, despite the community’s role in supporting the company during difficult moments, including its recently concluded legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Many members agreed with BuryMeBig’s statement, recognizing that while Ripple has operated primarily as a business and software company, XRP holders maintained different expectations, viewing the token as a potential for life-changing gains. Crypto Bitlord himself expressed frustration with XRP’s performance over the years, revealing that if the cryptocurrency ever drops back to $2 , he would liquidate his holdings entirely. After going long on XRP for 12 years, the crypto market expert admitted to being disillusioned by the lack of substantial growth compared to other leading cryptocurrencies . XRP Chart Points To Possible Short-Term Gains In other news, crypto market analyst Don shared a technical analysis on X, predicting short-term bullish targets for XRP. His chart outlines two potential levels for XRP’s next rally , setting price expectations at $4.45 and then $5.48. Don’s chart analysis reveals that XRP has been trading within a long-term ascending channel . After experiencing a strong upward move earlier this year, the altcoin entered a corrective phase marked by a descending wedge pattern . If XRP’s price breaks out from the wedge pattern, it could resume its climb toward the upper resistance of the channel, aligning with Don’s near-term bullish targets.",XRP|Altcoin|Ascending Channel Pattern|Bitlord|BuryMeBig|Crypto Analyst Don|Descending Wedge Pattern|ETH|Ethereum|ripple|ripple news|US SEC|XRP Army|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 18:00:01

Crypto Analyst Lays Out The Possibilities",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-to-rally-5600-to-200/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has raised the possibility of the XRP price rallying to $200. This followed his analysis using the regression model, which showed that the altcoin could record a 5,600% rally to this price target. How The XRP Price Could Rally 5,600% To $200 In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price could rally to $200 if it were to overshoot the linear regression line. He alluded to the monthly timeframe, which reflected the analysis of hits, misses, and overshoots using linear regression on a log scale. The analyst then noted that the analysis is grounded in a 2-standard deviation model. Related Reading: Analyst Suggests Thinking Of XRP As Just ‘Payments’ Is Primitive, Here’s The Real Deal Egrag Crypto further highlighted the R-squared value in the regression model. He explained that this is a critical metric in indicating how well the regression line fits the data, with values closer to 1 representing a better fit. Essentially, 0.0 means no correlation, 0.5 indicates a moderate correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect correlation. The crypto analyst then revealed that the current R-squared is at 0.84754, indicating a highly fitting model. He further remarked that this means around 84.75% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable. In applying this theory to XRP price prediction, Egrag Crypto stated that the altcoin has reached the upper edge of the regression line three times. Notably, the XRP price recorded a notable overshoot on one occasion, when it surged by 570%. Meanwhile, in the 2021 cycle, it missed the target by 45%. Egrag Crypto stated that the altcoin is currently hovering around the midpoint of the regression. Based on his analysis, a hit of this regression line would put XRP at $27, while a miss of 45%, as seen in the 2021 cycle, would put the altcoin at $18. The overshoot of 570% is what could cause XRP to skyrocket to $200. Egrag Crypto noted that these targets will likely increase as the regression model is trending upward. What’s Next For The Altcoin Crypto analyst CasiTrades has provided insights into what to expect from the XRP price amid the latest decline. In an X post, she noted that the altcoin has printed a new low and remains within its larger consolidation pattern, even as it recently tested the key trendline around $2.91. The analyst also revealed that the area is the golden retrace, which is where Wave 2s love to correct before continuing higher. Related Reading: Analyst Says It Doesn’t Matter What Analysis You Use, XRP Price Is Set To Explode As such, if this level holds, CasiTrades believes that the XRP price could be setting up a textbook Elliot Wave continuation for Wave 3. She stated that the next confirmation point is $3.12. The analyst explained that this is the resistance level that is capping a higher move. Therefore, a break above that level would mean that the higher Fibonacci extensions are aligning nicely. At the time of writing, the XRP Price is trading at around $3, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Source: Glassnode XRP Slips, BNB Peaks, Solana Soars XRP trades at $3, with 92% of supply in profit. Daily addresses fell to 38,000, but on-chain volume rose 23% to $2 billion, suggesting some investors are starting to take gains. BNB, at $870, has 100% of its supply in profit, a rare situation. Activity surged 19% to 2 million daily addresses, and volume grew to $2.7 billion. Funding rates, however, slipped into negative territory at -0.0034%, pointing to hedging against downside risk. Solana is trading at $213, with 96% of supply in profit. Network use is strong, with 4 million daily addresses, up 7%. On-chain volume jumped 29% to $10.1 billion. Futures open interest is at $8.6 billion, with positive funding. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana’s profitability is paired with rising usage. In addition, Cronos (CRO) has surged 59% in 24 hours to $0.37, making it one of the best performers in the market. On-chain data shows 87% of CRO holders are in profit, placing it alongside other major coins flashing high profitability. Trading volume has jumped to multi-month highs. The move follows weeks of steady recovery and was accelerated by news of a Trump Media partnership with Crypto.com. Sentiment around CRO shows both optimism and anxiety, with analysts cautioning that such profit levels often precede selling pressure. Liquidations Sweep the Market Even with most investors in profit, liquidations remain heavy. In the past day, over 93,900 traders were liquidated, totaling $261 million.

The holding, made through Berkshire’s insurance subsidiary National Indemnity Company, rose to 10.23%, up from 9.74% in March. This increase makes the U.S. conglomerate an even bigger shareholder in Japan’s biggest trading company. A Mitsubishi spokesperson said Berkshire “continues to believe in the firm’s medium to long-term growth.” This comes nearly five years after Warren Buffett first bought into five Japanese trading houses in 2020. The investment is part of Warren’s wider Japan strategy, which includes positions in Sumitomo, Itochu, Marubeni, and Mitsui, alongside Mitsubishi, all of which dominate Japan’s global trade pipeline, with investments stretching from energy to metals to food distribution. And since the original announcement, Berkshire has gradually added to these holdings, especially during periods of market softness, rarely revealing purchases until they are already done. Warren rules out railroad acquisition but cuts new freight deal While increasing Berkshire’s footprint in Japan, Warren also addressed rising chatter about U.S. railroad mergers. On August 3, he and CEO-in-waiting Greg Abel met with Joseph Hinrichs, the CEO of CSX, at Warren’s Omaha office. The meeting was private; no aides, no assistants. Warren later told Becky Quick on CNBC that Berkshire “would not make a bid” to buy CSX. Instead, he said the three executives discussed ways to cooperate and make U.S. freight rail more efficient. Just days later, CSX and BNSF Railway, which Berkshire owns, announced a partnership to offer new coast-to-coast freight service across the U.S. The announcement hit markets immediately. On the news that Berkshire would not buy CSX, shares of CSX fell 5%, closing at $32.81. Union Pacific dropped around 2%, and Norfolk Southern slid more than 2%. Even Berkshire’s own stock dipped, though by less than 1%. The dip followed a month of speculation after Union Pacific said it would buy Norfolk Southern for $85 billion, sparking rumors that Warren might jump into a railroad buying spree. Hinrichs didn’t offer much detail after the meeting, but CSX told CNBC it would “continue exploring additional service options that will efficiently improve transcontinental service.” Leadership change and valuation uncertainty drive investor focus While Berkshire keeps building positions abroad and striking new deals at home, investors are still locked in on the company’s leadership handoff and cash mountain. The latest quarterly earnings show Berkshire sitting on $344 billion in cash, the most it’s ever held. The company also continues to sell more stock than it buys, signaling a cautious stance in a market where valuations remain high. Even with that much dry powder, Berkshire hasn’t made a major acquisition. And that’s bothering some shareholders, especially with declining net income, flat revenue growth, and insurance profits weakening. The company’s Q2 results showed just how carefully it’s been navigating. Still, those figures haven’t changed the core near-term risks: the shift from Warren to Abel, and what they plan to do with that massive cash pile. Warren, who remains Chairman, has gradually handed more responsibility to Greg Abel, who’s expected to become CEO once Warren steps down. Abel’s presence at the CSX meeting shows he’s already operating at the highest level. The market is watching closely to see how much of Warren’s strategy Abel will carry forward, and how soon the handover will actually happen. Despite some hesitation around the company’s pace, valuation remains a big talking point. Twenty-nine members of the Simply Wall St Community estimated that Berkshire Hathaway could be undervalued by up to 30%. They put the company’s fair value between $577,396 and $1.06 million per share.

This could deliver explosive returns for early adopters. The question isn’t whether XRP will pump againit’s whether you’re missing the bigger opportunity. XRP momentum driven by regulatory clarity XRP finally broke free from SEC uncertainty, driving massive institutional FOMO.

On August 28, the exchange introduced upgrades to its OTC liquidity and execution services. The improvements aim to reduce slippage and provide better pricing for large trades. The system now aggregates liquidity not only from Binance’s internal pools but also from external market makers. By sourcing real-time prices externally, traders gain access to more liquidity, tighter spreads, and lower execution costs. Faster Settlement and Bespoke Execution Binance will now offer two distinct trade execution models. Instant settlement: OTC trades can be settled in as little as 15 minutes.

The team, led by analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted that Bitcoin's volatility has fallen to historic lows, pushing its fair value higher. Volatility, which began the year at around 60%, has now fallen to around 30%. According to JPMorgan, this decline brings Bitcoin's risk-adjusted performance closer to that of gold. Panigirtzoglou said, “Yes, we expect this rise by the end of the year.” Analysts have compared the tendency for corporate treasuries to accumulate Bitcoin to suppress volatility, likening it to central banks reducing bond market volatility after 2008. Corporate treasuries reportedly currently hold more than 6% of Bitcoin's total supply. Related News: BREAKING: Nvidia Releases Earnings Report - Could Impact Many Altcoins, Here Are the Details Additionally, analysts believe index-based inflows are also supporting the rally. MicroStrategy's inclusion in major indices and Metaplanet's promotion to mid-cap status on the FTSE Russell index have fueled new capital inflows. Pointing out that corporate competition has increased, the report stated that KindlyMD, traded on Nasdaq, applied for a $5 billion capital increase after setting Bitcoin as its primary reserve, while Adam Back's company BSTR aims to rival Marathon Digital. JPMorgan argued that reduced volatility is a significant advantage for institutional investments. Analysts estimate that Bitcoin's risk capital consumption ratio compared to gold has fallen to a record low of 2.0. At this rate, Bitcoin's approximately $2.2 trillion market capitalization should increase by 13%, bringing it closer to gold's private investment value, which would push the price to $126,000. *This is not investment advice.

KENDU does not rely on a fleeting narrative. It does not promise cutting-edge tech. It does not rely on paying influencers and Key Opinion Leaders (or “KOLs”) to artificially create hype. Over the last 16 months, the community has carved its own path, expanding its reach in all directions. This is the first “Brand Coin” with a passionate community of autonomous marketers. The “Permissionless Brand” Concept Most businesses strictly guard their brands from unauthorized use, often threatening and pursuing legal action. KENDU takes the opposite approach. The name, logo and concept are original Intellectual Property and free for anyone to use, remix and share. This philosophy does two powerful things: 1. Invites and encourages creativity. Instead of the brand being shaped by a few individuals in boardrooms, thousands with diverse backgrounds, geography, talents and ideas can contribute and take the brand in any direction they please. 2. Transforms supporters into marketers. Community members building under the KENDU umbrella not only instantly tap into their first several hundred users, product testers and buyers, but also into an autonomous marketing machine. No approvals. No licensing red tape. Whether you want to design a hoodie, paint a mural, or simply create a viral meme—you KENDU it. The Power of Community & Decentralization Since its launch in March 2024, the KENDU community has had several key chances to demonstrate their strength. It was the second-ever memecoin to garner over 50,000 votes on the popular and reputable security platform, CertiK Skynet , earning free KYC and a full project audit. This audit was completed in February of 2025—analyzing not only the coin’s contract security, and tokenomics, but also its social impact, community sentiment and decentralization. Due to the project’s early fundamentals, longevity and several periods of redistribution, KENDU now is one of the most decentralized memecoins in the space, boasting a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (or “HHI”) of approximately 29%. These metrics, combined with the permissionless brand concept, exemplifies the core principle of cryptocurrency—decentralization. The Concept in Action This novel concept has manifested itself in many ways, almost too many to list, not only in web3, but web2 and in real life (“IRL”). – Food & Beverage: KENDU Energy developed a wildly successful energy drink, already selling and distributing over 6,000 cans to Europe, North America and Australia. The team has committed to using a portion of the funds raised to purchase and hold $KENDU and has donated hundreds of cans to sponsor events. Several community members have developed KENDU beers, achieving a commercial license and distributing in the EU. KENDU Coffee developed a custom KENDU roast, which achieved a grade of 89/100, firmly placing it in the “specialty” category by Q graders. Other community members have made KENDU chocolate, baked goods, sweets and more. – Event Sponsorship: An artistic street team called KENDU Street formed early on, and has sponsored events in Florida, Tennessee and soon Pennsylvania. KENDU Energy and merch were on full display at MuralFest during Art Basel. The team held its own cypher showcase, a breakdancing competition during Miami Music Week. Custom KENDU Energy cocktails were served to thirsty festival goers at the Florida Groves Music Festival in Orlando. Accompanying these multi-day events was a team of KENDU holders and artists who painted live KENDU murals and tag walls. One community member started an events company in India, KENDU Entertainment, and has sponsored many nightclub events, as well as pickleball tournaments. Capitalizing on one of the fastest growing sports in the world, KENDU Entertainment is planning to sponsor a 10-city tour, where KENDU will be front and center. – Merchandise: Several independently run apparel and footwear stores have emerged—offering not only a creative and profitable outlet for these purveyors, but also a way for other community members to sport “KENDU” on their hats, shirts and shoes in their day-to-day lives. One professional jeweler in the community created a custom 1:1 silver KENDU pendant and sold out of handmade KENDU dog tags. Just this week, a newly formed company, KENDU Brilliance , teased upcoming jewelry products. Another entrepreneur unveiled a concept for “KENDU VENDU Refreshment Solutions,” an AI-driven vending machine, that can be purchased, delivered, installed and stocked to provide passive income to its owner. – Gaming: A successful video game developer has come out of retirement and started an indie game studio called KENDU Games. With a team of 5 employees, including ex-AAA and BioWare talent, its first release slated for Q4 of 2025 on Steam, the popular online gaming marketplace. The studio has committed to using a portion of the profits from the studio to purchase and hold $KENDU in its treasury. Another member is working on sponsoring an eSports team, who will wear KENDU apparel and be fueled by KENDU Energy drinks. This list is not exhaustive, but rather a snapshot of the endeavors taking place in the KENDU community. A Movement, Not a Meme When people feel like they own a brand, they don’t just buy into it, they build it, fiercely defend it, and share it with their networks. KENDU takes the core crypto concept of decentralization a step further by open sourcing its culture. It is not one central team trying to grow an audience, but rather an audience transforming into a team. KENDU is more than a token—it is a living, breathing example of how decentralization, creativity and community combine to redefine what a brand can be. The permissionless approach turns holders into co-creators, allowing rapid expansion throughout many industries and farther than any marketing budget could. It is not simply something you invest in—it’s something you can join . KENDU is primarily an Ethereum-based token but has also partnered with Wormhole to be available on both Solana and Base blockchains: Ethereum : 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18 Solana : 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45 Base : 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7 Learn more at kendu.io .

What started as a promising presale has morphed into a full-blown phenomenon, with experts now suggesting it could rival the forecasts of established giants like Bitcoin. With predictions of a potential 9900% ROI before 2026, RUVI is rapidly becoming the must-have token for investors looking to position themselves for the next major market cycle. Professional Validation Ignites Explosive Demand The foundation of Ruvi AI’s incredible ascent is its commitment to professional credibility, a factor that has attracted serious capital. The project’s strategic listing on CoinMarketCap provided instant mainstream exposure, putting it on the radar of millions of global investors. This visibility was powerfully reinforced by a successful third-party security audit from CyberScope , which verified the integrity of its smart contracts and provided a crucial layer of trust. This one-two punch of visibility and security has translated into staggering presale numbers: Almost $3.3M raised in record time, signaling massive market confidence. Over 250M tokens sold to an enthusiastic and rapidly growing community. A holder base now surpassing 3,200 investors , with new participants joining daily. These metrics are not just numbers; they are proof of a project with the momentum and backing to achieve its ambitious goals. The Super App Powering a 9900% Vision A stunning ROI forecast requires more than just hype; it needs a foundation of real-world utility. Ruvi AI delivers this with its revolutionary super app, an all-in-one toolkit designed to empower creators in the $104 billion creator economy . This tangible use case is the engine driving long-term value. Advanced Trend Research : AI-driven tools analyze market data to identify viral trends before they happen, giving creators a powerful first-mover advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation : The platform generates high-impact, platform-specific scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, engineered for maximum engagement. Native Media Creation : With built-in image and video generators, creators can produce high-quality content without relying on expensive third-party software. Streamlined Workflows : A unified dashboard allows creators to plan, edit, schedule, and publish content with unmatched efficiency. This ecosystem creates sustained, organic demand for the RUVI token, providing the substance needed to support a potential 9900% ROI. A Clear Path to Growth: Phase 3 and Beyond Ruvi AI’s presale is structured to reward early investors with clear, predictable price appreciation. The project has successfully entered Phase 3, locking in gains for early backers and setting the stage for the next leg up. Current Price (Phase 3) : $0.020 Next Price (Phase 4) : The token is scheduled for a 40% price increment to $0.028. This transparent structure creates powerful FOMO, as each phase offers diminishing returns for latecomers. To ensure a seamless transition to the open market, a partnership with the major exchange WEEX is already secured, guaranteeing deep liquidity and professional trading infrastructure from day one. VIP Tiers: Your Gateway to a 9900% ROI For those aiming for the highest possible returns, Ruvi AI’s VIP program offers substantial token bonuses that dramatically amplify the ROI potential. VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 5 ($10,000 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway adds another layer of incentive, rewarding the most engaged community members with additional tokens. The End-of-Summer Verdict The window of opportunity is closing. Ruvi AI has proven its credibility, demonstrated its utility, and built unstoppable momentum. With Phase 3 now live and a 40% price jump on the horizon, the chance to secure a position at this foundational level is disappearing. For investors looking for a project with the potential to define the next market cycle, Ruvi AI is the must-have token before summer ends.

Davinci Jeremie, who gained notoriety for advising people to buy Bitcoin at just $1 back in 2013, has now issued a strong forecast for XRP, noting that the token’s chart displays a healthy structure and a bullish pattern. Davinci Jeremie Maps XRP Price Path To $4.93 With Fibonacci Levels In his detailed breakdown, Jeremie focused on XRP’s recent movements and the structure forming on its chart. He pointed to a clear W-shaped pattern as a bullish signal. According to him, the market action that pushed XRP higher in recent weeks appeared to be organic, with genuine investor activity providing support rather than artificial manipulation. Related Reading: Pundit Says Bitcoin Price Crash Is Not Over, Why A Decline Below $100,000 Is Coming Jeremie explained that he used the Fibonacci extension levels to calculate possible price targets for XRP. He said the 1.618 level comes in at 4,555 Chilean pesos, but he believes the token could go slightly higher. His projection puts the token at 4,761 pesos, which converts to about $4.93. If this outlook materializes, XRP would not only maintain its current momentum but also surpass its previous all-time high of $3.65, which it met in July of this year. According to the analyst, XRP’s earlier moves in late 2024 appeared forced, with extreme jumps that raised doubts, but this newest action looks more natural and could carry further implications. He emphasized that the chart math and price behavior support the path to further bullish growth, while the token’s structure itself demonstrates clear strength. Bitcoin Maximalist Turns Bullish On XRP’s Market Structure What makes this analysis stand out even more is who it is coming from. Davinci Jeremie has long been regarded as a strong supporter of Bitcoin, often described as a Bitcoin maximalist. His early call for people to buy BTC when the price was at only $1 has given him lasting credibility in the cryptocurrency space. For that reason, his positive comments on XRP are being taken very seriously by many in the market. Related Reading: Rumored Ripple NDA Suggests Trump, BlackRock, And JP Morgan Are Working With XRP Ledger Jeremie emphasized that XRP’s moves from January to June formed a clean W formation on the weekly chart. He explained how the token reached a high of $ 3.40 in January, dropped to around $2.11 in April, rebounded to $2.60 in May, declined to near $2 in June, and then rallied strongly to surpass its January high. That sequence, he said, completed the pattern and opened the door for more gains. His change of tone shows that a strong market structure can override token bias. Even for someone who has close ties to Bitcoin, the health of XRP’s current chart was enough to spark a bullish outlook. Jeremie’s analysis suggests that more investors may start looking at XRP differently, seeing it as an asset with room to grow beyond old expectations.

50827785,567747,1756407658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50827785.jpeg,"New Wallets Receive 78,891 Ethereum Worth $358M From FalconX – Whale Activity Surges",https://bitcoinist.com/wallets-receive-78891-ethereum-worth-358m-falconx/,"Ethereum has faced heightened volatility after setting new all-time highs, with the price retracing to lower levels in recent sessions. The sharp swings have tested investor sentiment, but beneath the surface, institutional demand and whale accumulation continue to tell a different story. Despite the pullbacks, big players are buying Ethereum aggressively, signaling confidence in its long-term trajectory. Data from Lookonchain confirms this trend, revealing that whales and institutions have been steadily adding ETH to their holdings at a rapid pace. This wave of accumulation stands in sharp contrast to the short-term price fluctuations, suggesting that well-capitalized investors view the current environment as an opportunity rather than a risk. Their activity provides a strong foundation for market stability and sets the stage for potential upside. Analysts argue that this institutional participation is only the beginning of a broader trend. With Ethereum cementing its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and institutional-grade infrastructure, many believe its rally is far from over. Some forecasts now point to ETH climbing above $5,000 in the near future, fueled by persistent demand and expanding adoption. For investors, Ethereum’s story is increasingly about accumulation and positioning for what may come next. Institutions Keep Accumulating Ethereum According to Lookonchain, fresh onchain data from Arkham Intelligence highlights a major wave of Ethereum accumulation that underscores the confidence of large players. Over the past 30 hours, four newly created wallets — possibly linked to BitMine — received a total of 78,891 ETH, worth approximately $358.16 million, directly from FalconX. These inflows mark yet another sign that whales and institutions are positioning aggressively, even as volatility continues to test short-term sentiment. This buying trend is not new, but its scale and consistency strengthen Ethereum’s bullish case. Analysts note that persistent institutional demand provides a firm foundation for ETH’s price structure, helping the asset absorb market swings while setting the stage for potential upside. With this type of accumulation underway, many market watchers argue that it is only a matter of time before Ethereum breaks decisively above the $5,000 level. Such a move could carry broader implications beyond Ethereum itself. For years, traders have speculated that a clear breakout in ETH could act as the catalyst for the long-awaited “altseason,” where capital rotates into the wider altcoin market. With Ethereum already leading the way — surging more than 250% since April — the stage appears set for another cycle-defining moment. Price Action Details: Bullish Consolidation Ethereum is trading around $4,600 after bouncing from recent lows near $4,400, showing resilience despite heightened volatility. The 4-hour chart highlights a constructive structure, with ETH now holding above the 50-day ($4,533) and 100-day ($4,493) moving averages. This defense suggests that buyers are maintaining control of key levels, keeping the broader uptrend intact even after sharp retracements. The price action also shows ETH consolidating just below resistance near $4,800, the level that capped its last rally. A decisive breakout above this zone would be crucial for momentum, potentially opening the door for a retest of the $5,000 psychological barrier. Analysts see this level as the trigger that could spark renewed bullish sentiment and extend Ethereum’s rally into price discovery. If ETH loses support at $4,500, the market could see another dip toward $4,300, where the last strong demand emerged. Below that, the 200-day moving average at $4,146 serves as the ultimate safeguard for the current trend. Ethereum’s consolidation reflects balance: bulls are defending higher lows, while resistance at $4,800 remains the key ceiling to break. The next move above or below these levels will likely define ETH’s short-term trajectory.

Here’s Why It’s Bigger Than You Think,https://timestabloid.com/everyone-thought-ripple-was-just-trying-to-fix-swift-heres-why-its-bigger-than-you-think/,"Crypto enthusiast All Things XRP recently outlined Ripple’s progression from its founding to its current role in global finance. According to the post, Ripple was established in 2012 to challenge SWIFT, the long-standing financial messaging system. At that time, banks relied on outdated systems that were slow and expensive for cross-border payments. Ripple introduced RippleNet and XRP as alternatives, offering real-time and low-cost transactions. This approach was described as fast, frictionless, and significantly different from the traditional banking infrastructure, positioning Ripple as an innovative player in global settlements. EVERYONE THOUGHT RIPPLE WAS JUST TRYING TO FIX SWIFT. But they weren’t building a payment company… They were building a financial empire to power a new global internet—one where XRP moves everything. It’s bigger than you think. pic.twitter.com/R1NzE3YfLR — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) August 27, 2025 XRP as a Strategic Entry Point The tweet highlighted that Ripple’s use of XRP extended beyond simple money transfers. Through its On-Demand Liquidity solution, XRP enabled banks and institutions to settle cross-border payments instantly without the need for pre-funded accounts. This model provided a new method for global banking operations, and according to the post, became Ripple’s gateway into the broader financial sector. XRP was described as the tool that allowed Ripple to gain influence in international finance, serving as more than just a payment mechanism but as a foundation for a broader strategy. The SEC Case and Its Aftermath The post also reflected on Ripple’s legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which began in 2020. While many initially viewed the lawsuit as a severe setback, All Things XRP stated that Ripple instead expanded its operations internationally during that period, refining its focus and strengthening its global presence. By 2023, XRP received a ruling in U.S. courts declaring it not to be a security. This legal clarification was framed as a turning point that enables Ripple to re-establish stronger ties in the American market. Rebrand and Broader Vision The tweet noted that in 2025, Ripple redefined its role, moving beyond payments and positioning itself as the driver of what it called the “Internet of Value.” This rebrand was compared to the transformation of the internet, which enables the instant transfer of information. Ripple’s aim was presented as enabling the instant transfer of value, whether money, assets, or commodities. This shift was described as an expansion of Ripple’s mission into a broader financial ecosystem. Tokenization and Market Integration All Things XRP emphasized that Ripple’s plans now include tokenization of real-world assets. Examples given included oil through partnerships with entities such as Saudi Aramco’s WhiteRock, as well as real estate and U.S. Treasuries. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was described as infrastructure capable of supporting more than $10 trillion in tokenized assets, enabling fractional ownership and real-time settlement. Additionally, Ripple has introduced a USD-backed stablecoin known as RLUSD, which operates across XRPL and Ethereum, and has entered into work with several central banks on central bank digital currencies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expanding Global Reach According to the post, Ripple has also broadened its presence across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Over 100 banks are reportedly onboarded through RippleNet, with more than $300 million in commitments. XRP futures now trade on exchanges such as CME and Coinbase, and analysts have estimated an 85 percent likelihood of an XRP exchange-traded fund being approved by the end of the year. Toward a Parallel Financial System The tweet concluded by stating that Ripple is no longer simply a payments company but has grown into a conglomerate offering custody, compliance, tokenization, and stablecoin services. The post framed Ripple’s work as creating a parallel global financial system that is tokenized, programmable, and international in scope.

When policy clarifies—as with stablecoins—product builders quickly align to those standards worldwide.” Given this, Nexo believes that a U.S. presence for global blockchain companies is more about interoperating with institutional pipes under clear rules, so that products built for the region can become the global reference. “A clear example of this is Brazil and Mexico using Circle’s stablecoin USDC,” they said. “USDC is now directly connected to the countries’ national instant payment rails, PIX and SPEI, so businesses can move between BRL or MXN and dollar stablecoins through local banks in minutes rather than days.” Blockchain Companies Move Back to the U.S. In addition to Nexo and TON Foundation, Deribit, a Netherlands-based derivatives exchange, recently announced its entry into the U.S. market. Wintermute, a London-based algorithmic trading platform, also opened a New York office in May. While global blockchain companies are entering the U.S. market, companies that left the region are also coming back. Jennie Levin, chief legal and operating officer at the Algorand Foundation, told Cryptonews that layer-1 blockchain Algorand was launched in Boston, even though the Algorand Foundation is Singapore-based. According to Levin, it has been a goal for the Algorand Foundation to return to the U.S. in a meaningful way. “Today’s administration has reshaped how America views and supports the blockchain sector—moving from uncertainty to constructive, principle-based engagement. With that shift, the door is finally open,” she said. Levin shared that the exact operational details surrounding the move are still undergoing legal, regulatory, and board review, but the Foundation intends to relocate soon. She explained this is the case as, “No single market matches the United States for depth of capital, concentration of technical talent, or global regulatory influence, so leadership here remains decisive for blockchain’s worldwide trajectory.” Echoing this, Timothy Enneking, CEO of decentralized search engine Presearch, told Cryptonews that Presearch moved its operations to the U.S. in 2023. The company was previously based in Canada, yet Enneking mentioned that “general stability” and availability of risk capital brought the company back to the U.S. Other crypto companies, like OKX, a centralized exchange registered in Seychelles, relaunched their U.S. operations this year. The company established a new headquarters in San Jose, California, following a $500 million settlement with US regulators . Challenges to Consider While it’s clear that the U.S. is becoming a hub for blockchain development, a number of challenges remain. For example, Levin pointed out that establishing a blockchain company in the U.S. requires a deliberate, long-term commitment due to major tax considerations upon entry and potentially larger ones on any future exit. Enneking added that the tax regime in the U.S. has not been favorable. “And its application is terribly extraterritorial,” he commented. From a regulatory perspective, Levin noted that although a lot of progress has been made, there is still a lack of clarity on many important issues. For example, she explained that there is still an unsettled jurisdictional boundary between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additionally, while the GENIUS Act has clarified regulatory oversight for stablecoin issuers , Levin noted that every other segment of the blockchain industry must still work through the vast number of state licensing regimes alongside concurrent federal jurisdiction. Nexo’s spokesperson added that fragmented state licensing has been challenging for the company, as money transmission, lending, and virtual-currency permissions remain on a state-by-state basis. U.S. Market Hot Spot for Blockchain Growth Challenges aside, Levin believes that the U.S. crypto market will continue to offer unparalleled depth and institutional capital. Nexo’s spokesperson also pointed out that building a blockchain company in the U.S. forces standards that help with data security, licensing, and service levels. “These are exportable advantages.” Given this, Levin remarked that blockchain and crypto companies that delay market entry to the U.S. risk being left behind.

Cook argued that the White House lacked the authority to do so and insisted she wanted to keep her position. Cook's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, called the dismissal “unprecedented and illegal.” Cook described Trump's move as an attempt to put political pressure on the independent Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This case is seen as the start of a critical legal process for the future of the Fed, an independent institution. Trump has long criticized the Fed and has taken steps to appoint people who share his monetary policy views. Cook also named the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell as parties in the lawsuit, citing their authority to implement Trump's directives. In a statement about the lawsuit, the Fed stated that it would “comply with the court's decision.” Related News: BREAKING: A Historic Cryptocurrency Decision Is Reportedly Coming Soon in the US - It Could Make A Significant Effect Trump announced his dismissal of Cook in a letter shared on social media three days ago. The president claimed Cook was involved in mortgage fraud and claimed he was exercising the “power of removal” enshrined in the Fed's charter. However, Cook was not charged with or convicted of any crime. Experts have raised serious doubts about the legal basis for Trump's decision. The lack of evidence and the fact that the allegations predate Cook's tenure at the Fed have further fueled the controversy. Furthermore, the fact that Cook was dismissed without a chance to defend himself has been deemed legally problematic. Cook's lawyers filed a 24-page brief arguing that impeachment would “weaken” the safeguards granted under the Federal Reserve Act and that Trump violated Cook's legal rights. The filing argued that the mortgage claims in question did not fall within the law's “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or abuse of office.” At the heart of Trump's allegations is that Cook listed two different addresses as his primary residence, but the lawsuit also provides no clear explanation for this. *This is not investment advice.

According to CoinMarketCap, PYTH briefly peaked above $0.20, gaining more than 70% in a single day before easing slightly to $0.19. The rally lifted its market capitalization above $1 billion, with trading volumes soaring more than 2,700% in 24 hours. Oracles at the Center of Blockchain Integration The Commerce Department’s initiative will see quarterly GDP figures published across nine blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tron, Stellar and Avalanche. Pyth and Chainlink were tapped as key oracle providers, ensuring verified government data is disseminated securely across decentralized networks. Both platforms specialize in bridging offchain financial data such as stock prices, commodities and FX rates into blockchain ecosystems for DeFi applications. Trump Administration’s Pro-Crypto Shift The move reflects the Trump administration’s increasingly proactive stance on blockchain adoption. It comes amid heated debate over the reliability of official government statistics, particularly labor market data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Earlier this month, President Trump accused the BLS of manipulating figures after a major downward jobs revision, subsequently dismissing Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Broader Push for Digital Asset Adoption The blockchain data initiative complements a series of pro-crypto legislative efforts under Trump’s leadership. Recent milestones include passage of the GENIUS Stablecoin Act, House approval of a comprehensive market structure bill, and progress on an anti-CBDC measure.

Amid this, a new altcoin, Remittix, that is priced under $0.10 is drawing serious attention for its real-world utility and rapid execution. A payments-focused project, backed by institutional interest and poised for major milestones, may outshine ADA this cycle. It combines infrastructure, momentum, and a roadmap that traders are rallying around. Cardano (ADA): Steady Foundation, Slower Velocity Heading into September, Cardano (ADA) trades near $0.86 and analysts have raised targets to $1.50 if momentum continues. Recent news shows that whales scooped up 180 million ADA tokens within 48 hours. Some analysts predict that ADA may climb, but not leap, to $5 this cycle. Other forecasts place ADA closer to $1–$1.80 in the near-term, with long-term outlooks pointing to a gradual rise beyond $2. Add to that macro tailwinds like anticipated Fed rate cuts, institutional inflows totaling $73 million, and strong network fundamentals; ADA is solid… just not explosively fast. Remittix (RTX): Utility Meets Velocity Remittix is becoming the alternative that many traders are rooting for; not just hype, but function. Designed to power low-gas, cross-border PayFi transfers for users in 30+ countries, it’s built for real use. A Q3 2025 beta wallet and verified CEX listing already signal execution, not speculation. Key Advantages of Remittix Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Momentum building ahead of wallet launch Security First: Audited by CertiK With over $21.6 million raised, a BitMart listing confirmed, and another coming after $22 million, Remittix stands poised, from product promise to adoption runway–unlike ADA’s slower infrastructure rollout. Solid Foundations vs. Swift Function: Why Remittix Could Overtake ADA in 2025 While the Cardano (ADA) camp awaits firm footing, Remittix is already building pathways for real-world crypto payments. With whales stacking, wallets nearing launch, and listings underway; you’re looking at not just talk, but traction. If you’re exploring the top crypto to buy now, seeking the next big altcoin 2025, or want crypto with real utility, buying RTX could be the smarter move.

Attention is shifting toward a new contender trading under $0.003; Little Pepe (LILPEPE). With its nearly sold-out presale, unique Layer 2 design, and rapid rise in community interest, LILPEPE is drawing comparisons to PEPE’s meteoric rise in 2023. Data trends, security audits, and tokenomics all suggest this project could become the next 20,000% meme coin success story. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin Layer 2 Little Pepe is not just another meme coin riding the hype wave. It’s backing the meme dream with serious tech. The team is rolling out a custom Layer 2 chain just for meme coins. That means dirt-cheap fees, near-instant transactions, and a ready-to-go launchpad for the next wave of meme projects, no hype required. Key innovations include: Sniper bot resistance: LILPEPE will be the only blockchain where sniper bots won’t work, ensuring fairer token launches. Scalability: Designed for high transaction throughput to accommodate meme coin trading surges. Utility token ($LILPEPE): This token powers all activity on the chain, from gas fees to launchpad participation. This positions Little Pepe not just as another meme coin, but as the infrastructure layer for meme culture. Presale Momentum Nears Completion The presale has already reached Stage 12, with tokens selling at $0.0021 and preparing to increase to $0.0022 in the next stage. So far, LILPEPE has raised $22.4 million of its $25.47 million target, with over 14.29 billion tokens sold (90.78% of allocation). With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, and 25 billion allocated to presale, the structure ensures scarcity while supporting ecosystem growth. If LILPEPE were to hit a market cap of $300 million, the token price would rise more than 10x from presale levels — with long-term upside even greater if adoption matches that of top meme tokens. Tokenomics and Security A project’s success often comes down to trust, and Little Pepe has addressed this head-on: CertiK Audit Score : 95.49%, validating its smart contract safety and access controls. Zero taxes, maximizing gains for holders. Community rewards: Over $777,000 allocated for giveaways and engagement. Token distribution highlights include: 26.5% Presale 30% Reserves 20% Liquidity/DEX 13.5% Staking 10% Marketing This balanced model ensures liquidity, long-term growth, and strong community incentives. Community Interest is Surging One of the strongest signals for meme coin success is community traction, and here Little Pepe is clearly outpacing competitors. As shown in the chart, LILPEPE’s question volume trend on ChatGPT has surged past Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and even Pepe (PEPE) between June and August 2025. With relative volume normalized to its own peak, Little Pepe hit 100 while competitors remained in the 35–60 range. This growth in awareness mirrors the early viral stage seen in PEPE’s 2023 run, suggesting that momentum is rapidly building across retail investors and online communities. Can Little Pepe Repeat PEPE’s Success? PEPE’s rise in 2023 showed how quickly a low-cost meme coin can transform portfolios. Early holders saw gains exceeding 20,000%, driven purely by hype and social virality. But unlike PEPE, Little Pepe adds infrastructure, utility, and security — giving it more staying power. Guided by anonymous pros with a solid record in leading meme coins and two major exchange spots already locked in, LILPEPE is set for instant buzz plus lasting growth. Final Thoughts Trading under $0.003, Little Pepe offers a rare entry point before listings and potential mainstream exposure. With nearly $22.4M raised, a strong audit score, fair tokenomics, and accelerating community traction, the stage is set for what could be the next 20,000% meme coin story. If PEPE was the viral breakout of 2023, Little Pepe may be the infrastructure-powered evolution in 2025.

This significant milestone, reported by Walter Bloomberg, highlights the growing importance and adoption of stablecoins within the broader digital asset ecosystem. It’s a clear signal that these digital currencies, pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are becoming an indispensable part of how people interact with crypto, offering a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of digital assets. Why is the Stablecoin Market Cap Reaching New Heights? This impressive surge in the stablecoin market cap isn’t just a random event; it’s driven by several compelling factors that underscore their utility and growing demand. Stablecoins provide a sanctuary during market volatility, allowing traders to lock in gains or avoid losses without fully exiting the crypto space. Moreover, their role in decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to expand, powering lending, borrowing, and yield-generating protocols. Here are some key drivers behind this growth: Market Volatility: When Bitcoin or Ethereum experience price swings, investors often move their funds into stablecoins as a safe haven, preserving value. DeFi Ecosystem: Stablecoins are the lifeblood of decentralized applications, enabling seamless transactions and liquidity provision across various platforms. Global Payments: They offer a faster, cheaper, and more accessible alternative for cross-border transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Institutional Interest: As institutions explore crypto, stablecoins offer a regulated and less volatile entry point, reducing risk exposure. What Does This Surging Stablecoin Market Cap Mean for Crypto? The substantial growth in the stablecoin market cap carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, it indicates increasing liquidity, making it easier for larger trades to occur without causing significant price fluctuations. This enhanced liquidity attracts more institutional players and sophisticated investors, further legitimizing the crypto market. However, this growth also brings its own set of challenges and increased scrutiny: Regulatory Focus: Governments worldwide are paying closer attention to stablecoins, considering them a potential systemic risk if not properly regulated. This could lead to stricter compliance requirements. Centralization Concerns: While some stablecoins aim for decentralization, many prominent ones are centralized, raising questions about transparency and censorship resistance. Audit and Reserves: Ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed by their stated reserves is paramount for maintaining user trust. Regular, transparent audits are crucial. As the market evolves, balancing innovation with robust regulatory frameworks will be key to sustainable growth. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for the Stablecoin Market Cap ? Looking ahead, the trajectory of the stablecoin market cap seems poised for continued expansion, albeit with evolving dynamics. The rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could introduce a new competitive landscape, while ongoing technological advancements promise even more efficient and diverse stablecoin offerings. Innovation in areas like privacy-preserving stablecoins or those backed by baskets of assets could redefine their utility. We can anticipate: Diversification: New types of stablecoins, including algorithmic or commodity-backed, may emerge and gain traction. Integration: Further integration into mainstream financial services, bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Policy Development: Clearer regulatory guidelines are likely to emerge, providing a more stable environment for stablecoin issuers and users alike. This continuous evolution underscores the adaptability and resilience of the digital asset space. In conclusion, the astonishing rise of the stablecoin market cap above $280 billion is more than just a number; it’s a powerful testament to their indispensable role in the evolving financial ecosystem. They offer stability, liquidity, and accessibility, driving innovation in DeFi and facilitating global transactions. While challenges like regulatory scrutiny and centralization concerns remain, the future of stablecoins appears bright, promising continued growth and integration into our financial lives. This milestone truly marks a pivotal moment for digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin?

This rare crossover from real estate to blockchain infrastructure signals Caliber’s intent to position itself as more than just another property investment firm. Caliber Turns to Chainlink for Long-Term Growth and Real Estate Innovation Real estate companies normally hold cash, debt, and physical assets. Caliber wants to change that playbook. It intends to hold LINK for the long term while also generating income by staking the tokens. The board believes the digital coin offers both stability and strong growth potential. This makes it suitable to be considered a digital reserve asset. This decision is poised to help boost the company’s finances and potentially use the token to streamline its operations. Also, Caliber plans to integrate Chainlink’s technology into its operations. This integration is expected to improve core business processes such as asset valuation and fund administration. Furthermore, Caliber plans to use its existing credit line, cash reserves, and equity-based securities to gradually build its LINK holdings. The firm, like SharpLink Gaming , has no plans to sell its tokens. Instead, it wants steady accumulation, staking for yield, and long-term value creation. According to Caliber’s management, this strategy will help the firm stand out from other public real estate companies and attract new investors. Formation of the Caliber Crypto Advisory Board To guide this move, Caliber has established the Caliber Crypto Advisory Board (CCAB), which is made up of digital asset and blockchain experts. The group will align Caliber’s capital with modern treasury practices and guide how it acquires, holds, and manages digital assets. They will also advise on implementing and overseeing the DAT Strategy. This comes as the real estate manager gained approval from the new Digital Asset Treasury Strategy (DAT Strategy) and a detailed Digital Asset Treasury Policy (DAT Policy). These rules provide a framework for how Caliber will handle digital assets. It covers how funds are sourced for acquisition, how tokens are secured, and how decisions are overseen. Caliber Bets on Chainlink as Digital Assets Go Mainstream Chainlink isn’t just another crypto project. It acts as a bridge connecting traditional finance with blockchains. Its technology already supports major institutions such as Mastercard, DTCC, and SWIFT. The leading decentralized oracle network has achieved a major milestone in the past . It is the first platform to earn ISO 27001 certification and SOC 2 Type 1 attestation. By accumulating LINK, Caliber gets exposure to a highly liquid digital asset while betting on the future of decentralized finance. More importantly, it gained a tool that could modernize its real asset operations. Caliber’s move is not in isolation. Many crypto and non-crypto firms are now adding assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB, Solana (SOL), and XRP to their balance sheet. This global growing trend shows digital assets are quickly becoming mainstream in finance .

The cryptocurrency world often moves at a breakneck pace, with new developments constantly shaping its landscape. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant USDC minting event. Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, reported the creation of a staggering 450 million USDC at the USDC Treasury. This massive influx of a leading stablecoin naturally raises questions about its immediate and long-term implications for the market. Understanding the Latest USDC Minting Event When we talk about USDC minting , we are referring to the creation of new USD Coin, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Circle and Coinbase jointly founded Centre Consortium, which oversees USDC. Each USDC token is backed by fully reserved assets, ensuring its value remains stable. The process of minting essentially means issuing new tokens into circulation. For USDC, this happens when users or institutions deposit fiat currency (like USD) with Circle or its partners. In return, an equivalent amount of USDC is minted and sent to their wallets. Whale Alert’s report simply confirms that a substantial amount of new USDC has entered the ecosystem. This action is a direct response to demand, indicating a significant interest in acquiring or utilizing the stablecoin. What Drives Such Massive USDC Minting? Several factors typically contribute to a large-scale USDC minting event. These events are not random; they reflect underlying market dynamics and user behavior. Understanding these drivers helps us interpret the broader market sentiment. Increased Demand for Stablecoins: A primary reason is often a surge in demand for stablecoins. Traders and institutions use stablecoins to hedge against volatility in the crypto market, move funds between exchanges, or participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Institutional Inflow: Large mints frequently signal significant institutional interest. Big players might be onboarding substantial capital into the crypto space, choosing USDC as their entry point due to its regulatory compliance and transparency. DeFi Growth: The expanding DeFi ecosystem relies heavily on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision. More activity in DeFi can directly lead to higher demand for USDC. Arbitrage Opportunities: Sometimes, price discrepancies on various exchanges can create opportunities for arbitrage, where traders might need to mint USDC to capitalize on these differences. This 450 million USDC minting could be a combination of these factors, pointing towards a healthy appetite for stable, dollar-pegged assets within the digital economy. The Broader Implications of This USDC Minting The creation of such a large sum of USDC has several potential implications for the cryptocurrency market. It is not just a number; it represents a significant shift in available liquidity and market sentiment. Enhanced Market Liquidity: More USDC in circulation means increased liquidity across exchanges and DeFi platforms. This can facilitate smoother trading and larger transactions without significant price slippage. Potential for Crypto Purchases: Often, newly minted stablecoins are intended for purchasing other cryptocurrencies. This could indicate an expectation of upward price movement for various digital assets, as investors position themselves to buy. Reinforced Trust in Stablecoins: Large-scale, transparent USDC minting events reinforce trust in the stablecoin model, particularly for USDC, which maintains a strong reputation for backing and audits. Economic Activity Indicator: Such mints can serve as a strong indicator of overall economic activity within the crypto space, suggesting growth in trading, investment, and DeFi engagement. Consequently, this event could inject fresh capital and dynamism into various sectors of the crypto market. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape After This USDC Minting While the latest USDC minting highlights strong demand, it also underscores the evolving stablecoin landscape. USDC continues to be a dominant force, but competition and regulatory discussions are ongoing. For users, understanding the stability and backing of their chosen stablecoin remains paramount. This minting event serves as a reminder of USDC’s role as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset world. As the market matures, the transparency and reliability of stablecoins like USDC will become even more crucial for widespread adoption. The minting of 450 million USDC is more than just a transaction; it is a powerful signal. It reflects a robust demand for stable digital assets and potentially hints at upcoming activity in the broader crypto market. As institutions and individual investors continue to seek reliable on-ramps and off-ramps, USDC maintains its pivotal role in the ever-evolving digital economy. This development underscores the continued growth and increasing sophistication of the stablecoin sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It is backed by fully reserved assets, meaning for every USDC in circulation, there is an equivalent dollar or dollar-equivalent asset held in reserve. Why is 450 million USDC being minted significant? The minting of such a large amount of USDC indicates a substantial increase in demand for stablecoins. It suggests significant capital inflow into the crypto market, potentially for trading, investment, or participation in DeFi protocols. Who is behind USDC? USDC is managed by the Centre Consortium, which was co-founded by Circle and Coinbase. These companies are responsible for the issuance, redemption, and overall oversight of USDC. How does USDC minting affect the crypto market? Increased USDC minting can boost market liquidity, making it easier to trade other cryptocurrencies. It often signals an intention to purchase other digital assets, potentially leading to upward price pressure, and reflects overall healthy activity in the crypto ecosystem. Is USDC a safe stablecoin? USDC is generally considered one of the safer stablecoins due to its transparent backing by audited reserves and its compliance with regulatory standards. However, all cryptocurrencies carry some level of risk. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Buterin stated that he sees a 20% probability of this technology being able to break current encryption methods by 2030. In his statement, Buterin touched on the magnitude of the threat quantum computers pose and its timeline: “Looking at prediction platforms like Metaculous, it’s estimated that quantum computers will be powerful enough to break cryptography between 2030 and 2035. There’s a lot of speculation out there right now; some companies claim to be developing quantum computers, but in reality, they’re quantum adiabatic computers that don’t even come close to breaking cryptography.” Buterin also stated that the Ethereum ecosystem is preparing for the quantum threat: “Justin Drake is working on quantum-resistant signatures. STARKs are already quantum-resistant. Great progress is being made in this area, and I'm optimistic that Ethereum can adapt.” Related News: Surprise Altcoin Announces Agreement with a Country - Unexpected Collaboration Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, while acknowledging the magnitude of the risk, stated that he sees the probability as lower: Vitalik predicts a 20% chance, but that seems lower to me. The crucial point isn't the exact probability. NIST has mandated a transition to post-quantum cryptography between 2030 and 2035. We have the necessary tools, but the key is which standards will be implemented and implemented. This is critical not only for blockchain but also for defense, banking, telecom, and identity systems. Although Guillemet stated that blockchain may face difficulties in the adaptation process due to its decentralized structure, he pointed out the sector's capacity to move quickly: “There is no reason to panic, we just need to work in a focused manner.” *This is not investment advice.

This significant transaction, first reported by Whale Alert, immediately raises questions about its implications for the stablecoin market and broader crypto ecosystem. Such large movements often signal important shifts or strategies within major financial entities. Understanding the Significance of This USDC Transfer When we see a USDC transfer of this magnitude, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying reasons. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning one USDC is always intended to be worth one US dollar. The USDC Treasury is essentially the issuer’s wallet, where new USDC is minted or burned. Coinbase, on the other hand, is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, facilitating trades for millions of users. This particular USDC transfer suggests a few potential scenarios: Increased Liquidity: Coinbase might be preparing for a surge in demand for USDC, requiring more liquidity to facilitate trading, withdrawals, or other platform activities. Institutional Activity: Large institutional investors often use stablecoins for significant capital movements, and Coinbase serves as a primary gateway for such operations. Treasury Rebalancing: The USDC Treasury might be rebalancing its holdings or preparing for a redemption event through Coinbase, which is a key partner in the USDC ecosystem. What Does a Large USDC Transfer Mean for the Market? A USDC transfer of $450 million is not an everyday occurrence. While it doesn’t directly impact the price of volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum in the same way a large buy or sell order would, it can still have indirect effects. For instance, increased USDC on an exchange often indicates a readiness for potential buying pressure, as traders might be converting fiat or other crypto into stablecoins to await opportunities. Conversely, it could also precede large-scale withdrawals, suggesting a move of funds off the exchange. Given Coinbase’s role as a major fiat on/off-ramp, this USDC transfer could represent either an influx of new capital entering the crypto space or a consolidation of funds for various strategic purposes. It highlights the crucial role stablecoins play in providing liquidity and stability within the often-volatile digital asset markets. Navigating the Implications of Major Stablecoin Movements For investors and enthusiasts, monitoring significant transactions like this USDC transfer offers valuable insights. It helps us understand the flow of capital and the operational dynamics of major players in the crypto space. While the exact intent behind this specific transfer remains speculative without official statements, the fact that such a substantial amount of USDC moved suggests a high-level strategic decision. These movements underscore the transparency inherent in blockchain technology. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, allowing services like Whale Alert to track and report them, providing a real-time pulse on the market’s underlying activities. This transparency empowers the community to observe and analyze, fostering a more informed environment. This substantial USDC transfer from the Treasury to Coinbase is a clear indicator of active and strategic movements within the stablecoin sector. Whether preparing for increased demand, facilitating institutional flows, or rebalancing, such a large transaction underlines the critical function of stablecoins as foundational pillars of the cryptocurrency market. Keeping an eye on these significant shifts helps us better comprehend the evolving landscape of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDC? USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. It aims to combine the stability of traditional currencies with the utility of blockchain technology. What is the USDC Treasury? The USDC Treasury refers to the digital wallets controlled by Circle, the issuer of USDC. These wallets manage the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of USDC tokens, ensuring that each USDC is backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars or highly liquid assets. Why would such a large USDC transfer occur? Large USDC transfers can occur for various reasons, including increasing liquidity on an exchange like Coinbase to meet anticipated demand, facilitating large institutional transactions, or as part of the USDC Treasury’s internal rebalancing and operational management. Does a large USDC transfer affect its peg to the US dollar? Generally, a large USDC transfer itself does not directly affect its peg to the US dollar. The peg is maintained by the underlying reserves held by Circle. These transfers are operational movements of existing USDC, not changes in its backing. Who is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. It provides real-time updates on significant movements, often giving early indications of potential market shifts or major participant activities.

In an interview with Fox News Business this week, van Eck said that with the rise of stablecoins, every bank and financial services company now needs infrastructure to process them. Ethereum’s Wall Street Moment van Eck explained that if one person wants to send stablecoins, the recipient’s bank must either handle that transaction directly or rely on another institution to do so. According to van Eck, the real winners in this transition will be the blockchains that provide the foundation for these transactions. He believes Ethereum, or other networks built on its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) methodology, will be central to driving this new financial architecture. “If I want to send you stablecoins, your bank has to figure it out, or you find some other institution to do that. The winner is, who’s going to be building on these blockchains? It’s going to be Ethereum or something that uses Ethereum’s methodology, which is called EVM.” The regulatory landscape for stablecoins has witnessed a tremendous change with the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), which was signed into law on July 18th this year. As the first federal legislation of its kind, the act provides a framework to ensure stablecoins are transparent, fully backed, and safely integrated into the US financial system. Post-Genius The market’s reaction to GENIUS was swift. CryptoQuant recently reported that Binance’s stablecoin reserves surged from $32 billion to $36 billion shortly after the law’s approval. Institutions are also accelerating their push into this sector. Stripe, for one, supports stablecoin payouts in over 100 countries and is developing its own Layer 1 blockchain to control payment rails. Circle, fresh off a successful IPO, is expanding beyond issuance with its Circle Payment Network (CPN) and a proprietary Layer 1 where USDC will be the native asset. Even traditional giants are adapting – Visa recently introduced stablecoin settlement APIs to support round-the-clock global payments. Its rival, Mastercard, teamed up with OKX and Nuvei earlier this year to support global stablecoin payments, letting users spend from wallets and merchants accept USDC.

The latest freeze shows the growing role of industry collaboration in dismantling cross-border criminal networks that exploit cryptocurrencies to launder illicit gains. Cross-Border Operation Seizes $50M in USDT From Crypto Fraud Ring “Pig butchering” scams —so named for the way fraudsters “fatten” their victims with trust before extracting maximum financial losses—have evolved into a global criminal enterprise. Combining elements of investment fraud and human trafficking, these operations lure victims through social media, dating apps, or even wrong-number text messages. Once a relationship is established, scammers pressure people into fake investment schemes, often involving crypto. At the same time, traffickers force laborers, many held captive in compounds, to run the scams themselves. We're honoured to have worked with @okx , @Binance & @Tether_to alongside APAC law enforcement to investigate and freeze $50M in USDT tied to pig butchering scams. Powerful example of how industry collaboration can combat sophisticated financial crime networks.

Between November 2022 and July 2023, victims transferred assets into a web of scam-controlled addresses. Funds were consolidated into a central wallet that moved $46.9 million to intermediary accounts before being dispersed into five final wallets. Source: Chainalysis Investigators also found that scammers sent back small amounts, such as $63,900 worth of USDT from one wallet, to victims, a common tactic to make schemes appear legitimate. After analysis, Tether froze the funds in June 2024 at the request of Asia-Pacific (APAC) authorities. This operation follows a landmark case in November 2023, when Tether and OKX worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to freeze $225 million in USDT linked to international human trafficking and romance scams. In June 2024, a U.S. judge authorized the seizure and burning of those assets , marking the largest recovery in Secret Service history. “Unlike other cryptocurrencies like ether and bitcoin, Tether has the technical ability to freeze known illicit funds,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said. “We are committed to supporting law enforcement worldwide to disrupt pig butchering scams and help provide restitution for victims.” Binance’s Head of Intelligence and Investigations, Erin Fracolli, said the case demonstrates the importance of public-private cooperation. “Our collaboration highlights the essential role of partnerships in subverting criminal operations and working toward compensating victims,” she said, adding that Binance promptly shares intelligence with agencies and other exchanges to strengthen blockchain security. An investigator from OKX noted that pig butchering scams no longer target only Asian victims but now reach users globally. He stressed that victims are often chosen based on vulnerabilities, not intelligence, making awareness and preventative action key. The crackdown also reflects Tether’s wider campaign against illicit finance. In September 2024, the company reported freezing more than 1,850 wallets linked to crimes across 45 jurisdictions , in collaboration with 180 agencies. @Tether_to ’s latest report details its collaboration with over 180 agencies across 45 jurisdictions, with nearly 1,850 wallets frozen. #BlockchainSecurity #Cryptocurrency https://t.co/bMPoRrGDPU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 18, 2024 That operation led to the recovery of $1.86 billion in assets, showing Tether’s expanding enforcement footprint. The company has also assisted in cases tied to sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex and cybercrime groups like North Korea’s Lazarus. However, challenges remain. A May 2025 report by AMLBot pointed out delays in Tether’s blacklisting process due to its two-step multisignature system, which can create windows of up to 44 minutes before funds are fully frozen. Analysts warned that this gap may allow criminals to move millions before restrictions take effect. Pig Butchering Scams Drove $3.6B in Crypto Losses in 2024; DOJ and Global Partners Step Up Crackdown Pig butchering scams have emerged as the single biggest threat to crypto investors, accounting for $3.6 billion in losses in 2024 , according to a report from Web3 security firm Cyvers. The fraud, which involves grooming victims over weeks or months before draining their funds, primarily targeted users on the Ethereum blockchain. Cyvers reported a 40% rise in cyber threats last year, with 165 incidents causing $2.3 billion in damages. Access control breaches were the most common attack vector, responsible for $1.9 billion in losses, while smart contract exploits and address poisoning added another $525 million. Ethereum was hit hardest, with more than 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions linked to pig butchering schemes. The scams, often orchestrated by organized crime groups in Southeast Asia, use unsolicited messages or dating apps to lure victims into fake crypto platforms. Beyond financial losses, investigators say many operations rely on trafficked workers forced to carry out the fraud. Governments and industry players are ramping up their response. In June, the U.S. Department of Justice moved to seize $225.3 million in Tether’s USDT , the largest crypto seizure tied to pig butchering to date. @DOJCrimDiv seizes $225.3M in Tether’s USDT—largest crypto haul tied to pig butchering scam—funds traced via OKX in global fraud network. #CryptoFraud #USDT https://t.co/0q6GUi99SZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 18, 2025 The funds had been laundered through OKX exchange wallets, many held under the names of trafficking victims. Coinbase assisted the U.S. Secret Service in tracing the illicit flows and identifying more than 130 defrauded customers. Meanwhile, India has intensified efforts to curb investment scams by partnering with Google and Facebook to crack down on fraudulent ads and phishing schemes. Private-sector collaboration is also expanding. Binance recently joined T3+ , a global initiative launched by Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs that has frozen more than $250 million in illicit assets since late 2024 . In its first joint case, T3+ partners blocked nearly $6 million tied to a pig butchering operation. Chainalysis data shows law enforcement projects in Canada and the U.S. have since prevented over $70 million in additional fraud. With crypto-related investment scams driving $5.8 billion in losses in 2024 alone, officials say such partnerships are becoming key to safeguarding the sector.

The index rose 0.3% intraday, breaking its previous high. The Nasdaq Composite moved up 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 81 points, or 0.2%, according to data from CNBC. S&P 500 Index 1hr price chart Traders saw Nvidia’s report as confirmation that the AI rally is still alive, even if there were a few weak spots in the numbers. Nvidia, which now makes up around 8% of the S&P 500, posted 56% revenue growth, beating Wall Street’s expectations. But two things caught attention. Its data center revenue came in just shy of forecasts, and the company’s forward guidance of $54 billion for the current quarter was only slightly above the $53.1 billion estimated by analysts at LSEG. The stock slipped before the open but reversed course, trading 0.5% lower by midday. Still, the company made it clear that none of that forward guidance includes revenue from H20 chip sales to China. Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that “they didn’t include China in their guide, and some people were hoping there were some China sales in there, maybe a little firmer stance that China sales could get going.” He added, “The core growth outside of China was really good. There should be more great growth in the fourth quarter, so I think we’re all systems go.” Chipmakers bounce after initial dip Despite the minor pullback, several analysts grew more bullish on Nvidia after the report. Firms like JPMorgan, Citi, and Bernstein raised their price targets, signaling more upside potential. Investors watching the AI trade stayed engaged, with names like Broadcom and Micron Technology both climbing around 3% after slipping early on. The report also revived confidence across the chip sector. Elsewhere, Snowflake (another AI-linked name) jumped roughly 22% after its second-quarter earnings beat forecasts. Its surprise surge added to the tech-driven gains seen across major indexes. The S&P 500 had already posted a winning session on Wednesday, with expectations for a strong Nvidia report lifting the index to record levels. Thursday’s actual earnings only pushed it higher. Meanwhile, political pressure on the Federal Reserve added another layer of uncertainty. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump told Fed Governor Lisa Cook she was fired. On Thursday, Cook responded by filing a lawsuit to challenge the move. A federal judge is expected to hold a hearing on Friday. GDP beats forecast as rate bets return On the economic front, the Commerce Department released its revised second-quarter GDP figure, showing a 3.3% annualized growth rate. That topped both the previous 3.0% estimate and the 3.1% forecast from Dow Jones. The stronger growth gave investors more to work with as they look ahead to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report due Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are predicting a 0.2% monthly increase and a 2.6% year-over-year rise in the July reading. What happens next will likely come down to the Fed. Manish Kabra, lead U.S. equities and multi-asset strategist at Societe Generale, told clients in a note that “we believe the bigger driver for equities will be the Fed and rate-cut outlook.” He also projected that the Fed will cut interest rates by over 100 basis points across the next 12 months. So, between Nvidia’s numbers, Washington’s drama, economic beats, and fresh inflation data on deck, the S&P 500 just bulldozed into uncharted territory. Get seen where it counts.

With growing investor attention and rising engagement across decentralized finance platforms, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a potential catalyst in a market where XRP’s trajectory remains closely tied to major resistance levels. Early investors in the project are set for at least a return of 300% post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surpassed $15.05 million and has over 15720 investors presently. While XRP navigates its technical hurdles, Mutuum Finance could chart its own course toward a faster surge. XRP Price Outlook: Resistance at $3 Holds Key to the Next Move XRP is currently trading at $2.89, hovering under the psychological $3 mark, which remains a pivotal level. Analysts highlight that if XRP can overcome resistance around $3.30–$3.40, there is potential for a swing toward $5 to $8, supported by strong institutional interest and bullish technical patterns. As XRP navigates these key thresholds, emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance are increasingly capturing investor attention alongside traditional altcoin narratives. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at stage 6 of presale, and the token is now priced at $0.035. The next stage will see the price of the token increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Over 15,720 investors have registered for the presale, and the project has so far raised over $15.05 million. Such traction is a reflection of enhanced trust in the project and value proposition within the decentralized finance industry. Developing a Stable and Secure DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance is developing a stablecoin to be pegged on the Ethereum blockchain to the US dollar. The stablecoin is an unfalsifiable, non-algorithmic investment token that avoids volatility tied to algorithmic stablecoins that balloon and de-peg in market hysteria. Rock-solid, Mutuum Finance is trying to provide users with an unmoving anchor of value in DeFi. The Dual-Lending Advantage One of the advantages of Mutuum Finance is that it is a two-lending mechanism under which Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer operations fall within an efficient and dynamic finance mechanism. Peer-to-Contract runs through independent smart contracts, which execute lending activities independently without any human interference. Smart contracts supply real-time streams of the marketplace, which fit to meet supply and demand with greater ease. Peer-to-Peer model also offers room for one-to-one direct contact between borrowers and lenders without the need for an intermediary where players can negotiate on the best terms appropriate to their interests. Future-Proofing Decentralized Finance Both multipurpose and efficient at the same time, the two-channel mechanism facilitates users to switch between man-to-man, bilateral contracts and contract-based lending mechanisms automated. These are the foundations on which a future-proof, scalable enough to be able to keep up with evolving market trends and user needs, a decentralized finance system can be constructed. Open, secure, and transparent, Mutuum Finance is the institutional as well as individual user solution for the future. Mutuum Finance Guarantees Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched an official Bug Bounty Program reward pool of $50,000 USDT. Four severities will be chosen. These include critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 investors will be awarded $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $15 million with 15,720+ investors by presale phase 6. Early participants target at least 300% ROI. Join the presale now to secure tokens, get your share of the $100,000 giveaway, and participate in the CertiK-backed $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. With its dual P2C and P2P lending models and upcoming stablecoin, Mutuum Finance offers a secure, scalable, and high-potential DeFi opportunity.

This licensing places AIXA Miner under the oversight of the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), ensuring the company follows strict financial standards, anti-money laundering (AML) practices, and customer protection regulations. In an industry often criticized for its lack of oversight, this move represents a crucial step forward. It highlights AIXA Miner’s dedication to building an environment where individuals, institutions, and regulators can engage with confidence. The FinCEN license not only affirms legitimacy but also strengthens customer trust by providing legal and regulatory safeguards rarely seen in the mining industry. Opening the Door to Global Accessibility The vision of AIXA Miner is simple yet transformative: make cryptocurrency mining accessible, transparent, and efficient for everyone. Traditional mining requires significant investments in equipment, energy resources, and technical knowledge. In contrast, AIXA Miner’s cloud-based system removes these barriers, giving users worldwide the ability to participate without needing to navigate complicated setups. The platform provides an inclusive entry point for individuals who are curious about digital assets, as well as professional investors and institutions seeking regulated, reliable mining solutions. By combining cutting-edge technology with financial compliance, AIXA Miner ensures its services are future-ready and capable of meeting the needs of both retail and enterprise clients. Industry Impact and Future Outlook AIXA Miner’s announcement comes at a time when the cryptocurrency sector is undergoing rapid transformation, with increasing demand for transparency, sustainability, and compliance. The company’s approach directly addresses these market needs while setting a precedent for other players in the industry. “Mining is the backbone of blockchain, but it has often been inaccessible or misunderstood by the wider public,” said a spokesperson for AIXA Miner. “Our mission is to simplify the process, provide professional oversight, and ensure compliance so that anyone—from individuals to institutions—can confidently participate in the digital economy.” Looking ahead, AIXA Miner plans to expand its distributed infrastructure, strengthen partnerships in key global markets, and continue evolving its framework to support emerging blockchain applications. The company remains committed to driving innovation while maintaining its focus on security, compliance, and customer success.

50829833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=811589,1756411210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50829833.jpeg,Calm Before The Surge? Bitcoin Price Stability Signals Sustainable Rally Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-calm-before-a-surge/,"Bitcoin is entering a phase of unusual calm, with price volatility dropping to some of its lowest levels in years. For many analysts, this reduced volatility is not a sign of weakness; rather, it’s a sign of strength. If this trend continues, the groundwork could be laid for a sustainable bull run fueled by Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a long-term store of value. Can Reduced Volatility Redefine Bitcoin’s Market Identity? Bitcoin is entering a new phase in its market evolution. As highlighted by CryptoRank_io on X, the world’s leading cryptocurrency has seen its volatility steadily decline in tandem with the growth of its market capitalization. This trend suggests that Bitcoin is maturing from a speculative, high-risk asset into a more stable, long-term investment vehicle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakdown in Motion – Bounce Trap Or Deeper Bear Market Warning? Such a shift toward stability could significantly impact how Bitcoin evolves in the years ahead, rather than the explosive, parabolic rallies and brutal corrections that have historically defined BTC’s price action. The lower volatility suggests that the next phase of growth may come in the form of steadier and more sustainable increases with shallower pullbacks. This is a crucial development for institutional investors and major funds. Traditional finance prefers assets with predictable risk profiles, and Bitcoin’s reduced volatility makes it far more attractive for large-scale allocation. BTC’s market structure signals bearish sentiment despite rising open interest. According to Luca, the Bitcoin market is showing signs of tension. Since BTC topped out in mid-August, a clear divergence has emerged between Open Interest and Funding Rates. While Open Interest has been steadily climbing, indicating that more positions are being opened, Funding Rates have been trending lower. This setup suggests that bears are doubling down and loading up on short positions in anticipation of further downside. Traders seem to be betting that the latest move lower is just the beginning, especially as BTC heads into September, which is a historically weak month for Bitcoin. Luca noted that this aligns with his previous observations, suggesting that the market may continue to favor bearish positioning in the near term. Sideways Movement Highlights Bitcoin Stability Daan Crypto Trades also revealed that Bitcoin has largely been consolidating over the past few months, showing sideways price action compared to the Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500). BTC is only up around 10% vs the 2021 all-time high in relation to stocks in 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin 10% Off Its Highs—But Hidden On-Chain Data Tells a Different Story The trend highlights that the cryptocurrency has yet to replicate the dramatic gains seen in previous cycles.

The partnership adds to Ripple’s momentum in Asia as Linklogis, a well-known fintech powerhouse, has announced it will move its trillion-dollar supply chain finance platform to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Linklogis Moves Trillion-Dollar Finance Platform To XRPL WhaleWire, a popular crypto monitoring account, announced on X that Linklogis has selected the XRP Ledger to support its extensive supply chain finance ecosystem. The company operates a trillion-dollar platform and is now moving these operations onto XRPL. WhaleWire states that XRPL powering real-world assets, global payments, and trade finance is a victory for XRP . The scale of Linklogis’ operations is already massive. In 2024, the platform processed RMB 20.7 billion, equivalent to approximately $2.9 billion, in cross-border assets across 27 countries. Handling flows at this size requires a strong solution, and Linklogis chose XRPL to meet the demand for high throughput and instant settlement. Through this move, Linklogis will be able to place invoices and receivables directly on the blockchain by turning them into digital tokens. The tokenization process will enable businesses that work with Linklogis to trade and settle these financial documents more quickly and with reduced risk. With each move tracked and protected on the blockchain , the collaboration with XRPL could add reliability to trade assets. Both Ripple and Linklogis will now work together to roll out the Linklogis global digital supply chain finance application on XRPL’s mainnet. As part of the plan, Linklogis will fully integrate its global platform into XRPL, allowing digital assets tied to real trade flows to be issued and settled on-chain. After taking this first step, Ripple and Linklogis also plan to explore new ways of collaborating. These new areas could expand XRPL’s technical capabilities in enterprise-grade financial systems , including stablecoins, smart contracts for trading supply chain assets, and the use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with blockchain in trade finance. Ripple Expanding Deeper Into Asia’s Financial Infrastructure This development with Linklogis is part of Ripple’s rapid expansion in Asia. In South Korea, a custody provider called BDACS has launched institutional-grade XRP storage , which supports major cryptocurrency exchanges in compliance with local regulations. In Japan, SBI Holdings is preparing to list Ripple’s XRP stablecoin , while also exploring the launch of yen-backed digital tokens. Ripple is also backing innovation through the Web3 Salon , where it provides grants of up to $200,000 for projects built on the XRP Ledger. With Linklogis now integrating XRPL into one of China’s largest fintech ecosystems, Ripple’s technology could gain a deeper foothold in Asia’s financial landscape. Although China bans domestic cryptocurrency activities , Linklogis can still apply blockchain technology to its global supply chain business, using XRPL for international needs.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPL news|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ASIA|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 20:00:35

Price Will be $37 or $180,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-repeating-the-very-same-pattern-price-will-be-37-or-180/,"Crypto analyst CryptoBull shared a chart suggesting that XRP is currently repeating a similar price pattern observed in its previous market cycle. The chart, labeled “XRP/USD 1-Week,” highlights phases of resistance, retracement, and sharp upward movements that have historically led to substantial price increases. According to the analysis, XRP’s earlier cycle demonstrated a surge of approximately 5,000% following a prolonged consolidation and resistance phase. The current chart shows XRP trading near a new resistance level, which, if broken, could potentially replicate that earlier upward trend. CryptoBull’s projection indicates two possible outcomes for XRP’s price trajectory. The first target is $37, while the second, more ambitious projection points to $180. Both targets are presented as possible scenarios if the chart pattern continues to follow the same structure seen in the past. The chart emphasizes the parallels between the historical breakout and the current setup, framing the potential future move as consistent with XRP’s cyclical behavior. #XRP is repeating the very same pattern as in the previous cycle. JUST LOOK! Price will be $37 or $180. Pick one. pic.twitter.com/hqUq4kqzqd — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 27, 2025 XRP Community’s Reactions The tweet attracted reactions from other users who weighed in on the analysis. An X user, X Finance Bull, commented that the chart “looks aligned, but still early,” suggesting caution until further confirmation that the market is truly repeating its past structure. Another user, For_The_Crown, expressed optimism, stating that either price target would be favorable, with a preference for the higher target of $180 but also noting that $37 would still be a significant outcome. These comments indicate varying levels of optimism and caution. Some users acknowledge the alignment of historical patterns, while others prefer to wait for more decisive confirmation before drawing strong conclusions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Projection CryptoBull’s analysis underscores the ongoing interest in historical market patterns as a way to anticipate potential outcomes for XRP. The emphasis on repeating cycles is not uncommon in technical analysis, where past performance is often studied to assess possible future moves. The suggested targets of $37 and $180 highlight the magnitude of gains if XRP follows a similar trajectory to its earlier breakout, though the actual realization of these projections remains uncertain. The idea of repeated market behavior is the foundation of this outlook, supported by visual comparisons of past and present price action. Reactions from the community reflect both optimism and caution, with some acknowledging the alignment while others await confirmation. The projections remain speculative, but they reinforce the focus on cyclical analysis in evaluating XRP’s long-term potential.

The wave of capital shows accelerating institutional demand for Ether, with Wall Street funds increasingly positioning around the second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH ETFs Catch Up to BTC, But Bitcoin Still Leads at $144B AUM According to data from SoSoValue , U.S.-listed Ethereum spot ETFs now hold $30.17 billion in net assets, equal to 5.4% of Ether’s total market capitalization. Daily inflows on Tuesday were led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which pulled in $262.6 million, while Fidelity’s FETH attracted $20.5 million. In a sign of shifting sentiment, Grayscale’s flagship ETHE product, which has suffered heavy redemptions since launch, managed to record a rare positive day with $5.7 million in inflows. Source: Lark Davis The latest surge caps an extraordinary two-week turnaround for Ethereum ETFs. On August 19, the group suffered its worst trading session to date, with a $429 million net outflow, driven largely by redemptions from Fidelity and Grayscale. But flows rebounded sharply. On August 21, BlackRock alone attracted $233.6 million, while Fidelity added $28.5 million, pushing total net inflows to nearly $288 million. The recovery gathered momentum, with August 22 bringing $337.7 million in new capital, followed by $443.9 million on August 25 and a record $455 million on August 26 . Cumulatively, Ethereum ETFs have now absorbed $13.6 billion since launch, with nearly one-third of that total arriving in just the past few weeks. Trading activity has been robust, with $2.23 billion in daily turnover across Ether ETF products. Source: SoSoValue BlackRock remains the dominant player by far, with its ETHA fund controlling $17.19 billion in net assets, more than half of the market. Fidelity’s FETH, at $3.68 billion, and Bitwise’s ETHV, at $3.23 billion, round out the sector’s second tier, while Franklin’s EZET holds under $1 billion. While Ether products are expanding rapidly, Bitcoin ETFs continue to hold a much larger share of the market. As of August 27, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $81.2 million in daily net inflows, far below Ethereum’s $307 million haul. Collectively, Bitcoin funds now manage $144.6 billion in assets, around 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Trading volumes reached $2.8 billion on the day, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the pack with $50.9 million in fresh inflows and $514 million in daily trading. BlackRock Rules Both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, But ETH Gains Edge BlackRock also dominates the Bitcoin side of the market, with IBIT accounting for $83.5 billion of the sector’s assets, or nearly 60% of the total. Fidelity’s FBTC is the second-largest, with $22.4 billion in assets and $14.6 million in daily inflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC has seen a cumulative $23.9 billion in redemptions despite still holding $20 billion. Secondary players, including Ark 21Shares and Bitwise, continue to contribute steady but smaller flows. The divergence in flows shows a decisive shift in momentum toward Ether funds. In just the past five trading days, Ethereum products have attracted $1.8 billion in net inflows, compared with Bitcoin’s more modest gains. The trend suggests investors are increasingly comfortable diversifying beyond Bitcoin into Ethereum, particularly through low-cost ETFs led by BlackRock and Fidelity. The flows also reflect an ongoing migration away from legacy Grayscale trusts, which remain hampered by higher fees and sustained redemptions. Since launch, Grayscale’s ETHE has seen $4.49 billion in net outflows, while GBTC has bled nearly $24 billion, showing investor preference for newer spot-based structures. Analysts See Trillions Flowing Into Crypto as Advisers Expand ETF Exposure Investment advisers are emerging as the largest identifiable holders of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to new data from Bloomberg Intelligence. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X that advisers invested over $1.3 billion in Ether ETFs during Q2, representing 539,000 ETH, a 68% increase from the previous quarter. A similar trend was seen in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, where advisers now hold $17 billion across 161,000 BTC. Their exposure is nearly double that of hedge funds. Yesterday, we published our note on the top holders of Ethereum ETFs. Advisors are dominating the known holders and have pulled away from Hedge Funds. pic.twitter.com/qvP6ZGN3VI — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 27, 2025 Seyffart noted that the figures are based on 13F filings with the SEC, which only reflect about 25% of Bitcoin ETF holders. The rest, largely retail investors, are not captured. Still, analysts suggest that financial advisers could play an outsized role once regulatory clarity arrives. Fox Business has previously projected that trillions in assets could enter crypto markets through adviser allocations. Institutional interest comes as whales shift strategies. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham reported that nine large wallets purchased $456.8 million worth of Ether this week , with several transactions routed through BitGo and Galaxy Digital. Lookonchain also tracked another $164 million in ETH bought by newly created wallets via FalconX and Galaxy. The activity follows diverging price trends. Ether has gained 18.5% in the past month, while Bitcoin has slipped 6.4%. Some long-term Bitcoin holders are rotating into ETH, including one 2013-era wallet that moved $83 million to Binance. Analysts say such flows signal a growing preference for Ether, particularly during Bitcoin corrections.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at approximately $111,952.17 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden shift has naturally sparked conversations among traders and investors alike, prompting a closer look at the factors behind this movement and what it could mean for the broader crypto landscape. Many are now wondering if this dip is a temporary setback or a sign of deeper market shifts. What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the catalysts behind any significant market movement is crucial for investors. While no single factor often dictates the entire market, several elements typically contribute to a notable Bitcoin price drop . Market analysts are currently pointing to a combination of technical indicators, broader economic sentiments, and potentially large-scale trading activities. Technical Resistance: BTC encountered strong selling pressure at higher price levels, leading to a retest of support zones. Macroeconomic Concerns: Global economic uncertainties, such as inflation fears or interest rate hike speculations, can push investors towards less volatile assets, impacting riskier investments like crypto. Whale Movements: Large holders (whales) moving significant amounts of BTC can create selling pressure, influencing market sentiment and price action. Profit-Taking: After periods of strong upward movement, some investors opt to secure profits, contributing to a temporary Bitcoin price drop . Understanding the Immediate Impact on BTC The immediate aftermath of a Bitcoin price drop is often characterized by heightened volatility. For traders, this means increased opportunities for short-term gains or losses. For long-term holders, it can be a test of conviction. Currently, BTC’s position below $112,000 suggests a re-evaluation of its immediate support levels. This level acts as a psychological and technical benchmark for many market participants. Short-term Traders: They closely monitor order books and technical charts for entry and exit points, often capitalizing on rapid price swings. Long-term Holders (HODLers): Many view such dips as buying opportunities, accumulating more BTC at a lower price, confident in its long-term value proposition. Market Sentiment: News of a Bitcoin price drop can trigger fear among new investors, but experienced participants often see it as part of the market cycle. Navigating Volatility: Smart Strategies for Investors Given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, especially during a Bitcoin price drop , adopting a strategic approach is vital. Investors can employ several tactics to mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on market movements. It’s not just about reacting to the news, but having a plan. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the assets you invest in and the broader market conditions. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect capital. Diversification: Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can reduce overall portfolio risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price, to average out your purchase price over time. This strategy can be particularly effective during a Bitcoin price drop . Stay Informed: Follow reliable market monitoring sources like Bitcoin World for timely updates and analysis. What Lies Ahead for the Bitcoin Price? While the recent Bitcoin price drop below $112,000 might seem concerning, the cryptocurrency market is known for its resilience and dynamic nature. Predicting exact future movements is challenging, but analysts often look at historical data and current market indicators to form projections. Many anticipate that if this level doesn’t hold as strong support, further retests of lower levels could occur. Conversely, a quick rebound could signal renewed bullish sentiment. Long-term fundamentals for Bitcoin, such as its scarcity, increasing institutional adoption, and growing utility, remain strong. Therefore, while short-term fluctuations, including any significant Bitcoin price drop , are part of the journey, the broader outlook for Bitcoin often remains optimistic among proponents. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $112,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While short-term volatility is inevitable, understanding the underlying factors and adopting a well-informed, strategic approach can help investors navigate these challenging periods.

For many in the cryptocurrency space, the idea of data ownership and control is paramount, echoing the very principles of digital autonomy. Now, Anthropic, a leading AI developer, is putting its Claude users at a crossroads, demanding a crucial decision that resonates with these core values: opt out or allow your conversations to fuel AI training. Anthropic Data Policy: What’s Changing for Claude Users? Anthropic has announced significant revisions to its user data handling, requiring all Claude users to make a choice by September 28. This decision will determine whether their conversations will be used to train Anthropic’s advanced AI models. This marks a substantial shift from previous practices, where consumer chat data was not utilized for model training. Here’s a breakdown of the key changes: New Default: Previously, Anthropic did not use consumer chat data for model training. Now, the company intends to train its AI systems on user conversations and coding sessions. Extended Retention: For users who do not opt out, data retention will be extended to five years. Prior to this update, prompts and conversation outputs for consumer products were generally deleted from Anthropic’s back end within 30 days, unless legally required otherwise or flagged for policy violations, in which case they might be retained for up to two years. Affected Users: These new policies apply to all Anthropic consumer product users, including Claude Free, Pro, and Max subscribers, as well as those using Claude Code. Unaffected Users: Business customers, such as those using Claude Gov, Claude for Work, Claude for Education, or API access, will not be impacted by these changes. This mirrors a similar approach taken by OpenAI, which also protects its enterprise customers from certain data training policies. This is a massive update, fundamentally altering the privacy landscape for millions of Claude users. Why is AI Data Training So Crucial for Anthropic? Anthropic frames these changes around user choice and mutual benefit. The company suggests that by not opting out, users will “help us improve model safety, making our systems for detecting harmful content more accurate and less likely to flag harmless conversations.” Furthermore, users will “also help future Claude models improve at skills like coding, analysis, and reasoning, ultimately leading to better models for all users.” In essence, the message is: help us help you. However, the underlying motivations are likely more strategic than purely altruistic. Like every other large language model company, Anthropic requires vast amounts of high-quality data to refine and advance its AI. Accessing millions of real-world Claude interactions provides the precise kind of conversational content necessary for robust AI data training . This direct access to user conversations can significantly enhance Anthropic’s competitive standing against major rivals such as OpenAI and Google, who are also in a fierce race to develop the most capable AI models. Effective AI model development relies heavily on diverse and extensive datasets, making user interactions an invaluable resource for improvement and innovation. Navigating Claude AI Privacy: Your Opt-Out Decision The urgency of this decision for Claude AI privacy cannot be overstated. Users must actively choose to opt out by September 28 if they wish to prevent their data from being used for AI training. New users joining Claude will be prompted to make this preference during their signup process. However, existing users face a different scenario. Upon logging in, existing users are presented with a pop-up titled “Updates to Consumer Terms and Policies.” This pop-up features a prominent black “Accept” button. Below this button, in much smaller print, is a toggle switch for training permissions, which is automatically set to “On.” This design raises significant concerns that users might quickly click “Accept” without fully realizing they are consenting to data sharing for AI training. The user interface, as observed by The Verge, appears designed in a way that could easily lead to inadvertent consent. The stakes for user awareness are exceptionally high. Privacy experts have consistently warned that the complexity inherent in AI systems often makes achieving meaningful user data consent incredibly difficult. The way these policy changes are presented can significantly impact whether users genuinely understand the implications of their choices. User Data Consent: Industry Trends and Challenges Beyond the competitive pressures of AI development, Anthropic’s policy changes also reflect broader industry shifts and increasing scrutiny over data retention practices. Companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are under the microscope regarding how they manage and utilize user data. For instance, OpenAI is currently engaged in a legal battle, fighting a court order that demands the company retain all consumer ChatGPT conversations indefinitely, including deleted chats. This order stems from a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other publishers. In June, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap criticized this as “a sweeping and unnecessary demand” that “fundamentally conflicts with the privacy commitments we have made to our users.” This court order impacts ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, though enterprise customers and those with Zero Data Retention agreements remain protected. The alarming aspect across the industry is the significant confusion these constantly changing usage policies create for users, many of whom remain unaware of the shifts. While technology evolves rapidly, leading to inevitable policy adjustments, many of these changes are sweeping and often mentioned only briefly amid other company news. For example, Anthropic’s recent policy update was not prominently featured on its press page, suggesting a downplaying of its significance. This lack of transparency, coupled with confusing UI designs, often means users are agreeing to new guidelines without full comprehension. Under the Biden Administration, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) previously issued warnings that AI companies risk enforcement action if they engage in “surreptitiously changing its terms of service or privacy policy, or burying a disclosure behind hyperlinks, in legalese, or in fine print.” Whether the commission, currently operating with a reduced number of commissioners, continues to actively monitor these practices remains an open question, which has been posed directly to the FTC. The Future of AI Model Development and User Trust The ongoing debate surrounding Anthropic data policy and similar moves by other AI giants highlights a critical tension: the desire for rapid AI model development versus the imperative to protect user privacy. High-quality data is undeniably essential for creating more capable, safer, and less biased AI systems. However, the methods used to acquire and manage this data must align with ethical standards and respect user autonomy. For users, the takeaway is clear: vigilance is paramount. Actively reviewing privacy policies, understanding opt-out options, and questioning default settings are crucial steps in maintaining control over personal data in the age of AI. For AI companies, fostering trust will depend on greater transparency, clearer communication of policy changes, and user-friendly interfaces that genuinely facilitate informed consent rather than subtly nudging users towards data sharing. The future of AI hinges not just on technological advancements but also on building a foundation of trust with its users. Without clear, explicit user data consent and robust privacy safeguards, the public’s willingness to engage with and adopt AI technologies could be significantly undermined. Summary Anthropic’s new data policy represents a pivotal moment for Claude users, demanding a clear choice regarding their data’s use in AI training. While Anthropic cites benefits for model improvement and safety, the move underscores the intense need for high-quality data in the competitive AI landscape. Concerns persist regarding the clarity of policy changes, the design of consent mechanisms, and the broader industry trend of shifting privacy standards. As AI continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and user privacy will remain a critical challenge, requiring both user vigilance and corporate responsibility to navigate effectively.

For the first time ever, developers and institutions can get secured and verified U.S. government information directly across different blockchain networks. This is a big step in connecting public data with digital markets. Turning Government Data Into Real-Time Blockchain Access For years, government economic data was shared only through reports, charts, and press updates. While useful, these formats were slow and sometimes hard to use in real time. Now, with Chainlink’s oracle technology, the U.S. government can share this data directly onchain. This creates a fast and secure link between official numbers and the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With this system, anyone can access real GDP levels, growth rates, consumer prices, and spending data right away on trusted blockchain networks. The data cannot be changed once published, removing delays and reducing risks of tampering. U.S. Government Data Indicator Available Across Multiple Blockchains At launch, Chainlink is delivering six key U.S. economic indicators onchain. This includes the real GDP, the PCE Price Index, and real final sales to private domestic purchasers. These metrics are updated quarterly or monthly, depending on the measure. They already live across ten major blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum , Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism. Over time, more types of data can be added, giving developers and institutions even more to work with. This is possible because Chainlink is already the industry-standard oracle platform . It has connected with more than 2,400 projects and secured tens of billions of dollars in decentralized finance. Its network is trusted by major banks, payment systems, and asset managers, including Swift, Euroclear, and Fidelity International. Chainlink Deepens Ties With U.S. Government and Regulators This latest collaboration with the Department of Commerce builds on a steady series of engagements with U.S. regulators and policymakers. Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov has held discussions with the SEC and members of Congress on how blockchain infrastructure can comply with existing regulations while unlocking new growth for the economy. The White House recently called Chainlink an important part of the infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenized assets. This role became even clearer with the signing of the GENIUS Act, a new federal law that sets rules for stablecoins. When President Donald Trump signed the law, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov stood with government leaders. This shows a new level of cooperation between the blockchain industry and public institutions.

The moment occurred at the Stand With Crypto event in Michigan for its digital asset community, where Big Sean delivered an energetic show. However, a call from Big Sean himself to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple captured even more attention among attendees. A Clear Message From American Rap Star Big Sean The video, now making rounds on X , TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, shows Big Sean addressing the crowd in direct terms. “It’s not too late. Invest in crypto right now. Tonight, if you can. Do that tonight; you’re going to get a return from it. Bitcoin is a good one, Ethereum, Ripple. Invest in that shit, I’m telling y’all right now. This is a free flip. Do it tonight; it’s about to go up,” he said. His words drew loud reactions from the audience, many of whom cheered as he listed the leading cryptocurrencies. The event was mostly filled with crypto investors, and attendees explored an NFT gallery and enjoyed the crypto carnival. Ripple’s mention on stage stood out because XRP has long been tied to financial institutions, central banks, and cross-border payment systems rather than hype and music culture. Hearing its name echoed from a Detroit stage by a mainstream artist shows just how much the XRP price has grown in recent months. Many XRP proponents can argue that the cryptocurrency now belongs in the same conversation as Bitcoin and Ethereum, particularly after its rise in recent months to secure the position of the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization What may have started as a normal statement from Big Sean quickly grew into one of the most shared moments from the entire event. This shows the type of influence celebrity endorsements have on crypto adoption. Trend Of Celebrity Crypto Advocacy Celebrity entertainers and athletes have steadily ventured into the world of cryptocurrency over the past decade. Notably, the movement reached its peak during the 2021 bull run when countless celebrities aligned themselves with cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Although the wave of crypto projects endorsed by celebrities has slowed down in the current market cycle, high-profile endorsements are still influential. Particularly, the launch of Donald and Melania Trump meme coins provides the best examples of how far digital assets have reached. Another notable example is Elon Musk , who is known for his comments on social media endorsing multiple cryptocurrencies. Adding to this mix is Kanye West, who recently entered the sector by launching his own official meme coin called YZY. This has seen a mix of reactions from crypto investors, with some critics calling it another celebrity-backed gimmick . At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.",XRP|Big Sean|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|Ethereum|instagram|Kanye West|Melania Trump|meme coin|nfts|ripple|tiktok|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Youtube|YZY,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|ETH|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-28 21:00:30

The meme coin recorded one of its most significant surges in transaction volume in months, indicating a possible sign of the market bottoming as large holders seemingly prepare for the next leg. Shiba Inu Sees Explosive On-Chain Growth Shiba Inu’s on-chain activity has erupted in recent days, with token transfer volumes recording a major increase. According to Etherscan’s data, on August 25, SHIB’s transfer volume surged over 4.25 trillion tokens, representing a 300% increase from the 1.13 trillion recorded the previous day. This sudden rise highlights renewed liquidity flows and investor participation, possibly signaling that Shiba Inu may be gearing up for a market bottom. Related Reading: Shiba Inu 699,000% Imbalance: What Happened To Trigger It? Interestingly, despite the dramatic surge in volume, transaction counts did not follow the same upward trend. Data shows that while August 24 saw 5,478 transfers, the number slightly declined to 5,355 on August 25, marking a drop of 123 transactions. This disparity suggests that the spike in Shiba Inu’s on-chain volume was not driven by a higher number of transfers, but rather by larger transaction sizes, indicating renewed whale activity or significant reallocations within the ecosystem. As of August 27, SHIB’s transfer volume slightly cooled to 3.26 trillion tokens, with transaction counts dropping significantly to 4,811. Despite this reduction, the metric still reflects a strong level of on-chain engagement compared to prior weeks. With the Shiba Inu price currently consolidating around the $0.000012 range, the recent surge in transfer volume may suggest that the market is finding its floor before the next expansion phase. Analyst Says SHIB’s Consolidation May Be Ending A new chart analysis by crypto market expert Kamran Asghar has added a fresh layer of optimism for Shiba Inu holders. Sharing his insights on X social media, Asghar hinted at the possibility that SHIB’s long-term consolidation may be coming to an end. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Head And Shoulders Pattern Signals 540% Upshoot To New All-Time Highs The analyst noted that Shiba Inu’s accumulation pattern is strikingly similar to those of previous consolidation phases that preceded massive price rallies. The accompanying chart shows three distinct accumulation zones in the meme coin’s history. The first occurred before its 1,154.2% rally in late 2021, while the second phase led to a 501.23% surge in early 2024. Now, Shiba Inu is trading within an extended accumulation zone again, and Asghar suggests this could be the setup for another explosive move. If the current pattern holds, the analyst predicts that the next breakout could see the meme coin’s price skyrocket toward $0.00009, marking a new all-time high. As of writing, Shibua Inu is trading at $0.0000126, meaning a rally to this projected target would represent a significant increase of approximately 614%.

In his post, Gordon stated, “XRP fractal looking strong. The pump will shock many.” His statement was accompanied by a chart showing XRP’s price movements, where it recently surged above $4.30, demonstrating a significant upward trend. According to Gordon, the pattern suggests that XRP may be preparing for another strong rally if the fractal continues to develop. $XRP fractal looking strong. The pump will shock many. pic.twitter.com/RVY6DOcxR1 — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) August 28, 2025 Community Response to the Chart Following Gordon’s post, community members added their own perspectives on the situation. A user under the name DREGEN commented that although he does not hold XRP, the chart gave him a strong sense of fear of missing out. He expressed concern that if XRP experiences a sharp upward move, it would be difficult for those without a position to endure the situation, describing the scenario as a form of psychological pressure on investors who remain on the sidelines. Another response came from Nguyen Volt, who highlighted the enthusiasm of XRP supporters. He remarked that the XRP community, often referred to as the XRP army, is anticipating a breakout. He further stated that if the fractal outlined by Gordon proves accurate, the optimism surrounding the token would be extremely high, even using the term “nuclear” to describe the potential sentiment boost among holders. Significance of the Chart Projection The chart shared in Gordon’s tweet shows XRP trading on Binance against the U.S. dollar on a daily timeframe. The price action reveals a sustained upward move that recently pushed XRP above the $4.30 level. The structure illustrated by Gordon suggests that XRP may be repeating a previous pattern, which some traders interpret as a signal of further gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Fractals in trading are often used to identify repeating price behaviors and are closely followed by technical analysts. If the fractal in question plays out as Gordon suggests, XRP could maintain its momentum and attract greater attention from both retail traders and larger market participants. The reactions to Gordon’s chart underline how price movements in XRP continue to capture the interest of the wider crypto market. The remarks from traders such as DREGEN and Nguyen Volt highlight both the psychological and community-driven elements surrounding XRP’s performance. The combination of technical analysis and market sentiment is a dynamic often seen during periods of strong volatility. While Gordon remains confident that XRP’s fractal is strong and anticipates a movement that will surprise many, community members are already positioning their outlooks around whether or not the projection will hold.

Is There Danger on the Horizon?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/latest-status-report-for-ripple-xrp-released-is-the-network-healthy-is-there-danger-on-the-horizon/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm Messari has shared important developments regarding the Ripple (XRP) network in its latest report titled “The State of the XRP Ledger in Q2 2025.” In July, the SEC announced listing standards for crypto ETFs, requiring them to be tracked with futures of at least six months before listing. XRP began trading on Coinbase's Derivatives Exchange in April, paving the way for US approval of an XRP spot ETF and its listing in the fall. Ripple's US dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, closed the second quarter with a market capitalization of $65.9 million (+49.4% QoQ), becoming the largest stablecoin on XRPL. Several stablecoins were launched on XRPL during the quarter, including Circle's USDC, Braza Group's USDB, Schuman Financial's EURØP, and StratsX's XSGD. Related News: JPMorgan Claims Bitcoin Price Is “‘Too Low’,” Shares Its Own Year-End Price Target XRPL closed the second quarter with an all-time high of $131.6 million in RWA (real-world assets) market capitalization. Several new RWAs, announced at the XRPL Apex event in Singapore in June, were issued during this period. These include Ondo's OUSG tokenized treasury fund, Guggenheim's Digital Commercial Paper, and tokenized real estate issued by Ctrl Alt. On June 30th, the XRPL EVM Sidechain went live, providing the ecosystem with access to EVM developers and functionality. Rippled V2.5.0, released in June, also introduced innovations such as Permissioned DEX (permissioned exchange) and TokenEscrow. Permissioned DEX allows only accounts with valid credentials to create or fill orders within a specific area, while TokenEscrow offers escrow support for Trustline-based tokens (IOUs) and Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs). According to the report, the average daily total transaction count decreased by 20% quarter-over-quarter to 1.6 million in the second quarter. This metric covers 57 different transaction types, including payments, escrow creation, NFT burning, and account deletions. *This is not investment advice.

While SOL continues to draw attention with its potential gains, investors are also eyeing tokens that solve real-world problems. Remittix stands out by offering faster, cheaper cross-border payments, making it one of the best crypto to buy now for those looking beyond hype and towards utility-driven growth. Solana Price Prediction Holds Steady Amid Market Uncertainty Solana has been testing the $200 ceiling for weeks, with the SOL Price currently hovering around $184, up 3.55% in the past 24 hours. Despite these gains, Solana Price remains down 6.7% over the last week, reflecting market hesitation at these levels. Monthly metrics show a 6.27% decline, suggesting traders are weighing Solana’s potential versus its past highs near $294. On-chain activity shows a mixed picture. Network fees dropped 17% while transaction volume fell 10% last week. Compared to Ethereum and BNB Chain, Solana News indicates slower adoption in some sectors, yet inflows exceeded $1 billion over the past 30 days, accounting for 42% of cross-chain bridging activity. Futures data indicates cautious positioning among whales, while derivatives and Binance top-trader ratios suggest balanced sentiment. Technical charts provide some optimism. Weekly ascending triangles show Solana Price Prediction targets between $320 and $350 if the $260 resistance is breached. Short-term four-hour wedges suggest reversals are possible near $188-$190. Institutional moves, including a $1 billion Solana-focused treasury led by Galaxy Digital and Multicoin Capital, signal longer-term interest. Pending SEC decisions on Solana ETFs could act as another catalyst for price swings. Solana’s trajectory will influence upcoming altcoins like Remittix, as capital and attention shift toward high-potential networks. BitMart Listing Expands Remittix Access To Global Investors As Solana eyes a potential $1,000 valuation in 2026, Remittix is quietly emerging as one of the most practical altcoins to watch. The project has already raised $21.6 million in presale funding, selling over 623 million tokens at $0.0987 each. Remittix focuses on solving real-world payment problems, offering faster and cheaper cross-border money transfers for individuals and businesses. The upcoming Remittix Wallet beta, launching on September 15th, 2025, will allow select community members early access, marking the first live product in the ecosystem. The project is also reaching a major milestone with its first centralized exchange listing on BitMart, which has already been confirmed. This will enhance liquidity, widen access to the thousands of new investors, and bring the token to mainstream adoption. With widespread user adoption, Remittix could see its token demand soar, potentially reaching the $1 mark as global payments increasingly rely on fast, low-cost solutions. Here’s why Remittix is leading the charge: Presale success shows strong investor confidence Token addresses high-cost international money transfers BitMart listing brings global exposure and liquidity Wallet beta allows early community access As investors look at Solana’s long-term trajectory, Remittix demonstrates how practical utility can complement high-profile networks, making it one of the best crypto to buy now.

The network hashrate has reached all-time highs, strengthening security infrastructure amid growing altseason speculation and institutional positioning. ChatGPT’s DOGE analysis synthesizes 21 real-time technical indicators to assess Dogecoin’s trajectory as it navigates comprehensive EMA resistance and potential breakout formation. Technical Analysis: Comprehensive EMA Resistance Testing Dogecoin’s current price of $0.22030 reflects a 1.61% decline from the opening price of $0.22390 , establishing a tight consolidation range between $0.22518 (high) and $0.22013 (low). This 2.3% intraday range shows controlled volatility typical of consolidation phases below multiple resistance levels. Source: TradingView The RSI at 48.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing balanced momentum without oversold or overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal a challenging bearish positioning with Dogecoin trading below all major EMAs: the 20-day at $0.22081 ( +0.2% ), the 50-day at $0.22243 ( +1.0% ), the 100-day at $0.22339 ( +1.4% ), and the 200-day at $0.23103 ( +4.7% ). The MACD also shows mixed signs, with a slight bullish positioning at 0.00084 above zero. However, the signal line at -0.00045 and the negative histogram at -0.00129 suggest a deterioration in momentum. Source: Tradingview Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 185.71 million DOGE, indicating strong whale participation during resistance testing phases. ATR also maintains high readings at 0.19785 , suggesting substantial volatility potential despite current tight consolidation range characteristics. Network Strength Meets Altseason Positioning Dogecoin’s consolidation occurs amid major network developments, with the hashrate reaching all-time highs, strengthening security infrastructure. BREAKING: Dogecoin Hashrate has just hit an all time high! $DOGE pic.twitter.com/qjNrgotpq5 — KrissPax (@krisspax) August 27, 2025 The hashrate milestone indicates increased mining participation and network resilience during market uncertainty. Recent market dynamics are sending mixed indicators, with $200 million in DOGE transferred to Binance, creating downward pressure on the price. Meanwhile, Binance data reveals that 75% of accounts are maintaining long positions, expecting rebounds. This positioning dichotomy reflects institutional distribution against retail optimism during altseason speculation phases. Analysts note Dogecoin “lags behind Ethereum after Ethereum breaks all-time highs,” suggesting potential catch-up momentum if altseason rotation accelerates toward established meme coins. $DOGE lags behind #Ethereum after #Ethereum breaks all time highs. pic.twitter.com/gjGi5pY6JC — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) August 28, 2025 The 2025 trajectory exhibits volatility, ranging from January’s $0.33 peak to spring’s $0.16 – $0.17 consolidation, followed by July’s $0.24 recovery and the current $0.22 positioning. Strong Network Metrics Support Positioning Dogecoin maintains a substantial market position with a $33.46 billion market cap ( +0.49% ), despite challenges from EMA resistance. The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $2.31 billion ( +18.3% ), indicating active institutional repositioning during network milestone achievements. The 6.91% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests healthy trading activity, supporting price stability during resistance-testing phases. Source: CoinMarketCap The circulating supply of 150.7 billion DOGE represents the current distribution, with an unlimited maximum supply reflecting the ongoing inflationary mechanics that support network security incentives. With a market dominance of 0.86% , Dogecoin positions itself as a leading meme coin, boasting proven resilience. Fully diluted valuation of $33.47 billion reflects total network value, while current pricing maintains a 70% discount to the 2021 all-time high of $0.7376, providing substantial upside potential. Current pricing secures extraordinary 258,783% gains from 2015 lows while testing key resistance levels. Social Sentiment: Network Strength Amid Technical Challenges LunarCrush data reveals moderate social performance with Dogecoin’s AltRank at 172 during network milestone achievements. A Galaxy Score of 53 reflects a balanced sentiment as participants process hashrate records versus technical resistance challenges. Engagement metrics indicate a decline in activity, with 3.89 million total engagements ( -25,890 ) while mentions increase to 34.2K ( +12,950 ), demonstrating continued attention. The social dominance of 2.4% maintains meme coin visibility, while sentiment registers at a robust 81% positive, despite technical challenges. Recent social themes have focused on network security validation, with community discussions emphasizing “hashrate hits all-time high” and historical pattern analysis suggesting that “ 2025 launchpad is ready.” Dogecoin’s official account just hinted at a “possible threat” behind its hashrate ATH. They referenced Monero… but avoided naming the real player. Why? Because naming it would give visibility.

ChatGPT’s DOGE Analysis: Network Strength Meets Resistance Resolution ChatGPT’s DOGE analysis reveals Dogecoin at a key juncture between network strength validation and comprehensive EMA resistance testing. The hashrate milestone demonstrates fundamental improvement, while the technical structure requires breakout confirmation for trend continuation. Immediate resistance emerges at the 20-day EMA around $0.22081 , followed by layered resistance at 50-day ( $0.22243 ), 100-day ( $0.22339 ), and 200-day ( $0.23103 ) EMAs. Source: TradingView Breaking above these levels would indicate validation of network strength, driving momentum toward $0.24 – $0.25 targets. Support begins at today’s low around $0.22013 , followed by key support at $0.21500 – $0.22000 levels. The technical setup suggests consolidation resolution required for altseason participation, with high volume indicating continued whale interest despite surface resistance challenges. Three-Month Dogecoin Price Forecast: Altseason Scenarios Network-Driven Breakout (40% Probability) A successful break above the $0.2208 EMA resistance, combined with continued network strength, could drive Dogecoin toward $0.24 – $0.27 , representing a 9-23% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires altseason rotation validation and resistance breakthrough confirmation. Extended Consolidation (35% Probability) Continued EMA resistance testing could result in consolidation between $0.21 and $0.23, allowing for network development progress while technical indicators reset for the next directional move during altseason positioning. Source: TradingView Support Testing (25% Probability) Breaking below the $0.2201 support level could trigger selling pressure toward the $0.2100 – $0.1950 range, representing a 5 – 12% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on network strength validation and major support defense during altseason preparation. ChatGPT’s DOGE Analysis: Network Milestones Meet Technical Resolution ChatGPT’s DOGE analysis reveals Dogecoin is positioned between network strength validation and comprehensive resistance testing, requiring breakout confirmation. The hashrate milestone provides a fundamental catalyst while the EMA resistance structure demands technical validation for altseason participation. Next Price Target: $0.24-$0.27 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $0.2208 resistance to validate network strength over technical challenges. From there, the altseason rotation could propel Dogecoin toward the $0.24 psychological resistance, with sustained network development driving it toward recovery levels of $0.27 and above. However, failure to break $0.2208 would indicate extended consolidation toward $0.21 – $0.215 range, creating an accumulation opportunity before the next altseason wave drives DOGE toward $0.35 + targets as network fundamentals compound with market rotation dynamics.

The goal: greater transparency, real-time access, and a public record that can’t be altered. Today’s announcement, made by Howard Lutnick and Donald Trump, signals a major leap for decentralized tech in public data infrastructure. It also validates Pyth’s reputation as a trusted data provider in global finance. The U.S. Department of Commerce has selected Pyth Network to verify & distribute economic data onchain Today’s announcement by @howardlutnick & @realDonaldTrump marks a landmark step for the adoption of decentralization & validates Pyth’s role as a trusted data source pic.twitter.com/cOvw8lDNhP — Pyth Network (@PythNetwork) August 28, 2025 A Historic Collaboration Pyth has been working closely with the Department of Commerce for months. Now, as the official data source for this initiative, the network will power the verifiable publication of economic stats onchain. Howard Lutnick’s push for data innovation has positioned the U.S. to lead the world in financial transparency. And Pyth is at the center of that vision. With 100+ blockchains and 600+ apps already relying on its data feeds, Pyth combines openness, security, and speed in ways few protocols can match. That made it the ideal choice for the government’s first big onchain data experiment. Why This Move Matters For decades, economic data has been siloed behind agencies, websites, and slow distribution channels. By putting it onchain, the Department of Commerce is ensuring anyone, anywhere, can access the same official numbers at the same time—no middlemen, no delays, no doubts. This move unlocks new opportunities: Transparency: Immutable records remove questions about revisions or data tampering. Access: Developers and businesses can integrate official stats directly into applications. Trust: Onchain publication makes economic data verifiable by design. As Howard Lutnick said, this isn’t just about better data. It’s about redefining how markets and governments interact in a digital-first world. Pyth’s First Release: GDP Data The partnership starts with gross domestic product (GDP) data. Pyth will publish quarterly GDP figures going back five years, all verified and accessible onchain. Over time, this will expand to cover more economic datasets—employment, inflation, trade balances, and beyond. For now, GDP is the focus because it’s the core measure of U.S. economic health. And putting it onchain for the first time marks a historic modernization of public data infrastructure. Pyth Network is working with @CommerceGov to power the distribution of gross domestic product data onchain. Chief Executive Officer of Douro Labs, @mdomcahill was the only person quoted in the White House exclusive press release with @Bloomberg to speak on how Pyth Network is… pic.twitter.com/3HfZ65ilIK — Pyth Network (@PythNetwork) August 28, 2025 Onchain economic data doesn’t just help policymakers. It fuels the next wave of tokenization, DeFi applications, and algorithmic markets that rely on real-world information. Developers can now build apps using official GDP numbers as inputs. Investors can reference verifiable data feeds for analytics. And the public can trust that the figures haven’t been changed after release. This is how decentralized tech moves from niche experiments to national infrastructure—by solving real problems with open systems. Pyth Community Sees Years of Work Pay Off For the Pyth Network community, this moment is huge. It validates years of building secure, real-time data oracles for finance, gaming, and decentralized apps. Quick Update: Pyth Network (PYTH) Price Surge Pyth Network’s token (PYTH) surged sharply today, jumping 60–70%, climbing from around $0.11 to hit highs near $0.20, following this landmark partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce. This ignited a massive 2,700% spike in trading volume. Now, with the U.S. government adopting its model, Pyth’s tech will support real markets and public trust at national scale. As Douros Labs CEO Mike Cahill said in an exclusive Bloomberg interview, this partnership shows how onchain transparency can power entire economies. A New Standard for Governments This isn’t just a one-off experiment. The Department of Commerce plans to make onchain data a standard practice moving forward. As more datasets come online, governments worldwide will see how decentralized systems deliver speed, security, and openness that old models can’t match. Pyth is ready to provide the rails for that future—secure, verifiable, and built for scale. The collaboration positions the United States as a global leader in financial transparency. It also proves that decentralization isn’t just for crypto—it’s for anyone who needs trusted, public data at scale. With quarterly GDP numbers already set to launch, and more datasets on the way, this marks the start of a new era for economic data: open, immutable, and accessible to all.

Fresh data shows ETH products are drawing steadier inflows even as Bitcoin ETFs continue to command the lion’s share of assets under management. Weekly Data Highlights Ethereum’s Edge According to data from SoSoValue, as of August 27, cumulative inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $54.19 billion, with $144.57 billion in assets under management. By contrast, Ethereum ETFs have drawn $13.64 billion in total inflows and now manage $30.17 billion, representing 5.44% of ETH’s market capitalization. However, while BTC funds remain far larger, Ethereum’s pace of accumulation has become quite notable. Analysis by DefiLlama based on data from Farside Investors shows that spot ETH ETFs have posted stronger inflows than the BTC ones in six straight weeks, including periods of overall market turbulence. You would have to go back to the July 14-20 window, when BTC ETFs were in the middle of a long inflow streak, to find the last time they topped Ethereum. In that week, the Bitcoin-based products saw $2.386 billion in net inflows against Ethereum’s $2.182 billion. Since then, it has all been downhill for the OG cryptocurrency. Between July 21 and 27, Bitcoin ETFs saw just $72.3 million in inflows, while Ethereum ETFs brought in $1.84 billion. The trend deepened from July 28 to August 3, when BTC posted $642.9 million in outflows compared to ETH’s net gains of $154.3 million. Even in weeks where both asset classes recorded losses, ETH still fared better. For example, between August 18 and 24, Bitcoin funds shed $1.179 billion, while only about $241 million worth of capital trickled out of Ethereum ETFs. With still a few days left in the last week of August, ETH is again leading after raking in over $1.2 billion in inflows. Meanwhile, since Monday, their BTC counterparts have collectively managed a more modest $388.6 million. Market Context Looking closer, within the ETF ecosystem, BlackRock dominates both asset classes. Its IBIT product leads Bitcoin with $83.54 billion in net assets after a $50.87 million single-day inflow on August 27. On the Ethereum side, the investment firm’s ETHA fund accounts for $17.19 billion in assets and added $262.63 million that same day, dwarfing activity from competitors such as Fidelity and Grayscale. The story is also similar in the markets, with the two leading crypto assets moving in opposite directions. Bitcoin is trading at $112,967, down slightly by 0.4% on the week compared to ETH’s 7.5% pump in the same period. BTC also lags in the monthly charts, dipping by 5%, while ETH went up by almost 19% in that time. In one year, ETH has advanced by 86%, which is broadly in line with Bitcoin. Furthermore, both assets recently hit new all-time highs, but have since dropped from their respective peaks by almost the same rate.

Morgan just dropped a bombshell. The banking giant committed $500 million to Numerai $NMR, the hedge fund-meets-crypto project powered by AI and data scientists. Minutes after the news hit, the reaction was instant. Mindshare exploded. Social sentiment flipped from flatline to moonshot. And $NMR? It went vertical—up 160% in days. Is this the moment Wall Street’s influence on crypto finally gets real? J.P. Morgan committed half a billion to @numerai . Mindshare and sentiment jumped from near flatline to soaring levels after the news broke, and $NMR followed, climbing over 160% since. Indication of Wall Street’s growing influence on the crypto markets? pic.twitter.com/UdNBT0cTkR — Cookie DAO (@cookiedotfun) August 28, 2025 JPMorgan Asset Management’s $500 million investment isn’t small change. It signals confidence. It signals scale. And the market noticed. $NMR broke $11, climbing over 33% in 24 hours. Market cap briefly hit $170 million. At one point, the token spiked 124% intraday. That’s a classic crypto squeeze—volume exploding 10X relative to market cap. But here’s the thing: most people still don’t know what Numerai actually does. The Backstory You Didn’t Know Go back to 2015. Hedge funds were walled gardens. Data was locked down. Models were secret. Performance? Mixed. Richard Craib, Numerai’s founder, had a different idea. Instead of a few analysts guessing at trades, why not unleash thousands of data scientists on the problem? Why not give them anonymized data to prevent bias? That was Numerai’s breakthrough. A global hedge fund built on crowdsourced intelligence. Then came the crypto twist. Enter $NMR, What You Need To Know In 2017, Numerai launched the $NMR token. It wasn’t just another coin. It had a purpose: staking. Data scientists stake $NMR on their models. If their predictions win, they earn more tokens. If they fail, the stake burns. It’s meritocracy on-chain. The results speak for themselves: Hedge fund AUM grew from $60M to $450M. Net return in 2024 hit +25.45%, crushing many traditional funds. Over $7M worth of $NMR is currently staked by data scientists. JPMorgan just provided $500M capacity to scale even further. The team even repurchased $1M of $NMR recently. No wonder the token rallied 125% in seven days. $NMR is catching 10X the volume compared to its market cap, and most of you don’t even know what’s behind this tech titan! It's one of the OG “real use case” projects that’s been quietly building since 2017. Here’s the story Back in 2015, @richardcraib saw hedge funds… pic.twitter.com/BYzOn8ldgq — Thanos (@CryptoThannos) August 27, 2025 Why $NMR Is Different This isn’t just another meme coin. $NMR sits at the intersection of real finance and crypto incentives. Direct link to hedge fund performance: As Numerai wins, demand for $NMR rises Capped supply: 11M max tokens, with burns reducing it further Constant demand: Data scientists need $NMR to stake every single week TradFi meets DeFi: JPMorgan on one side, crypto-native mechanics on the other Utility. Scarcity. Adoption. That’s rare in this space. The big question: does JPMorgan’s money change the game? If Numerai scales AUM from $450M to billions—and keeps outperforming—demand for $NMR staking could explode. Token buybacks add fuel. Burns tighten supply even more. Every piece points to growing real-world adoption. Sentiment Flip To Bullish Look at the social feeds. The moment the $500M news dropped, sentiment around $NMR flipped bullish. The hype isn’t just empty talk. It’s backed by numbers, adoption, and now Wall Street money. Numerai has been quietly building since 2017. Now, with half a billion from JPMorgan, the spotlight’s finally here. Hedge fund growth. Token burns. Buybacks. Staking demand. $NMR isn’t another crypto promise. It’s a live experiment in merging traditional finance scale with crypto-native incentives. If this trend holds, Wall Street’s next big frontier might not be ETFs or Bitcoin halving plays. It might be a hedge fund powered by thousands of data scientists and a single token driving it all. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

50833419,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80582,1756417502,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,From Early Stages to 1000x: BullZilla Is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2025 with Popcat and ApeCoin Buzz,https://timestabloid.com/from-early-stages-to-1000x-bullzilla-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest/,"The digital asset market thrives on momentum, and 2025 has already proven how quickly narratives can shift. While legacy projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to anchor institutional portfolios, it’s the meme and community-driven tokens that capture the imagination of retail investors. Today, three names dominate the conversation: BullZilla, ApeCoin, and Popcat. BullZilla is preparing for one of the most ambitious presales of the year, promising stage-based price growth that rewards early adopters as the best crypto to invest in 2025. ApeCoin is regaining traction after a turbulent 2024, while Popcat has risen sharply on the back of Solana’s surging ecosystem. Each token represents a different angle of the crypto market: early-stage speculation, ecosystem-backed utility, and meme-fueled virality. Together, they paint a vivid picture of where capital may flow next. BullZilla: The Best Crypto to Invest in 2025 Engineered for Multipliers The crypto world remembers Dogecoin’s improbable rise and Pepe’s meteoric sprint. But BullZilla has introduced something those tokens lacked: a structured presale model designed to amplify ROI at every stage. Its defining feature is the dual-timed price escalation, where token prices increase every 48 hours or when $100,000 is raised. This mechanic creates a built-in scarcity loop that forces investors to act decisively. At the presale’s start, tokens are going to be priced at $0.00000575. Such models echo traditional venture capital’s tiered funding rounds, but in a way that is accessible to everyday investors. For financial students studying tokenomics, BullZilla ($BZIL) offers a live experiment in behavioral economics. The countdown-driven pricing model combines urgency with community hype, ensuring liquidity flows at predictable intervals. Blockchain developers, on the other hand, see value in the project’s dual mechanics: the Roar Burn, which reduces token supply, and the HODL Furnace, which rewards long-term holders. These features create a balance between short-term trading appeal and long-term sustainability. Analysts argue that BullZilla’s approach aligns with the psychological triggers that made earlier meme coins successful, but with more mathematical discipline. If the project executes its roadmap and listings follow as scheduled, early-stage participants could be sitting on some of the most eye-catching ROI opportunities of the year as the best crypto to invest in 2025 ApeCoin: Rebounding from the Shadows Once tied to the roaring success of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, ApeCoin (APE) has spent much of 2024 trying to reclaim its relevance. Trading today at $0.5807 with a daily turnover of over $30 million, ApeCoin is showing signs of steady recovery. The numbers may not yet hint at a breakout, but seasoned traders recognize early consolidation patterns. Technical indicators suggest the current price is near its historical support levels. Should market sentiment turn risk-on, liquidity could push ApeCoin back above the $1 threshold, with higher resistance levels at $1.50 and $2. Financial analysts caution that this recovery depends heavily on renewed retail interest and the broader NFT market’s rebound. For blockchain developers, ApeCoin represents a test of resilience: can a project born from NFT culture adapt to a post-hype environment? If successful, ApeCoin may set a precedent for how community-driven tokens evolve once their initial craze subsides. For investors, the risk-reward profile is asymmetric, downside is cushioned by established liquidity, while upside potential lies in renewed cultural adoption. Popcat: Solana’s Meme Star Emerges Popcat has become one of the fastest-rising meme coins on the Solana network. Trading at $0.270886 with a daily volume exceeding $33 million, Popcat’s surge reflects both Solana’s expanding influence and the appetite for fresh meme-driven narratives. The narrative around Popcat is also buoyed by Solana’s growing reputation as the home for next-generation meme coins. Much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu defined earlier waves, Popcat could define Solana’s meme cycle. Price action suggests bullish continuation, with upward targets ranging between $0.35 and $0.50 if liquidity continues to build. From a technical perspective, Popcat’s support level sits firmly around $0.20, a zone defended multiple times by buyers. If momentum holds, Popcat could cement itself as one of the most important community tokens in 2025. Analysts also point to Solana’s institutional adoption as a macro driver that could indirectly elevate meme projects built on its chain. Final Words: Which are The Best Crypto to Invest in 2025? These three tokens embody different stages of the crypto narrative cycle. Bull Zilla represents speculative entry points with life-changing ROI potential. ApeCoin stands as a test case for resilience and ecosystem adaptation. Popcat exemplifies how new infrastructure, in this case Solana, can supercharge meme coins. Financial students studying portfolio theory may view BullZilla as a high-risk, high-reward allocation, ApeCoin as a moderate-risk play tethered to cultural revival, and Popcat as a momentum-driven asset tied to infrastructure strength. Blockchain developers see in BullZilla and ApeCoin experiments in governance and tokenomics, while analysts are closely monitoring Popcat for signs of breakout momentum. Ultimately, these projects prove one lesson: the crypto market never moves in a straight line. Instead, it thrives on cycles of speculation, adaptation, and reinvention. Investors willing to study these cycles, and act at the right time, often find themselves ahead of the curve as the best crypto to invest in 2025.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,413.80 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $3,241.76. Monero (XMR) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions, making it one of the leading privacy focused cryptocurrencies. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero progresses, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth, as many traders speculate? Can it sustain its competitive edge in the ever-evolving crypto market? Will XMR recapture its ATH at $517.62 in the long term forecast? Overview Cryptocurrency Monero Token XMR Price $265.32 (-3%) Market Cap $4.88 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $96 Million Circulating Supply 18,446,744.07 XMR All-time High $517.62 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.213, Jan 15, 2015 24-h High $273.50 24-h Low $259.51 Monero price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $295.86 200-Day SMA $276.02 Price Prediction $580.45 (118.78%) F & G Index 21.33 (extreme fear) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 14-Day RSI 58.30 Monero price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Monero price shows fall towards $260 The XMR coin fell by over 3% at the time of writing. Monero price has support and resistance at $260 and $280, respectively. The Monero price analysis for August 28 shows further decline as XMR decays further towards the $230 support. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR falls to $265 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes a decrease of more than 18% of its value in the last 30 days as XMR fell from the $340 price level to the $230 mark. However, after reaching the $230 mark, the price gained buying demand and rose sharply to the $300 level where it hovered for a while before ultimately correcting to $265 where it trades at press time. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show rising selling pressure. The MACD is bullish at 3.15 units and shows attempts of a bullish recovery at the current price level. However, the RSI hovers below the midline at 45.92 level, suggesting room for movement in downward direction. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest higher volatility, indicating that the $260 support may hold for the week. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero was in a steady decline until finding strong bullish support at $230 that enabled a recovery to $265. Currently, the bulls seek to defend the $260 support but with rising bearish pressure, price may continue to decline. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The RSI is at 42.18, suggesting neutral sentiment as the price falls back towards the $260 mark. The MACD, at -0.79, shows rising bearish momentum on the 4-hour charts. Additionally, the EMAs are falling towards the mean value, it suggests a pessimistic market sentiment. These indicators collectively issue bearish market sentiments suggesting further decline.

XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great start to this month as the price rose toward $320. However, the sharp crash around the $320 mark suggests strong bearish pressure. As such, the price fell below $300 as the bulls were unable to hold the level. Now the $260 acts as short-term support. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to fall towards the $260 mark after a breakdown from the current level. However, the bulls need to protect the $230 level and establish a foothold above the $280 level to initiate a recovery. On the other hand, a bearish breakout would mean a drop below the $200 level. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR down today? The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero was in a steady decline until finding strong bullish support at $230 that enabled a recovery to $280 before crashing back towards the $265 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current Monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Chief finance officer David Zinsner revealed at an investor conference on Thursday that the struggling chip-making firm received the grant on Wednesday night. Intel CFO confirms receipt of the funds Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last Friday revealed that the US government had taken a 10% stake in Intel, the Trump administration’s latest effort to exert control over corporate America. He added that the agreement would strengthen the US’s leadership in semiconductors. Zinsner also said the move was an incentive for Intel to retain control of its contract manufacturing business, or foundry. “This was a quick way to getting, initially, $5.7B in the door,” said Zinsner during a fireside chat at Deutsche Bank’s 2025 Technology Conference in Dana Point, Calif. “By the way, we have received it. We got it last night. So that’s on the balance sheet. So that was one thing that eliminated the need to access the capital markets in any other way in the near term.” Zinsner. As part of the deal, the Trump administration negotiated an additional 5% warrant in the event Intel ceases to own more than 51% of its foundry operation. “I don’t think there’s a high likelihood that we would take our stake below 50%,” Zinsner said, adding that “so ultimately, I would expect (the warrant) to expire worthless.” The embattled chip-making firm has previously indicated that it could take outside investment in the foundry business and has established a separate management board to govern it. In the event that the company does so, Zinsner said Intel was leaning towards a strategic investor versus a financial one, though the company is “years away from that.” Last month, Intel revealed that the future of its foundry business depended on getting a big customer for its next-generation manufacturing process known as 14A. In the event that it failed to secure one, it could leave the foundry business altogether. During the Thursday investor conference, Zinsner downplayed the potential risk to its foundry. “The lawyers are always looking for areas where we should be elaborating in terms of our risks,” he said. BIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies. This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge. Thanks to Intel… pic.twitter.com/AYMuX14Rgi — Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) August 22, 2025 US government says it is still working on the deal White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also on Thursday gave a different picture, suggesting the deal was not yet final as there were areas that were still being “ironed out by the Department of Commerce.” “The t’s are still being crossed. The i’s are still being dotted. These – you know – it’s very much still under discussion.” Leavitt. Leavitt added that the President proposed the deal, and the Commerce Secretary was working on its implementation. When asked to elaborate, a White House official revealed that the Intel deal, namely a $3 billion Secure Enclave award from the Department of Defense, was not fully implemented. It was, however, not clear if Leavitt’s sentiments suggested the deal could still be revised in some way. The $5.7 billion is part of the company’s share of the US CHIPS and Science Act funding. Under the agreement, the US government is buying 433.3 million shares at $20.47 each. According to Seeking Alpha , Intel had already received $2.2 billion in grants from CHIPS at an earlier date. An additional $3.2 billion will come from the Secure Enclave program through the US Department of Defense, elevating the total investment to $11.1 billion. Earlier this month, Intel raised $2 billion from SoftBank Group in the form of an equity stake. As part of its restructuring exercise under the leadership Lip-Bu Tan, the company seeks to slash its workforce to 75,000.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an emerging DeFi protocol gaining traction for its innovative lending, is drawing increasing attention from investors seeking higher growth potential in a maturing market. Existing investors will get an ROI of a minimum of 300% post-listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already reached over $15.05 million and has achieved 15720+ investors so far. While Ethereum remains the benchmark for smart contracts and decentralized applications, Mutuum Finance’s rapid ecosystem expansion and strategic positioning could make it a surprising portfolio multiplier as the next crypto cycle unfolds. Ethereum Price Prediction: Steady Momentum Toward 2025 Targets Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $4,403.78, showing steady performance amid a broader market consolidation. Analysts suggest that ETH could gradually advance toward the $7,000–$10,000 range by 2025, supported by ongoing institutional interest, network upgrades, and wider adoption of decentralized applications. While the path remains influenced by overall market conditions and regulatory developments, Ethereum continues to play a central role in the crypto ecosystem, with other emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance contributing to shifting investor sentiment. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in presale round six and is priced at $0.035 per token. Once the round is complete, the price rises 14.29% to $0.04 as demand surges and early adopters show faith in the project. The presale has gathered over 15,720 investors and over $15.05 million in capital, with signals of early traction and investor interest. A USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Ethereum Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain as a stable, secure, and transparent form of value storage. The stablecoin will be a stable digital currency for daily transactions, decentralized applications, and long-term portfolio stability. Though algorithmic stablecoins have in the past been exposed to market volatility, this asset shall be created with the aim of eradicating speculation and not being limited by the burden of high volatility. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Infrastructure Mutuum Finance involves a two-way lending approach in which automation is mixed with user-initiated intervention to provide a very efficient and interactive decentralized financial system. Peer-to-Contract lending is done using self-executing smart contracts, which facilitate lending and borrowing without the need for intervention on their part. Interest rates compound automatically in real time based on supply and demand within the market, and it is transparent and autonomous. Peer-to-Peer lending takes a step ahead and lets the lenders and borrowers negotiate with each other. Here, the intermediaries are skirted and the users are given more control to negotiate and agree on terms and transactions and grant access and convenience of a platform. Through this dual approach, Mutuum Finance is a safe and future-resistant infrastructure that functions to promote financial inclusion, achieve solid returns, and deliver opportunity to retail and institutional players in equal proportions. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability serves as the basis for an expansion-led and sustainable DeFi market.

Related Reading: $160K Bitcoin By Christmas? Analysts Say It’s Still Possible Based on reports, the total crypto market cap bounced from an intraday low near $3.80 trillion to about $3.90 trillion on the same day, while Bitcoin traded around $112,300 and Ether reclaimed levels near $4,600. The minting stood out because it often signals ready cash that can be deployed quickly into exchanges and trading desks. Tether Minting Sparks Liquidity Flows New USDT issuance is frequently used to fund purchases, and the 1 billion issuance was flagged by on-chain trackers as a likely source of fresh buying power. Santiment and other trackers show that the number of addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC rose by 13 to about 2,085 since the start of August. At the same time, wallets holding at least 10,000 ETH increased by 48 to roughly 1,27. On August 26, US spot ether ETFs recorded about $450 million in net cash inflow, led by BlackRock’s ETHE with roughly $320 million that day. That pushed cumulative inflows into spot ether ETFs to near $13.30 billion, while US spot Bitcoin ETFs took in about $88 million with BlackRock’s IBIT posting roughly $45 million. The freshly minted USDT could be used by traders and desks to buy into Ether and other altcoins, matching the observable rotation from Bitcoin into alternative assets and ETF-linked demand. Whale Accumulation Intensifies Large holders were not the only sign of demand. Trading volumes and price moves showed altcoins gaining traction, but it was the flow of stablecoins that underpinned the story. When stablecoin supply rises, it lowers the friction for big buys: money can be moved to exchanges and executed faster than waiting for bank transfers. That operational detail helps explain why a billion mint draws attention even when headline prices are already climbing. The immediate effect of the mint was to give traders extra readily available cash. But liquidity injections are a two-sided event. They can push prices higher if buyers are aggressive, while concentrated buying and later profit-taking can cause sharp swings. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For Triple Surge Vs. Bitcoin – Details What Tether Minting Could Mean For Markets Market observers are watching liquidity, whale wallets, and ETF flows together because the mix determines whether a sustained capital rotation into altcoins will follow or if gains will be short lived. Tether’s 1 billion USDT mint was the clearest single signal of added spending power during Wednesday’s rebound. That supply, paired with heavy inflows into Ether ETFs and signs of whale accumulation, creates a setup where altcoin demand can grow quickly.

Analysts are now observing a similar pattern in a new AI project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), suggesting it is walking in Ripple’s successful path. Following a strategic CoinMarketCap listing that made it one of the highest-demand presales, many believe its token could be on the verge of a 100x rally. Professional Validation Creates a Ripple-Like Foundation Before Ripple gained widespread adoption, it first established itself as a credible, professional project. Ruvi AI is following this exact blueprint to build trust with serious investors. The project began by successfully completing a comprehensive third-party security audit from CyberScope , which verified the integrity and security of its smart contracts. This move provided the technical assurance necessary to attract significant capital. That foundation was then leveraged through a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , the world’s most referenced crypto data authority. This action put Ruvi AI on the global stage, unleashing a torrent of demand and resulting in some of the most impressive presale metrics seen this year: Almost $3.3M raised with incredible velocity, demonstrating massive market confidence. Over 250M tokens sold to a rapidly expanding global community. A holder base surpassing 3,200 investors , with momentum building daily. This combination of a successful audit and overwhelming market demand is precisely why analysts see parallels to Ripple’s own path to success. A Super App with Utility to Power a 100x Run Ripple’s long-term value is rooted in its utility for cross-border payments. Similarly, Ruvi AI’s potential for a 100x rally is grounded in its powerful, real-world utility. The project’s revolutionary super app is an all-in-one toolkit designed to empower creators in the massive $104 billion creator economy . This tangible use case creates sustainable, long-term demand for the RUVI token. The super app offers a suite of AI-powered tools that solve critical problems for creators: Advanced Trend Research : Identifies viral topics before they peak, giving users a crucial first-mover advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation : Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram to maximize audience retention. Native Media Creation : Allows creators to generate high-quality images and videos directly within the app, cutting costs and streamlining workflows. Streamlined Workflows : A central dashboard for planning, editing, and scheduling content enhances productivity. A Clear Path to Growth with a 40% Surge Ahead Ruvi AI’s presale is engineered with a transparent, multi-stage structure that guarantees price increases for its early investors. Having sold out its initial phases in record time, the project has now entered Phase 3. Current Price (Phase 3) : $0.020 Next Price (Phase 4) : The token price is set for a 40% increment to $0.028. This built-in growth model is creating a powerful sense of urgency. To ensure a seamless transition to the open market, a partnership with the major exchange WEEX is already in place, guaranteeing deep liquidity and a professional trading environment for all token holders. VIP Tiers: Your Gateway to a 100x Opportunity For those looking to capitalize on this opportunity, Ruvi AI’s VIP program offers substantial bonus tokens that can lead to extraordinary returns. VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI .

The Solana-based launchpad has taken more than 70% of market share and pulled in over $13 million in weekly revenue. Lifetime earnings just crossed $800 million. But while the platform is booming, many traders are rotating into tokens with stronger long-term potential. Analysts say XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two of the biggest beneficiaries of this shift. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is that it’s fully audited, safe, and backed by compliance—giving investors more confidence as they search for the best cryptos to buy now . XRP Sees Renewed Interest On-chain data reveals that the bulk of the transaction inflow into XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE has come from Pump Fun traders. Interestingly, this rotation comes at a time when Pump Fun is seeing positive energy, which signals that a bigger play is happening elsewhere. Following a strong summer, XRP is trading near $3.29. The majority of the price boost the token saw came from the conclusion of the long SEC case against Ripple. With the court giving the final confirmation of XRP’s securities status, both institutional and retail confidence have gone up. With $3.00 acting as a strong support level, XRP is being called one of the best cryptos to buy now for 2025. Investors Show Renewed Confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE Meanwhile, the capital infusion from Pump Fun traders appears not to be the only catalyst driving momentum in MAGACOIN FINANCE. An inflow of new investors in the project has also added to the excitement. On-chain data analysis reveals that a growing number of the earliest investors in the project are rapidly accumulating more tokens, especially as speculations of a price increase grow. This comes as analysts who track emerging tokens project gains of up to 5,000% for investors who buy MAGACOIN FINANCE before it lists on exchanges. As a result, many investors now believe the window to get into the project may be closing, and supply is running out fast. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investors who missed out on the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Right now, the project is earning multiple picks as the best crypto to buy now in 2025. Verified Altcoin With Analyst Support and Long-Term Upside As one of the best altcoins to buy this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE earns its place through verified credibility. Unlike speculative launches, this project is backed by a full audit and led by a KYC-compliant team, creating a solid foundation for long-term success. Its combination of security, transparency, and utility makes it highly attractive to forward-thinking investors. Final Take Pump Fun may dominate Solana’s launchpad market, but the real action is happening elsewhere. XRP offers utility and institutional adoption. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early presale growth potential. For traders scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy now, these two tokens show how viral momentum can turn into opportunity.

50833969,567710,1756418427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50833969.jpeg,Solana Successfully Starts Community Voting Phase On Alpenglow,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-community-voting-phase-alpenglow/,"The most ambitious consensus overhaul foe Solana to date—SIMD-0326, nicknamed “Alpenglow”—has officially moved into the community voting window, a three-epoch process that began at the start of Epoch 840 and will conclude at the end of Epoch 842. The proposal rewrites Solana’s core consensus, replacing Proof-of-History plus TowerBFT with a modern architecture centered on a direct-vote finality engine (“Votor”). The authors say Alpenglow significantly reduces latency (from 12.8 seconds under TowerBFT to as low as 100–150 milliseconds) while eliminating heavy vote-gossip traffic through off-chain messaging and signature aggregation. Solana Validators Begin Deciding Future Of Alpenglow Governance mechanics for SIMD-0326 are unusually explicit. Vote tokens are claimable by validators according to captured stake weights, using a Merkle distributor tool; tokens may be sent to “Yes,” “No,” or “Abstain” accounts. Passage requires a supermajority: the sum of Yes votes is equal to or greater than 2/3 of the total sum of Yes + No votes,” with a quorum of 33% in which abstentions count toward quorum but not toward the Yes/No denominator. On day one of the window (Epoch 840), early snapshots show modest—but distinctly positive—participation. Multiple market data posts report turnout near 11.5%, with roughly 11.3% of stake signaling “Yes” and negligible “No.” Because the overwhelming share of stake has not yet cast ballots, this should be treated as an initial reading rather than a trend. A public tally dashboard is being maintained by Staking Facilities. Alpenglow’s design changes go beyond speed. The protocol introduces certificate-based notarization and finalization, aggregates validator votes off-chain to reduce overhead, and rebalances incentives around voting. Notably, the proposal replaces per-slot on-chain vote fees with a fixed “Validator Admission Ticket” (VAT) currently set at 1.6 SOL per epoch and burned—an economic continuity measure intended to keep cost structures comparable to today’s while votes move off-chain. “Before each epoch, each validator must pay a fixed fee—initially set to 1.6 SOL per epoch,” the authors write, adding that the figure mirrors roughly 80% of current on-chain voting costs. Forum participants have already begun debating whether a flat VAT raises entry barriers for smaller operators, underscoring that the governance discussion is as much about economics as it is about protocol mechanics. Timing matters for operators and tokenholders following the vote. Solana epochs are approximately two days in length, so a three-epoch voting window implies about six days from start to finish. The network entered Epoch 840 on August 27, 2025, which places the expected end of the voting window around September 2, 2025, when Epoch 842 concludes. If the supermajority threshold is reached, Alpenglow would clear governance, with subsequent activation depending on client readiness and the standard Solana release process. For now, the focus is on turnout. With ~90% of stake yet to be tallied in the opening snapshot, every validator ballot over the coming epochs will carry outsized weight in determining whether Solana pursues ~150-millisecond finality as its next consensus horizon.

Some assets swing wildly with speculation, while others manage to channel volatility into adoption and growth. As 2025 unfolds, the most volatile crypto projects are no longer just those that move up and down on charts; they’re the ones transforming unpredictability into opportunity. Among the leading names, Solana, Ethereum, and Kaspa are showing varying levels of resilience and momentum. Yet BlockDAG is emerging as the standout, not only for its price movement but also for its presale structure, early rewards, and ability to tie volatility directly to community participation. BlockDAG (BDAG): Building a Loyalty Engine That Harnesses Volatility BlockDAG has flipped the usual presale script. Instead of simply raising funds, it has built a functioning loyalty system designed to keep users engaged daily. With $386 million already raised, more than 25 billion coins sold, and the presale sitting in batch 30 at $0.03, it has delivered an ROI of 2,900% since its $0.001 debut in batch one. But the numbers only tell part of the story. At the center of BlockDAG’s momentum are features that turn volatility into participation. Buyer Battles, a daily contest distributing 50 million BDAG, rewards the biggest presale buyer, creating a competitive Meta Title: Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025: BlockDAG Leads with Gamified Rewards & 2,900% ROI Meta Description: Discover the best altcoins to buy in 2025, starting with BlockDAG ’s $386M presale, 25% referral rewards, Buyer Battles, and 2.5M+ mobile miners. Compare with SOL, ETH, and KAS to find real utility and early earning power. energy that resets every 24 hours. Over 2.5 million people are already mining BDAG with the X1 mobile app, while future miners in the X10, X30, and X100 series will earn up to $100 daily at the projected $0.05 listing. BlockDAG also rewards high-engagement members with perks through its Ambassador Program, combining merchandise, early access, and event representation. With CertiK and Halborn audits already completed, BlockDAG is not only one of the most volatile crypto presale performers but also one of the most structurally prepared for long-term adoption. Solana (SOL): Speed Meets Fragile Confidence Solana has long been praised for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, making it one of the most popular platforms for DeFi and NFTs. In 2025, it continues to integrate into real-world applications, from payments in retail environments to mobile phone ecosystems. Yet Solana’s volatility tells a mixed story. While the chain can process thousands of transactions per second, recent chart data reveals a double-top formation near the $206–$209 level. At the same time, holder confidence has slipped, with mid-term wallets falling from 14.84% to 12.96% and short-term holders dropping from 7.87% to 4.06% within a month. These signals suggest that despite Solana’s speed and scale, market participants are less willing to ride out its price swings. If support at $183 breaks, downside risks toward $175 or even $161 could emerge. Ethereum (ETH): The Bedrock Facing Profit-Taking Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and Layer-2 ecosystems. With more than $17.6 billion locked in treasuries and institutions holding over 4.1 million ETH, it has the deepest foundation in Web3. Still, volatility has caught up with ETH. After peaking above $4,793 in mid-August, the coin slipped back under the $4,000 threshold, as futures markets showed strong profit-taking. The taker buy/sell ratio has stayed below 1, currently at 0.92, highlighting sell-side dominance. Key supports remain near $4,063 and $3,950, but if they fail, deeper corrections may unfold. On the flip side, breaking $4,948 resistance could reignite momentum toward $5,500. Kaspa (KAS): Volatility Anchored in Pure DAG Speed Kaspa has carved out a niche by blending Proof-of-Work security with blockDAG scalability. Its architecture allows simultaneous block confirmations, removing the bottlenecks seen in older chains like Bitcoin. Unlike presale-driven projects, Kaspa’s volatility comes from market dynamics and technical interest. Having launched without presales or insider allocations, it attracts those who prioritize decentralization and fair distribution. Its ultra-fast block times make it attractive for real-time use cases, but volatility remains. Kaspa’s price continues to swing sharply as it battles for recognition beyond its core technical supporters. Final Outlook: Volatility With Substance The label of “ most volatile crypto ” often comes with skepticism, but 2025 proves volatility can mean more than sudden drops or pumps. Solana demonstrates speed yet struggles with waning holder conviction. Ethereum remains the market’s foundation but faces pressure from profit-taking. Kaspa showcases technical innovation but still wrestles with recognition and adoption. BlockDAG, however, stands apart. Its $386 million presale, 2,900% ROI, 25 billion coins sold, and millions of miners already engaged highlight a project channeling volatility into sustained participation. As markets keep shifting, the question isn’t whether crypto will be volatile; it always will be. In 2025, BlockDAG’s mix of community traction, audited security, and presale scale makes it the front-runner among the most volatile crypto assets with genuine staying power.

This isn’t just a corporate transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver that could redefine the landscape of US chip manufacturing and have long-term implications for global tech supply chains. For those invested in the stability and growth of the digital economy, understanding this intricate deal is crucial . Understanding the Government Equity Stake in Intel The Trump administration’s recent deal with Intel is designed to significantly influence the company’s future, particularly concerning its foundry business unit. Intel’s CFO, David Zinsner, shed light on the specifics at a Deutsche Bank conference. The agreement grants the U.S. government a 10% government equity stake in Intel, a move that comes with strings attached, primarily aimed at preventing the sale or spin-off of its custom chip manufacturing arm. Key aspects of this deal include: 10% Equity Stake: The U.S. government now holds a substantial share in Intel. Five-Year Warrant: An additional 5% equity stake, at $20 a share, could be acquired by the government if Intel’s equity in its foundry business drops below 51% within the next few years. Zinsner expressed confidence this warrant would expire, indicating Intel’s commitment to retaining the unit. Financial Infusion: Intel received $5.7 billion in cash, representing the remaining grants previously awarded under the U.S. CHIPS Act . Zinsner explicitly stated the government’s objective: “I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody.” This statement underscores the administration’s intent to anchor chip production firmly within the United States. The CHIPS Act and its Strategic Intent This deal is a direct manifestation of the goals outlined in the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act . Enacted to bolster domestic semiconductor research, development, and production, the CHIPS Act aims to reduce America’s reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from regions like Taiwan, which currently dominates the global chip manufacturing landscape through companies like TSMC. The government’s intervention with Intel Foundry is a clear signal of its determination to bring critical manufacturing capabilities back home. The strategic intent behind the CHIPS Act and this specific deal is multi-faceted: National Security: Ensuring a domestic supply of advanced semiconductors is vital for defense and critical infrastructure. Economic Resilience: Reducing vulnerability to global supply chain disruptions and fostering high-tech job growth. Technological Leadership: Reasserting the U.S. as a leader in semiconductor innovation and production. By structuring the deal to penalize Intel for divesting its foundry, the administration is effectively forcing the company to commit to its role in strengthening US chip manufacturing , even if it means navigating financial headwinds. Navigating Challenges: Intel Foundry’s Financial Hurdles While the government’s stance is clear, it presents significant challenges for Intel. The Intel Foundry unit has been a source of considerable financial strain for the company, reporting an operating income loss of $3.1 billion during the second quarter. This consistent underperformance has led to widespread calls from analysts, board members, and investors to spin off the struggling unit. The idea of a spin-off gained traction last fall, especially before the unexpected retirement of Intel Foundry’s architect, former CEO Pat Gelsinger, in December. The deal’s structure, however, effectively removes this option, compelling Intel to retain and invest in a business unit that is currently a financial drain. This commitment requires Intel to: Intensify Investment: Pour more resources into improving foundry operations and technology. Optimize Efficiency: Find ways to make the foundry business profitable despite its current losses. Long-Term Vision: Adopt a long-term strategy that aligns with national interests, even if it conflicts with short-term financial pressures. The government’s position highlights a tension between corporate profitability and national strategic imperatives, forcing Intel to balance its fiduciary duties with a broader national agenda. Reshaping US Chip Manufacturing: A New Era? This unprecedented deal signals a new era for US chip manufacturing . For decades, many industry players have shifted production offshore, primarily to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), due to cost efficiencies and specialized expertise. The Trump administration’s actions, supported by the CHIPS Act , aim to reverse this trend and rebuild domestic capabilities. The implications for the broader tech ecosystem are substantial: Increased Domestic Capacity: More chips designed and produced on U.S. soil. Supply Chain Resilience: A more secure and less vulnerable supply chain for critical components. Innovation Hub: Potential for the U.S. to re-emerge as a leading hub for advanced semiconductor research and development. While the immediate financial burden on Intel is evident, the long-term vision is to create a robust and self-sufficient domestic semiconductor industry , capable of meeting the demands of future technological advancements. Broader Implications for the Semiconductor Industry The ripple effects of this deal extend far beyond Intel. It sets a precedent for how governments might intervene in critical industries to secure national interests. For the global semiconductor industry , it could mean a shift towards more regionalized manufacturing, potentially leading to higher costs but greater supply chain security. Consider the competitive landscape: Competition with TSMC: While TSMC remains a dominant force, increased U.S. investment in domestic foundries could foster greater competition and alternative sourcing options. Global Partnerships: The deal might influence how other nations view their own semiconductor strategies, potentially spurring similar initiatives. Innovation Pace: A strong domestic base could accelerate innovation in areas like AI, quantum computing, and other advanced technologies that rely heavily on cutting-edge chips. As the industry evolves, events like the 20th anniversary of Bitcoin World Disrupt in San Francisco (October 27-29, 2025) become even more vital. Tech and VC heavyweights from Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, and Sequoia Capital will gather to deliver insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen industry edge. These platforms offer invaluable opportunities to learn from top voices in tech about the shifting dynamics of global supply chains and the future of critical technologies, including those impacted by deals like Intel’s. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on America’s Tech Future The Trump administration’s deal with Intel represents a bold and decisive move to reshape US chip manufacturing . By taking a government equity stake and structuring the agreement to prevent the sale of the Intel Foundry unit, the administration is making a significant investment in the nation’s technological sovereignty. While Intel faces the immediate challenge of making its foundry business profitable, the long-term goal is to build a resilient and robust domestic semiconductor industry , vital for national security and economic prosperity. This deal underscores the increasing intersection of geopolitics, technology, and corporate strategy, highlighting how critical components like semiconductors are now at the forefront of national policy.
