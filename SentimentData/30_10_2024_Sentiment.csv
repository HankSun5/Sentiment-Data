[20x Potential],” prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher unveiled Chintai (CHEX) as his latest high-conviction investment within the Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Deutscher believes Chintai could offer significant upside potential—up to 1,900% (20x)—in the upcoming market cycle. Deutscher has consistently highlighted RWA tokens as one of his top investment narratives, ranking third behind memecoins and AI for this crypto bull run. “When I look at narratives that can actually change the fabric of crypto and really offer a new value add, I think RWA is massive,” he stated. He emphasized the growing appeal of on-chain treasury yields, especially as traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) yields diminish and interest rates decline. The analyst previously capitalized on early investments in ONDO and Mantra (OM), both of which have seen substantial gains. ONDO, for instance, delivered a 7x return from his initial entry point. However, Deutscher now considers these assets to be reaching overvalued territories. “Valuation-wise, though, it’s pretty insane considering the fact that its market cap’s a billion, but it’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $7.1 billion,” he said regarding ONDO. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‘True Time To Sell It All’: Here’s When Deutscher has been reallocating his capital into what he perceives as undervalued opportunities within the RWA space. Alongside Clearpool (CPOOL), which he mentioned has already gained 42% since his initial disclosure, Chintai (CHEX) stands out as his newest and largest RWA position. “This one I’m also really, really bullish on. It’s tough for me to say if I’m most bullish on this, but it might be the one that I’m most bullish on in the RWA sector,” he remarked. Chintai differentiates itself by being one of the few RWA-focused layer-one blockchains regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). “If you know Singapore, they are so strict with due diligence. It’s really hard to get a license; they fought for a license and they’ve got it,” Deutscher noted. This regulatory approval positions Chintai to attract significant institutional capital, potentially channeling billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL) onto their chain. The analyst highlighted Chintai’s robust fundamentals, including its extensive list of major clients and partnerships, such as DHC, Finstable, and Greengate. “They are basically a marketplace for tokenization, an L1 blockchain for RWA tokenization,” he explained. The platform has already facilitated over $630 million worth of loans and is set to launch “OZEAN,” a blockchain for RWA yield supported by Optimism, early next year. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run From a valuation perspective, Deutscher sees substantial upside potential. Chintai currently has an FDV of approximately $250 million, significantly lower than Mantra’s $1.37 billion FDV. “If CHEX—even in a static market without the market growing at all—does a 6x, that’s just now matching Mantra,” he calculated. Considering the potential growth of the RWA market, the upside could be even more pronounced. “What if the RWA market 2x’s? Because I think it’s going to be a very strong narrative next year; then you could be looking at a 14x.” Despite its strong fundamentals, Deutscher acknowledges that Chintai’s lower valuation compared to its peers is largely due to a lack of market awareness. “Why is there that discrepancy despite the fundamentals being just as, if not more strong, for Chintai? Just marketing,” he observed. Mantra has excelled in marketing efforts, attracting considerable attention in the crypto community. “Once Chintai can improve its awareness—and I’m actually giving it more awareness by making this video—that is the only key that it’s missing.” On the technical front, Deutscher finds Chintai’s chart promising. “What I also like from a technical analysis perspective is the fact it’s hovering above this zone, which, if you are technically inclined, you have that technical invalidation,” he said, pointing out the potential for a significant move to previous highs. He remains cautiously optimistic about price targets, emphasizing prudent profit-taking strategies. “I don’t want to get carried away with crazy price targets… I’m never greedy in this market.” Deutscher concludes that Chintai’s combination of regulatory compliance, institutional appeal, and undervalued status makes it a compelling investment. “They can actually attract institutional capital because of the licensing and because of the product they’ve built,” he affirmed. At press time, CHEX traded at $0.2874.

On Tuesday, total trading volume for spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $3 billion, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price briefly above the pivotal $73,000 mark for the first time in over 7 months. Bitcoin ETF Market Set To Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings Soon Notably, crypto investor BigRig observed a remarkable uptick in Bitcoin ETF purchases over the past two weeks, reporting $2.673 billion in inflows since October 16. This accounts for a substantial 11.8% of total ETF inflows during this period, suggesting a robust interest from institutional and retail investors. BigRig also pointed out that, prior to Tuesday’s trading volume, this period represented the best day for ETF inflows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added to the optimistic narrative by stating that US spot ETFs are on track to hold 1 million Bitcoin by next Wednesday, surpassing the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, by mid-December with an average addition of about 17,000 BTC per week. However, Balchunas also cautioned that market volatility could impact these projections. “Anything can happen,” he noted, referencing the possibility of a sudden selloff that could delay the timeline. Conversely, if prices continue to rise and political factors, such as a potential Trump victory in the upcoming election, contribute to increased market enthusiasm, the expert believes that this influx of new investors could accelerate the pace of Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs. Whale Accumulation Spurs Optimism Despite heightened activity in the Bitcoin ETF market, the price of the largest cryptocurrency recently fell short of its all-time high, retracing to approximately $72,250 at the time of writing. However, there are positive indicators for Bitcoin bulls. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating above key support levels, with strong backing around the $66,000 mark. This support has effectively prevented any significant decline over the past week and has contributed to the ongoing rally. However, what would be a notable bullish indicator would be a sustained consolidation above the $70,000 level for the bulls, which could further demonstrate the strength of the current move. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect Market expert Miles Deutscher has been vocal about his bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly in the latter months of the year. He recently pointed out a significant trend: whales—large holders of Bitcoin—are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an “unprecedented pace.” This observation suggests that institutional demand for Bitcoin is currently outpacing retail interest, a shift that could have implications for massive price movements to the upside in the near future. Deutscher further highlighted that Bitcoin exchange reserves have reached all-time lows. This means that the amount of Bitcoin available on exchanges for trading has dwindled, signaling a supply squeeze.

According to crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, Bitcoin’s breakout last week could signal the onset of a major price continuation phase as the bulls aim above the $70,000 mark. Particularly, Van Lagen highlighted that Bitcoin’s ability to successfully retest the upper trendline of this pattern lends strong momentum to the current bullish structure. The descending broadening wedge pattern is a reversal structure in technical analysis, often hinting at a strong trend upon breakout. Bitcoin’s ability to breach the upper trend line reinforces the likelihood of bullish momentum, lending voice to a new all-time high in the coming weeks. Bullish Retest Validates Strong Support For Next Rally At the time of van Lagen’s analysis, the Bitcoin price was retesting a bottom-sloping trend line, which has capped its price rallies since it reached an all-time high of $73,737 in March. By then, Bitcoin had already peaked out of this trend line in the descending broadening wedge and was already on the third candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge – Report As Bitcoin bounced from the upper trend line, van Lagen described this as a “successful bullish retest.” Furthermore, he noted the importance of a bullish trajectory for this pattern, highlighting that the breakout direction is upward 79% of the time. With the Bitcoin price now successfully above this wedge, this next phase could see the cryptocurrency extend its gains and surge above $70,000. As such, the analyst also noted that reaching a new all-time high is essential to fully validating the wave continuation pattern. Key Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch While the breakout and retest offer promising technical signs, van Lagen warned of a critical downside level that traders should monitor. He pinpointed $58,700 as a crucial weekly closing price, below which the bullish structure would be invalidated. In his view, a close below this threshold would disrupt the quick wave five continuation and totally reverse the bullish setup to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens Interestingly, Bitcoin has managed to push to the upside since this breakout. Particularly, the cryptocurrency has extended gains and has now broken above $71,000 for the first time since June. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $71,150, having reached an intraday high of $71,450 in the past 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin is only 3.6% away from reaching uncharted price territories. The only key price resistance level to watch at this point would be the current all-time high. Many Bitcoin metrics point to the continuation of bullish Bitcoin price momentum, at least in the short term. The Bitcoin open interest is now at its highest point of $42.6 billion, which relays a high level of trading activity among Bitcoin traders.

Trump said that Musk would be the head of a proposed department called the Department of Governmental Efficiency or D.O.G.E. for short, an acronym that bears resemblance to Dogecoin. A similarity analysts viewed sparked the price rally. pic.twitter.com/y0UCd5NvMj — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 28, 2024 The Tesla CEO has been making rounds in the country to endorse Trump in his pursuit of getting a second chance at the White House.

He explained that it would generate huge savings for the US government, saying that the new department could trim the annual US budget by $2 trillion.

Charts showed that the price of Dogecoin increased by nearly 15% and traded at $0.157 as the crypto becomes the biggest gainer among the top 100 digital currencies by market cap. According to CoinGecko, Dogecoin has been experiencing a price rally hitting $0.16 on Monday, the highest it has ever been since June. The subtle increase in Dogecoin over the last few weeks coincides with Musk’s continuous involvement in Trump’s quest to get re-elected as US president. After the recent shooting incident against Trump, Dogecoin prices climbed up to a level which is even higher than what it is currently experiencing in relation to D.O.G.E.

At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.165, up 14% and 16.3% in the daily and weekly timeframes.

A “potent mix” of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors has significantly influenced the flagship crypto’s performance, with anticipation for the outcome of the US election and Q4’s close setting a potential target of $80,000 by year-end. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Bitcoin Volatility About To Reach Its Peak Crypto exchange Bitfinex’s recent report shared that Bitcoin’s price could hit $80,000 by the end of the year due to a convergence of geopolitical uncertainty, macroeconomic factors, seasonality, and the increasing influence of the “Trump Trade.” The report noted that, historically, global macroeconomic trends and geopolitics events influenced BTC’s price. As a result, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen its price movements driven by the anticipated US Presidential elections. The potential outcome of the elections, scheduled for next week, has affected Bitcoin’s performance throughout the year. Both presidential candidates have acknowledged the crypto industry, with the Republican candidate Donald Trump becoming the sector’s champion after fully embracing Bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s pro-crypto stance increased the correlation between the Republican candidate’s winning odds and Bitcoin’s trajectory. Moreover, the “Trump Trade” narrative reflects “the market’s view of how BTC will fare dependent on the outcome of the election.” Per the report, this narrative has fueled Bitcoin volatility, with the flagship crypto seeing sharp intra-week corrections before rebounding. Last week, BTC saw a 6.2% pullback toward the $65,000 support zone before reclaiming the $68,000 mark again. Bitfinex analysts consider that this pullback might be the first of several “whipsaw price movements” ahead of the elections, affecting BTC’s short-term price as speculation and volatility increase. Additionally, option premiums and estimated daily volatility for the US stock market and Bitcoin are projected to rise significantly next week. The report noted that BTC volatility will peak between November 6 and November 8, when the Election results are expected to be delivered. Reportedly, the highest implied volatility (IV) is for the November 8 strike price “reaching up to over 100 vol for strike prices over $100,000 for BTC.” BTC Poised To Hit $80,000 In Late December The report noted that Bitcoin has shown strength despite the increasing volatility. The flagship crypto “has remained resilient” and held its ground compared to the September lows, surging around 30% from last month’s drop. Additionally, BTC closed September, which has historically been a challenging month for the cryptocurrency, with a 7.29% increase, the highest closing for the month on record. The crypto exchange’s report predicted that October’s close could be “less impressive” due to the volatility. Nonetheless, Bitfinex analysts suggested that Q4’s historically bullish seasonality will still favor a positive rally for BTC. Market positioning shows that end-of-year options have seen a considerable rise in call open interest over the last few weeks.

But the market seems poised for a post-election surge above March’s $73,666 all-time high (ATH). Lastly, call options with a December 27 expiry and an $80,000 strike price have seen a steady build-up, suggesting that this target could be in reach by year-end. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $71,197, a $3.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

At press time, the world’s most valuable coin is approaching $72,000, a critical resistance level that marks June 2024 highs. Bitcoin Breaks Above $70,000 And Descending Triangle As buyers press on, reversing losses of the second half of last week and soaring to print a three-month high, one analyst has also picked out another crucial development. In a post on X, the technical analyst said not only is the price firm at press time, but the explosion over the last two days means the coin is trading above a descending wedge. Related Reading: Neiro Breaks Above Key Level Following 10% Weekly Drop, Is $0.0020 Next? Technically, based on the analyst’s preview, the coin is within a key breakout formation. Accordingly, it signals that the era of discouraging lower lows, seen in the better part of Q3 2024, could be over as buyers take over. Specifically, the series of lower and lower highs seen since prices retraced from all-time highs is likely over. As it is, buyers are buoyant. According to the CoinMarketCap poll, over 70% of voters think the coin is heading higher. This preview is crucial, considering the importance of hype in the crypto scene. Usually, whenever prices tick higher, traders tend to rush in so as not to miss the leg up by opening leveraged positions on perpetual futures platforms like Binance or Bybit. Meanwhile, the more conservative ones opt to buy at the spot market, aware that though gains could be posted, risks are also mitigated. Is The Post-Halving Advance On? For the uptrend to continue, the analyst said, it is important gains posted on the last two days are confirmed. In this case, a follow-through will see Bitcoin lift off, breaking $72,000 and even $74,000 printed in March 2024. In that event, bulls could have more headroom to march on as the “post-Halving” advance begins. Looking at past cycles, Halving events are always seen as bullish. Prices rallied in the next few months when the network halved its miner rewards in 216 and 2020. Then, Bitcoin rallied to $20,000 in 2017 and $70,000 in 2021.

This renewed interest is reflected in the performance of Popcat (POPCAT), one of the outstanding and best-performing tokens in the Solana memecoin space over the past month. Wintermute Fuels The POPCAT Bullish Trend POPCAT has emerged as a significant winner in the Solana chain in the past week, experiencing a 21% surge. Following a continued uptrend, the token recorded a 13% increase in just 24 hours, reaching a new all-time high of $1.75 on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triggers Golden Cross: What This Means For The Crypto Trend According to data from Nansen, the driving force behind this bullish trend has been a notable increase in buying pressure, largely attributed to market-making trading firm Wintermute, which has played a pivotal role in facilitating buying transactions within the digital asset. However, shortly after hitting its record peak, POPCAT retraced to approximately $1.70, attributed to increased profit-taking by investors, as many sought to capitalize on the recent gains. Nansen’s data indicates a pattern of transfers to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for selling purposes, signaling a typical market behavior following a significant price surge and the achievement of a new record price. One of the key players in these transactions is the crypto exchange Bybit, which has been transferring POPCAT tokens in batches to the US-based exchange Kraken over the past few days. Despite these transfers, Bybit still retains around 63,602 POPCAT coins, valued at approximately $109 million. To avoid a sharp correction and maintain the upward momentum, it will be crucial for the POPCAT bulls to hold key support levels in the coming days, and in particular, to hold and consolidate above the $1.70 level. Key Levels To Watch Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the POPCAT token, the most significant support levels are well below current trading prices, which could lead to significant retracement. Looking at the POPCAT/USDT daily chart, the first support is located at the $1.55 zone, which, if lost, could lead to a further pullback down to the $1.48 support. This could jeopardize most of the token’s gains over the last week, as the loss of these levels could lead to a retest of its next support at $1.37. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect However, it remains to be seen whether the buying pressure seen over the past week can overcome the current profit-taking activity by investors in the token, as a consolidation above $1.70 in the next 72 hours can lead to a significant bullish weekly close.

Key metrics from IntoTheBlock reveal that DOGE network activity has spiked multiple times over the past month, a sign of increased engagement that suggests the meme coin could be primed for more gains. As Bitcoin nears its all-time high, the broader crypto market rally is fueling confidence that DOGE may soon challenge its yearly high of $0.228. Related Reading: Cardano Might See A Massive Pump Around November 18 – Analyst Exposes 2020 Similarities The surge in network activity highlights the growing momentum behind DOGE, as new and seasoned investors show heightened interest in the coin. With traders increasingly active, sentiment around Dogecoin has taken a bullish turn, leading many to anticipate further upside. As excitement builds and BTC’s performance hints at continued strength across the market, DOGE’s momentum could see it set new local highs in the coming weeks. Dogecoin Activity Supporting Price Action Dogecoin has finally made its move, and many analysts believe this rally is just beginning. Recent data from IntoTheBlock reveals a substantial uptick in daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network, with several notable spikes in activity over the past month. This increase in network engagement is often a bullish indicator, signaling rising demand and optimism among traders. As DOGE now tests a critical supply level around $0.18, bulls are focused on maintaining momentum to break through this barrier and ultimately target the yearly high of $0.228. Analysts suggest that a successful breakout above $0.18 could set the stage for Dogecoin’s next significant rally. However, if bulls face resistance at this level, a retrace to lower demand zones could provide the liquidity needed to fuel the next leg up. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details The heightened network activity is a promising signal for the DOGE community, as it indicates that new interest is backing price action. With Bitcoin leading the market higher, Dogecoin could continue to benefit from the current wave of enthusiasm in crypto, positioning it well to challenge new highs. For now, DOGE remains one of the coins to watch closely as it navigates critical resistance, with traders eager to see if it can ride this wave toward new heights. DOGE Price Action Signals Strength Dogecoin is trading at $0.172, following a robust 39% surge after rebounding from its daily 200 moving average (MA) at $0.127. Holding this key indicator as support has signaled renewed long-term strength, underscoring DOGE’s potential for a continuing uptrend. Price action remains resilient, with DOGE holding firmly above the $0.165 level, suggesting that bulls are in control and could drive higher prices. Despite the strong momentum, a healthy retrace to $0.165—or even a lower demand level at $0.15—would support the bullish structure, allowing DOGE to gather the necessary liquidity for another leg up. Holding these levels would position DOGE to push toward its next major target: yearly highs around $0.228. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Fear A Short Squeeze Above $71,000 As Open Interest Rises To $22.6B With bullish sentiment across the crypto market and DOGE showing solid technical indicators, many analysts view these price levels as potential stepping stones for another rally. Traders and investors will closely watch for signs of strength or a pullback as DOGE prepares for its next test.
