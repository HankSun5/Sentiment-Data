[20x Potential],” prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher unveiled Chintai (CHEX) as his latest high-conviction investment within the Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Deutscher believes Chintai could offer significant upside potential—up to 1,900% (20x)—in the upcoming market cycle. Deutscher has consistently highlighted RWA tokens as one of his top investment narratives, ranking third behind memecoins and AI for this crypto bull run. “When I look at narratives that can actually change the fabric of crypto and really offer a new value add, I think RWA is massive,” he stated. He emphasized the growing appeal of on-chain treasury yields, especially as traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) yields diminish and interest rates decline. The analyst previously capitalized on early investments in ONDO and Mantra (OM), both of which have seen substantial gains. ONDO, for instance, delivered a 7x return from his initial entry point. However, Deutscher now considers these assets to be reaching overvalued territories. “Valuation-wise, though, it’s pretty insane considering the fact that its market cap’s a billion, but it’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $7.1 billion,” he said regarding ONDO. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‘True Time To Sell It All’: Here’s When Deutscher has been reallocating his capital into what he perceives as undervalued opportunities within the RWA space. Alongside Clearpool (CPOOL), which he mentioned has already gained 42% since his initial disclosure, Chintai (CHEX) stands out as his newest and largest RWA position. “This one I’m also really, really bullish on. It’s tough for me to say if I’m most bullish on this, but it might be the one that I’m most bullish on in the RWA sector,” he remarked. Chintai differentiates itself by being one of the few RWA-focused layer-one blockchains regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). “If you know Singapore, they are so strict with due diligence. It’s really hard to get a license; they fought for a license and they’ve got it,” Deutscher noted. This regulatory approval positions Chintai to attract significant institutional capital, potentially channeling billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL) onto their chain. The analyst highlighted Chintai’s robust fundamentals, including its extensive list of major clients and partnerships, such as DHC, Finstable, and Greengate. “They are basically a marketplace for tokenization, an L1 blockchain for RWA tokenization,” he explained. The platform has already facilitated over $630 million worth of loans and is set to launch “OZEAN,” a blockchain for RWA yield supported by Optimism, early next year. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run From a valuation perspective, Deutscher sees substantial upside potential. Chintai currently has an FDV of approximately $250 million, significantly lower than Mantra’s $1.37 billion FDV. “If CHEX—even in a static market without the market growing at all—does a 6x, that’s just now matching Mantra,” he calculated. Considering the potential growth of the RWA market, the upside could be even more pronounced. “What if the RWA market 2x’s? Because I think it’s going to be a very strong narrative next year; then you could be looking at a 14x.” Despite its strong fundamentals, Deutscher acknowledges that Chintai’s lower valuation compared to its peers is largely due to a lack of market awareness. “Why is there that discrepancy despite the fundamentals being just as, if not more strong, for Chintai? Just marketing,” he observed. Mantra has excelled in marketing efforts, attracting considerable attention in the crypto community. “Once Chintai can improve its awareness—and I’m actually giving it more awareness by making this video—that is the only key that it’s missing.” On the technical front, Deutscher finds Chintai’s chart promising. “What I also like from a technical analysis perspective is the fact it’s hovering above this zone, which, if you are technically inclined, you have that technical invalidation,” he said, pointing out the potential for a significant move to previous highs. He remains cautiously optimistic about price targets, emphasizing prudent profit-taking strategies. “I don’t want to get carried away with crazy price targets… I’m never greedy in this market.” Deutscher concludes that Chintai’s combination of regulatory compliance, institutional appeal, and undervalued status makes it a compelling investment. “They can actually attract institutional capital because of the licensing and because of the product they’ve built,” he affirmed. At press time, CHEX traded at $0.2874.

On Tuesday, total trading volume for spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $3 billion, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price briefly above the pivotal $73,000 mark for the first time in over 7 months. Bitcoin ETF Market Set To Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings Soon Notably, crypto investor BigRig observed a remarkable uptick in Bitcoin ETF purchases over the past two weeks, reporting $2.673 billion in inflows since October 16. This accounts for a substantial 11.8% of total ETF inflows during this period, suggesting a robust interest from institutional and retail investors. BigRig also pointed out that, prior to Tuesday’s trading volume, this period represented the best day for ETF inflows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added to the optimistic narrative by stating that US spot ETFs are on track to hold 1 million Bitcoin by next Wednesday, surpassing the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, by mid-December with an average addition of about 17,000 BTC per week. However, Balchunas also cautioned that market volatility could impact these projections. “Anything can happen,” he noted, referencing the possibility of a sudden selloff that could delay the timeline. Conversely, if prices continue to rise and political factors, such as a potential Trump victory in the upcoming election, contribute to increased market enthusiasm, the expert believes that this influx of new investors could accelerate the pace of Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs. Whale Accumulation Spurs Optimism Despite heightened activity in the Bitcoin ETF market, the price of the largest cryptocurrency recently fell short of its all-time high, retracing to approximately $72,250 at the time of writing. However, there are positive indicators for Bitcoin bulls. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating above key support levels, with strong backing around the $66,000 mark. This support has effectively prevented any significant decline over the past week and has contributed to the ongoing rally. However, what would be a notable bullish indicator would be a sustained consolidation above the $70,000 level for the bulls, which could further demonstrate the strength of the current move. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect Market expert Miles Deutscher has been vocal about his bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly in the latter months of the year. He recently pointed out a significant trend: whales—large holders of Bitcoin—are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an “unprecedented pace.” This observation suggests that institutional demand for Bitcoin is currently outpacing retail interest, a shift that could have implications for massive price movements to the upside in the near future. Deutscher further highlighted that Bitcoin exchange reserves have reached all-time lows. This means that the amount of Bitcoin available on exchanges for trading has dwindled, signaling a supply squeeze.

According to crypto analyst Gert van Lagen, Bitcoin’s breakout last week could signal the onset of a major price continuation phase as the bulls aim above the $70,000 mark. Particularly, Van Lagen highlighted that Bitcoin’s ability to successfully retest the upper trendline of this pattern lends strong momentum to the current bullish structure. The descending broadening wedge pattern is a reversal structure in technical analysis, often hinting at a strong trend upon breakout. Bitcoin’s ability to breach the upper trend line reinforces the likelihood of bullish momentum, lending voice to a new all-time high in the coming weeks. Bullish Retest Validates Strong Support For Next Rally At the time of van Lagen’s analysis, the Bitcoin price was retesting a bottom-sloping trend line, which has capped its price rallies since it reached an all-time high of $73,737 in March. By then, Bitcoin had already peaked out of this trend line in the descending broadening wedge and was already on the third candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Reach $3 Billion Inflows In October, Retail Investors Lead The Charge – Report As Bitcoin bounced from the upper trend line, van Lagen described this as a “successful bullish retest.” Furthermore, he noted the importance of a bullish trajectory for this pattern, highlighting that the breakout direction is upward 79% of the time. With the Bitcoin price now successfully above this wedge, this next phase could see the cryptocurrency extend its gains and surge above $70,000. As such, the analyst also noted that reaching a new all-time high is essential to fully validating the wave continuation pattern. Key Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch While the breakout and retest offer promising technical signs, van Lagen warned of a critical downside level that traders should monitor. He pinpointed $58,700 as a crucial weekly closing price, below which the bullish structure would be invalidated. In his view, a close below this threshold would disrupt the quick wave five continuation and totally reverse the bullish setup to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $24? Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens Interestingly, Bitcoin has managed to push to the upside since this breakout. Particularly, the cryptocurrency has extended gains and has now broken above $71,000 for the first time since June. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $71,150, having reached an intraday high of $71,450 in the past 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin is only 3.6% away from reaching uncharted price territories. The only key price resistance level to watch at this point would be the current all-time high. Many Bitcoin metrics point to the continuation of bullish Bitcoin price momentum, at least in the short term. The Bitcoin open interest is now at its highest point of $42.6 billion, which relays a high level of trading activity among Bitcoin traders.

Trump said that Musk would be the head of a proposed department called the Department of Governmental Efficiency or D.O.G.E. for short, an acronym that bears resemblance to Dogecoin.

He explained that it would generate huge savings for the US government, saying that the new department could trim the annual US budget by $2 trillion.

According to CoinGecko, Dogecoin has been experiencing a price rally hitting $0.16 on Monday, the highest it has ever been since June. The subtle increase in Dogecoin over the last few weeks coincides with Musk’s continuous involvement in Trump’s quest to get re-elected as US president. After the recent shooting incident against Trump, Dogecoin prices climbed up to a level which is even higher than what it is currently experiencing in relation to D.O.G.E.

At the time of writing, DOGE was trading at $0.165, up 14% and 16.3% in the daily and weekly timeframes.
