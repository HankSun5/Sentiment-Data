53553924,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87353,1761257119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Investors: $5 is the First Move of Many on the Next Impulse,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-5-is-the-first-move-of-many-on-the-next-impulse/,"A quiet but powerful sentiment is spreading across the XRP community, one that suggests the digital asset may be preparing for its next major rally. After months of sideways movement and fading momentum, analysts are beginning to see signs of life returning to XRP’s long-term structure. Among them is respected market analyst ChartNerd, who believes XRP could be on the brink of a significant bullish impulse, with $5 serving as just the opening move. Technical Structure: A Channel That Holds the Key On the weekly timeframe, XRP’s price has been oscillating within an ascending parallel channel, a formation that typically precedes extended bullish runs once resistance is decisively broken. Each test of the lower boundary has seen buyers defend key levels, while the upper trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance. This consistent price symmetry has created a well-defined roadmap: a sustained rebound from current support zones could set the stage for a breakout toward higher highs. At present, XRP trades near the lower region of this structure, around $2.40, hinting at a potential pivot point. The channel’s upper boundary, near $4.50 to $5.00, aligns perfectly with the analyst’s projected short-term target. $XRP is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the horizon. Channel support awaits below, with HLs on the weekly MACD, and SRSI levels in oversold territory. $5 is the first move of many on the next impulse. I believe XRP will front-run within the bluechips category – #NFA pic.twitter.com/uCtPmOb2wz — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 23, 2025 Momentum Shifts: Weekly MACD and Stochastic RSI Align Beyond the visible channel, momentum indicators are flashing encouraging signals. The weekly MACD histogram, which tracks trend strength, has been printing a series of higher lows, a classic bullish divergence that often precedes upward reversals. This suggests that bearish momentum is weakening, even as prices hover near support. Supporting this outlook, the Stochastic RSI (SRSI) has entered deeply oversold territory, an area that typically marks exhaustion among sellers. When both the MACD and SRSI align in this manner, it strengthens the case for a medium- to long-term reversal, precisely the foundation of ChartNerd’s bullish thesis. Market Context: The “Blue-Chip” Advantage XRP’s position among top-tier digital assets gives it an advantage as broader market cycles turn. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue leading the market’s next macro leg, XRP, often categorized as a blue-chip altcoin, could front-run its peers in performance, benefiting from renewed liquidity and investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This possibility becomes even more compelling when coupled with Ripple’s ongoing real-world integrations and adoption of RLUSD, the company’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. These developments strengthen the network’s utility narrative, giving technical setups stronger fundamental backing. The $5 Target: A Launchpad, Not a Ceiling ChartNerd’s analysis underscores that $5 is not the destination but the beginning of a broader impulsive wave. The move, if validated by volume and confirmed breakout patterns, could reestablish XRP as a leading performer in the digital asset market. Still, traders must remain cautious: while technical signals are aligning, execution depends on market sentiment, regulatory stability, and macroeconomic conditions. Technicals Hint, Market Confirms The convergence of technical and momentum factors paints a promising picture for XRP. With channel support intact, momentum indicators turning upward, and broader market structure improving, the stage appears set for a potential rally. As ChartNerd’s analysis suggests, $5 could be only the first step, an opening act in what might become a defining move for XRP in the next market cycle. In a space driven by sentiment and structure alike, XRP’s chart is quietly sending a message: the next impulse might be closer than it seems .

53554188,https://cryptonews.com/?p=442805,1761257767,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53554188.jpeg,China Is Third-Largest Contributor To Global Bitcoin Mining: Why It Matters,https://cryptonews.com/news/china-is-third-largest-contributor-to-global-bitcoin-mining-why-it-matters/,"China was once the undisputed center for Bitcoin mining. Known for its cheap power and access to leading hardware manufacturers, all of this positioned China as a leader in global Bitcoin mining. However, this changed when mining was banned by the Chinese government in 2021 . In late September 2021, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) further banned all cryptocurrency transactions. The PBOC cited the role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating financial crime as well as posing a growing risk to China’s financial system. Fast-forward to today—despite the government’s strong efforts to weed out all crypto miners, many have found ways to continue operations . According to the Q4 2025 update of Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map , China currently accounts for 14.05% of Bitcoin’s total compute power, or roughly 145 exahashes per second (EH/s). This is a modest rise from 13.8% in Q3. Source: Luxor China Leads in Global Bitcoin Mining Kaan Farahani, research associate at Luxor, told Cryptonews that Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map estimates the geographic distribution of Bitcoin mining activity across the world. “The map provides weighted hashrate concentration across regions by incorporating mining pool data, ASIC trading flows, and firmware adoption trends,” Farahani said. Based on the recent data, China is the third-largest contributor globally to Bitcoin mining , just behind the U.S. and Russia. Luxor’s findings do not show where specifically the hashrate resides. According to Miner Weekly , multiple sources across the ASIC supply chain have pointed to one possible destination, which is Xinjiang. The region’s relative isolation and abundant energy resources have made it a longtime hub for Bitcoin mining before China’s ban in 2021. China Reveals Underground Bitcoin Mining Operations While China’s continuation of Bitcoin mining may not come as a complete shock, this illustrates the murky, underground nature of the mining industry. Kent Halliburton, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin mining platform Sazmining, told Cryptonews that he is not surprised to see mining still occurring in China. “This is one of the beauties of Bitcoin mining. It’s a cypherpunk way to generate Bitcoin, meaning that as long as you have electricity and hardware, you can generate Bitcoin for yourself. It’s tough to shut down mining on the outskirts, and that is why I believe the hashrate we see in China continues to exist,” Halliburton said. Other regions where Bitcoin mining is considered illegal are also showing signs of growth. For example, Farahani noted that Luxor’s Hashrate Map gives insight into Iran, estimating that around 8 EH/s of hashrate is operational in the region as of Q4-2025. This represents 0.75% of global market share. According to Halliburton, Iran is another good example of where Bitcoin mining has been occurring, but has largely been illegal . Iran initially banned Bitcoin mining in May of 2021 for four months. The region’s second ban took place in December 2021. Prior to this, Iran’s bitcoin mining was estimated to make up between 4% and 8% of the global BTC network. “Essentially, any country with stringent controls on capital outflows is likely to restrict or attempt to ban Bitcoin mining,” Halliburton said. “But if you have power, you can generate Bitcoin as long as you have the right hardware to harness it. That means that if you’re trying to stem the flow of capital from leaving your country, you have a way to do that with Bitcoin mining.” China’s Concerning Mining Infrastructure Empire In addition to mining, recent findings from Bitcoin solutions manufacturer Auradine found that over 95% of Bitcoin ASIC mining equipment is manufactured by Chinese firms like Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan. Auradine’s report notes that Chinese equipment manufacturing poses a major threat to U.S. national security and key infrastructure. Sanjay Gupta, chief strategy officer at Auradine, told Cryptonews that China’s mining infrastructure operations are concerning for a number of reasons. For instance, he mentioned that there are over a million Chinese-based Bitcoin mining machines with foreign firmware connected to the U.S. electrical grid. “This poses a potential serious cybersecurity risk to the electrical grid across multiple states,” Gupta said. “If there is embedded software in these Chinese miners that is triggered for a coordinated cyber attack to drive a large number of miners to simultaneously go in rapid over- or underdrive, this could cause a catastrophic failure of the U.S. electrical grid.” And they would have gotten away with it too, if not for President Xi and President Putin. China, Russia and co-operative nations within BRICS have enough control over BTC mining repositories to bring Bitcoin to ZERO. The U.S. will not get away with this. pic.twitter.com/Ylx81nBFw0 — Inevitable China (@InevitableChina) September 8, 2025 Gupta added that the BTC mining hardware supply being highly concentrated poses a major risk of a potential 51% takeover of the bitcoin protocol in a hostile geopolitical situation. This has become even more of a threat with the recent tariffs imposed on China by President Trump, which could rise to 155% in the coming weeks . “This could cause a dramatic impact on the value of BTC and ripple effect in financial markets,” Gupta remarked. Is China A Threat To Bitcoin Miners? It’s clear that Bitcoin mining and manufacturing continue to take place in China despite bans. So what does this mean for miners based in regions where BTC mining is considered legal? According to Farahani, Luxor is unaware of challenges or threats based on China’s mining operations. On the other hand, Gupta believes that Chinese firms supplying mining equipment will create complexities for other regions. “To combat this, we need to enable strong U.S.-based Bitcoin mining suppliers that can drive continuous innovation and performance for mining operations,” he said. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China are having a significant and costly impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. According to a new report from The Miner Mag, rising tariffs on mining equipment have exposed American companies to substantial financial liabilities.… — Dr Martin Hiesboeck (@MHiesboeck) August 21, 2025 Gupta added that moving forward, Bitcoin miners should have technology that allows energy demand response with the ability to rapidly increase or decrease power consumption based on the needs of a state or region’s electrical grid. In the meantime, the architecture and legacy of mining in China will likely continue to loom over the global network. In crypto’s ever‑shifting world, China isn’t gone—but rather simply operating in the margins.

Polymarket Bettors Place Bets On CZ’s Potential Binance Return In a poll on Polymarket’s website labeled “Will CZ return to Binance by December 31,” odds that Zhao would return to the crypto exchange shot up to 82%.

However, by Friday evening, the poll showed Zhao’s odds of returning to the crypto organization stabilizing around 36%. Donald Trump Pardons CZ, Former Binance CEO Teases Book Reports emerged on Thursday morning that Trump had decided to pardon Zhao after the former Binance CEO pled guilty to money laundering violations at the crypto exchange back in 2023. As part of the resolution , Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines. “President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she added. Following the news, Zhao took to X on Thursday morning to share his gratitude for receiving clemency and thank his supporters for “congratulatory messages.” Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.

This year’s “Uptober” rally came to an abrupt end after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a decision that sent shockwaves through global markets and triggered one of the steepest single-day declines in the crypto sector in months. As the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting draws closer, traders are adopting a wait-and-see approach, seeking clues about potential monetary easing that could help revive risk-friendly investors. Crypto believers, however, interpret the current correction as a healthy reset. Historically, deep market pullbacks eliminate excessive leverage and speculative positions, creating the foundation for more sustainable long-term rallies. World Liberty Financial (WLFI): ChatGPT Predicts the President’s Crypto Could Rise to Match his Favourite Fiat Currency World Liberty Financial ($WLFI) is President Trump’s crypto play, and it seeks to demonstrate what decentralized finance can achieve by merging innovation, governance, and freedom in a single ecosystem. Source: ChatGPT With Presidential backing and bold ambitions, WLFI empowers users to participate in a transparent, community-driven financial network designed for real-world impact. Built on Ethereum using the Aave protocol, details of the project are closely guarded, but we know that it is likely to facilitate lending to institutions and everyday users while likely aiming to play a big part in stablecoins should the technology take off, as it’s widely expected to do. WLFI hasn’t been out long enough to have lots of data about its trends, but it’s currently the 41st biggest crypto on the market with a capitalization of $3.8 billion. WLFI is interesting because it is a demonstration of how Trump’s business interests align with crypto. This could act as a positive catalyst in spurring legislation to arrive quicker, as US crypto companies still await needed clarity on how they should act. Should that happen, then WLFI could conceivably rise to the cost of $1, maybe not in the one week left of the month, but by Christmas. Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Powerhouse Could Double in a Week, Predicts ChatGPT Aave ($AAVE) remains a powerhouse in decentralized finance, offering users the ability to lend, borrow, and earn passive income through an intuitive and secure protocol. Its trailblazing feature suite includes flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain support, all of which have made AAVE a cornerstone of the DeFi revolution. With continual innovation, strong community governance, and growing institutional adoption, Aave isn’t just keeping pace with the future of finance; it’s one of the early builders. ChatGPT sees the price of Aave could leap from $227 to $500. Given the short notice, only a seriously big announcement could make Aave rise that high. However, Aave has entered a technical setup that looks like an expanding triangle. If this triangle is confirmed by continued upward movement (Aave rose 4% in the last 24 hours), then Aave could easily hit the $500 stretch target any time between here and the New Year. Sui Network: Can This Altcoin Surpass Ethereum and Cardano? Sui Network ($SUI) continues to attract attention as one of the more promising altcoins, presenting itself as a blockchain that surpasses Ethereum’s performance. Although claims of being an “Ethereum killer” often depend on perspective and use case, Sui’s biggest edge lies in its speed. The network reportedly processes up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), dwarfing Ethereum’s average throughput of around 15 TPS. Over the past 24 hours, Sui has climbed 3%, reaching $2.50. According to ChatGPT’s projections, the coin could maintain steady momentum with a measured target of $5 by the New Year. This growth outlook is thanks to Sui’s advanced smart contract framework, impressive scalability, and focus on cross-chain interoperability. Should the broader market re-enter a bull phase, as many anticipate, Sui could realistically achieve the $10 mark by Christmas. Technical indicators reinforce this view, with the token breaking out of a bullish flag pattern that formed between January and late March, typically a sign of sustained upward potential. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI) Finally, A fresh contender in the meme coin scene Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is already gaining serious traction despite not hitting exchanges yet. Its presale phase has attracted over $3.7 million in early investments from traders looking to catch the next viral crypto phenomenon. Dogecoin’s risk-mainlining cousin, Maxi Doge, offers community-driven degeneracy with a narrative that is captivating meme coin volatility surfers. Launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, MAXI promises faster, more affordable, and environmentally conscious transactions than Dogecoin. It promotes itself through lively Telegram and Discord communities, delivering trading contests and influencer partnerships to build early momentum. Out of its total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” which will finance marketing efforts, ecosystem expansion, and future collaborations. Staking is already available, offering returns as high as 82% APY, though this yield will gradually decrease as more participants join. Currently priced at $0.0002645 in the presale, MAXI’s value is set to rise incrementally with each funding round. You can purchase tokens using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Within days, markets crashed hard after President Trump declared a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting investors to adopt a risk-off stance ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Even so, several analysts interpret this retracement as a healthy consolidation phase, flushing out excess leverage and weak hands before a more sustained climb. Here are three standout altcoins showing significant upside potential. Hyperliquid: The DEX Creating a New Class of Crypto Millionaires Introduced late last year, Hyperliquid and its native $HYPE token have rapidly emerged as a top contender in the decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. Operating on its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid prioritizes transparency and transaction efficiency. Unlike centralized exchanges, it allows users to maintain full custody of their assets, a feature that has gained prominence since the collapse of CEX giants such as FTX. With minimal trading fees, lightning-fast order execution, and advanced features like perpetual derivatives, Hyperliquid successfully blends the convenience of centralized platforms with the trustless nature of DEXs. Price action since launch shows robust bullish trends. Two bullish flag formations appeared between late winter and early spring, patterns often preceding substantial price rallies. Between early April and May 26, HYPE’s price skyrocketed from roughly $10 to $40, a fourfold increase. The chart also displays multiple cup-and-handle formations, indicating persistent accumulation from major investors. Now HYPE’s support and resistance lines since then have entered an expanding channel, which gives HYPE plenty of potential for a rapid bounce. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Strongest Competitor and This Week’s Top Performer Solana ($SOL) continues to solidify its standing as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. With a market capitalization surpassing $104 billion and over $11 billion locked across its DeFi protocols, Solana’s ecosystem expansion remains impressive. Market participants are closely monitoring prospects for U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional capital inflows similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF effects. After bottoming near $100 in April, SOL now trades close to $191. Growing regulatory clarity has boosted confidence, while technical readings, including an RSI of 44, a 4% gain in 24 hours, and moving to converge with its 30-day moving average, indicate that SOL may be undervalued at current prices and is likely to rise going into the weekend. Key support lies around $150, with heavy resistance at $250. A decisive breakout above this resistance could propel SOL toward its all-time high of $293.31, or even above $500 if a full-scale bull market develops. Ripple (XRP): The 2025 Leader in Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , serves as the foundation of a payment network known for ultra-fast transactions and minimal fees, offering a modern alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Supported by the UN Capital Development Fund and linked with several major U.S. financial institutions, XRP has climbed to become the third-largest crypto asset by market value, standing at approximately $144.3 billion. Ripple’s introduction of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, highlights its intention to capture a portion of the expanding stablecoin market. Over the past year, XRP has surged 357%, reaching a seven-year peak of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% gain over the same timeframe. With an RSI around 39 and trading below its 30-day moving average, XRP appears primed for another move upward. Technical indicators also show two bullish flag formations during the summer months, pointing to further growth potential if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto legislation could push XRP toward the $5–$10 range. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The 2025 Meme Coin Revolutionizing Bitcoin’s Potential Finally, one that’s too early-stage to be listed on exchanges: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has rapidly become one of the most discussed presales of 2025. Designed to amplify Bitcoin’s scalability and speed through a Layer-2 infrastructure, it delivers lightning-fast and cost-efficient transfers, packaged in a meme coin format. The project incorporates decentralized governance through a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and exceptional transaction throughput on its custom-built Layer-2 framework. With over $24.6 million raised in presale funding, analysts project potential 10x or higher returns after launch. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s network features a streamlined Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, full dApp compatibility, and built-in meme coin integrations. Additionally, a recent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels essential ecosystem functions, including staking, governance, and transaction processing, rewarding early participants with staking yields reaching 48% APY.

53555289,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=843839,1761259588,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53555289.jpeg,Luxury automaker Porsche reverses EV strategy amid weak China demand,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/luxury-automaker-porsche-changes-ev-strategy/,"Porsche is pulling back from its electric vehicle plans, thanks to weak demand in China amid a frenzy in a crowded market that has erased almost two-thirds of its stock value since May 2023. The luxury carmaker is cutting investment in battery-powered models and redirecting funds toward petrol and hybrid engines, according to the Financial Times . The change will be led by Michael Leiters, who takes over as Porsche’s new chief executive in January. Leiters has never been shy about his doubts over electric cars. “The technology isn’t ready,” he told the Financial Times last year while still running McLaren. He argued that EVs don’t offer the emotional thrill of traditional engines and lose value much faster. Leiters began his career at Porsche two decades ago as an assistant to a former CEO before moving to Ferrari as chief technology officer and then to McLaren as its top executive. Now he’s returning to the company that trained him, with the task of undoing years of overly ambitious electric planning. Leiters takes charge as Porsche faces pressure in China and the U.S. Leiters replaces Oliver Blume, who managed Porsche while also running Volkswagen. That dual role looked efficient when profits were strong, but after a series of warnings this year, it’s clear the brand needs a full-time leader. Automotive analyst Stephen Reitman from Bernstein said Porsche cut its 2025 operating margin forecast from 14 percent to just 0–2 percent. The company still targets 10–15 percent in the midterm, but Reitman warned it will “take some time before we even get to that.” The brand’s biggest problem is China. Sales there, once a key growth engine, have plunged nearly 40 percent since 2022 as local carmakers flooded the luxury EV segment. The U.S. market hasn’t been kinder. New tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump will now hit every Porsche vehicle imported from Europe, since the company has no American factories. That extra cost threatens to squeeze profits even further, worsening its dependence on Europe and shrinking global margins. Inside its factories, the pain is already visible. Porsche confirmed earlier this year that it will cut 3,900 jobs — about 9 percent of its workforce — by 2029. Talks with labor unions are ongoing as it seeks more cost reductions. On the technology side, Sajjad Khan, board member for IT and software, said the company is fixing persistent EV delays caused by software problems. “We have to work hard to execute perfectly,” Khan said, adding that improvements in quality and reliability should arrive by 2026 or 2027. Porsche cancels new SUV and revives gas engines amid restructuring As part of the overhaul, Porsche has canceled its upcoming all-electric SUV and booked an impairment charge of €1.8 billion for related development costs. It’s also reversing a previous decision to stop building petrol or hybrid versions of its top sellers, the Macan and Cayman. Analysts see this as an admission that the EV rollout under Blume went too far. Metzler Research analyst Pal Skirta said Porsche had been “too bullish” on electrification after the Dieselgate scandal and is now paying for it. Even with sales accounting for just 3.6 percent of Volkswagen’s total deliveries over the past three years, Porsche generated nearly 30 percent of the parent group’s operating profit. That made it one of VW’s most valuable divisions. But the collapse in demand, combined with software delays and China losses, has damaged that reputation. Leiters now faces the hard job of keeping Porsche’s high-end status intact while boosting output.His old company, Ferrari, thrives on limited production and exclusivity, a model Porsche can’t easily copy while chasing growth. And while this renewed focus on fuel engines might help short-term profits, it risks putting the company behind in the electric race again. Skirta warned that “they will focus again too much on combustion engine vehicles, and then we’ll lose the EV race in the long run.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|Porsche,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 22:46:28

53555403,612386,1761260403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53555403.jpeg,Ethereum Netflow Turns Positive: Binance May Be Leading the Selling Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-netflow-turns-positive-binance-selling/,"Ethereum is once again under pressure, struggling to find the strength to reclaim the $4,000 level amid growing uncertainty across the crypto market. Investor sentiment has turned increasingly cautious, with mixed opinions emerging among analysts — some warning that a bear market may be taking shape, while others believe this correction could precede a massive rally in the coming weeks. According to CryptoQuant insights, the latest on-chain data reveals a notable shift in Ethereum’s exchange activity that could shape short-term price dynamics. Despite the recent decline in ETH’s price, the 7-day moving average of Exchange Netflow (Total) has transitioned from heavy outflows to inflows — climbing from approximately -57,000 ETH on October 16th to +7,000 ETH recently. This shift suggests that more ETH is now moving onto exchanges, potentially signaling rising selling pressure as traders prepare to offload assets amid volatility. Historically, such inflow spikes have often preceded short-term pullbacks, especially when accompanied by negative market sentiment. However, some analysts caution that this could also reflect whale repositioning or liquidity management, not outright distribution. Ethereum Exchange Inflows Spike as Binance Activity Signals Caution According to CryptoOnchain’s latest analysis on CryptoQuant, Binance appears to be playing a major role in Ethereum’s recent exchange flow dynamics. Data shows that Binance’s 7-day netflow has shifted dramatically — moving from approximately -31,000 ETH on October 15th to +3,000 ETH in recent days. This single exchange accounts for nearly 50% of the total shift observed across all major trading platforms, underscoring its significant influence on Ethereum’s short-term liquidity landscape. This sudden and pronounced rise in ETH deposits onto exchanges — particularly during a period of price weakness — is typically seen as a bearish short-term signal. When traders or institutional holders transfer coins from private wallets to exchanges, it often suggests a readiness to sell or reposition in anticipation of further downside. As a result, the increased on-exchange supply could add selling liquidity, making it easier for large sell orders to impact price action more sharply. However, analysts also caution against interpreting this move too narrowly. While exchange inflows often precede selling pressure, they can also reflect strategic hedging, collateral deposits for derivatives trading, or liquidity management during periods of market stress. Still, when combined with the broader macro uncertainty and Ethereum’s struggle to stay above key technical levels, this data reinforces the cautious tone prevailing across the market. If inflows persist and Ethereum fails to defend support near $3,800–$3,700, downside risk could intensify. Conversely, a quick reversal back to outflows would signal renewed investor confidence and potentially set the stage for a stronger recovery. ETH Holding Key Support Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is currently trading around $3,880, holding slightly above a key short-term support zone near $3,700–$3,750, as shown in the 3-day chart. The recent retracement has brought ETH back toward the 50-day moving average, which now acts as an important line of defense for bulls. After failing to break and hold above the $4,400 level earlier this month, Ethereum entered a corrective phase that mirrors the broader weakness in the altcoin market. Price structure shows lower highs forming since the local top, indicating fading momentum. However, as long as ETH stays above the 100-day moving average near $3,400, the broader uptrend remains technically intact. If the current support holds, Ethereum could attempt another recovery toward $4,000–$4,200, where heavy resistance and previous liquidity clusters are located. A confirmed close above this zone would signal renewed strength and potentially mark the end of this correction phase. On the downside, a decisive breakdown below $3,700 could expose ETH to deeper losses, targeting $3,400 and possibly $3,000, where stronger historical demand lies. For now, Ethereum’s price action remains at a pivotal point — balancing between short-term weakness and the potential for a mid-term recovery.

Dogecoin has spent the past few days trading within a tight range between $0.18 and $0.20, showing a slight increase in trading activity compared to last week. Although the price action has been mostly subdued, a new technical analysis suggests that a significant reversal could soon be underway, one that may send the Dogecoin price surging to at least $0.5 once momentum returns to the market. Dogecoin In The Lower Band Of Its Long-Term Channel Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s macro price chart shows the king of meme coins is now trading at a historical bullish momentum low. This analysis, which was posted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst EtherNasyonaL, looks at Dogecoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Surge, But Buy DOGE Under These Levels The analysis shows that Dogecoin is currently trading within a well-defined ascending channel that goes as far back as when it was created. As it stands, Dogecoin is now trading around the lower boundary of this channel. The flash crash earlier in the month created a downward wick that bounced off a confluence of supports right on this trendline. This long-term structure reveals a consistent pattern of Dogecoin bouncing back each time it reaches this lower band, with previous reversals leading to exponential rallies. The current setup mirrors the same early stages of recovery seen before the 2021 breakout that sent the Dogecoin price from below $0.1 to above $0.70. EtherNasyonaL explained that Dogecoin’s momentum has now reached “historical lows,” with the Stochastic RSI confirming a bottoming phase similar to those seen before previous bull runs. Furthermore, the analyst described this period as a phase of “quiet, calm, yet determined recovery,” meaning that the market is gradually regaining strength beneath the surface. Historical Bottom Means Price Bounce The momentum oscillator displayed in EtherNasyonaL’s chart supports this outlook. The Stochastic RSI, which tracks the rate of change in momentum, is at its lowest level, even lower than before Dogecoin’s rally in 2021. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could be entering the same type of accumulation phase that set the stage for its 2020/2021 rally. Related Reading: What Happens To The Dogecoin Price If The Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $65,000? This view is further supported by the positioning of the price within the ascending channel. With Dogecoin currently trading around the lower range, it effectively sets a technical foundation for another upward leg. Should Dogecoin follow its established pattern, a rebound toward the midline of the channel would place its price at least at $0.5. A continued move upward would see Dogecoin break into new all-time highs above $0.9 and $1 in conservative projections. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1945, having increased by 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

On Tuesday, the fund recorded almost $477 million in net gains with a big improvement in sentiment from institutional investors. This rebound comes as optimism mounts for a general market recovery before year-end. Analysts believe the slowdown in ETF redemptions signals the early stages of a new Q4 rotation, where capital will move from Bitcoin into high-performing altcoins. As Bitcoin is nearing $113,000, attention is shifting towards DOGE, TRON, and LINK, as they are now ranked among the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next rally . Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting the attention of investors who are seeking strong returns and utility-backed growth before the major uptrend starting in 2025. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Ease as Market Stabilizes Fresh data from SoSoValue shows that nine of twelve U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows on Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT was the largest investor with $210 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $162 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $34 million. These inflows were a clear reversal after more than $1 billion in outflows the previous week. October’s total net inflows have now exceeded $4 billion and have already surpassed the performance of September. Analysts note that this turnaround is due to increasing confidence from institutional and retail investors. Historically, such rebounds are often followed by powerful rotations to altcoins as the liquidity trickles down the market. With the volatility subsiding, traders are now looking at the fourth quarter as a window to find the best crypto to buy before the prices soar again. DOGE Gains Retail Momentum Again Dogecoin (DOGE) is still gaining ground as more companies seek to integrate it with mainstream services. Thumzup Media announced plans for DOGE for micro-payments in its advertising reward platform, and reduced transaction fees and enhanced accessibility globally. Separately, the House of Doge recently took majority ownership in Italian football club U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918, in what was one of the first major crossovers between cryptocurrency and professional sports. These developments are leading to renewed excitement in DOGE’s global community. Analysts believe DOGE’s visibility and growing real-world use will enhance its cause as one of the best crypto to buy before the Q4 rotation picks up steam. TRON Shows Network Strength and Expanding Reach TRON (TRX) continues to strengthen its dominance in the blockchain space with new integrations and records on-chain. The collaboration with Avail enables the network to provide direct interoperability with over ten blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. TRON processes more than $23 billion in daily USDT transfers, with a total supply of more than $77 billion. Its market capitalization climbed 19% in the third quarter to $31.6 billion, with network revenue growing 30% to hit a record $1.2 billion, according to Messar i. Speculation regarding a Coinbase listing has had a further positive impact. Analysts claim that TRON’s robust fundamentals and expanding revenue base make it one of the top cryptos to buy in the face of the Q4 rotation. Source: Messari LINK Attracts Institutional Interest as Whales Accumulate Chainlink (LINK) is displaying renewed confidence from big investors after experiencing a volatile month. Wallets that hold between 100,000 and one million tokens added over 12 million LINK just in recent days. This sharp increase in holdings is a signal of growing trust in the potential of Chainlink in the long term. Source: Santiment With its Oracle services powering a great deal of the DeFi ecosystem, LINK has become a cornerstone of on-chain data reliability. The increase in the long positions also indicates greater conviction from the institutional traders. As capital rotation builds, LINK continues to be one of the best crypto to buy for those aiming for mid-cycle recoveries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Smart-Money Attention As ETF momentum cools, smart money is quietly rotating into high-return projects that have real value in the long term. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged at the center of this movement, bringing a rare combination of good fundamentals and high growth potential to investors. Analysts are predicting MAGACOIN FINANCE will provide up to 1,500% ROI before the end of 2025 – one of the most aggressive predictions of this cycle. This optimism is based on the project’s emphasis on utility and an explicit development roadmap that goes beyond short-term hype. Its planned implementation and clear token model have attracted disciplined investors seeking sustainability and growth. The growing ecosystem in the project and rising participation by investors indicate that early entrants may have a significant upside as the next bull phase approaches. Unlike most speculative tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is laying a foundation that is appealing for retail buyers seeking a replacement for institutional-grade exposure to a credible blockchain. With the market now in accumulation mode, it now stands as one of the best crypto to buy before large-scale capital returns to the altcoin sector. Final Outlook The slowdown in outflows of Bitcoin ETFs has brought optimism to the entire market, which signals that some confidence will be returning among institutional players. Historically, this stability has come ahead of major Q4 rotations, in which capital moves out of Bitcoin and into undervalued altcoins. This time, DOGE, TRON, and LINK are at the forefront of the established assets with accumulating momentum, with MAGACOIN FINANCE as the new wave of high ROI opportunities built on transparency and strong fundamentals. For investors positioning early, this could be the perfect window to place your exposure to the best crypto to buy , before the next explosive leg upwards for the market.

In a recent statement, he outlined new insights into how institutions could be preparing for indirect exposure to the digital asset, even as direct adoption faces several regulatory and operational obstacles. Van Code emphasized that while institutional interest in XRP continues to rise, the process of gaining exposure remains complex. He noted that large organizations cannot simply acquire XRP and store it in personal wallets due to compliance, audit, and security demands. According to him, such entities must maintain regulated custody frameworks, implement stringent auditing processes, and comply with regional financial standards, costing as much as $300,000 annually to maintain. What I am realizing with the bew @evernorthxrp announcement and stagnant XRP price is that it might be harder than we think for institutions to buy and hold XRP. Large companies aren't going to simply setup a Ledger or Xaman wallet and drop $100M in there. They want custody,… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 21, 2025 Institutional Access Through ETFs and Equity Investments Given these challenges, Van Code argued that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and publicly traded companies holding XRP may serve as the most efficient paths for institutions to enter the ecosystem. These structured financial products, he explained, allow for exposure to XRP’s price movement without the need for direct token management. This viewpoint reinforces the growing discussion around the potential introduction of XRP-backed ETFs . Multiple applications for such funds have already been submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), though progress remains stalled due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. The eventual approval of these ETFs could provide a framework for traditional investors to access XRP through regulated financial instruments. At the same time, several firms are announcing plans to establish XRP-based treasuries. Among these, Evernorth’s initiative has drawn the most attention for its scale and institutional backing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evernorth’s Expanding Institutional Role Evernorth, a financial venture closely associated with Ripple, has announced plans to build the largest XRP treasury to date. The company intends to acquire approximately $1 billion worth of XRP, supported by more than $1.1 billion in committed funding from participants, including Ripple and Japan’s SBI Holdings. Once fully operational, the project will launch with an initial pool of over 560 million XRP. According to Van Code, developments like Evernorth illustrate how institutional infrastructure is forming around XRP in ways that could influence long-term adoption. Although these activities have yet to drive immediate price increases, he emphasized that their significance lies in creating a foundation for future liquidity and regulated access. Van Code stated that he is now more bullish than ever on XRP’s institutional trajectory. He placed particular importance on the alignment between initiatives such as Evernorth and the potential introduction of XRP ETFs, noting that both approaches serve to integrate XRP into the broader financial system. Evernorth’s upcoming merger, expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2026, is projected to trigger the next round of XRP acquisitions within ten days of completion. Analysts suggest that this could mark a major step forward in the token’s institutional adoption strategy. As Ripple continues to advance infrastructure development and partnerships through ventures like Evernorth, combined with the future possibility of XRP ETFs, industry observers anticipate a more structured environment for institutional participation. This growing landscape could allow major investors to gain exposure to XRP through secure and compliant channels, representing a significant shift in how the asset is accessed and utilized.

On Wednesday, nearly 40% of total options volume came from a small cluster of stocks with no real business momentum, just heavy internet hype and sky-high short interest, according to data from CNBC. The tickers leading the charge are Beyond Meat’s BYND and Krispy Kreme’s DNUT, names that Reddit traders can’t stop gambling on, despite both companies being in the red revenue-wise. Traders target BYND and DNUT with high-risk options On Wednesday, options traders went ballistic as BYND traded more than 3.3 million contracts, roughly 9.4 times its average 20-day volume.DNUT went even crazier, with contracts trading at 38 times its typical options activity. Both names are under $5 per share, which makes them too cheap for most margin accounts. So retail traders are turning to options, where a few bucks can control hundreds of shares, for the same high-stakes action. The most traded BYND contract was the October 24 weekly $3 put, with 147,000 contracts changing hands at an average of $0.415 per contract.To break even, the stock would need to fall $1, about 28%, within two trading days. Meanwhile, 104,000 contracts were traded on the weekly $4 calls, priced around $1.455. That’s a bet the stock will climb to $5.455, more than 52% higher, before Friday’s close. That’s two moonshots in opposite directions. And at least one will be worthless by 4 p.m. Friday. There’s a reason this happens.These stocks are impossible to borrow, making it difficult for hedge funds to short them directly. But if a stock is loaded with short interest and retail traders push prices up, those funds may be forced to cover, buying shares at higher prices, which makes the rally worse. That’s the game. And it’s why meme traders aren’t tagging along with institutions. They’re betting against them. They want to be David against Goliath. This has nothing to do with earnings. DNUT and BYND both operate real businesses, but neither is profitable. BYND keeps reporting losses. DNUT has weak margins and debt problems. None of that matters. What matters is the story online, the tweets, the TikToks, the posts that spark a frenzy. That’s what sets the price, not revenue or market share projections. Back in 2021, traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum turned stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) into weapons.

Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

The RSI and MACD indicate fading bearish momentum, but a confirmed reversal has not yet occurred. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of October 23, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000727, showing a +2.6% daily gain. The coin’s price sits between the mid-Bollinger line at $0.0000795 and the lower band at $0.0000518, indicating it’s still within a weak recovery phase after prior selling. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD line has crossed slightly above the signal line, indicating a potential re-entry of buyers, but momentum has not yet completely shifted positive. The RSI at 38.9 indicates partial recovery from oversold conditions but remains below the neutral level. To regain strength, FLOKI must close above $0.0000795, opening a path toward $0.000090–$0.00010, while support rests at $0.000052–$0.000060. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour frame, FLOKI trades tightly near $0.0000728, as the Alligator lines flatten, showing consolidation after recent volatility. The MACD bars are fading red, indicating weakening bearish momentum, although buyers haven’t yet reclaimed dominance. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A clear breakout above $0.0000735–$0.0000740 could trigger a short-term rally toward $0.000078–$0.000080, while failure to hold $0.000070 risks another dip toward $0.000066.

Until then, traders can expect tight sideways action with mild upside potential. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Such a consolidation phase could be the calm before a major breakout, as chart patterns hint at a possible pre-rally formation that might propel ETH toward new all-time highs. Potential Right Shoulder Formation Signals Structural Strength Crypto analyst MarketMaestro delivered a detailed technical update on ETH, noting that the asset recently suffered a key rejection at its neckline resistance. Following this failure, the price is now positioned in a crucial retest phase at a red diagonal resistance line that it had previously surpassed. ETH’s market’s success in holding this diagonal is essential to avoid completely losing the bullish momentum built up in the prior moves. Related Reading: Ethereum Slides Gradually — Buyers Losing Control As Market Turns Cautious The analyst further noted that the current price movement suggests ETH could be forming a right shoulder in this region. This structural development is highly significant because the right shoulder simultaneously works to complete two major, highly bullish chart patterns. It is the final component needed to create the handle for the Cup and Handle pattern, while forming a larger Inverse Head and Shoulders (Inverse H&S) pattern. The simultaneous formation of both the Inverse H&S and the Cup and Handle in the same area is extremely rare and powerful, indicating that the market is setting the stage for highly bullish formations for the next quarter. Considering this powerful confluence of classic reversal and continuation patterns, along with the behavior of the broader market index, MarketMaestro views this entire consolidation phase not as weakness but as a logical pre-rally setup. He concludes with a high degree of confidence that the “pain threshold” or the maximum expected downside risk will likely not be very high. Bullish Bias Intact As Long As Support Remains Firm In a recent update, analyst Crypto Candy noted that the ETH scenario remains largely unchanged, despite recent market movements. A key takeaway from the analysis is that the asset is demonstrating significant resilience by strongly holding the crucial support zone between $3,600 and $3,800. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Ethereum Price If Bullish Momentum Holds The analyst reiterated the importance of this specific range, emphasizing that as long as the $3,600–$3,800 zone successfully sustains, the medium-term bullish outlook remains firmly in place. This suggests that buyers are aggressively defending this level, preventing a deeper correction from continuing. Given the strength shown at this support level, Crypto Candy maintains a strong price forecast: the market is expected to target $4,700, with the potential to reach a new ATH. This bullish bias, the analyst concludes, remains valid until the $3,600–$3,800 support zone is breached.

His outlook arrives at a time when the token is under heavy selling pressure, alongside widespread weakness across the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite the current bearish environment, Rector maintains that the ongoing correction forms part of a broader accumulation phase that could lead to a significant uptrend heading into 2025. Rector’s Final 2025 XRP Timeline In a recent post on X, Rector presented a timeline that outlines how XRP might transition from its current downtrend to potentially reach a price between $5 and $12 by December 2025. His projection is based on historical price behavior, particularly XRP’s performance during previous election cycles. Final 2025 XRP Timeline XRP November Pump Coming $5-$12 XRP by first part of December — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) October 22, 2025 The analyst recalled XRP’s trajectory in late 2024, noting that the asset experienced substantial declines before a sharp rebound. Specifically, XRP fell from $0.6540 on Oct. 1, 2024, to $0.4860 by Oct. 25, marking a 25% decline amid broader market uncertainty. At the time, sentiment turned largely negative, with some analysts dismissing the possibility of a major rally. Veteran investor Raoul Pal notably advised traders to shift focus to other assets, labeling projects like XRP and Cardano (ADA) as unlikely to recover meaningfully. However, XRP later invalidated those bearish calls, rebounding dramatically after the U.S. elections in November 2024. From a price of $0.50 on Nov. 4, it climbed to $3.40 by January 2025, gaining over 580% in just two months. XRP Poised for Another Run Toward $5–$12 According to Rector, XRP’s recent movement mirrors the same setup that preceded its 2024 surge. This October, XRP has declined by nearly 49%, forming a structure similar to the 60% retracement observed in early 2017 before the start of XRP’s historic 61,000% rally to $3.31 during the 2017–2018 cycle. Rector applied this historical pattern to XRP’s current logarithmic chart, noting that if the pattern remains consistent, the asset could experience a substantial rise between November and December 2025. He identified November 5, 2025, as a potential turning point for the next major rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst also argued that historical price cycles tend to repeat due to the market’s psychological and structural patterns, with similar setups often preceding significant bullish moves. While he did not provide an exact figure, his range of $5 to $12 aligns with other prominent forecasts within the XRP community. Broader Market Consensus Rector’s outlook adds to growing expectations among analysts that XRP could record significant gains within the next market cycle. Analyst, EGRAG Crypto introduced the “Valhalla Gate” model, suggesting that XRP could rally as high as $12 under favorable conditions. Earlier, in December 2024, the same analyst identified intermediate targets between $6 and $8 as possible milestones before a move toward double-digit prices. While these projections remain speculative, they highlight growing confidence among long-term supporters that XRP’s market structure remains intact despite recent declines. Analysts emphasize that sustained network adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and institutional entry could strengthen the case for renewed growth. If these factors align, XRP could once again defy bearish expectations, with many investors closely watching the final months of 2025 for confirmation of the next major trend.

53557084,612506,1761264034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53557084.jpeg,"Bitcoin Poised To Top $1.5 Million, Says Ex-PayPal President",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-top-1-5-million-ex-paypal-president/,"In a wide-ranging Coin Stories interview published October 21, David Marcus—co-founder and CEO of Lightspark, former president of PayPal and co-creator of Diem, the cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook—laid out a thesis that Bitcoin will ultimately surpass gold in value and evolve from a purely “store-of-value” asset into the invisible, neutral settlement layer of the internet for money. How Bitcoin Could Reach $1.5 Million “I think Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold,” Marcus told host Natalie Brunell. “At today’s gold price, it’s, you know, $1.3 million a bitcoin that [it] will have a higher market cap than gold.” He emphasized he is “decent at directional predictions” but “terrible at timing,” framing the trajectory as inevitable over a five-to-ten-year horizon rather than a near-dated call. The implication of outgrowing gold’s market capitalization places Bitcoin’s potential value well north of $1.3 million per coin and, at Gold’s recent ATH at $4,381.58/oz, above $1.53 million. Marcus’s price view is inseparable from his broader contention that BTC must progress beyond a narrow “digital gold” narrative. Echoing a line from analyst Matt Pines that Brunell cited—“if Bitcoin is only a store of value, it has failed”—Marcus agreed “fully,” but added a critical caveat: the savings-asset phase was a necessary precondition for utility. “We believe that the store-of-value phase is absolutely essential for us to be able to actually build a utility phase of Bitcoin on top of it,” he said, arguing that institutional adoption, ETFs and nation-state accumulation conferred enough legitimacy to begin scaling real-world payments. “Now that every institution… whether it’s BlackRock, Fidelity or others, are actually supporting Bitcoin… we can actually really start building payment utility on top of it.” That utility vision hinges on using Bitcoin more like TCP/IP—an invisible settlement substrate—than as a volatile unit of account for everyday spending. Marcus was blunt about behavioral and economic constraints: “People don’t want to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases because it’s volatile and people want to actually benefit from appreciation… they don’t want to be the Bitcoin pizza guy .” Lightspark’s approach is to move fiat end-to-end while using BTC in the middle. “You can send dollars from a US bank account to someone in Mexico receiving Mexican peso… the settlement asset is Bitcoin in between. So you have dollars, Bitcoin, Mexican peso and it’s invisible to people using it.” Technically, Lightspark is pushing beyond Lightning’s channel model while remaining backward-compatible. Marcus lauded Lightning’s trust model and speed, but highlighted its liquidity and self-custody frictions when scaled to “billions of endpoints.” The company’s newly launched “Spark” is described as a Lightning-compatible, non-channel payment system that enables spinning up “billions of wallets” with “minimal new trust assumptions.” Crucially, he said, it preserves safety valves: “It’s not as trustless as Lightning, but we believe it’s trustless enough and has unilateral exits to Layer 1… you can pull a rip cord and no one can prevent you from recovering your funds on L1.” Stablecoins And Adoption Marcus also argued that stablecoins—despite their centralized issuer model—are an unavoidable component of global payments, and that anchoring them to BTC’s settlement layer enhances resilience. He described a personal “schizophrenic journey” with stablecoins, disliking the “single throat to choke,” yet accepting their ubiquity and attempting to minimize trust by avoiding separate gas tokens and preserving unilateral exits to Bitcoin L1. On adoption, Marcus pointed to shifting institutional sentiment. Recounting a panel in New York “put together by Citadel Securities,” he said a “majority” of a roughly 450-person room of large traditional-finance investors indicated they own BTC, versus far fewer holding ETH , stablecoins, or any token. “This is a room that traditionally would have been very resistant to Bitcoin… now the times have changed so profoundly.” Yet he still framed retail penetration as early, estimating “low hundreds of millions” of unique holders globally and significant headroom from there. Overall, Marcus’ thesis returns to first principles: BTC as neutral, scarce, programmable collateral and a credibly decentralized settlement layer. Dismissing critiques that it lacks “intrinsic value,” he argued, “Underlying scarcity of Bitcoin secured by code is the intrinsic value… this is the only thing that’s deflationary by nature.” That, he contends, is why Bitcoin should outcompete gold over time: “When the first gold ETFs were launched, they started mining more gold.

According to a Reuters article, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against the US tech giant after a mass lawsuit which was brought forward on behalf of iPhone and iPad users in the UK. The case has been valued at an estimated £1.5 billion or $2 billion by the plaintiffs. Apple abused its dominance for five years to shut out competition The Tribunal concluded that Apple abused its dominance from October until the end of 2020 as it shut out competition in the app distribution market and levied “excessive and unfair prices,” as commission from developers. Apple has faced severe regulatory pressure in the US and Europe over its fees and has indicated it will appeal the ruling. It said the ruling “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy”. The lawsuit was led by British academic Dr Rachael Kent, who said that Apple made “exorbitant profits” by excluding all competition for app distribution and in-app purchases. Her lawyers maintained that during the January trial Apple’s “100% monopoly position” allowed it to impose excessive commissions. Dr Kent called the decision a “landmark victory, not only for App Store users, but for anyone who has ever felt powerless against a global tech giant”. In a statement, Dr Kent said that the ruling shows that Britain’s collective action regime is working. “Today’s ruling sends a clear message: no company, however wealthy or powerful, is above the law.” Dr Kent. The CAT’s ruling specified that developers were overcharged by the difference between a 17.5% commission and the commission that the tech giant actually charged, which, according to Dr Kent’s lawyers was typically 30%. The tribunal also concluded that developers passed on the 50% of this overcharge to consumers. Apple wants to appeal Apple said it strongly disagreed and indicated it would appeal. “This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments,” an Apple spokesperson said. “The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections,” added the spokesperson. According to reports, a hearing is now scheduled for next month to define how the damages will be calculated and to hear Apple’s application for permission to appeal. This case represents a significant victory for the UK’s “class action” style legal regime. It also marks the first mass lawsuit against a major tech company to go to trial under the system, which has reached its 10 th anniversary this year. It has seen multi-billion-pound cases certified for trial but limited success for consumers so far. According to Reuters, there are many other cases waiting in the wings, including one against Google over the commission it charges app developers for access to its Play Store. This case is expected to begin in October next year and will be heard alongside a similar claim by Epic Games, which is engaged in parallel litigation with Apple in the US. Other tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft are also facing sizeable claims at the CAT. The ruling also comes at a time after Apple was hit with a complaint to European antitrust regulators over the terms and conditions of its App Store under rules aimed at reining in Big Tech.

With markets recalibrating after months of volatility, investors are zeroing in on projects that balance innovation with strong fundamentals. The surge of interest in the best crypto presales to join now shows how the market is shifting from hype to utility. Stellar’s blockchain efficiency, Toncoin’s Web3 integration, and BullZilla’s explosive presale growth each tell a different story of momentum, but one stands out as the next major player for 2025. Among the three, BullZilla ($BZIL) is capturing the spotlight with its rapid fundraising, growing community, and ROI potential that dwarfs even early-stage Ethereum or Shiba Inu levels. Its structured presale, governed by scarcity and transparent growth stages, is redefining how investors perceive early crypto opportunities. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Titan of Presales and the Best Crypto Presale to Join Now Introducing BullZilla, the project rewriting the playbook for the best crypto presales to join now and early-stage investing. Currently in Stage 7D (Bag Signal Activated), the token is priced at $0.00018573, having already raised over $960K from 3,100+ holders and sold 31 billion tokens. This staggering momentum reflects a community-driven surge and strong investor belief in its mechanics. The Mechanics Behind the Bull Run BullZilla’s structure is built on three revolutionary systems: the Progressive Price Engine, which automatically raises prices every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours; a 24-stage burn mechanism ensuring long-term scarcity; and staking tiers offering up to 70% APY in the HODL Furnace. These elements create sustained upward pressure on token value and reward long-term holders, distinguishing BullZilla from short-lived hype coins. $4,000 Today, a Roaring Future Tomorrow: BullZilla’s ROI Projection An investment of $4,000 at the current price of $0.00018573 would secure approximately 21.5 million BZIL tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.00527, this would equate to $113,305, a 2,738.21% ROI, or 3,130.08% for the earliest investors. With the next price hike of +3.59% approaching as Stage 8 begins, the clock is ticking for new investors aiming to capitalize before the next tier activates. BullZilla’s presale isn’t just about speculation; it’s about strategy. By linking growth to verifiable metrics and blockchain transparency, it builds investor confidence while fueling excitement for its eventual exchange debut. How to Join the BullZilla Presale Getting started with BullZilla is simple. Set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, then purchase ETH or USDT via a trusted exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Visit the official BullZilla presale website, connect your wallet, and swap your ETH or USDT for $BZIL tokens. The tokens lock automatically during the presale, ensuring security and transparency, and can be claimed after the sale ends. Vesting and reward details are fully visible on the dashboard, maintaining a fair ecosystem for every participant. Stellar (XLM): Resilient in Volatility Stellar (XLM) is trading near $0.3095 after a 1.51% daily dip, yet its fundamentals remain strong. With a market cap of $9.9 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $15.47 billion, Stellar holds its rank as the 14th-largest crypto globally. A 13.01% surge in daily trading volume to $218.46 million signals sustained investor participation despite mild market pullbacks. While prices sit far below the 2018 all-time high of $0.9381, XLM has gained 25,123% since its 2014 low, an astonishing return that underscores long-term potential. Stellar continues to drive cross-border payment innovation and asset tokenization, cementing its reputation as one of the most stable blockchain ecosystems. Analysts expect that as traditional finance integrates tokenized assets, Stellar’s network could benefit significantly from new liquidity inflows and institutional adoption. Toncoin (TON): Web3 Connectivity on the Rise Toncoin (TON) has slipped 1.53% in the past 24 hours to $2.12, extending a brief correction amid rising trading activity. With a market cap of $5.34 billion and $155.17 million in daily volume, it remains a top-25 crypto powerhouse. The fully diluted valuation of $10.9 billion highlights Toncoin’s growing appeal across both consumer and developer segments. Despite being well below its June 2024 high of $8.24, Toncoin is still up 442.58% from its 2021 low of $0.3906, proving resilience amid wider market turbulence. Analysts attribute the dip to short-term profit-taking as traders rebalance portfolios. However, Toncoin’s deep integration with Telegram and its expanding Web3 ecosystem provide it with unique leverage. Its mission to bridge messaging, decentralized finance, and NFT applications positions Toncoin as one of the most versatile blockchain projects of this decade. Conclusion: Why BullZilla Is the Top Choice Among the Best Crypto Presales to Join Now Stellar’s resilience and Toncoin’s technological integration prove that strong fundamentals matter, but in this cycle, innovation tied to investor participation is driving momentum. BullZilla stands at the intersection of transparency, utility, and timing, giving investors a clear entry into one of the best crypto presales to join now before its next price surge. As the crypto market eyes 2025’s potential rebound, BullZilla’s momentum-driven mechanics and ROI trajectory make it impossible to ignore. Those who recognize its structure today may find themselves in the same position early Ethereum or Dogecoin holders once did, watching a bold idea transform into a market leader.

As volatility decreases, and Bitcoin holding major levels, altcoins already exhibit initial recovery patterns. Cardano is one of them, where its long-form symmetrical triangle pattern is narrowing down to a possible breakout in Q4. ADA would also soar up to 70% in case the support at $0.62 is met. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE keeps drawing presale investors who are eager to get the next boom in the crypto sphere. ADA Technical Outlook: Symmetrical Triangle Nears Q4 Breakout Most recently, Cardano is trading at approximately $0.64, and it is barely above the major support of $0.62, which has been supporting the structure of ADA over the past few months. This area coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and forms the foundation of a one-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Analyst Ali Charts believes a holding above $0.62 will maintain the bullish structure, and a possible rally to $1.90 can follow. ADAUSD 12-Hour Chart | Source: X The apex of the formation is in late Q4 2025, meaning that a decisive move is coming soon. When ADA crosses the downward trendline at approximately $0.70, the following levels of resistance will be at $0.95, $1.28, and $1.86 according to Fibonacci projections. Both are zones of historical reactions at which Cardano has been stalling or backtracking on rallies earlier. Momentum indicators also justify a pending change. The MACD line is slightly lower than the signal line, however, the close margin and the disappearing red bars indicate that force of selling is decreasing. The RSI reading of 40 points suggests a market is still recovering and still has room to grow, should buyers regain control. Taken together, the structure indicates that as Q4 continues, Cardano is gearing towards volatility growth. Market Sentiment and Open Interest Reflect Caution Derivatives data indicate that traders remain cautious. According to Coinglass , ADA’s futures open interest has declined sharply from $1.8 billion in mid-September to $648.56 million, a 64% drop. The decrease shows a lower demand for speculative exposure, signaling more conservative positioning across the market. Historically, such phases of reduced open interest have preceded large directional moves once new volume returns. On-chain data shows steady accumulation as non-exchange wallets continue to grow, while developers advance scalability upgrades such as Hydra and Mithril . Institutional inflows since Q3 further reflect growing confidence ahead of potential network expansions. Bitcoin Steadies Above $108K Ahead of Key Market Shift Bitcoin has been trading at $108,000 following a rebound from early-October lows of close to $103,000. The recovery indicates decreasing pressure after volatility spike last month. The biggest crypto in terms of market cap added 0.8% today, trading in a tight range amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Although momentum was muted, the steady level of Bitcoin above the $108K price offers a reference point to the overall market sentiment. Traditionally, ADA and other significant altcoins are known to track the mid-cycle recoveries of Bitcoin, especially when volatility is compressed. According to analysts, the current consolidation phase of BTC can become a boost off the ground into a larger Q4 recovery should the volume of purchases rise. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks With traders keeping an eye on the next move by ADA, presale investors are moving to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new Ethereum-based project that is gaining momentum among investors. The token has received attention due to its transparent tokenomics, anti-whale design, and verified Hashex audit . All these factors support its credibility among early-stage projects. In addition, the current PATRIOT50X bonus program is creating a booming presale, giving early investors additional tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised millions, and analysts have listed it as one of their top Q4 picks since it has a growing community and a practical utility plan. The social traction the project has experienced makes it a unique project in a market that seeks reliable opportunities in the face of volatility. Conclusion The symmetrical triangle formation of Cardano indicates a breakout is imminent, as the support of $0.62 is still the pivotal point. A successful defense would cause a rally to $1.90, which coincides with Bitcoin holding steadily above $108K and improving mood on the crypto markets. Meanwhile, presale investors are making use of new opportunities beyond traditional assets. Having good fundamentals, an engaged community, and an active incentive program called PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains among the best altcoins to buy today before being listed on exchanges.

Banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, are leading the deal, which is divided into two distinct senior secured credit facilities, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. One $23.25 billion package will be used to help finance a data center in Texas, and another $14.75 billion facility will help fund a project in Wisconsin, according to the people. Vantage Data Centers is building the two data centers, which Oracle will ultimately use to host OpenAI, Bloomberg News has reported. The projects are part of Oracle’s larger goal to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure alongside OpenAI in a project that it calls Stargate. Oracle’s $500B ‘Stargate’ Vision drives massive data center expansion Others, including Wells Fargo & Co., BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Societe Generale SA, have been designated portions of the financing package after the first round of selecting underwriters, the people said. Spokespeople for JPMorgan, MUFG SMBC, and OpenAI declined to comment. Contacted for comment, Oracle, Vantage, and the rest of the banks did not immediately respond. Meanwhile, Oracle’s new dual chief executives recently defended the firm’s massive new investmen t in data centers, stating that it will provide computing firepower and a suite of bundled services that will make artificial intelligence more useful for businesses. “We’re really in a unique situation to deliver what we call applied AI,” said Mike Sicilia, the former president of Oracle Industries, who was appointed as the CEO of the company last month. That includes infrastructure, analytics, and applications, he said in an interview. Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s former president of cloud infrastructure, was also named a chief executive. They arrive just as fears of an A.I. bubble are metastasizing rapidly. Oracle shares spiked by over 40% last month after the cloud firm said that it had added $317 billion in future contract revenue as part of its latest quarter that ended on Aug. 31. A lot of that new revenue originated from a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Investors and tech analysts have raised questions over the past month about how much the new build-out depends on OpenAI, which won’t beco me profitable until 2029, according to Sam Altman, the chief executive of the ChatGPT maker. Credit ratings firm Moody’s last month indicated risks to Oracle’s balance sheet due to the extent to which its future AI data centers rely on OpenAI. At the beginning of October, Oracle shares fell as much as 7.1%—though they quickly recovered—after a report suggesting that its margins on renting specialized Nvidia chips were razor-thin. Investor demand for AI debt surges as Vantage and Meta deals set new benchmarks Investors across the spectrum have been eager to gain early exposure to AI, with banks and private credit firms vying to lead vast debt packages that finance the boom. Meta Platforms Inc. recently chose Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. to arrange a $29 billion debt and equity deal for the company’s data-center expansion in rural Louisiana. The Vantage debt comes about a week after other bonds issued to facilitate the Meta deal began trading in secondary markets, jumping as much as 10 cents on the dollar and yielding Pimco paper profits of approximately $2 billion. Both Vantage facilities are due to mature in four years, with two one-year extension options, and priced at around 2.5 percentage points over the benchmark, the people said. Like the project and commercial real estate financings, the loans are to be structured as interest-only during construction but amortize once operations begin, according to the people. The managers finalized the second round of underwriting early this week, at which the debt was allotted to other banks and institutional investors, they said.

According to the Cupertino-based tech company, these servers play a crucial role in their pledge to invest approximately $600 billion in the US, particularly in advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives. Following this move, US President Donald Trump expressed his pleasure with Apple’s decision, urging the tech giant and other tech firms to expand their production within the United States. Apple pledges to make significant investments in the US Apple began implementing its plan to produce AI servers at its factory in Houston, Texas, earlier this year. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant first shared its intention to create US servers in February this year before making significant moves later. Regarding the tech company’s triumph in the AI ecosystem, Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan commented that these servers will support the firm’s Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services, which are scheduled to be announced this week. Currently, Apple is utilizing its own silicon technology in its Apple Intelligence servers, Khan said. The Chief Operating Officer’s remarks came after he acknowledged, “Our teams have done an excellent job accelerating the work to get the new Houston factory operating ahead of schedule, and we plan to keep expanding the facility to enhance production next year.” Meanwhile, when Apple was implementing its plan, the tech giant viewed the Houston factory as an opportunity for several individuals to secure jobs. According to the tech company, the factory was set to create thousands of jobs. Notably, Apple servers were previously made overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook took the initiative to meet with Trump in August to demonstrate the company’s commitment to further invest in the US. At this time, Cook promised the president that the tech giant would invest particularly in semiconductor firms via a program known as the American Manufacturing Program. Apart from the pledge, the CEO also presented Trump with a gift from Corning Glass, produced in the US. Interestingly, the Corning glass is used in iPhones and Apple Watches. Additionally, the tech firm introduced a manufacturing academy in partnership with Michigan State in July. Industry experts weighed in on the discussion, pointing out that although Trump has recently praised Cook and acknowledged Apple for its commitment to invest in the US, the president has often called on the tech giant to produce its iPhones in the country. Therefore, according to them, this shift will likely take years and be expensive. Apple admits to strongly supporting the US manufacturing sector The Trump administration had earlier requested tariffs that could affect Apple’s operations. However, after several considerations, they decided to cancel them. In response to this action, Apple revealed that it would import computers and phones from China, India, and Vietnam to the United States. This was confirmed after Cook stated that Apple strongly supports the US’s manufacturing sector by partnering with domestic semiconductor suppliers. He further explained that Apple’s investment and expertise play a role in developing chips entirely made and packaged in the country. “You can add a lot by making it global and then connecting the entire supply chain for semiconductors,” Cook added. Afterwards, the CEO acknowledged that he could not emphasize enough the crucial role the US semiconductor sector plays in their operation and the significant contribution it will make to their efforts. Despite managing to keep Trump’s tariffs off its back, Apple is still facing high costs , and this time it’s landing directly on customers. As per the briefing document obtained, CEO Tim Cook offered President Donald Trump a $100 billion sweetener to protect Apple’s supply chain. In exchange, Trump spared Apple from semiconductor tariffs that could have doubled the price of chips. Last month, Tim Cook presented Trump with a gold-and-glass plaque before reporters, thanking him for “putting American innovation and jobs front and center.” The gesture marked Apple’s expanded $600 billion US investment pledge over a five-year period. Yet behind the show of goodwill, the company is quietly preparing to raise iPhone prices — and it’s no coincidence. Get seen where it counts.

But while XRP hogs the limelight, investors looking for new horizons are putting more and more focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a completely new crypto coin that’s rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in this week. Already exchanging hands at $0.035 in Stage 6 of its presale with over 70% already sold, Mutuum Finance has garnered over $17.75 million due to its revolutionary dual-lending DeFi protocol. Built to merge Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems, Mutuum Finance is providing unparalleled capital efficiency and utility. While XRP is targeting a breakout to $3, MUTM is setting itself up as the next monster mover in the DeFi space, one that may hallmark the next phase of crypto innovation. XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Target $3 as Retail Fear Peaks XRP has mounted a defiant comeback, reclaiming over $2.50 only days after falling below $1.90 and bouncing off $2.20. Market data indicates retail traders were selling at a loss on the move, spreading mass FUD, a classic situation where prices naturally move in opposition to herd mentality. This contrarian indicator, along with fresh whale building and hopes of an eventual XRP ETF, is a prelude that the bulls will push the price to the $3.00 resistance level in the near term. While investors are occupied trying to find the breakout level of XRP, others are waiting with bated breath for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been rising up in the DeFi space as the best new crypto coin of 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Spike Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is red hot in the cryptocurrency world as investor demand runs wild in its Phase 6 presale. Its token currently sits at $0.035, 16.17% up from Phase 5, the all-time lowest that MUTM will ever trade at. It will go up to $0.04 in Phase 7, so early birds have a great chance to snag it at low today, making it the best crypto to buy this year. Thus far, over 17,370 investors have pledged, investing over $17.75 million. Over 70% sold during Phase 6, the presale reflects confidence on the part of early adopters in the next milestone: the debut of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol, rendering it one of the best crypto to buy opportunities in DeFi and an excellent new crypto coin for early investors. Infrastructure and Price Discovery To the ends of facilitating timely and accurate price information, Mutuum Finance makes use of Chainlink oracles cross-referencing token prices against broadly traded assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, aggregator feeds, and on-chain data are made use of throughout the platform to the ends of providing real-time and accurate price information. These protocols are the collateral pricing, risk, and liquidation process backbone, thus allowing the protocol to be efficient and stable irrespective of the changing market conditions. As XRP steals the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains quietly. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, with over 70% sold and $17.75M collected by 17,370+ investors, MUTM offers early entry into a dual-lending DeFi platform. Its P2C/P2P architecture, Chainlink oracles, and $50K CertiK bug bounty guarantee its security and scalability, and therefore it is the best crypto to buy today and a new crypto coin with long-term potential. Investors can invest in presale now before Phase 7 at $0.04 and set themselves up for potential returns towards its $1 target.

53559732,612555,1761267602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53559732.jpeg,Analyst Who Called The Gold Surge To ATH And The S&P Rally Has Turned To Bitcoin – Here’s What He Said,https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-has-turned-to-bitcoin/,"A crypto market analyst who correctly predicted gold’s price surge to new all-time highs and explosive rallies in the S&P 500 is now turning his focus toward Bitcoin (BTC). The analyst has officially declared Bitcoin the next bull run opportunity . His bold call and history of accuracy have left the crypto community eager to see where the cryptocurrency’s price heads next. Bitcoin Now In Focus After Analyst Nails Gold And S&P Predictions In a post on X earlier this week, financial services veteran Mel Mattison announced that investors should start buying Bitcoin. The analyst believes BTC is entering a potentially bullish phase , suggesting that the pioneering cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a “massive run.” Interestingly, this is not the first time Mattison has made such a bold call. Earlier this year, his predictions on gold and equities proved surprisingly accurate. In April, he had made a striking prediction about the S&P 500 , urging investors to “buy now” and forecasting that the index would hit 7,000 within a year and 15,000 before the end of US President Donald Trump’s term . Since then, the S&P 500 has surged, validating Mattison’s aggressive bullish outlook. Months later, in August, the financial service veteran encouraged investors to accumulate gold while its price was down and still consolidating, labeling it a rare long-term opportunity. He also detailed his moves by adding to January 2026 GLD call options at the 330 and 350 strike levels, explaining that the setup was ideal for a 6-12 month rally. Remarkably, his timing aligned perfectly with gold’s subsequent rally, which saw the precious metal break to new all-time highs. With his focus now on Bitcoin, Martian appears to be positioning the digital asset alongside gold and equities as the next major play in a global risk-on environment. His bullish calls align with other analysts who believe BTC could advance toward a new ATH this Q4 . BTC Price Chart Mirrors Gold’s Legendary 1980s Surge Sharing similar bullish sentiments, crypto market expert Merlijn the Trader has presented a striking technical comparison between Bitcoin’s current weekly chart and gold’s historical price action in the late 1970s. The analysis highlights a near-identical ascending channel formation, with BTC’s price action from 2023 to 2025 closely mirroring gold’s structure from 1976 to 1979. In the accompanying chart, Merlijn indicated that Bitcoin’s trajectory shows a clear consolidation within the same upward channel that preceded gold’s dramatic breakout to new all-time highs above $760 in 1980. The analyst explained that the cryptocurrency has accurately traced the rhythm, structure, and squeeze of this distinct bullish setup. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is situated at the upper end of the ascending channel , suggesting that a breakout could lead to a significant upward move that could mirror gold’s historic surge. While the analyst has not shared a specific price target for his bullish outlook, he remains confident that BTC is primed for a “legendary move” to new highs.",Bitcoin News|Ascending Channel|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|Mel Mattison|Merlijn|S&P 500,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-24 01:00:02

Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price – Bullish Momentum Soon? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Ethereum is trading above its Realized Price at approximately $2,300. Dubbing the price level a “fundamental support zone,” the analyst said that historically, any dips below this level have marked a capitulation phase. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Ethereum Price If Bullish Momentum Holds For the uninitiated, Realized Price represents the average cost basis of all ETH holders, calculated by dividing the total value of all ETH at the time they last moved on-chain by the current circulating supply. Realized Price effectively shows the “true” average price investors paid, serving as a key indicator of whether the market is in profit or loss. As long as ETH trades above Realized Price, the market structure is likely to remain bullish. The analyst also highlighted Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. Notably, ETH holders are currently, on average, at 67% profit relative to their cost basis. This metric gives two major hints about the current market. First, it shows that although the market is profitable, it is still far from “overheated” levels. Second, it indicates that market participants are confident about the market’s upward momentum, but not quite euphoric. To explain, the MVRV ratio compares the market value of an asset to its realized value. A higher MVRV indicates holders are sitting on larger unrealized profits – often signaling potential overvaluation – while a lower MVRV suggests undervaluation or market fear. Further, TeddyVision noted Ethereum’s reaction from the Upper Realized Price Band, which is currently located around $5,300. The analyst remarked: Price pulled back before reaching the “Overheating Zone. This isn’t a reversal – it’s a consolidation phase after distribution, a healthy cooldown without structural damage. Finally, spot inflows of ETH to crypto exchanges are also slowing down, hinting that the next leg up for the digital asset will likely depend on fresh liquidity, and not leverage. To sum it up, Ethereum is slowly moving from the distribution phase to the consolidation phase. Is It A Good Time To Buy ETH? While providing reliable future predictions in the crypto market remains a challenging task, fresh on-chain and exchange data point toward ETH regaining its bullish momentum. For instance, Binance funding rates recently hinted that ETH could surge to $6,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For Breakout? SOPR Trend Hints At $5,000 Upside Similarly, ETH reserves on exchanges continue to fall at a rapid pace. Earlier this month, ETH supply on exchanges hit a multi-year low, increasing the probability of a potential “supply crunch” that can dramatically increase ETH’s price. That said, crypto analyst Nik Patel recently cautioned that ETH’s price correction may not yet be fully over. At press time, ETH trades at $3,849, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

In a pair of candid letters made public on Thursday by Senator Chuck Grassley, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judges Henry T. Wingate of Mississippi and Julien Xavier Neals of New Jersey said that AI tools were used in the preparation of court orders that were later found to be riddled with factual mistakes and legal missteps. Both decisions have since been retracted. Grassley, who had demanded explanations, said, “Each federal judge, and the judiciary as an institution, has an obligation to ensure the use of generative AI does not violate litigants’ rights or prevent fair treatment under the law.” Staff missteps expose limits of AI in the courtroom In his letter , Judge Neals of the District of New Jersey said that a draft ruling in a securities lawsuit had been released “in error — human error” after a law school intern used OpenAI’s ChatGPT for research without authorization or disclosure. The decision was promptly withdrawn once the mistake was discovered. To prevent a recurrence, Neals said his chambers had since created a written AI policy and enhanced its review process. Judge Wingate, who serves in the Southern District of Mississippi, said a law clerk used the AI tool Perplexity “as a foundational drafting assistant to synthesize publicly available information on the docket.” That draft order, issued in a civil rights case, was later replaced after he identified errors. Wingate stated that the event “was a lapse in human oversight,” adding that he has since tightened review procedures within his chambers. Criticism of AI usage in legal work The episode adds to a growing list of controversies involving AI-generated legal material. Lawyers in several US jurisdictions have faced sanctions in recent years for submitting filings drafted by chatbots that included fabricated case citations and misapplied precedents. Earlier this month, the New York state court system put out a new policy that restricts judges and staff from entering confidential, privileged, or non-public case information into public generative AI tools. While the legal profession has been quick to explore AI’s potential to improve efficiency, the incidents have exposed the technology’s limitations, particularly its tendency to hallucinate, or generate plausible but false information . For courts, where the integrity, accuracy of rulings and the burden of proof are paramount, such lapses risk undermining public confidence in the justice system. Grassley, who commended Wingate and Neals for owning up to the mistakes, also urged the judiciary to put in place stronger AI guidelines. The Administrative Office of the US Courts has not released comprehensive guidance on AI use, though several circuit courts are reportedly exploring frameworks for limited, supervised deployment. Legal scholars, on the other hand, are reportedly proposing a disclosure rule, which will require judges to publicly note any use of AI in their opinions or orders, in a manner similar to citation requirements for external research. The incidents come as federal agencies and professional bodies continue to grapple with questions about AI accountability. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Analysten sehen darin keinen Verkauf, sondern eine technische Neuorganisation der Bestände. Trotz der symbolischen Bedeutung bleibt der Einfluss auf den Markt gering und vor allem psychologischer Natur. Ein Relikt aus den Anfängen von Bitcoin ist plötzlich wieder aufgetaucht. Eine Adresse, die noch aus der mysteriösen Satoshi-Ära stammt, hat nach über 14 Jahren Ruhe 150 BTC bewegt. Der unerwartete Transfer weckt alte Spekulationen über verschollene Miner, vergessene Schlüssel und mögliche Marktreaktionen. Doch wie gefährlich ist dieses Erwachen wirklich für den Kryptomarkt? Ein Stück Bitcoin-Geschichte erwacht Ein Bitcoin-Wallet aus dem Jahr 2009 hat nach über 14 Jahren erstmals wieder Aktivität gezeigt. Die Adresse, die in den Anfangstagen der Kryptowährung rund 4.000 BTC gemint haben soll, übertrug in dieser Woche 150 BTC im Wert von rund 16 Millionen US-Dollar. Das ist die erste Bewegung seit Juni 2011 – eine Zeit, in der Bitcoin noch kaum bekannt war und nur wenige Enthusiasten an seine Zukunft glaubten. Die damals verdienten Coins hatten beim letzten Zugriff einen Wert von nur knapp 68.000 Dollar. Heute steht die Summe für ein kleines Vermögen. Der Vorgang zeigt, wie rasant sich der Wert von Bitcoin seit den Anfängen entwickelt hat und wie viele frühe Miner durch Geduld oder Vergessen zu Multimillionären wurden. Seltene Aktivität aus der Satoshi-Ära Solche Bewegungen aus der sogenannten Satoshi-Ära sind extrem selten. Laut Daten des Analyseunternehmens Glassnode werden nur wenige Wallets aus der Zeit vor 2011 überhaupt noch aktiv. Das weckt regelmäßig großes Interesse, da diese Coins geschürft wurden, als Bitcoin-Erfinder Satoshi Nakamoto selbst noch online diskutierte und Beiträge in Foren veröffentlichte. Jede Bewegung alter Coins löst Spekulationen aus – könnten es Satoshi selbst sein oder frühe Mitstreiter? Historisch betrachtet führen diese Ereignisse oft zu kurzfristiger Unruhe an den Märkten, da Anleger Verkäufe befürchten. Doch bisher hat sich fast immer gezeigt: Die meisten dieser Transfers dienen rein technischen oder organisatorischen Zwecken. Psychologische Wirkung statt Marktschock Der Zeitpunkt des Transfers ist bemerkenswert. BTC handelt derzeit um die Marke von 110.000 Dollar, nachdem die Kryptowährung Anfang des Monats von einem Rekordhoch über 126.000 Dollar gefallen war. Der Markt hat jüngst den größten Liquidationsschock seiner Geschichte erlebt, mit fast 19 Milliarden Dollar an aufgelösten Positionen. In einem so sensiblen Umfeld wirken Bewegungen großer, alter Bestände wie ein psychologischer Auslöser. Doch rein faktisch spielt die Transaktion kaum eine Rolle. Die 150 BTC entsprechen einem winzigen Bruchteil des täglichen Handelsvolumens von mehr als 20 Milliarden Dollar. Der Effekt liegt also nicht in der Marktmechanik, sondern in der Wahrnehmung. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Warum die Coins jetzt bewegt wurden Analysten nennen mehrere mögliche Gründe für den Schritt. Der Inhaber könnte seine Bitcoins in eine moderne, besser gesicherte Wallet übertragen haben, um sie vor Verlusten oder technischen Risiken zu schützen. Ebenso denkbar sind Erbschaftsregelungen oder einfache Funktionstests alter Wallets. Bislang gibt es keine Hinweise darauf, dass die Coins an Börsen gesendet wurden, was auf einen geplanten Verkauf hindeuten würde. Auch frühere Fälle, etwa in den Jahren 2021 und 2023, führten zu keiner nachhaltigen Preisbewegung. Stattdessen stellte sich meist heraus, dass die Besitzer lediglich ihre Guthaben restrukturierten. Ein Blick auf den aktuellen Markt Die allgemeine Stimmung am Kryptomarkt bleibt vorsichtig. Nach dem starken Preisrückgang Anfang des Monats schwankt BTC nun in einer engen Spanne zwischen 108.000 und 111.000 Dollar. Viele Anleger warten auf neue Impulse, während Analysten über mögliche Korrekturen diskutieren. In dieser Phase werden On-Chain-Daten besonders aufmerksam verfolgt. Bewegungen alter Wallets dienen dabei als Erinnerung an die Ursprünge des Netzwerks – und an das enorme, bislang unberührte Vermögen früher Miner. Es zeigt, dass ein großer Teil des Gesamtbestands von BTC noch immer in den Händen einer kleinen, historischen Gruppe liegt. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Mehr Symbolik als Substanz Letztlich dürfte das Erwachen dieses 14 Jahre alten Wallets keine fundamentale Auswirkung auf den Markt haben. Der Vorgang ist eher ein Symbol für die Beständigkeit und Geschichte der Kryptowährung als ein Signal für bevorstehende Verkäufe. Für viele Investoren ist es ein faszinierender Einblick in die frühen Tage von Bitcoin – eine Erinnerung daran, dass digitale Werte auch über Jahrzehnte hinweg Bestand haben können. Solange die Coins nicht auf Börsen auftauchen, bleibt die Bewegung reine Statistik und kein Grund zur Panik. So zeigt diese Geschichte doch auch besonders eines: Wie lange es schon BTC gibt und wie weit Bitcoin als Projekt gekommen ist. Das bedeutet auch, dass neue Projekte, die sich an Bitcoin orientieren und dessen Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit benutzen, durchaus auch noch zukünftig Potenzial haben, so wie Bitcoin Hyper. $Hyper: Eng verbunden mit der Stärke von Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper baut direkt auf dem BTC-Netzwerk auf und erbt damit dessen Sicherheit und Vertrauen. Es erweitert Bitcoin um das, was bisher fehlte – Geschwindigkeit, niedrige Gebühren und Smart Contracts. Wenn Bitcoin stark performt, profitiert auch $Hyper, denn sein Fundament ist untrennbar mit BTC verbunden. Steigt das Interesse an Bitcoin, wächst auch die Nachfrage nach Lösungen wie Bitcoin Hyper, die echte Nutzung ermöglichen. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Der Token, der mit BTC wächst $HYPER ist der Treibstoff desHyper-Ökosystems – sicher durch Bitcoin, effizient durch Solana. Wenn BTC langfristig zulegt und stärker in den Alltag und institutionelle Nutzung rückt, dürfte auch $HYPER profitieren. Denn wo BTC die Basis ist, bietet Bitcoin Hyper die Anwendung – und beide stärken sich gegenseitig.

This decline occurs as the central bank prepares to decide on the future of its balance sheet in its upcoming meeting. According to reliable sources, data shared on Thursday highlighted a decrease of approximately $59 billion in US bank reserves, bringing the total to $2.93 trillion for the week ending October 22. This marks the lowest level reached since January 1. Fed’s upcoming meeting raises predictions among individuals The US bank reserves dropped as the Treasury borrowed more funds to restore its cash balance after raising the debt limit in July. Following this move, analysts have raised concerns that the action may remove liquidity from other areas of the Fed’s balance sheet, such as its overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and bank reserves. Their remarks followed research that revealed a decrease in the amount of money commercial banks hold in reserves at the Fed as the RRP nears depletion. These cash adjustments have significantly impacted daily operations within the financial system, as the Fed continues to lower its balance sheet through a process widely known as quantitative tightening, or QT. In the meantime, sources familiar with the situation, which wished to remain anonymous, pointed out that since QT can worsen liquidity-related problems and cause market instability, the Fed decided to lower the number of bonds that can mature each month earlier this year. In their upcoming meeting next week in Washington, federal officials are expected to discuss the future of the balance sheet as individuals share predictions about the situation. According to these predictions, many have expressed the likelihood of a policy rate cut between 3.75% and 4%. However, Wall Street highlighted concerns about the uncertainty surrounding when the Fed will end quantitative tightening, another method for controlling interest rates. Another example of these predictions is the forecasts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp analysts. They predicted that the Fed will stop reducing its balance sheet, which is approximately $6.6 trillion, this month. This would conclude a process aimed at removing money from financial markets, a perspective shared by TD Securities and Wrightson ICAP. Analysts raise concerns about the persistently elevated rates on repos and fluctuations Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the balance sheet shrinkage will cease when bank reserves reach a level higher than what policymakers consider necessary for “ample” levels, which are sufficient to prevent market disruptions. Powell noted that early government data, before the recent shutdown, indicated the US economy was running hotter than policymakers had anticipated, warning that growth remains firm even as the central bank inches toward ending its balance-sheet reductions and considers further rate cuts. Speaking in Philadelphia at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell noted that the Fed is close to its target for “ample” bank reserves and hinted that the tightening cycle could soon pause. This development came as investors weighed how far the Fed can go before risking job losses while maintaining a stable inflation rate. “Our long-stated plan is to stop balance-sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,” Powell said. “We may approach that point in the coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.” He noted that the central bank hasn’t set a date, but liquidity measures suggest that the end of balance-sheet reduction is close. Still, money market rates have remained elevated this week despite an influx of cash. This occurs as Government-sponsored enterprises hold their monthly principal and interest payments in repurchase agreements (repos) before releasing them to holders of mortgage-backed securities around the 25th of every month. To analysts, the persistently elevated rates on repos and fluctuations suggest that reserves are no longer abundant and the financial system is at risk of running short.

The market now stands at a critical crossroads — one that could define whether the next phase brings a deep correction or sets the stage for a massive recovery. According to top analyst Axel Adler, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 remain in what he calls the late bull phase. The S&P 500’s 52-week return currently sits at +13%, reflecting that global markets remain in a risk-on environment, with investors still willing to take exposure to growth-oriented assets. Adler notes that the BTC–S&P correlation currently stands at 0.26, meaning Bitcoin tends to move in the same direction as equities, though not entirely in lockstep. This moderate correlation suggests that while macro factors like earnings and monetary policy still influence Bitcoin, its internal dynamics — such as liquidity shifts and derivatives positioning — remain key. However, Adler warns that the S&P 500’s sensitivity to macro and political narratives could quickly spill over into the crypto market. Any cooling in equities or broader risk sentiment could pressure Bitcoin and define its next major move. Bitcoin Mirrors Late-Cycle Market Behavior as Q4 Earnings Take Center Stage According to Axel Adler, the final quarter of 2025 marks a crucial transition point for both traditional and crypto markets. After nearly two years of steady yield growth and tight monetary policy, the macro focus is shifting from expectations to real corporate performance. The Q3 earnings season is now in full swing, and early results have been surprisingly strong — out of 58 companies that have reported so far, all have beaten estimates by an average of 571 basis points (bps). Moreover, expected earnings growth for the quarter has climbed from 7% to 8%, reinforcing the idea that markets are still in the final phase of a bull cycle. This late-cycle behavior typically reflects investor optimism, even as underlying risks — such as stretched valuations, declining liquidity, and macro uncertainty — begin to surface. Adler notes that such conditions often coincide with high volatility across risk assets, including Bitcoin, which tends to track broader shifts in investor sentiment. For crypto markets, this context is particularly relevant. Bitcoin’s muted reaction to strong earnings data suggests that institutional flows remain cautious, waiting for confirmation of macro stability before re-entering risk positions. Historically, when equity markets approach the peak of their bull cycle, Bitcoin can either decouple and surge amid renewed liquidity or follow equities downward during a correction phase. Adler concludes that the current setup aligns with a late-bull, pre-cooling environment — a moment defined by strong short-term optimism but fragile long-term balance. The coming weeks, driven by the remaining earnings reports and central bank commentary, will determine whether this momentum fuels another Bitcoin rally or marks the beginning of a broader market cooldown. Bulls Defend Key Support, Market Awaits Breakout Confirmation Bitcoin is currently trading around $109,300, showing modest recovery momentum after finding support near the 100-day moving average (green line). The 3-day chart reveals that BTC remains in a consolidation structure, oscillating between $106,000 and $117,500, the latter acting as a significant resistance level since mid-September. The $117,500 zone continues to mark the upper boundary of the current range, aligning with the previous high-volume node from the August–September period. This level represents the Point of Control for the recent trading structure and is critical for defining short-term direction. A successful breakout above it would likely trigger momentum toward $123,000, where large liquidity clusters and short liquidations are positioned. On the downside, the 50-day moving average (blue line) sits near $111,000, overlapping with the mid-range level, while the 200-day moving average (red line) near $90,000 remains a longer-term support base. Bitcoin’s trend remains neutral-to-bullish, but confidence is fragile. A strong close above $111,000–$112,000 could signal renewed strength, while a rejection here would likely confirm extended consolidation or even a deeper correction toward $105,000. The next few sessions will determine whether BTC can regain momentum or face renewed selling pressure.

Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore are pioneering Ethereum-linked investment products that are experiencing significant demand from mainstream funds and retail investors. This growth represents a significant trend in confidence in digital assets after months of mixed sentiment. According to analysts, the new wave of institutional demand is spilling over into the best-performing altcoins. Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK) are picking up speed as traders seek assets with genuine market activity. Joining the list of the best altcoins to buy this week is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that is rapidly emerging and gaining the attention of early investors due to its consistent growth and clear direction. Ethereum ETF Expansion Sparks Market Optimism A formidable alliance of Asian crypto leaders is launching a digital asset treasury company with a billion dollars to fund Ethereum-based projects. The group consists of Huobi founder Li Lin, Fenbushi Capital’s Shen Bo, HashKey Group CEO Xiao Feng, and Meitu founder Cai Wensheng. Bloomberg reported that the team is raising hundreds of millions already and says that it’s planning to wrap the project up in the purchase of a Nasdaq-listed firm. Li Lin’s Avenir Capital has invested $200 million, and Shen Bo’s Fenbushi Capital has extensive experience in the field of blockchain. Cai Wensheng’s participation lends even more credibility. His firm, Meitu, was one of the earliest publicly traded companies to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2021. This increasing financial support in Asia strengthens market positivity for ETH ETF funds. Solana’s Hong Kong ETF Approval Adds Fuel The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has authorized ChinaAMC’s spot Solana ETF (3460) for launch on Monday. The product is the first Solana ETF approved in Asia, which highlights institutional demand for fast blockchain asset classes. According to ChinaAMC, the ETF will be denominated in HKD, CNY, and USD, and will have a management fee of 0.99%. OSL Digital Securities will carry out the trading and custody services. This comes at a time when investors expect potential approvals of Solana’s ETFs in the US later this year. With a strong performance, speed, and a strong presence across the globe, Solana has been one of the best altcoins to buy this week due to its official backing and increasing accessibility. Polkadot Boosts Utility With Asset Hub Integration Polkadot continues to build its network utility with the Asset Hub adding support for stablecoin transactions for USDT and USDC. The upgrade, which has been made possible by Crypto.com, enables direct transfers of stablecoins and other assets across the Polkadot ecosystem. Asset Hub is transforming interchain transfer and improving DeFi compatibility, making Polkadot a pioneer in blockchain interoperability. The competition is also part of Binance’s recent support for the network’s migration to enhance its liquidity and developer accessibility. These developments make DOT one of the top altcoins to invest in this week among investors looking for scalability, stablecoin integration, and multi-chain demand growth. Chainlink Whale Accumulation Signals Rising Confidence Chainlink’s on-chain activity indicates strong buying activity from large investors around the $18 range. The 30-day MVRV liquidation ratio dipped below 5% on October 17, which is a signal that has been commonly associated with heavy accumulation. Binance wallets recorded more than 400,000 LINK in large transactions as buying increased. Source: Coinglass This phase is thought to be indicative of a renewed long-term confidence in Chainlink as it continues to underpin critical blockchain infrastructure. The oracle technology of this project is still crucial in the DeFi, tokenized assets, and integration of real-world data. With the return of whales, LINK is one of the strongest utility and stability tokens during significant market fluctuations. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Stability Amid the ETF Buzz With the ETF buzz in Asia, MAGACOIN FINANCE quietly emerges as a presale space standout. It has raised over $16.5 million and demonstrates exceptional traction in a sector where many early projects wither following their launch. With its steady growth, transparent roadmap, and longer-term value proposition in contrast to short-lived presales, it stands out. In a volatile environment, investors are moving towards value-storing assets that can also help maintain trust in the community. It is quite evident that whales are already looking ahead long-term at MAGACOIN FINANCE – an altcoin that is considered by insiders to be one of the best altcoins to buy this week for investors looking for stability beyond hype. Conclusion Ethereum ETF activity in Asia has rekindled global crypto excitement. Institutional Participation is on the rise, and investor sentiment is moving in a positive direction across the market. The trust is renewed by Solana, Polkadot, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. This steady growth, adoption, and market activity are why they are considered to be one of the best altcoins to buy this week by analysts. As liquidity increases and innovation speeds up, these coins may characterize the next iteration of crypto growth.

Bitcoin Is At Risk Of Losing The 0.85 Quantile Level In its latest weekly report, analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is currently looking from the perspective of the Supply Quantiles Cost Basis model. This model maps price levels according to the amount of BTC supply that would be lost if the cryptocurrency were to trade at its current price today. There are three supply “quantiles” involved in the indicator: 0.95, 0.85, and 0.75, corresponding to levels where 5%, 15%, and 25% of the supply would be held at a loss, respectively. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Rebound? This Metric Says More Pain Needed First Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the different Bitcoin supply quantiles over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin surged above the 0.95 quantile during its price rally earlier in the month, as the supply in profit approached the 100% mark during the new all-time high (ATH). With the recent bearish action, however, the cryptocurrency has fallen below the line and is now trading around the 0.85 quantile situated at $108,600. Thus, it would appear that about 15% of the BTC supply is in the red at the moment. Bitcoin has already faced dips below this mark, so it’s possible that the coin may be at risk of losing the line. “Historically, failure to hold this threshold has signalled structural market weakness and often preceded deeper corrections toward the 0.75 quantile,” explained the analytics firm. BTC last saw such a decline to the 0.75 quantile during the consolidation period in mid-2024. Currently, this level is equivalent to $97,500. It now remains to be seen whether the asset can maintain above the 0.85 quantile, and if not, whether a retest of the 0.75 quantile will take place. The 0.95 quantile isn’t the only level that Bitcoin has lost during the recent drawdown; its price has also dropped below the average cost basis of the short-term holders (STHs) located at $113,100. STHs here refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This group is considered to represent the fragile side of the market, prone to making panic moves during times of volatility. With BTC dropping below the cost basis of the cohort, its members are now underwater. “Historically, this structure often precedes the onset of a mid-term bearish phase, as weaker hands begin to capitulate,” noted Glassnode.

Warren Slams Trump’s CZ Pardon Decision, While Supporters Rally Behind Binance Founder",https://cryptonews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-slamps-president-trump-decision-to-pardon-changpeng-zhao/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Thursday sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , calling it an example of political corruption that Congress must address. Her comments followed reports that Zhao, known widely as CZ, had sought closer ties with Trump’s circle in recent months. According to the Wall Street Journal, Zhao and his associates had backed initiatives related to the Trump family’s crypto ventures, which drew scrutiny from US lawmakers. Trump’s Inner Circle Viewed CZ Case as Weak, Warren Fires Back Trump reportedly told advisers he believed prosecutors targeted Zhao unfairly. Several insiders claimed that Trump viewed the fraud case against Zhao as weak and undeserving of a felony charge or prison sentence. In a post on X, Warren wrote: “CZ pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison. But then he financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon.” “If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption, it owns it,” she added. CZ pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison. But then he financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon. Today, he got it. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption, it owns it. pic.twitter.com/NsWeaJcVeK — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) October 23, 2025 Zhao Rejects Claims of Involvement in Trump Family’s USD1 Token Zhao has denied direct involvement in financing Trump’s stablecoin project, USD1, which is issued by World Liberty Financial, a company linked to the former president’s family. However, Bloomberg reported that Binance provided technical code for the token’s underlying smart contract, which governed its creation and transfer. The token was later used in a $2b transaction when a UAE-based firm purchased a stake in Binance . Zhao publicly rejected the report, calling it “another hit piece,” and claimed it was “sponsored by a competitor.” He accused the publication of spreading fear and misinformation in the crypto community. Warren Accused of Misrepresenting CZ’s Case as Debate Over Trump’s Pardon Deepens Warren’s remarks reignited debate over Zhao’s legal past. Critics argued that Warren misrepresented his conviction, noting that Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to implement adequate anti-money laundering controls rather than committing money laundering himself. Respectfully, the only corruption here is the corruption of the truth in your words. CZ did not please guilty to money laundering. Also, he's the only first-time offender in U.S. history to serve prison time for a single, non-fraud BSA charge This pardon addresses an injustice — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) October 23, 2025 Zhao’s 2023 plea deal resolved one of the largest enforcement actions in US crypto history. He admitted that Binance did not establish sufficient know-your-customer and compliance procedures, allowing illicit transactions on the exchange. As part of the settlement, Binance paid a $4.3b fine , and Zhao personally paid $50m before stepping down as CEO. He served a four-month prison sentence in 2024. CZ Thanks Trump, Vows to Help Make America the Capital of Crypto After receiving Trump’s pardon, Zhao said he was “deeply grateful” and pledged that Binance would support US leadership in digital assets. “Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide,” he said. Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide. (Still in flight, more posts to come.)… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 23, 2025 The decision to pardon Zhao has split political opinion. While Warren and several Democratic lawmakers condemned the move as a setback for accountability, many crypto advocates see it as a turning point for fairer treatment of the industry. The controversy arrives at a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation in the US. Trump’s administration has backed legislation to clarify oversight of exchanges and stablecoins, while Warren continues to push for tighter restrictions on crypto platforms. The post Sen.

Rowe Price, the US asset manager with $1.8 trillion in assets, has filed to launch its first crypto exchange-traded fund, according to regulatory filings and market reports. The filing seeks registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an actively managed product that would give investors exposure to a basket of digital tokens rather than a single coin. Active Fund Aims For Multiple Coins Based on reports, the proposed vehicle — referred to as the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF — would normally hold five to 15 different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are expected to be on the eligible list, along with other top tokens such as Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC). The filing describes an active approach: managers would select and weigh assets using valuation, momentum and fundamental analysis rather than simply tracking a passive benchmark. A Different Kind Of Crypto ETF Most recent US filings on Wall Street have focused on single-asset ETFs or passive funds that mirror an index. This product , by contrast, is framed as an actively managed, multi-asset fund. That distinction matters because active management gives the team flexibility to shift allocations over time, but it also introduces manager risk and typically higher fees. The filing notes the intent to seek returns that beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index, though it stops short of promising any particular outcome. Wall Street: Regulatory Hurdles Remain According to the filings, the request is now subject to the SEC’s review process. Approval is not guaranteed. Issues such as custody of digital assets, daily valuation, trading rules and operational safeguards are likely to be scrutinized by regulators before any listing is permitted. What This Could Mean For Markets Wall Street watchers say the move is significant because it signals that a large, long-standing manager is willing to offer regulated crypto exposure to mainstream clients. If the SEC approves the product, it could open another door for institutional and retail flows into a broader set of tokens, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum. That said, the active structure could lead to different performance patterns compared with passive crypto ETFs, and investors would need to weigh the potential benefits against added costs and manager decisions.

On one hand, major bank Standard Chartered PLC has flagged the potential for Bitcoin to dip below $100,000 in the near term. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions On the other hand, significant growth in global M2 money supply strengthens the backdrop for a longer-term upside. Short-Term Correction Predicted as Trade & Liquidity Risks Mount According to head of digital asset research Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could briefly fall under the $100,000 mark amid intensifying global risks, particularly the escalating U.S.–China trade tensions. BTC's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Although he deems the drop as temporary, Kendrick frames it as a “buying opportunity,” asserting this may be “the last time Bitcoin is EVER below” $100,000. He further points to shifts in capital flows, notably from gold into Bitcoin, as signs of rotation and deeper structural appeal. Technical indicators such as the 50-week moving average are cited as meaningful support zones, adding credence to his view that the correction may be short-lived. Bullish Macro Backdrop: M2 Growth & Institutional Flows Intact Despite the caution in the short run, the macro landscape offers supportive themes. Analysts note that global M2 money supply growth accounts for a significant portion of Bitcoin’s historical price variance, highlighting the asset’s evolving role beyond speculative crypto. As central banks continue to inject liquidity, Bitcoin’s correlation with broader money-supply trends reinforces its potential as a hedge or portfolio diversifier rather than purely a speculative vehicle. Furthermore, institutional interest and on-chain activity remain elevated, underscoring that this pull-back could be a healthy mid-cycle reset rather than a structural reversal. What This Means for Bitcoin (BTC) Investors In practical terms, investors should brace for potential near-term downside around or below $100,000 while keeping an eye on key support levels and macro catalysts. Kend­rick maintains his bullish target of $200,000 by year-end and even $500,000 by 2028, suggesting that the current dip could represent a long-term entry point. Related Reading: Last-Ever Bitcoin Dip Below $100,000 Looms This Week, Standard Chartered Warns At the same time, the market remains exposed to trade-war developments, Fed policy surprises, and liquidity shocks, factors that could trigger more substantial movement.

Source: X Every pullback received a consistent buying interest from large owners, and based on Merlijn the Trader, Ethereum is tracking the identical trail of Gold before its rocket launch. This comparison has elicited optimism within social media with traders seeking confirmation candles beyond the downward channel. Provided that the support level of $3,800 is not broken, Ethereum is capable of starting a breakout phase that will see it go beyond $4,100 in a matter of days. The failure to sustain the zone may however, result in a retest to short-term around $3,400 before another higher low is established. In any case, the sentiment is biased towards a continued bullish trend in the next sessions. HYPE and Cardano Show Early Recovery Signs Traders note that HYPE is hovering near the $34.5 mark, maintaining a slight edge above its $34 support. Past trading sessions show the MVN region often sparks price rebounds, and several analysts suggest this zone could attract new buyers. If momentum continues, a climb toward $37.8 and possibly $40.7 remains within reach. Market watchers also point to the $36.2 range as an area where stronger movement could confirm the next bullish phase. However, Cardano price is resistant to recent volatility. The token has observed its higher low set up and has stood firm around the $0.63 region. Analyst Ali Charts pointed out that “a breakout structure was still valid, which supported the bullish outlook of Cardano over the long term. As long as ADA can maintain this structure, its next upward leg might revisit the range of $0.80-$1.00 and then extend to $1.30. Source: X Across both assets, traders are showing renewed confidence, suggesting that capital rotation is already underway from older large-cap coins toward smaller, higher-upside opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Surges as Investors Rush In The increased buzz on the early-stage projects has made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the fastest-expanding presales in 2025. CoinMarketCap tracking data shows the project has already collected over $16.5 million and attracted over 16,000 investors within a relatively short period of time. Over 89% of the presale tokens in circulation are already sold, and there is little time to get other buyers before the next stage. There is growing institutional interest as traders anticipate the next token exchange listings, which would open the global market to more people. With early participation, there is a rapid expectancy of price discovery as the listing processes proceed, which causes valuations to grow with an increase in liquidity. Analysts refer to this stage as the“final opportunity” to achieve early-stage access before larger availability leads to demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE marked its recent milestone with a 50% bonus under the PATRIOT50X code, a move aimed at rewarding early supporters. The incentive has drawn noticeable attention, with the presale continuing to attract steady participation as pricing steps advance. Consequently, analysts have flagged the crypto presale as the best altcoin to buy before listings in 2025 Q4. Final Take Across the market, participants appear to be building positions in select assets rather than chasing volatility. As networks such as Ethereum, Cardano, and HYPE refine their ecosystems, interest is gradually shifting toward presales that combine timing, scarcity, and tangible use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits within that narrative, supported by an active base of holders, early traction in its rollout, and a defined roadmap that extends toward its liquidity phase. To individuals who are scanning the market for the best crypto to buy before the 2025 rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE is providing a limited time slot to join the presale before it ends. Its robust momentum, future exchange access, and growing base of investors keep making it the best crypto to buy at present as anticipation runs throughout the market.

While the price remains within a defined range, recent signals from several market watchers suggest a possible shift in direction. However, the likelihood of a correction appears firmer at the moment. Technical Setup Suggests Room for Upside XRP continues to move within an ascending channel that has held since late 2024. According to ChartNerd, the asset is currently testing support at the lower end of that channel, near $2.40. On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram shows a series of higher lows, even as the price trends sideways—often read as a sign of building momentum. $XRP is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the horizon. Channel support awaits below, with HLs on the weekly MACD, and SRSI levels in oversold territory. $5 is the first move of many on the next impulse. I believe XRP will front-run within the bluechips category – #NFA pic.twitter.com/uCtPmOb2wz — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 23, 2025 The Stochastic RSI has dropped into oversold territory, printing a level of 6.24. Previous setups like this have preceded upward moves, though confirmation is still needed. ChartNerd said the first upside target in this scenario sits around $5, in line with the channel’s top range. Near-Term Pressure Still in Play While long-term signals look constructive, short-term charts show continued weakness. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a bearish view, noting that XRP has broken below a key support at $2.60. The current setup shows lower highs and lower lows, which supports a possible retest of $2.00. “$XRP continues to slide. Next key target sits at $2,” Ali posted. Unless the price reclaims the $2.60 level, the short-term structure leans bearish. This range is also consistent with levels where buying interest returned earlier this year. Source: Ali Martinez/X Moreover, traders are monitoring two main zones. CryptoWZRD pointed to $2.30 as a support level that could attract buyers if retested. A move above $2.55 would mark the next resistance and may set up a stronger recovery. XRP closed the previous daily candle with a slight loss, while XRPBTC also moved lower. WZRD noted, “XRP will follow XRPBTC and Bitcoin’s overall price action tomorrow.” A move toward $2.75 remains in play if the broader market turns. Large Holders Trim Positions According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, wallets holding over 1 billion XRP have offloaded approximately 1.09 billion tokens since October 16. This $2.63 billion shift marks one of the larger whale moves in recent weeks. Mid-size wallets also saw declines, though at a slower pace. Even with these movements, the price held steady between $2.33 and $2.44. Analysts described this range as an accumulation zone rather than a breakdown. Institutions appear to be rotating within the range ahead of possible catalysts. Ripple-backed firm Evernorth announced plans to list on Nasdaq via a merger, as previously reported . The company will focus on building services around XRP, adding to market interest in the asset’s long-term outlook.

The press release is France’s leadership attempting to address concerns about the EU’s aggressive EV targets amid economic challenges. France is still committed to decarbonization efforts The press release begins by reaffirming France’s commitment to supporting the competitiveness of the French automotive sector, a competitiveness it says is based on the “ability to innovate, invest in future technologies and guarantee fair conditions in the face of international competition.” It then goes on to talk about France’s priority, which is to produce in France and in Europe the vehicles sold on the continent, so as to strengthen strategic autonomy, preserve jobs and make the automotive industry a pillar of the European ecological transition. “The Minister for Ecological Transition, Biodiversity and International Negotiations on Climate and Nature, Monique Barbut, the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industrial, Energy and Digital Sovereignty, Roland Lescure, and the Minister Delegate for Industry, Sébastien Martin, hope that the European regulation on CO2 emissions from new vehicles will above all serve automobile production in Europe and introduce a real incentive for European preference in the automobile industry to increase investments and industrial establishments in France and on the continent, particularly in electric vehicles,” the press release states. It goes on further to state how France wishes to pursue the electrification of vehicles and will defend flexibilities in terms of technological neutrality, but only if they are paired with very clear measures to encourage European preference that support industrial jobs in Europe. “It is in this spirit that France has already defended and obtained the smoothing of manufacturers’ objectives between 2025 and 2027,” it says. “This means producing vehicles sold within the Union in Europe, using European components. Vehicles that benefit European equipment manufacturers and help maintain and create industrial jobs in Europe must be supported.” The document also mentioned batteries and electric motors, as well as some of the most sensitive electronic components, and how they need to be produced in Europe because its “sovereignty over a strategic technology for the future of mobility depends on it.” The document concluded by reiterating France’s plan to prioritize responsibility and pragmatism, without compromising on the ambition or commitments that were made to the French people and to Europe. EU drafts measures to control prices in its new carbon market The official joint statement from France’s Ministries of Ecological Transition and Economy comes after news revealed the European Union is drafting measures to control prices in its new carbon market, a direct response to governments’ concerns that the emissions-cutting scheme could increase fuel bills. The policy is designed to impose a price from 2027 on planet-heating emissions produced by heating and transport fuels, pushing more consumers to shift to electric vehicles and cleaner home heating systems. Revenue generated from the scheme will reportedly be spent on helping people pay bills, subsidize electric cars and energy-saving home renovations. The big issue is that some governments are worried the measure will stoke opposition to climate change policies from citizens, especially if they feel like it is raising their bills. So far this year, a group of 19 countries, including the Czech Republic, France and Germany have asked Brussels to introduce stricter price controls to address this. “I understand the concerns regarding uncertainties on future price levels and price volatility in ETS2 (the upcoming carbon market) and share those to a large extent,” EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said, in a letter addressing the demands. Hoekstra has also said the Commission will propose doubling the number of permits released in this scenario to potentially reach up to 80 million per year in 2027, 2028 and 2029 which will more decisively address unwarranted price rises and improve market confidence, both crucial factors that influence decarbonization investments. In 2026, the Commission will also propose launching carbon permit auctions to ensure governments have the funds to kick-start investments that will help people make the shift more easily.

The metal that once symbolized stability is now showing cracks, while BTC, the asset branded as volatile, has remained remarkably resilient. What It Means For Bitcoin Next Market Cycle For decades, gold has been hailed as the ultimate safe-haven, and it has been rock-solid. However, a seasoned financial analyst, Tom Tucker, has revealed on X that Gold, the world’s oldest store of value, has lost $2.5 trillion in market value, which is more than the entire Bitcoin market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supercycle? Jeff Park Says Gold’s $1 Trillion Gains Could Spark It Meanwhile, the crypto Fear and Greed Index is flashing extreme fear, signaling that sentiment across digital assets is near panic levels. Tom Tucker warns that traders should stay cautious, as BTC could follow the gold path. CryptoMichNL, the CIO and Founder of MNFund and MNCapital, has observed that gold has printed a harsh move, as it corrected by more than 8% in a single day. At the same time, Bitcoin moved up massively, but later gave back most of its gains. According to CryptoMichNL, this turbulence in gold is not a lasting trend. The volatility of gold is extremely high, which is a direct consequence of its status as a massive outlier with an incredible parabolic run over recent months. If gold has indeed topped out, that would open the door for capital rotation towards other assets. However, a soft Consumer Price Index (CPI) print on the horizon should trigger the potential rate cuts and the end of the US government shutdown. Otherwise, BTC’s consolidation might start running as risk-on appetite. Why Bitcoin Will Extend Above Its Recent Consolidation Historically, Gold has seen sharp drawdowns. Senior Analyst at CoinDesk and Advisor at Coinsilium Group and ForzaBitcoin, James Van Straten, explained that the last significant gold correction took place in August 2020. On August 6, gold hit an all-time high of $2,035, only to drop 5% on August 11, and then enter a 20% correction that lasted roughly seven months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Taken Gold’s Role In Today’s World, Eric Trump Says During that same period, Bitcoin was consolidating below $10,000 before surging to new highs that year, a move largely fueled by COVID-19-era stimulus, which acted as a powerful accelerant. Fast forward to today, James Van Straten believes that as BTC’s current phase is consolidating above $100,000, it may extend mid-cycle. This is due to strong parallels that gold has once again entered a significant correction, crypto liquidation events, the specter of a US government shutdown, looming rate cuts, and AI-driven capex expenditure, which continues to shape market sentiment and liquidity dynamics.

Here’s the full schedule. WazirX Trading Restart Will Begin Rolling Out This Friday As announced in a new blogpost , WazirX is finally gearing up to restart trading. The crypto platform has been inoperational since July 2024, when it fell prey to a massive $235 million hack . User funds have remained stuck with WazirX in this period, but with the exchange now rolling out a restart, creditors should at last be able to get their digital assets back. According to the blog post, the platform will enable trading in phases over four days, starting October 24th and reaching full activation by October 27th. Each day, around 25% of all tokens will go on listing. During this initial rollout, all tokens will be available for trading in the USDT market, but INR trading pairs outside of USDT/INR will be gradually enabled later. WazirX explained: This phased rollout will help restore liquidity safely, confirm technical stability, and ensure a gradual and reliable return to normal trading across all market pairs. The Indian exchange is also set to offer zero trading fees for the first 30 days of the restart, with a potential extension depending on how the community responds to it. The trading restart announcement comes a day after WazirX reopened both INR and crypto deposits. Although the blog post contained no clarification about when withdrawals will start, the platform’s founder and CEO, Nischal Shetty, has shared the relevant info in an X post . Shetty has noted that INR withdrawals are already live on the exchange, with crypto withdrawals beginning alongside the trading restart on Friday. “We will continue to add more tokens to the trading and withdrawal list,” said the WazirX CEO. WazirX’s reopening arrives after several months of proceedings in Singapore’s High Court, where the platform’s parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd, a Singaporean entity, had to obtain the green light for a restructuring scheme. The High Court finally approved the scheme earlier this month, and WazirX made it active on October 15th. The exchange had promised a restart within 10 business days, and with the plan to restart on October 24th, it appears to be right on schedule. In July of this year, CoinDCX , another major Indian crypto exchange, also suffered a breach. Hackers stole around $44 million in digital assets, but in this case, the tokens came from the exchange’s own internal treasury, not user funds. The timing of the hack was eerie, as it occurred exactly one year and one day after the WazirX incident. The WazirX hack has been linked with the North Korean Lazarus Group, and CoinDCX’s event is also suspected to involve the same or a similar entity.

The Company also revealed it would be staking its SOL holdings directly from custody at Anchorage Digital Bank. On-chain data showed that Solana Company currently has over 2.2 million SOL in its treasury, worth around $396 million, which it will use for its staking initiatives. According to the Company, the collaboration aims to earn the firm more staking rewards, enable it to participate in governance, and also boost support for the Solana network. HSDT seeks to earn more staking rewards Can’t get rid of us that easily 🙃 We’re back and now staking with @Heliuslabs and other top Solana validators @TwinStake_IO and @Anchorage to strengthen our $SOL treasury. Earning onchain yield in a secure and compliant way while continuing to support the Solana ecosystem 🫡 pic.twitter.com/FziozHCRvj — Solana Company $HSDT (@Solana_Company) October 23, 2025 Helius and Twinstake ( both Providers) have already established non-custodial staking and restaking solutions that allow the Company’s users to delegate, stake, and restake their digital assets to earn rewards. According to the announcement, the firms agreed that the Providers will provide the Company with certain services, including staking, voting with staked tokens, and reporting on the staked tokens. Joseph Chee, executive chairman of HSDT and chairman of Summer Capital, acknowledged that staking with industry giants like Helius and Twinstake allows firms to strengthen the operations of their SOL holdings while contributing to the Solana network. He also noted that both Providers rank among the top 25 validators on the Solana ecosystem by total SOL staked, arguing that they have an established track record and strong confidence within the community. Cosmo Jiang, board observer at HSDT, explained that the firm sees staking as a core part of its return generation strategy and a show of its commitment to Solana’s long-term growth. He added that such partnerships position HSDT to maximize on-chain yield in a secure, compliant, and scalable manner. Jiang also acknowledged that collaborating with top-tier validators such as Helius reinforces the firm’s focus on institutional-grade execution and network alignment. At the time of publication, Helius has over 13 million SOL staked on its platform. The leading Solana validator also offers institutional-grade staking services and operates SOC 2 Type II-compliant infrastructure, which it said ensures uptime, performance, and security. The Company revealed that Twinstake and Anchorage Digital’s regulated and enterprise-level staking expands the firm’s exposure to the broader Solana validator ecosystem. “Crypto is connecting the internet of value. Solana today is the only blockchain network with the scale to onboard all of the world’s capital markets, microtransactions, and AI payments. Together with the Solana Company, we’re accelerating institutional adoption of Solana, and building the future of the world’s trading terminal.” – Mert Mumtaz , Co-Founder and CEO of Helius. The Company noted that Solana has historically been the fastest-growing blockchain in transaction volume, processing more than 3,500 transactions per second. Solana’s adoption has also surged, with an average of approximately 3.7 million daily active wallets, and it has surpassed 23 billion transactions year-to-date. Solana Company also cited SOL as a financially productive blockchain, which offers a ~7% native staking yield compared to other assets like BTC, which are non-yield-bearing. HSDT seeks to support tokenized networks by providing SOL holding services HSDT revealed that its mission as an independent treasury company is to support the growth and security of tokenized networks by providing long-term SOL holding services. The firm, formerly Helius Medical Technologies, added that it continues to develop its neurotech and medical device operations. HSDT previously developed medical devices, but has since transitioned to a Solana-focused treasury company, which offers regulated market exposure to the Solana network. The firm diversified into SOL treasury operations as it sought to stabilize its finances after its stock collapsed from $182.75 in June to $9.76 a month later. The Company started its treasury operations on September 15, but has yet to onboard investors. At the time of publication, HSDT shares are currently trading at $6.63, up more than 6.55% after the partnership announcement. The firm’s stock price has also plummeted by nearly 60% in the past 30 days, according to Google Finance data. Chee argued that volatility created opportunity, and conviction is tested in such initiatives. He also affirmed that HSDT is not running from market pressure, but rather leaning into it.

In a recent analysis shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO unveiled what he described as XRP’s worst-case scenario before a potential major rally . His chart, showing what he called the “biggest liquidation candle in history,” sent shockwaves through the community and reignited discussion on how far XRP could fall, or soar, next. The Shockwave: A Record-Breaking Liquidation Event Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency market was rocked by one of the largest liquidation events ever recorded . More than $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in a matter of hours, sparking panic across exchanges. XRP was among the hardest hit, plunging sharply before staging a swift recovery that caught many traders off guard. Are you mentally prepared for this possible #XRP scenario? pic.twitter.com/JiLl1l0xhL — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 22, 2025 On the Bitstamp 2-hour chart, Steph identified a massive liquidation wick that marked a key turning point. The candle, which he referred to as the biggest in history, represented the moment when over-leveraged traders were flushed out of the market. Such capitulation events, while brutal, often serve as a cleansing reset that clears excess leverage and paves the way for a stronger, more sustainable uptrend. Technical Breakdown: When Pain Becomes Opportunity From a technical perspective, the chart shows XRP collapsing into a deep liquidity zone before rebounding with force—a classic market reset. As stop-losses triggered and margin calls cascaded, XRP’s price fell into oversold territory. Within hours, institutional buy orders stepped in, triggering a dramatic reversal. Steph explained that this move may have defined XRP’s lowest boundary for the current cycle—a point of maximum pain that could precede significant upside momentum. By wiping out weak hands and overextended positions, the market effectively leveled the playing field, creating the conditions for a more stable recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This pattern is not unique to XRP; similar liquidations have historically marked the end of bearish phases in other major cryptocurrencies, often followed by explosive rallies once market confidence returns. Market Psychology: Fear Before the Breakout Despite the initial panic, market sentiment has begun to shift. Trading volume has rebounded, open interest has normalized, and long-term holders appear to be accumulating again. These are often the early signals of a recovery phase, suggesting that the worst may be behind. However, Steph cautioned that volatility will remain elevated. The market could continue to test investor resolve before confirming a sustained uptrend. In his view, success in this environment depends less on predicting every price move and more on maintaining emotional discipline through uncertainty. The Mental Game: Surviving the Storm XRP’s recent price action wasn’t just a technical event—it was a psychological test. The “biggest liquidation candle in history” exposed the emotional extremes that drive the crypto market: fear, panic, and disbelief. Yet, as Steph emphasized, those moments of capitulation often precede transformation. If his analysis proves correct, XRP may have already faced its harshest downside scenario. What lies ahead could be the beginning of the long-awaited rally— but only for those mentally prepared to withstand the volatility that comes before it.

The price is now struggling to clear $2.420 and might decline if it trades below the $2.350 support. XRP price is attempting to recover above the $2.350 zone. The price is now trading above $2.350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.420 resistance. XRP Price Attempts Recovery XRP price formed a base above $2.30 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price surpassed the $2.3750 and $2.380 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5320 swing high to the $2.3275 low. However, the bears are currently active near the $2.420 zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.420 level. It is also close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5320 swing high to the $2.3275 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.480 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.380 level. The next major support is near the $2.350 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.350 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.250 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.20. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

The expansion spans Fidelity Crypto, Fidelity Crypto for IRAs, Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers and Fidelity Digital Assets, which caters to institutional clients. The move signals the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. It also comes as Solana cements its position as one of the most traded digital assets globally, supported by its growing developer base and expanding institutional footprint. Nick Ducoff, head of institutional growth at the Solana Foundation, confirmed the rollout on X, sharing screenshots that showed Solana listed as a tradable asset on Fidelity’s platform. Retail investors in U.S. can now purchase SOL in their @Fidelity brokerage account Some screenshots from my account NFA pic.twitter.com/gDqOdSpp6C — Nick Ducoff (@nickducoff) October 23, 2025 Fidelity Highlights Solana’s Cost Efficiency And Scalability Fidelity published an explainer on Solana on Thursday, describing it as a blockchain that processes about 60,000 transactions per minute on average, compared with roughly 250 for Bitcoin and 800 for Ethereum. The company noted that Solana’s transaction fees are typically just fractions of a cent, while Bitcoin and Ethereum often cost at least 50 cents per transaction. Solana, like Ethereum, allows third-party developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts on its network. Its speed and low costs have made it popular for payments, trading, and new blockchain-based projects. Frequent Network Outages Raise Questions About Solana’s Long-Term Stability However, Solana’s rise has not been without setbacks. The network has faced reliability challenges in the past, with several major outages that raised concerns about its stability. The most recent incident occurred in Feb. 2024, when the blockchain went offline for five hours . The outage was its first in over a year, signaling some improvement in network performance, though critics still question whether Solana can maintain consistent uptime under heavy demand. Earlier this year, in March 2025, congestion issues resurfaced when a memecoin frenzy briefly crippled the network. The surge in activity made Solana nearly unusable for several hours, prompting renewed scrutiny of its scalability claims. Institutional Access Expands as Solana ETFs Gain Traction Across Major Markets Despite these hurdles, Solana’s market momentum continues to grow. The 21Shares Solana Spot ETF in the US recently received approval following the SEC’s clearance of its Form 8-A filing, enabling it to trade on a major American exchange. The product gives investors direct exposure to Solana’s spot price, a milestone that could further boost institutional participation. In Asia, Hong Kong’s securities regulator also approved its first Solana spot ETF this week. The move makes Solana the third cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to gain such approval in the city and strengthens Hong Kong’s bid to become a leading hub for regulated digital assets. Fidelity’s addition of Solana rounds out a significant month for the blockchain, which has seen growing adoption from both Wall Street and global regulators. The listing offers investors a new entry point into one of the industry’s fastest-growing ecosystems, signaling that digital assets are becoming a permanent fixture in the financial mainstream.

Bullock also noted the importance of security. While delivering a speech on Friday, October 24, that did not address monetary policy or the state of the economy, the RBA’s governor mentioned that innovation and resilience are not conflicting ideas; therefore, based on her argument, they can and should work together. “In all these areas, the RBA and other regulators are working with industry and the government to create benefits for the public,” she added. Bullock outlines four key areas that need improvement in the payment sector Earlier, Bullock pointed out that the RBA’s main focus is to enhance Australia’s account-to-account payment infrastructure, starting with the implementation of updates to the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS). Notably, the BECS is an outdated network for managing payroll and welfare transfers . Following this announcement , analysts acknowledged that BECS remains a dependable and affordable option. However, they revealed that the system lacked modern features such as real-time processing available 24/7 or the ability to offer detailed payment information. According to them, these features are available in the New Payments Platform. To demonstrate their commitment to transforming the system, a roundtable comprising the RBA, Treasury, and industry groups announced that it is formulating a plan for replacing this system by the end of this year. After creating the plan, they intend to implement it by mid-2026. Bullock hinted that the process will consider the balance between costs and reliability, as well as the trade-off between old systems and innovations, and the diverse needs of users. “As with all payment systems, the interests of various parties do not always match up,” she added. The governor also mentioned that the second area requiring enhancements is cross-border payments. To address this, the RBA will work with industry leaders to implement new data and infrastructure, making international transfers quicker, cheaper, and clearer. On the other hand, the third area is on stopping fraud and scam activities. Regarding this area of focus, Bullock noted that continuous development is essential, as criminals continually adapt their methods. She also emphasized the urgency of preparing for improvements in quantum computing by updating card systems to utilize the Advanced Encryption Standard, a protocol designed to protect against quantum threats. For the fourth area, the governor emphasized the need to strengthen operational resilience. Based on her argument, this meant that it is essential to ensure the payment network remains secure and reliable, even as systems age or connections become more complex. RBA’s governor calls for an effective cash distribution system Bullock said that the RBA is exploring how links between systems can exacerbate outages and assessing how its settlement infrastructure may need to adapt to new forms of digital money , such as central bank digital currencies. She made this statement, acknowledging that while digital payments have flourished, the central bank remains committed to ensuring that cash is available for Australians who wish to use it. In the meantime, the decline in cash usage has added pressure to the distribution network, prompting regulators to initiate discussions on new rules that would help mitigate risks and ensure access. Following the intense nature of the situation, Bullock explained that they are currently involved in discussions with leading banks, the broader industry, and the government about enhancing their operating model. According to the governor, this will ensure that cash remains a useful form of payment in the future. She further highlighted their goal is to create a more efficient, sustainable, and firm cash distribution system. Meanwhile, RBA Assistant Governor Christopher Kent noted that the central bank believes the drag from tight financial regulations is loosening, a development that could help keep the economy around full employment and steer inflation back to target. The comments were made after Kent, who is responsible for the central bank’s dealings with financial markets, noted that narrower loan spreads and households making extra mortgage repayments as interest rates fall suggest conditions are starting to improve.

Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions The rally follows renewed investor optimism fueled by institutional participation and aggressive whale activity. Traders are now watching the $41.76 resistance level, a breakout point that could confirm a full trend reversal. Having reclaimed the key 61.8% Fibonacci level at $35.84, the Hyperliquid price is showing resilience amid broader market volatility, with volume spikes reflecting rising demand for exposure ahead of upcoming corporate milestones. $1B Fundraising and Public Listing Plans Spark Institutional Excitement The catalyst behind the rally stems from Hyperliquid Strategies Inc.’s recent S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), detailing plans to raise up to $1 billion through a 160 million-share public offering. The funds are set to support ecosystem expansion and HYPE token accumulation, further bridging decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional markets. The entity, formed from a merger between Nasdaq-listed Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Rorschach I LLC, intends to become a publicly traded crypto treasury management firm under the Hyperliquid umbrella. Analysts see this move as a major step toward institutional legitimacy, with parts of the proceeds earmarked for token buybacks and staking operations.

Source: HYPEUSD on Tradingview How the Developments Will Affect the Hyperliquid Price The merger and $1 billion fundraising are expected to drive a lasting bullish impact on the Hyperliquid price.

With Bitcoin whales accumulating over $580 million , analysts believe smart money crypto picks are rotating into altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising star with growing whale accumulation and millions already raised. Bitcoin Whales Accumulate $580M Amid Rising Market Conviction The surge in Bitcoin whale accumulation shows that institutional buyers are once again confident. Over the past week, Bitcoin whales accumulate $580 million, with spot ETFs recording inflows of $477.2 million after several days of outflows. This uptick marks a sharp shift in sentiment among large players known for timing market bottoms. $580M accumulated by Bitcoin whales indicates renewed long-term confidence. $72M deployed into leveraged Bitcoin longs on Hyperliquid shows rising institutional interest. Analysts call this one of the strongest signals of smart money returning to crypto. X post by Ted captured the trend perfectly: “Another OG whale sold $40,240,000 in $BTC today. He still holds $1.18B in Bitcoin.” This kind of repositioning suggests that Bitcoin whales are not exiting — they’re rebalancing ahead of what could be the next strong uptrend. Such activity aligns with rising Bitcoin whale activity 2025 projections, where accumulation patterns often precede major rallies. With smart money crypto picks now targeting strategic assets, investors are watching which altcoins may follow Bitcoin’s path in the coming months. DOGE Whales Load Up $120M: Could This Be the Calm Before the Next Breakout? Over the past week, Dogecoin whales accumulated 10.5 billion DOGE , roughly valued at $120 million. This sharp accumulation happened while DOGE’s price dropped, showing conviction from large holders even as retail traders hesitated. 10.50 billion DOGE accumulated at $0.21 forms a massive resistance zone. DOGE price prediction 2025 remains optimistic among analysts tracking whale activity. DOGE trades in the lower band of its long-term ascending channel — often a historical buy zone. DOGE price analysis Analyst Ali Martinez posted on X: “10.50 billion $DOGE were accumulated at $0.21. That’s a big resistance zone forming. Keep this level on your radar!” Meanwhile, Ether Nasyonal noted in an X post: “DOGE momentum is at historical lows. It’s calm, quiet, yet determined. When the next movement begins, many will once again say, ‘If only.’” These views suggest DOGE may be entering the “accumulation before explosion” phase. With large wallets loading up, DOGE, HYPE, and MAGACOIN FINANCE favorites could headline the top cryptos for next bull run narratives. HYPE Faces Institutional Selling but Analysts Stay Bullish on Long-Term Forecasts While DOGE and Bitcoin show strong accumulation, HYPE crypto price forecast remains a mix of caution and optimism. On-chain data confirmed that a major institution sold $65.43 million in HYPE during a three-day selling spree — part of a strategic rotation into Solana. 1.817M HYPE tokens sold for $65.43 million USDC at $36 average price. The institution originally held 1 million SOL worth of allocations. Despite the sale, analysts see strong long-term recovery potential. An X post from Arthur Hayes read: “HYPE multiple compression is a risk. Annual revenue is almost back to ATH, but price is much lower. Degens are cautious about paying for future uncertain revenues.” HYPE price analysis Analyst Dippy countered with optimism and stated that HYPE is one of the top assets of this cycle. “There’s no scenario where that changes.” Even with temporary selling pressure, the Bitcoin whales accumulate as smart money rotates into altcoins narrative suggests that HYPE remains on the radar of major investors looking beyond short-term moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Smart Money Pick with $16.5M Raised As Bitcoin whale accumulation fuels broader optimism, emerging altcoins are gaining traction — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that wave. With over $16.5 million already raised , this project has drawn growing attention for its early whale accumulation and solid development momentum. $16.5M raised , signaling strong early demand. Investors call it one of the best altcoins to buy now before the next bull run. Rumors suggest a future exchange listing could drive a major price breakout. Recent reports show Bitcoin whales rotate into altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, viewing it as one of the smart money crypto picks with long-term potential. Analysts say the mix of accumulation, utility development, and community traction makes it a standout for those seeking the best crypto to buy now after Bitcoin whale accumulation . With smart investors moving early, MAGACOIN FINANCE could soon join DOGE, HYPE, and MAGACOIN FINANCE favorites at the top of the next market wave. The Final Verdict: Could DOGE, HYPE, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Lead the Next Market Surge? The pattern is clear — Bitcoin whale accumulation is growing, and large holders are strategically rotating into key altcoins. Dogecoin’s $120M whale entry, HYPE’s institutional reshuffle, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early success all point toward a broad smart money realignment. These movements show what many analysts describe as smart money repositioning ahead of Q4’s potential surge. While no one can predict exact outcomes, the rotation into DOGE, HYPE, and MAGACOIN FINANCE suggests investors are quietly preparing for the top cryptos for next bull run . FAQs 1. Why are Bitcoin whales accumulating now? Whales often accumulate when prices are suppressed, indicating confidence in upcoming market strength. 2. What’s driving Dogecoin whale buying? Analysts like Ali Martinez point to accumulation near $0.21 and believe DOGE is in a quiet recovery phase. Many see it as a potential 5x opportunity by year-end. 3. Is HYPE still a good investment after institutional selling? Yes, while some selling occurred, analysts such as Dippy still include HYPE in smart money crypto picks, citing strong fundamentals and reduced risk after the correction. 4.

According to sources cited by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, both sides met with industry leaders, including executives from Coinbase and Ripple, to press ahead on draft language and priorities. Lawmakers And Crypto Industry Execs Meet The session hosted by Senate Democrats opened with over 30 minutes of introductions from industry representatives. Each person laid out the items they wanted reflected in the bill. Senators warned the executives not to become visible political allies for Republicans, saying recent leaks around a DeFi proposal had shaken trust. One lawmaker was quoted as saying “no slow walking was happening,” a line that aimed to reassure participants the process would move forward.

Attendees agreed the bill must strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) checks and clamp down on other forms of illegal finance. They also called for a clear definition of decentralized finance, which lawmakers said is needed so proposed rules cover that sector fully. The discussion led to two concrete recommendations: oversight should center on intermediaries rather than on blockchain protocols, and lawmakers should sit down with industry to review the bill line by line in an extended joint session. DeFi Definitions And Oversight Debates Continue Based on reports, the debate over how to define DeFi remains one of the main sticking points. Industry leaders argued for limits that protect innovation, while some senators pushed for language that would make enforcement easier. Earlier efforts, including a meeting led by David Sacks with Senate Republicans, were mentioned as part of the push to speed things up. Both sides signaled they are ready to keep negotiating details until agreement is reached.

Lawmakers appeared optimistic but also cautious: progress depends on resolving disagreements over DeFi and on avoiding public fights that could slow the process. Reports noted that outside events, such as the next Federal Reserve meeting, could change how markets react to any new rules, though the timing of legislation itself is driven by negotiation, not by macro announcements. Reports also say further contributions are expected in the coming days as staff and lawmakers refine the text. Participants recommended joint sessions where negotiators and industry would work through language carefully, line by line. That approach is meant to cut down on last-minute surprises and to give both sides a chance to iron out details.

Trump’s administration is pushing regulators to advance Trump’s AI and manufacturing goals. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to adopt an expedited 60-day review process for grid connection requests from large data centers. If approved, the rule would provide rapid access to power for hyperscale data centers, which support AI infrastructure for providers such as Amazon and OpenAI. Wright urges the FERC to adopt the 60-day review process for Hyperscalers According to a Bloomberg report , the 60-day proposal would shift from the existing regulatory model, where approvals often take multiple years. It would also help President Trump fulfil his campaign promise to scale AI capabilities as part of a broader domestic manufacturing revival. “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable and secure electricity,” – Chris Wright, Energy Secretary Meanwhile, state energy regulators have raised concerns over potential risks of connecting data centers directly to power grids. Several states argue that they are already struggling with surging demand from EVs, factories, and data centers; the rule could only add strain and potentially translate to huge bills for small households and businesses. Wright’s proposal, however, contains conditions intended to mitigate such concerns. For instance, Data centers seeking fast-tracked approval times must either invest in new generation capacity or agree to scale down during grid peak times, such as summer heatwaves. Previous disputes, such as the FERC’s rejection of Talen Energy’s plan to directly power an Amazon facility from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant, may weigh in. The plan intended to expand behind-the-meter power sales from 300 MW to 480 MW. The regulator argued that PJM failed to prove that the deal was consistent with grid reliability standards. Such disputes have shown the escalation between federal ambitions and state-level oversight. Energy expert argues AI data centers may stabilize U.S. power grid Some power industry experts have argued against the growing public perception that AI infrastructures are driving up costs. Nate Mason, Energy expert at the Atlantic Council, argued that data centers can become part of the solution to drive down costs. He noted that many new facilities are collaborating with co-located generation plants, such as gas turbines and modular reactor systems, which may feed surplus electricity back to the grid. Such plans could drive down the cost of electricity, reduce grid congestion, and also create new private power-generating and storage facilities. Mason also advocated for time-of-use and value-based pricing models where data centers and small consumers can pay fluctuating rates depending on real-time demand. He believes the pricing model could flatten peak loads and make energy use more efficient across the U.S. The emerging debate over grid reforms reflects the need for a key policy to maintain the U.S. leadership in the AI revolution. Both Hyperscalers and small consumers have acknowledged that AI, electrification, and even domestic manufacturing plants will demand a huge energy supply. However, they remain torn on who pays the price and who benefits. The Trump administration views the 60-day rule as a catalyst for modernization and innovation, aiming to fulfill Trump’s AI and manufacturing goals. On the flip side, some critics have argued that the rule may shift the burden from large corporations to ordinary citizens. Data centers may benefit from the proposed rule if they incorporate new generating streams or agree to reduce usage during peak demand hours. Also, feasibility studies may be required for cases such as the Talen Amazon proposal, which planned to connect to an existing power plant.

Pundit Says We’re Entering Rippy Season,https://timestabloid.com/research-firm-confirms-37-50-xrp-price-target-pundit-says-were-entering-rippy-season/,"A quiet tension is building across the crypto market. For months, XRP has traded in a narrow range, steady, subdued, and often overlooked. But that calm appears to be ending. A respected research firm has confirmed a bold new price target for XRP, and one analyst says we’re entering “Rippy Season” — a period that could redefine the token’s trajectory. Sistine Research Confirms $37–$50 Target for XRP The renewed optimism stems from Sistine Research , a digital asset analytics firm known for its precise, data-driven market models. In its latest projection, Sistine set a long-term XRP price target between $37 and $50, citing technical structure, liquidity flow models, and macro indicators that point toward a potential major breakout. The report caught fire after being shared by Amonyx, a prominent XRP analyst and commentator on X. “We’re not guessing anymore, we’re entering Rippy Season,” Amonyx wrote, summarizing the growing confidence that XRP may finally be approaching the explosive phase long anticipated by its supporters. According to Sistine’s analysis, XRP is forming a setup similar to those seen before massive rallies in other digital assets. The key threshold, they note, lies around $2.80–$3.20, a resistance zone that, once breached, could unlock the next stage of rapid appreciation driven by institutional participation. $XRP : $37 – $50 target confirmed by Sistine Research. We’re not guessing anymore — we’re entering Rippy Season. pic.twitter.com/2N7qu1ACWu — Amonyx (@amonbuy) October 22, 2025 XRP’s Current Market Landscape As of report time, XRP trades near $2.38. Market data shows that liquidity remains deep, with strong technical support at the $2 level — a sign that accumulation may be underway rather than distribution. Momentum has been supported by a shift in regulatory sentiment following the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC case in June 2025. With the legal uncertainty finally resolved, institutional interest in XRP has strengthened. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, already used in tokenized money market funds through firms like Securitize, has reinforced XRP’s relevance as a bridge asset for real-world financial operations. If this institutional adoption continues to expand across U.S. and European fintech networks, it could form the fundamental basis for the higher valuations outlined in Sistine’s model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The “Rippy Season” When Amonyx declared that “we’re entering Rippy Season,” it wasn’t just a rallying cry — it reflected a shift in market psychology. The term describes a moment when XRP’s fundamentals, liquidity conditions, and institutional use cases begin to align, setting the stage for accelerated repricing. Key drivers of this potential phase include broader integration of RLUSD, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , and expanding on-chain payment corridors. These developments strengthen XRP’s utility in global liquidity and settlement, making the price targets appear less speculative and more structurally grounded. Still, analysts caution that the $37–$50 range remains a conditional projection, dependent on sustained momentum, favorable macro conditions, and continued network growth. Investor Mindset and Market Discipline If XRP truly enters “Rippy Season,” success will depend as much on mindset as on market movement. Parabolic phases are emotionally challenging — fear of missing out (FOMO) and sudden volatility can lead to poor decisions. Seasoned traders advise measured exposure, clear profit targets, and emotional discipline. The path to new highs, if it unfolds, will likely be volatile, testing conviction and patience at every stage. In conclusion, with Sistine Research confirming a $37–$50 price target and Amonyx proclaiming the start of Rippy Season, XRP has re-entered the spotlight. Whether this marks the beginning of a historic rally or another speculative buildup remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: XRP’s narrative has shifted. The market is no longer debating if momentum will return, but when. For investors, the task ahead is clear: stay informed, stay disciplined, and be mentally prepared for what could be XRP’s most defining chapter yet.

This expiry event is a little larger than last week’s, but there is unlikely to be any impact on spot markets, which have been mostly sideways in the past several days. The US government remains in a shutdown, and a delayed September CPI inflation report is due today, which could induce volatility, especially if it comes in hotter than expectations, currently 3.1%. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.03, meaning that long contracts and shorts are evenly matched. Max pain is around $114,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $120k, $130k, and $140k, which have topped $2 billion at these strike prices on Deribit. There is also over $2 billion in OI at $100k targeted by short sellers. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at an all-time high of $63 billion, according to Coinglass.

Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $15 billion. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $5.8 billion. Spot Market Outlook The crypto market capitalization has increased by 1.8% over the past 24 hours to reach $3.8 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) has led the move with a brief spike above $111,000 in late trading on Thursday before retracing slightly on Friday morning. ETH, SOL, and BNB have posted impressive gains.

The agreement is about compute; real, measurable, high-grade compute. Industry estimates peg the cost of building 1 gigawatt of AI data center capacity at around $50 billion, with $35 billion typically going just to the chips. This project is central to Anthropic’s roadmap, and unlike OpenAI’s loud 33-gigawatt “Stargate” vision, this one is built for execution. Claude expands while Anthropic multiplies its vendor stack Founded by former OpenAI researchers, Anthropic isn’t out here performing. It’s calculating. It’s methodical. And it’s scaling the hell out of its infrastructure. Their Claude models — including the newer Claude Code — are split across Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium chips, and Nvidia GPUs. Each chip does different work. Training is done in one spot, inference in another, and research elsewhere. That setup wasn’t just for show. Krishna Rao, Anthropic’s CFO, said, “Anthropic and Google have a longstanding partnership and this latest expansion will help us continue to grow the compute we need to define the frontier of AI.” Google backed that up by saying TPUs deliver “strong price-performance and efficiency.” With this kind of architecture, Anthropic can stretch every dollar of compute further than the single-cloud players. Their pricing, performance, and power costs are all tuned per vendor, letting them avoid overpaying just because of exclusivity. Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, called the deal an expansion of an already successful relationship, noting, “Anthropic’s choice to significantly expand its usage of TPUs reflects the strong price-performance and efficiency its teams have seen with TPUs for several years.” Google’s new Ironwood TPUs are part of the package too. Business is growing just as fast as the infrastructure. Anthropic’s annual revenue run rate is closing in on $7 billion, with over 300,000 businesses now running on Claude — up 300× in just two years. The number of large enterprise clients spending over $100,000 annually has gone up nearly sevenfold in the past year. And then there’s Claude Code. It pulled in $500 million in annualized revenue just two months after launching. That number alone made Claude Code the fastest-growing product ever, according to Anthropic. Amazon builds deeper ties while Google increases capital While Google is loading up TPUs and stacking cash into the company, Amazon still holds the deeper seat. The retail giant has now invested $8 billion into Anthropic, compared to Google’s confirmed $3 billion in equity. That $8 billion isn’t just a number. It makes AWS the primary cloud provider, not just on paper but in the way the infrastructure is physically built. Take Project Rainier for instance, the custom supercomputer built by Amazon specifically for Claude, which runs on Trainium 2 chips that skip the markup that comes with traditional options. That’s more compute per dollar, which is really the only thing that matters when you’re burning power by the gigawatt. Wall Street already noticed. Alex Haissl from Rothschild & Co Redburn estimated that Anthropic added one to two percentage points to AWS’s growth during the last quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. He expects that number to hit over five points in the second half of 2025. Scott Devitt from Wedbush told CNBC that once Claude becomes standard for enterprise devs, it directly pushes up AWS revenue. He said that dynamic could drive Amazon’s cloud growth for “many, many years.” Back at Google, the investments keep stacking. After the first $2 billion and 10% equity stake, Google added another $1 billion in January. That came before the TPU expansion was announced. And while AWS had an outage Monday, Claude kept running — unaffected — because of Anthropic’s multi-cloud approach.

The decision now allows Zhao — who pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act — to potentially return to an executive role at the exchange. The news also sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with Binance’s native token BNB surging 3.6% to an intraday high of $1,121 before stabilizing around $1,137. Traders across X hailed the decision as a catalyst for a renewed market rally, with some predicting the start of a broader altcoin season. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is linked to Donald Trump Jr., also jumped by close to 14%. With BNB newly listed on Coinbase and Robinhood, and public companies like Applied DNA Sciences adding it to their treasuries, Trump’s pardon reignited optimism across the crypto space. CZ Receives Full Presidential Pardon US President Donald Trump officially pardoned Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, making it one of the most significant acts of clemency in the crypto industry’s history. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by Binance. The pardon also follows months of speculation, lobbying, and behind-the-scenes appeals from both the exchange and Zhao himself. According to people familiar with the matter, Trump signed the pardon on Wednesday, although it has not yet appeared on the White House website or in the Federal Register, where presidential pardons are usually published. Binance later expressed gratitude toward the US president. “Incredible news of CZ’s pardon today. We thank President Trump for his leadership and for his commitment to make the US the crypto capital of the world,” the company said, adding that Zhao’s vision helped shape the global digital asset movement. Zhao’s legal troubles began in November of 2023 when he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at Binance. As part of the plea agreement, he stepped down as CEO and later served a four-month prison sentence beginning in April 2024. He was released in September, after which rumors began to circulate that a pardon could be forthcoming. Speculation intensified over the past few weeks after Zhao quietly removed the “ex-@binance” tag from his social media bio, which was quickly interpreted by many as a signal of his possible reinstatement. Betting markets also reflected growing confidence in a pardon, with political commentators like Fox News’ Charles Gasparino reporting that Trump was “leaning toward” granting it. The pardon now potentially clears the way for Zhao to return to an executive role at Binance, which was previously prohibited under his plea deal. If confirmed, it will be a dramatic comeback for one of crypto’s most influential people. Trump’s decision continued his trend of granting clemency to big names in the digital asset space, following previous pardons for BitMEX founders Arthur Hayes and his co-executives, as well as Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht. Traders Bet on BNB Rally Crypto markets reacted quickly to the news of US President Donald Trump pardoning, and traders now predict a major rally for BNB and a potential broader altcoin surge. BNB climbed 3.6% to an intraday high of $1,121 shortly after the news broke. At press time, BNB was trading at $1,137.85. Traders on X celebrated the move . “Trump just pardoned CZ. Now we resume $BNB up only szn,” wrote trader Xeer, capturing the market’s bullish sentiment. The momentum extended beyond Binance’s native token. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the token linked to Donald Trump Jr.’s crypto venture, jumped by close to 14% to $0.1414, according to CoinMarketCap . Some market participants interpreted this as the beginning of a wider “altcoin season.” WLFI’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) RR2Capital co-founder Richard Seiler said that the crypto sector “could do with a catalyst right now… That may very well have been it,” and suggested that the pardon might trigger renewed enthusiasm across the market. Adding fuel to the optimism, BNB has seen growing institutional and public treasury interest. The token was listed this week on both Coinbase and Robinhood, which expanded its accessibility to US investors. In a surprising move, biotech company Applied DNA Sciences also revealed it purchased 4,908 BNB—worth approximately $5.3 million. This sent its stock soaring by more than 50% during Wednesday’s trading session. The combination of political developments, corporate accumulation, and renewed investor excitement positions BNB at the center of the market’s latest bullish narrative, with traders betting that the rally could extend well beyond Binance’s ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-24 05:30:00

UK Finance reported that fraud cases increased by 17% to over 2 million between January and June, marking one of the highest levels ever recorded in the UK. Criminals use AI tools to launch faster and smarter scams Criminals in the UK use AI to create fake messages, emails, and videos that look real, to reach thousands of victims at once with very little effort. They copy the logos, voices, and faces of real companies or trusted public figures to extort people because it’s really hard to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s fake these days. UK Finance stated that these fraudsters utilize AI tools to translate scam messages, craft convincing fake stories, and tailor their tricks to each target. The most common trick these criminals use is creating deepfake videos of popular celebrities promoting fake cryptocurrency or stock investment opportunities. Victims of these crimes lost about $15,000 each (and counting), and the total losses rose by 55% in the first half of the year alone (that’s nearly £100 million gone with the wind). These AI-generated videos look so realistic that people aware of such scams sometimes struggle to distinguish them. Scammers will take their time to create fake websites that appear legitimate and send the links to victims once they show some interest. Victims can literally open accounts with these fake websites, watch their investments “grow” in some of them, and sometimes even withdraw small profits at first, which is the cherry on top. By the time someone realizes the site is fake, they have already thrown a large amount of money into their account, and that’s when everything just disappears or freezes. Criminals have learned that the quickest way to some people’s wallets is through their hearts. Using romance scams, they make their schemes more personal and emotionally damaging. With AI-generated profiles and chatbots that sound genuine and affectionate, they lure victims on dating apps and social media. These fraudsters often spend weeks or even months chatting daily, sharing fake stories, and building emotional connections that don’t actually exist. Once trust is gained, they start asking for money — often claiming it’s for travel, medical expenses, or urgent emergencies. Many victims begin by sending small amounts but end up transferring larger sums as the fake relationship deepens. According to UK Finance, romance fraud cases increased by 19%, with total losses rising 35% to approximately £20.5 million in the first half of the year. Banks use advanced AI systems to block fraud in real time Traditional fraud checks can no longer keep up with AI-powered crime , so banks have had to modernize their own systems and use artificial intelligence to fight fire with fire. These new systems learn how each customer spends their money and will flag any suspicious activity, like large transfers to an unknown new account. UK Finance stated that this initiative is already showing a significant impact, as banks have prevented £870 million worth of unauthorised fraud in the first six months of the year. This figure represents a 20% improvement compared to the same period last year. This means that for every £1 that criminals attempted to steal, banks were able to block approximately 70 pence before it left the victim’s account. Ruth Ray, Director of Fraud Policy at UK Finance, stated that banks are now investing heavily in these AI systems because they work and react more efficiently than human teams. The systems monitor unusual customer behavior, such as someone suddenly sending money overseas, purchasing expensive items they have never bought before, or responding to pressure from a stranger over the phone. The AI will immediately alert the bank’s security team when it detects something suspicious, or it can pause the transaction until the customer confirms it is real. A special police team funded by UK banks, the Dedicated Crime and Payment Card Unit (DCPCU), has also been investigating how criminals use “SMS blasters” to send thousands of fake messages to phones in busy areas, asking people to click on fake links that expose their bank or card details.

Source: Google Finance The Nasdaq-listed company, SLMT, which recently rebranded from Brera Holdings, announced that it has completed assembly of its first validator hardware in the United Arab Emirates and is preparing to launch what it calls the region’s first “performant Solana validator.” The validator, housed in a newly selected UAE data center, is part of Solmate’s plan to integrate real infrastructure with its expanding digital asset treasury. Solmate Buys SOL at Discount After $50M Acquisition According to a company release, Solmate purchased SOL tokens “at a historic discount to market prices” to support its validator operations. The company did not disclose the purchase size, but earlier this month, it confirmed a $50 million acquisition of SOL tokens at a 15% discount during what it described as “the worst liquidation event in crypto history.” The company’s stock climbed to an intraday high of $12.55 before settling at $11.70, giving Solmate Infrastructure a market capitalization of roughly $754 million. The move follows Ark Invest’s recent disclosure of an 11.5% ownership stake in Solmate , signaling growing institutional interest in Solana-based treasury and infrastructure ventures. Chief Executive Officer Marco Santori, former Chief Legal Officer at Kraken, said the company’s M&A push will focus on strategic acquisitions across the Solana value chain rather than simple revenue-driven deals. “We aren’t interested in bolting on smaller companies,” Santori said. “We’re targeting businesses for which our SOL treasury will be fuel for their engine of growth — just like it is for ours.” Solmate Press Release Source: Globalnewswire The company also announced an amendment to its registration rights agreement for its oversubscribed $300 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing . The registration statement for PIPE investors is expected to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by November 22. Solmate said the amendment provides greater flexibility as it completes infrastructure projects and prepares for additional acquisitions. Notably, Solmate’s $300 million financing round, completed in September, drew backing from ARK Invest, the Solana Foundation, early Solana investor RockawayX, and UAE-based Pulsar Group. The company’s board includes economist Dr. Arthur Laffer and RockawayX CEO Viktor Fischer, while the Solana Foundation holds the right to appoint two directors. Solana Sees Record Institutional Holdings as 20 Firms Control $3.86B in SOL Notably, data from the Strategic Solana Reserve shows that 20 institutional entities now hold more than 20.3 million SOL, valued at roughly $3.86 billion, representing about 3.5% of the token’s circulating supply. Source: Strategic Solana Reserve The combined staking reserves among these entities exceed $1.8 billion, yielding an average of 7.7%. Forward Industries leads institutional holdings with 6.82 million SOL worth approximately $1.29 billion. The company recently established a 25-member crypto advisory board, including industry figures such as Helium founder Amir Haleem, Drift Labs’ Cindy Leow, and Superstate CEO Robert Leshner. Helius Medical Technologies, rebranded as HSDT Solana Company, holds about 2.2 million SOL valued at $417 million. The firm recently announced additional acquisitions less than three weeks after completing a $500 million private placement led by Pantera Capital, with potential expansion to $1.25 billion through stapled warrants. DeFi Development Corp. also deepened its SOL reserves this month, increasing holdings by 4.7% to $426 million despite a recent market downturn. The company said the purchase reflects its confidence in Solana’s long-term value, even as major institutions such as BlackRock reportedly reduced exposure amid geopolitical volatility. DeFi Development buys 86,307 $SOL for $16M at $110.91, growing treasury to 2.2M $SOL worth $426M, but per share drops 25% from warrant dilution. #Solana #Treasury https://t.co/38O7YQBjN8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 17, 2025 The company said the purchase reflects its confidence in Solana’s long-term value, even as major institutions such as BlackRock reportedly reduced exposure amid geopolitical volatility. Other notable players include Sharps Technology, with 2.14 million SOL worth $405 million; Upexi Inc., holding 2 million SOL valued at $379 million; and Solana-focused biotechnology firm Solana Company (HSDT), now controlling over $500 million in combined assets.

BlackRock's Tokenized Fund BUIDL Makes $500 Million One-Time Investment in Polygon Network This large-scale transaction marks a new era in BlackRock’s blockchain-based asset management strategy and was officially confirmed by Polygon’s CEO. Polygon CEO stated in a statement on social media that the transaction was the first large-scale distribution of the BlackRock BUIDL fund to the Polygon network. This move is considered an indication that both traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields are becoming increasingly closer. BUIDL is BlackRock's tokenized treasury fund for institutional investors, offering investors access to blockchain-represented versions of secure assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds. Experts predict that this $500 million transfer will boost institutional confidence in the Polygon ecosystem and that similar-scale fund movements could spread to other chains in the future.

Related Reading: All It Took Was A Tweet: FLOKI Jumps 27% After Musk Mentions It According to his remarks, the more likely outcome is that Bitcoin holds near current levels unless major new forces push prices much higher. Novogratz Sets A Realistic Range Based on reports, Novogratz suggested a year-end range of roughly $100,000 to $125,000 for Bitcoin under normal market conditions. At the time of his comment Bitcoin traded around $107,000, meaning a move to $250,000 would require roughly a 130% rise in a matter of weeks. That kind of jump is possible, he said, but it would demand events far outside ordinary market behavior. What Would Need To Happen Reports have disclosed two main scenarios that could create the type of momentum needed for a run to $250,000. One involves US President Donald Trump exerting pressure on the Federal Reserve in a way that shifts macro policy and boosts risk assets. The other key trigger would be swift passage of a major market structure bill for crypto — commonly referred to in discussions as the CLARITY Act — which could open the door to a surge in institutional demand. Both are uncertain and would have to line up quickly for the price to triple-plus in weeks. Market Context And On-Chain Signals On-chain data and recent price action add weight to Novogratz’s caution. Analysts tracking flows, supply, and holder behavior have pointed to a period of profit-taking and slower buying. Glassnode and other trackers show signs of consolidation. In plain terms: long-term holders are selling some coins and new buyers have not yet overwhelmed sellers. Unless large new inflows appear, price momentum is likely to be limited. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Bitcoin: Technical Thresholds To Watch Analysts are watching $125,000 as a key resistance level. A decisive move above that figure could change the math and encourage more buying. Conversely, a sustained hold near the low six-figure range would fit Novogratz’s base case. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows and big institutional purchases are the clearest possible catalysts that could tilt sentiment higher. According to market observers, investors should not assume rapid gains will occur simply because headlines mention big targets. The math is clear: moving from roughly $107,000 to $250,000 in about 10–11 weeks requires mass buying that has not yet appeared.

Crypto Bill Sees ‘Strong’ Bipartisan Collaboration Following Wednesday’s roundtables between Crypto industry CEOs and lawmakers from both parties, Armstrong told CNBC he believes the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) can see significant progress in the next few weeks, with bipartisan support mounting. “We had a great meeting with the Democrats in the Senate and on the Republican side today. The good news is that there’s strong bipartisan support and will to get this market structure legislation done. It’s important for America, and the 50 million Americans who use crypto wanna see it get done,” he affirmed. The CEO considers that 90% of the disputes that have delayed the Senate Banking Committee draft bill’s markup session are “already aligned and agreed” on, with “a lot of great cross-functional collaboration happening” to address the remaining issues. Armstrong also revealed that during the meetings with Senate Democrats, they addressed the controversial proposal to regulate the DeFi sector that got leaked and had seemingly stalled bipartisan talks on the legislation nearly two weeks ago. As reported by Bitcoinist, Senate Democrats and Republicans were allegedly quarreling behind the scenes over a leaked proposal to regulate DeFi platforms. The document suggested establishing a “clear” regulatory framework for DeFi platforms by “defining accountability, clarifying oversight, and preventing the misuse of decentralized protocols for illicit finance, sanctions evasion, or to bypass market guardrails.” The proposal received heavy backlash from Republican lawmakers and crypto industry leaders, including Armstrong, who argued that it “would set innovation back, and prevent the US from becoming the crypto capital of the world.” According to Coinbase’s CEO, Senate Democrats “communicated to us that it was not a serious proposal.” He also noted that the incident highlighted the importance of preserving DeFi as a source of innovation, adding that they had a “productive conversation” about regulating centralized intermediaries, not the protocols. Some online reports claimed that tensions between the two parties escalated during the October 22 meeting, resulting in a heated confrontation between one senator and the crypto executives about the leaked proposal and political alliances. Market Structure Bill Approval Back On Track? On X, Journalist Eleanor Terret affirmed that it is certain that all key players involved want to see the legislation done in a bipartisan manner. However, it remains unclear who will make the first move to restart the bipartisan negotiations, when a markup date will be agreed on, and how the government shutdown will affect these talks. Armstrong considers there’s a “good chance” that the crypto market structure bill could “get out” of the Senate Banking Committee by Thanksgiving, with the draft texts potentially being released “in the next month or so.” He also noted that the government shutdown “hasn’t stopped the Senate and their staff from continuing to work” on the legislation. To the CEO, lawmakers want the market structure bill to have a similar effect as the stablecoin framework, which “unleashed a surge of payment activity in the crypto space and gave a chance for the US dollar to really be exported around the world and all these dollar-denominated accounts.” “My hope is still that it gets done this year. I think we have a good chance of doing it,” he affirmed. “If we get it out of Committee before Thanksgiving, there’s a chance to get it done in December,” he continued. This timeline would allow the two chambers of Congress to come together and get the crypto legislation on US President Donald Trump’s desk, “hopefully shortly after.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Brian Armstrong|btc|BTCUSDT|Coinbase CEO|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|DeFi|Responsible Financial Innovation Act|RFIA|Senate Banking Committee|Senate Democrats,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-24 06:00:41

The formation is not just technical; it tells a story of resilience, accumulation, and the quiet build-up to what could become one of the most significant moves in XRP’s history. A Structural Shift on the Macro Timeframe When viewed through a 12-month lens, XRP’s chart presents a striking picture of transformation. After years of sideways consolidation and subdued price action, the token appears to be carving out a powerful bullish structure. Each candle on this chart represents a full year of trading, and the recent sequence of green candles, following an extended accumulation phase, signals renewed market strength. Unlike the sharp parabolic spike of 2017 that ended in an equally steep decline, the current pattern displays controlled growth and sustained higher closes. The growing volume bars at the base of the chart reinforce this momentum, suggesting that large investors, not just retail traders, are accumulating XRP. According to Cryptoinsightuk, this configuration isn’t just another technical setup; it’s a macro formation that rarely appears without follow-through. Does anyone see anything not bullish about the 12 month $XRP chart pic.twitter.com/bFwCXrhadb — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 23, 2025 The Changing Fundamentals Behind the Chart Beyond the chart, XRP’s fundamentals have evolved in ways that complement its technical posture. With the Ripple vs. SEC case concluded and regulatory clarity finally achieved, XRP has been reclassified as a non-security in the U.S. context—a monumental shift that clears a significant cloud over its future. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing integration of RLUSD (Ripple’s stablecoin) and expanding partnerships with traditional financial institutions are introducing fresh liquidity and real-world utility to the XRP Ledger. These developments, supported by Ripple’s global payment corridors, strengthen investor confidence and align perfectly with the bullish macro picture the chart portrays. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Market Levels and What to Watch As of report time, XRP trades around $2.39 , maintaining strong support above the $1.50–$1.80 zone. Technical analysts now eye the $5 region as the next critical milestone — a level that could confirm a full breakout from the multi-year consolidation range. Beyond that, historical resistance near $13 stands as the ultimate long-term target if momentum continues. The 12-month chart shows XRP’s trajectory pressing against previous highs, with momentum indicators aligning to suggest the beginning of a new macro uptrend. The Bigger Picture The message behind this chart is clear: something big is brewing . After years of legal uncertainty and stagnant performance, XRP’s structure now mirrors early stages of historical bull runs, not in speculative mania, but in measured, data-backed accumulation. As Cryptoinsightuk noted, there’s little about this setup that looks bearish. For investors who understand the significance of higher timeframes, the 12-month XRP chart isn’t just bullish, it’s potentially transformative. If momentum holds and adoption continues to expand, this could be the start of a chapter in XRP’s story that the market won’t soon forget.

This year has largely been a “positioning reset for Bitcoin’s market structure in spot and derivatives,” said crypto entrepreneur Joe Consorti on Thursday. He added that there has been long-term holder distribution above $100k and $110k, “paired with macro headwinds preventing a sustained bid to counteract the distribution,” and this has all been capped off by a major liquidation event that reset positioning in derivatives. Three Drivers of BTC in Q4 Its next major move will be driven by the US government reopening after more than three weeks of shutdown and a meeting to discuss trade tariffs between the US and Chinese presidents. “Now that leverage has been flushed, the government will reopen soon, and the Trump-Xi meeting is on the horizon, Bitcoin should pick up into year-end.” He added that the US central bank is also growing more supportive, and “managers are going to rebalance into risk by year-end.” “It’s hard not to be bullish over the next several months and throughout 2026 despite the horrible sentiment.”’ A Federal Reserve rate cut, which is virtually guaranteed next week, is also very bullish for Bitcoin and crypto markets. It is unlikely that any surprises with today’s CPI inflation report will deter the Fed from cutting rates, as it is primarily focused on labor market woes. Investor Fred Krueger also pointed out that there will be two rate cuts this year, then a third expected in January, which could prolong the cycle. “Rate cut in 6 days. Then again in 48 days. Then again in 97 days. Then we have a new Fed Chair in May who will make Bernanke look like Paul Volker. Enjoy missing out on the next bull market, cycle theorists.” Trader ‘Stockmoney Lizards’ observed that no primary indicator was flagging red, but there may be some short-term bearish indicators. “This currently is a buy-the-dip opportunity for me.” Bitcoin Support is support, until it is broken. Resistance is resistance, until broken. A bull market is a bull market, until it is over. No major indicator is flagging “red”.

Here’s Where It Headed,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-just-moved-211-million-xrp-heres-where-it-headed/,"A large-scale XRP transaction has caught the attention of market analysts after Whale Alert reported that 211,000,000 XRP, valued at approximately $506.1 million, moved between two unidentified wallets. Further investigation revealed that the sender was Ripple, and the recipient was Evernorth, the Ripple-backed company currently preparing for a public listing. Blockchain data now shows that Evernorth’s wallet holds more than 261.9 million XRP, signaling an accelerating build-up of tokens. The size and timing of the transfer are notable because they appear to be part of Ripple’s ongoing coordination with Evernorth. While neither company released a public statement at the time of the transaction, the move aligns with previously announced plans for Evernorth to manage one of the world’s largest publicly disclosed XRP treasuries . 211,000,000 #XRP (506,152,575 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/ExDrQTPxqY — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 23, 2025 Evernorth’s Expanding Role in the XRP Ecosystem Evernorth, established with Ripple’s backing, is positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. The company intends to go public through a $1 billion SPAC merger . Its stated purpose is to use capital raised from investors to acquire and manage XRP holdings. By maintaining an extensive treasury, Evernorth aims to support XRP liquidity and expand institutional access to the asset. Ripple’s transfer of over 200 million XRP directly contributes to this effort. Other notable contributors include Ripple executive Chris Larsen, who sent 50 million XRP , and SBI Holdings, a company that has consistently supported XRP, which has committed $200 million to Evernorth . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Significance for XRP Analysts view this development as a constructive signal for XRP. The consolidation of large amounts of the token into a corporate treasury can limit circulating supply while encouraging regulated participation in the asset. Because Evernorth operates as a corporate entity subject to public disclosure, its activities could offer institutional investors a transparent entry point into XRP markets. The movement also reflects Ripple’s ongoing strategy to connect XRP with institutional financial systems. By working through Evernorth, Ripple can expand XRP’s use in liquidity, lending, and cross-border settlement applications without directly managing those functions itself. This separation of roles enhances operational clarity and positions Evernorth as a specialized entity focused solely on XRP deployment. Evernorth’s accumulating balance indicates that its treasury operations are well underway. If the company proceeds with its planned listing and subsequent market purchases, XRP could experience increased institutional visibility and demand.

Stating that he is very optimistic about Ethereum, Tom Lee warned about the decline in Bitcoin. Warning for Bitcoin (BTC)! Speaking in an interview with Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano, Tom Lee warned that BTC could fall by as much as 50%. Lee said that despite the recent strong rally, the sharp declines in the stock market are a sign that Bitcoin could see declines of up to 50 percent in the future. Lee warned that BTC is following a highly volatile course and could lose up to 50% of its value, adding that Bitcoin is still highly correlated with stock markets and could therefore still experience larger declines. He noted that the entry of spot ETFs and institutional investors into the market has increased market stability somewhat, but despite this, Bitcoin still follows the stock market. “The stock market has seen 25% drops more frequently than Bitcoin, the stock market has made great progress over the last six years, but we have had an unusually large number of 25% drops during that time. Corrections of around 25% have been common in the stock market over the last six years. Since Bitcoin still has a high correlation with the stock market, larger declines, up to 50%, are possible. So if the S&P drops 20 points, Bitcoin could drop 40 points.” Ethereum is Still Undervalued! Speaking about the Ethereum prediction and Bitmain2's ETH accumulation, Tom Lee stated that Bitmain will continue to accumulate Ethereum and said, “It will be the largest holding company in the world.” Lee added that the company currently holds over 3.2 million Ethereum, equivalent to about 2.7% of the total supply, and that they plan to increase this number to 6 million in the long term. Arguing that Wall Street will embrace Ethereum as a trustless, neutral public blockchain, Lee said: “If the Ethereum-Bitcoin ratio reaches its 2021 peak, the unit price could rise to around $21,000. Ethereum is still an undervalued asset.” As you may recall, Tom Lee, along with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, one of the important names in the market, recently stated that Ethereum will reach $10,000 within the year. *This is not investment advice.

XRP Mirrors 2017 Pattern Before Massive Rally,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-deja-vu-xrp-mirrors-2017-pattern-before-massive-rally/,"XRP is forming a chart pattern that resembles its behavior before the 2017 rally. Analysts are watching this development as the market tests key levels seen in the last major price surge. Current movements are taking place inside a long-standing channel structure that has guided XRP’s price action for over a decade. Price Moves Within Long-Term Channel A monthly chart shared by EtherNasyonaL shows Ripple’s token trading inside an upward-sloping channel that dates back to 2014. This structure includes lower support, a central median band, and an upper boundary. Price movements have consistently reacted to these levels. In Q4 2017, XRP broke above the middle of this channel, then surged after a short period of sideways movement. The pattern eventually led to a peak near $3. A similar setup is forming in Q4 2025. XRP recently touched the middle band again, faced rejection, and is now consolidating below that level. The analyst commented, $XRP a different perspective. Q4 2017 After breaking the middle band of the channel, XRP peaked in a parabolic rise within a few months. Q4 2025 In the same channel structure, the price again touched the middle band, was rejected, and then began to accumulate. The chart… pic.twitter.com/Zd0nezIpKL — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 23, 2025 At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.44, with over $3 billion in daily volume, showing strong market activity during this phase. Chart Projects $9.90 Target Another chart from Javon Marks compares the current setup with the 2017 breakout. It uses historical moves and Fibonacci extensions to forecast future price zones. The next level in focus is $9.90, which would mark a 310% rise from current prices. “Due to the extreme similarities in $XRP’s price structure to a previous bull run, $9.90 looks to be up next,” the post read. While other targets are plotted above this, most focus remains on whether XRP can clear nearby resistance and continue higher. Source: Javon Marks/X In addition, CRYPTOWZRD posted a daily technical update showing that XRP closed the session with no clear direction. The token remains near its daily support. A break to the upside depends on Bitcoin’s behavior, especially its dominance across the market. Resistance is marked at $2.75, with support sitting near $2.27. Short-term charts suggest a possible dip to $2.3. A bounce from that level could lead to a move toward $2.55. Below $2.3, the chart turns bearish. Large Holders Move Coins to Exchanges On-chain data shows that wallets holding over one billion XRP have transferred around 1.09 billion tokens since October 16, as CryptoPotato recently reported . The move suggests that large holders may be taking profits or reducing exposure. Such whale activity often signals caution, especially when paired with high-volume exchange inflows. Traders are watching these movements, as they may affect price direction. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential indicator has now printed a buy signal on the XRP chart. “Looks like the rebound is about to begin,” the analyst stated. The post Ripple Déjà Vu?

Data from SolScan shows that two wallets, melania-liquidity1.sol and melania-liquidity2.sol, received $784,200 and $454,724 worth of MET. However, the distribution drew online criticism, especially since Hayden Davis, the founder of Kelsier Ventures behind MELANIA’s debut, was among the recipients of the airdrop. Soju says they’ve collaborated with Dethective and Rugcheck One X user commented , “Why is Hayden Davis getting a MET airdrop? You have to be kidding me,” referencing the Kelsier Ventures CEO . In another post, the user remarked, “Everyone, thank Meteora for giving Hayden Davis another $1,500,000,” adding that the funds were dispersed to other accounts through OKX. About an hour before the MELANIA wallets got their MET tokens, Meteora co-lead Soju defended the initiative, emphasizing that LIBRA’s launch wallets would not be rewarded in the airdrop. He insisted that the company partnered with Dethective and Rugcheck to prevent tokens from falling into the hands of bad actors . The airdrop timing comes on the heels of a court filing from investors alleging that Benjamin Chow, co-founder of Meteora, orchestrated a “scam coin” effort alongside Hayden Davis, involving no fewer than 15 tokens—including MELANIA, LIBRA, and ENRON. In their lawsuit, investors alleged that the defendants secured the former First Lady’s backing for her cryptocurrency in a plan that used celebrity status to bypass scrutiny. While Melania Trump is not named as a defendant, Chow and Davis are accused of issuing meme coins, buying large amounts after launch, and then selling them at peak prices—triggering steep losses for those who bought in later. Meteora’s airdrop includes three wallets connected to the Trump meme coin The controversy surrounding the Meteora airdrop highlights ongoing concerns in the cryptocurrency space regarding transparency, insider trading, and the use of celebrity endorsements. The involvement of public figures like Melania Trump and Javier Milei has raised questions about the ethical implications of leveraging their names for financial gain without their explicit endorsement. Only two days following the release of President Trump’s meme coin , Melania Trump showed support for a Solana token branded with her name as its ticker. MELANIA briefly hit a market capitalization of almost $7 billion, only to tumble 99% in the months that followed, landing near $80 million. A February meme coin backed by Argentina’s Javier Milei was later linked by Bubblemaps to MELANIA, triggering a class-action case accusing its creators of fraud and racketeering. The Argentine president has launched a personal meme coin called $LIBRA , but its price collapsed soon after it hit the market. So far, the Meteora token distribution has received positive feedback from airdrop participants , who cited the smooth distribution process and substantial payouts. MET is now the 269th-biggest coin, with a market capitalization of $263.2 million, according to CoinGecko. However, some users have also taken issue with Meteora’s decision to include three wallets connected to the Trump meme coin operation among the top airdrop recipients. Arkham Intelligence reports that they received approximately $4.2 million in MET before transferring the tokens to OKX. The Trump meme coin hasn’t yet drawn lawsuits for fraud, but it has stirred political uproar over alleged conflicts of interest and possible foreign ties. Get seen where it counts.

Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project that has quickly become one of the best cryptos to buy this year thanks to its innovative lending-and-borrowing ecosystem. The project is priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. Investors who want to join have limited time since the phase is only 30% remaining before ending. Mutuum Finance offers the kind of asymmetric upside potential Dogecoin once had in its early days. Its dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with Peer-to-Peer borrowing, is reshaping how DeFi capital flows work, allowing users to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction Dogecoin (DOGE) is exhibiting clear signs of a build-up in power after a long and exhausting consolidation, with buyers steadily buying dips around the $0.095 support level. This steady bottoming process is indicative that long-term buyers are again confident, with technical indicators demonstrating an underlying bullish foundation. Should DOGE successfully break decisively above the resistance zone of $0.22–$0.25, it may spur an acute upward rally, possibly reviving the momentum of the meme coin into 2025. The accumulation trend indicates a change of heart, as the bulls silently prepare for the next upward leg. However, while DOGE’s fundamentals still remain community-focused, many investors are now diversifying into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining popularity as the next big crypto for early-cycle growth in the upcoming market phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Rises with Strong Investor Sentiment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the strongest cryptocurrencies to invest in now. Its sixth phase of presale has seen strong buy interest. It is nearing sold out, with less than 30% of the stage’s initial allocation now remaining. More than 17,380 investors have injected over $17.8 million into the project so far. Within the past 24 hours alone, the top investors have purchased $290, $231, $135, $134, and $116’s worth of MUTM tokens, reflecting higher interest in early adoption. With all this activity, MUTM is one of the top plays for investors seeking the next big crypto and an open outlook on what crypto to invest in with high growth potential. Risk Management and Collateral Controls Mutuum Finance maintains an official risk management policy through tiered collateralization limits that differ by asset and are commensurate with the natural risk of the token. These include supply collateralization limits, borrowing limits, and total collateral limits. Positions are typically overcollateralized to absorb the platform against price volatility, offering a buffer against change. The system also pays liquidators to close undercollateralized positions in real time, enabling risky trades to settle in real time. Deposit and borrowing limits also limit exposure to very volatile or illiquid tokens. Riskier tokens have more prudent collateral utilization, though fully correlated assets may be utilized for leveraged access in order that users may lever the value of their collateral safely. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $17.8 million from over 17,380 investors to date, and Phase 6 is just 30% remaining at $0.035 per token, the entry price floor of the presale. Early adopters are able to gain from its P2C and P2P two-way lending markets, earn passive income, and lend/borrow flexibly at minimal risk. Investors looking to move beyond meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) are now required to act and lock tokens on Mutuum Finance’s official website to secure the best crypto to buy today and position themselves for the next big crypto opportunity during the 2025 bull run.

This sustained dominance is a function of its massive native population, exploding Web3 innovation, and a pragmatic shift in regulatory approach that views digital assets as the next significant wealth engine. This analysis breaks down the key data points from the 2025 TRM Labs Report and details the distinct factors fueling India’s position as a global cryptocurrency and blockchain powerhouse. What Are the Key Findings from the TRM Labs 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Report? The TRM Labs 2025 Global Adoption Report confirms India’s position at the top, outpacing major economies like the U.S., Vietnam, and Japan , and reveals several global and regional trends for the 2025 period (As of September 23, 2025 ): Global Adoption Surge: Worldwide crypto adoption grew by 52% year-on-year, driven largely by DeFi lending and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization . Stablecoin Dominance: Stablecoins solidified their role as the backbone of digital assets, constituting 30% of crypto transactions and hitting a record $4 trillion in volume by August 2025 , marking an 83% YoY increase. South Asian Transaction Volume: The South Asia region, anchored by India , experienced an 80% surge in crypto activity, surpassing $300 billion in total transactions. This growth is primarily powered by cross-border remittances, emerging Web3 gaming economies, and digital asset savings. Asia-Pacific (APAC) Growth: The broader APAC region saw its on-chain value transfer jump by 69% YoY, rising from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion , reflecting the aggressive digital asset embrace in emerging economies. Developer Momentum: Blockchain developer participation across Asia increased by 35% , with India, Vietnam, and South Korea ranking among the top global contributors to smart contract innovation and DeFi infrastructure . What Specific Factors are Powering India’s Crypto Dominance in 2025? India’s remarkable leadership in worldwide crypto adoption is built on a foundation of innovation, unparalleled scale, and improving accessibility, overcoming significant tax hurdles. Key accelerating factors include: Mass Adoption via Telecom & Fintech Integration: The strategic partnership between Jio and Aptos introduced blockchain-based loyalty rewards to an estimated 500 million users , representing one of the largest real-world Web3 rollouts globally. Institutional and Exchange Re-entry: Institutional confidence has returned, highlighted by Coinbase re-entering the Indian market. This was done through a partnership with CoinDCX , investing at a $2.45 billion valuation, following similar re-engagement by platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Bybit . Developer-Led Ecosystem Growth: India is fast becoming a global innovation hub, fostering decentralized technology leaders such as Polygon, Shardeum, and Zetachain , which are scaling their solutions globally. Progressive Regulatory Signaling: Authorities have continued to signal a welcoming, structured mindset by working on comprehensive crypto-regulations, such as the proposed COINS Act , and by mandating FIU registration for all offshore Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VASPs). How is India Balancing Regulation and Innovation in its Crypto Policy? Despite the continuation of a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on trades, India’s crypto-activity continues to grow. The government’s core philosophy has matured from potential restriction to structured regulation , establishing a model for other emerging crypto-economies: Shifting Government Stance: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has publicly suggested exploring an INR-backed stablecoin , while Union Minister Jitendra Singh has emphasized the government’s growing interest in utilizing AI and blockchain-driven governance . The ‘Regulate, Not Ban’ Model: This balanced approach provides enough regulatory certainty to attract institutional capital and protect consumers without stifling the grassroots innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that has made the country the world’s #1 crypto adopter . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is India maintaining the #1 ranking for global crypto adoption in 2025? India maintains the #1 ranking in 2025 primarily due to its massive, young, and digitally-native population, coupled with explosive Web3 and developer-led innovation. The country’s strong growth is further fueled by high-volume retail transactions, remittances, and a pragmatic regulatory approach that has shifted toward structured regulation rather than a ban. What is the role of stablecoins in India’s crypto economy according to the TRM Labs 2025 report? The TRM Labs 2025 report highlights stablecoins as a critical component of global and regional liquidity. While the report focuses on the overall India crypto adoption , it notes that stablecoins represent 30% of total global crypto transaction volume, making them vital for cross-border payments, remittances, and maintaining on-chain liquidity in emerging markets like India. How is the proposed COINS Act expected to impact India’s cryptocurrency laws? The proposed COINS Act (as of 2025) aims to transform India’s cryptocurrency laws by establishing a clear legal framework and formalizing a compliance pathway for digital assets. This move is expected to attract more foreign investment, provide legal recognition for crypto holdings, and simplify tax and reporting for retail investors, further accelerating the current trend of widespread India crypto adoption . Conclusion India’s dominance in crypto adoption is a powerful signal of the future of digital assets, demonstrating that grassroots enthusiasm, technological innovation, and a ‘regulate, not ban’ policy can successfully coexist. As of 2025 , the data from the TRM Labs Report is clear: India is not just leading; it is establishing the blueprint for how a major emerging economy can strategically embrace Web3 . For investors, developers, and global exchanges, this sustained leadership underscores the strategic significance of the Indian market, making timely action and a deep understanding of this dynamic ecosystem essential for future success.

In 2028, the coin is expected to range between $1.96 and $2.79, with an average price of $2.43. In 2031, SUSHI is expected to range between $3.48 and $4.61, with an average price of $4.04. SushiSwap is a decentralized exchange fork of Uniswap, a popular exchange. It offers several additional features not present in Uniswap, making it popular in the DeFi space. It is the largest DEX on the Binance Smart Chain. Its native token borrows the name of the exchange and is abbreviated SUSHI. Is SUSHI a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Our SUSHI Cryptopolitan Price Prediction answers these questions and more. Overview Cryptocurrency SushiSwap Ticker SUSHI Current price $0.5378 SUSHI Crypto Market cap $103.66M Trading volume $18.16M Circulating supply 192,789,255 All-time low $0.4533 on Aug 5, 2024 All-time high $23.38 on Mar 14, 2021 24-hour low $0.5207 24 hour high $0.5417 SUSHI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 12.16% 50-day SMA $0.6867 14-day RSI 37.68 (Neutral) 200-day SMA $0.7164 Sentiment Bearish Fear & greed index 27 (Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) SUSHI price analysis SUSHI is consolidating around $0.54 with a soft bullish tone. The RSI and MACD indicate stabilization, but not yet strong momentum. Key support to watch is $0.525, and resistance to watch is $0.575. SUSHI/USD 1-day price analysis As of October 24, SUSHI is trading near $0.5378, gaining a modest 0.56% as it attempts to sustain its short-term rebound. The price remains below the mid-Bollinger level at $0.578, indicating that bulls have yet to regain control. The lower band support at $0.422 remains strong, forming a base for gradual upward movement. SUSHI/USD 1-day chart The MACD is flattening near neutral, hinting at easing bearish pressure, while the RSI at 38.9 signals weak but stabilizing momentum. The overall structure favors slow accumulation over rapid breakout moves. SUSHI/USD 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, SUSHI holds around $0.5373, with the Alligator lines converging near $0.531, showing the market is entering a period of compression. SUSHI/USD 4-hour chart The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at 0.04 indicates a mild capital inflow, and the OBV remains steady at 214.9M, confirming that buying pressure is gradually supporting price stability. If SUSHI breaks above $0.540, it could move toward $0.555–$0.565, while a rejection would likely send it back to $0.525 support. SUSHI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6183 SELL SMA 5 $0.5906 SELL SMA 10 $0.5822 SELL SMA 21 $0.6231 SELL SMA 50 $0.6867 SELL SMA 100 $0.7594 SELL SMA 200 $0.7164 SELL Daily simple exponential average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6175 SELL EMA 5 $0.6564 SELL EMA 10 $0.7049 SELL EMA 21 $0.7486 SELL EMA 50 $0.7712 SELL EMA 100 $0.7630 SELL EMA 200 $0.7862 SELL What can you expect from SUSHI price analysis next? SUSHI is slowly transitioning from weakness to accumulation. A sustained break above $0.540 could trigger a short-term bullish continuation toward $0.57. Why is SUSHI down? SUSHI is down mainly due to low trading volume, strong competition from larger DEXs, bearish market sentiment, and lingering trust issues from its past leadership changes. Will SUSHI recover? SUSHI can recover if the DeFi market rebounds and SushiSwap continues to expand across chains, but progress may be slow and depends on renewed investor confidence. Will SUSHI reach $10? SUSHI could hit $10 someday, but not soon. It would require a major DeFi comeback and strong growth in SushiSwap’s user base and liquidity. Will SUSHI reach $100? It remains highly unlikely that SUSHI will cross the $100 mark before 2031. Is SushiSwap a good investment? SushiSwap can be a moderately risky investment. It has solid fundamentals as a multi-chain DEX with ongoing development, but faces stiff competition from larger players, such as Uniswap. Its long-term potential depends on market recovery, liquidity growth, and execution of its cross-chain strategy. Investing in SushiSwap (SUSHI) is primarily suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long-term outlook.

Image Source: CoinStats Sushiswap was introduced in 2020. After listing, it quickly rose to $7 in September 2020, then fell to lows of $1.50 by the end of the year. It recorded an all-time low of $0.4737 on November 4th, 2020 In the 2021 bull run, it quickly rose and reached its all-time high at $22.52 on March 14. It then experienced a general bearish trend since the 2021-2022 bull run. Despite the price challenges, the coin significantly grew in the first quarter of 2024, rising from a low of $0.53 to a high of $2.07. After reaching the peak, it proceeded into a bear run, reaching as low as $0.5. By late October, SUSHI saw significant recovery, reaching as high as $2 in December and closing the year around $1.3 to $1.8. The bear led the way in 2025, with SUSHI tumbling from approximately $2 in January to $ 0.50 in June. In the subsequent months, SUSHI maintained a trading range of $0.58 – $1.08. In October, the coin is currently trading between $0.5207 – $0.5417.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SUSHI|TRADING|UNI|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-24 07:35:16

Key Takeaways: Decentralized perpetual trading volume surpassed $1 trillion in October, setting a new monthly record. Hyperliquid led the surge with over $317 billion in trades, contributing to a $78 billion single-day volume peak. The gap between DEXs and CEXs is narrowing as decentralized platforms improve speed, liquidity, and accessibility. The surge reflects growing appetite for leveraged crypto trading and a shift toward on-chain derivatives platforms. According to DeFiLlama , October’s trading activity has already blown past August’s $762 billion record, marking an explosive 30% month-on-month increase. Hyperliquid Leads DEX Surge as Daily Perp Volume Hits $78 Billion Leading the charge is Hyperliquid, which has processed $317.6 billion in trades so far, followed by Lighter ($255.4 billion), Aster ($177.6 billion), and edgeX ($134.7 billion). Collectively, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) recorded an unprecedented $78 billion in trading volume on Oct. 10 alone. At the current pace, decentralized perpetual platforms are on track to close the month at around $1.3 trillion, nearly doubling the previous all-time high. The growing demand for perpetual swaps, derivatives that allow traders to bet on price movements without owning the underlying asset, is being fueled by their flexibility: 24/7 trading, high leverage, and no expiration dates. Source: DefiLlama Despite the surge, DEXs still trail far behind centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Binance and Bybit, which saw $69.3 billion and $26 billion in daily volume, respectively, according to CoinGecko. However, analysts note that the gap is narrowing as decentralized platforms improve user interfaces, execution speed, and liquidity access. Industry figures credit Hyperliquid with bringing decentralized perps into the mainstream. “It was the first to really get it right and scale successfully,” Infinex founder Kain Warwick said earlier this month. The platform’s momentum was further boosted after MetaMask integrated Hyperliquid on Oct. 8, allowing users to trade perpetual swaps directly from their wallets. The record-breaking month underscores how decentralized finance continues to mature, with perps trading emerging as one of its fastest-growing frontiers. Hyperliquid Strategies to Raise $1B to Become Largest HYPE Token Holder As reported, Hyperliquid Strategies has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $1 billion , with plans to use the proceeds to expand its crypto holdings and acquire additional HYPE tokens. The move marks a major step in the firm’s push to strengthen its presence in the decentralized derivatives market. Chardan Capital Markets is advising on the offering, which includes up to 160 million shares of common stock. The company will emerge from the merger between Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Rorschach I LLC, a SPAC deal that will form the new Hyperliquid Strategies entity. Upon completion, David Schamis will serve as CEO and Bob Diamond, former Barclays chief, will take the role of chairman. News of the filing drove HYPE token prices up 8% to $37.73, even as the wider crypto market declined slightly. Once the merger closes, Hyperliquid Strategies is expected to hold 12.6 million HYPE tokens worth about $470 million, alongside $305 million in cash set aside for further acquisitions, making it the largest corporate holder of HYPE.

The Canadian Department of Finance announced on Thursday that Stellantis’ tariff-free import quota will be slashed by 50%, and GM’s will be cut by 24.2%. Ottawa’s auto remission framework allows U.S.-assembled vehicles to enter Canada tariff-free only if the automakers maintain local production. Finance Minister Philippe Champagne revealed that the decision to cut the tariff-free rate reflected the government’s disappointment with the recent decision by GM to halt domestic production at BrightDrop electric delivery vans and Stellantis’ cancellation to build the Jeep Compass in Canada. He added that it was an unacceptable decision considering the legal obligations they signed to Canada and Canadian workers. Ottawa tightens tariff rules on Stellantis and GM Stellantis announced at the beginning of this month that it would shift its Jeep Compass production from Brampton, Ontario, to Belvidere, Illinois, as part of the U.S. $13 billion plan to boost domestic output. The automaker revealed that the plan will fund the launch of five new vehicle models, the development of a new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine, and the creation of 5,000 new jobs across Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. Our government is deeply disappointed by the recent production changes announced by General Motors and Stellantis. That's why we are reducing their import remission quotas — a clear consequence under our established framework. We stand firmly with our auto workers and will not… pic.twitter.com/ZHvuqXfgyL — François-Philippe Champagne (FPC) 🇨🇦 (@FP_Champagne) October 24, 2025 Antonio Filosa, CEO of Stellantis, acknowledged that the initiative will increase U.S. production capacity by 50% and support additional models through 2029. The decision to move production to the United States left roughly 3,000 unionized employees jobless. General Motors ended BrightDrop electric van production due to lower-than-expected demand for its commercial EV line. Atleast 1,100 hourly workers were affected by the blow. The government effectively deemed the decisions a breach of contract made under the auto remission framework. Automotive Industry Minister Melanie Joly revealed that the government is prepared to pursue legal actions if Stellantis fails to honor its pledges. In a letter to Stellantis, Joly warned that the automaker had made legally binding commitments, and anything short of fulfilling that commitments is considered a default. She added that Ottawa will hold the automaker accountable legally. Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, supported the government decision, pointing out that what’s the point of bonusing someone to maintain their footprint if they’ve reneged on the commitment. He framed the decision as a way to remind the automakers that the incentives come with expectations and hopes they’ll backtrack. Trump’s reshoring push pressures automakers as Canada retaliates Donald Trump’s reshoring agenda has put companies under pressure to expand U.S.-based production, prioritizing domestic auto-manufacturing and imposing steep penalties on imports. U.S tariffs of up to 25% on non-compliant vehicles have helped reshape firms’ decisions across North America. The current decision by GM highlights a growing trend of battery and EV manufacturers scaling back production following s slump in demand for EVs. Cryptopolitan reported recently that Dan Inc. closed down operations for the same reason. The closure of Dana led to the layoffs of approximately 200 employees. For the U.S. front, the slump in demand was mainly attributed to the expiry of tax credits on EVs on September 30. Dana’s market exit appears to be reciprocated across the industry, although the Chinese rivals, such as BYD, seem to keep up. The policy change by the Canadian government reflects a fragile balance in Canada’s automotive industry. Champagne wrote to GM’s president, Kristian Aquilina, that the remission quotas could be revisited. The Finance Minister noted that should GM secure another mandate for Ingersoll and vehicle production increases, the remission quotas will be revisited. He added that similar conditions apply to Stellantis, whose quotas will only be restored if it launches a new Canadian production line. The government decision effectively rolls back the trade incentive despite a 25% retaliatory tariff imposed last year amid escalating tensions over the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

One of those has been the verification process, with countless users complaining online about having to wait weeks or even months only to be denied at the end. Now, though, the team behind the project has issued a new update, providing more detailed information on the KYC procedures, the number of successfully verified users, and what’s next. Verified Pioneers The new update from the Pi Network Core Team reads that over 3.36 million additional users (referred to as Pioneers) had successfully passed the complete Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures. This became possible after the recent release of a system process that conducts additional checks for Tentative KYC cases and enabled more than 4.76 million Tentative KYC’d users to become eligible for full KYC completion. “This large-scale system process includes complex mechanisms using advanced AI models and analyzing large datasets from liveness checks and KYC application data. It is designed to analyze Tentative KYC cases to verify both that each applicant is a real, living person and that their application passes the additional checks required to fully pass KYC.” These new procedures allow the team to prevent “cheating accounts” from passing KYC, help uphold the project’s policy of one account per person, and “further protect the integrity of the network and fairness for honest, real Pioneers.” It’s worth noting that not all of the 3.36 million noted above have migrated to the Mainnet blockchain – the number as of press time stands at 2.69 million. Those who have not made the move yet need to check if they have fully passed KYC and complete the Mainnet Checklist. They might also need to conduct “liveness checks as soon as possible” to become eligible for the new system process to help get fully verified. PI Price Update Despite all the updates and news coming from the Core Team, Pi Network’s native token has been in a free-fall state for months. It has lost over 93% of its value since the ATH marked in late February. Its correction continued this week with another slip below $0.20. However, it has defended that level as of press time and trades just inches above it. The token unlock schedule for the next month doesn’t appear too painful as the average number of coins to be released daily sits at just over four million, which is a lot less than the 8-9 million seen during the summer. This means that the immediate selling pressure could ease, especially from investors who receive their tokens now. Pi Token Unlock Schedule.

The Reserve aims to accumulate approximately 10% of the total CXT supply within a few years. At that point, the plan will utilize both on-chain and off-chain revenue, including regular CXT buybacks. The Covalent team stated that it aims to reduce market volatility for CXT by creating reserves. 26 million tokens were bought back in 2025, providing governance oversight for future releases. In 2025 alone, over 17 million CXT were repurchased through off-chain revenue-backed buybacks and 9.05 million CXT through daily automated on-chain buybacks, for a total of 26 million tokens. CXT rose following the news, but has since pared back most of its gains. CXT continues to trade at $0.015. *This is not investment advice.

On Thursday, the company announced it’s transferring all hourly staff from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, to the nearby Dearborn Truck Plant to push out more units of the F-Series, especially the F-150. This comes as Ford sets a new goal: boost F-Series output by 50,000 trucks in 2026, all in efforts of making up for lost ground after a fire broke out at Novelis’ Oswego facility in September. This isn’t the first time Ford’s electric division got hit. Back in late 2024, the company also paused F-150 Lightning production for seven weeks, trying to cut costs as demand slowed. Ford freezes EV push to double down on gas trucks The Novelis’ Oswego plant supplies a big chunk of aluminum used in Ford’s trucks, so the blaze hit its supply chain hard. Ford’s finance chief warned during Thursday’s earnings call that the fire may burn up to $2 billion from the company’s Q4 2025 adjusted profits. James Farley, the company’s CEO, also said during the earnings call, “We are adding up to 1,000 new jobs to increase F-Series production to recover lost volume and fulfill strong customer demand.” And part of that plan means freezing production of the F‑150 Lightning, which is built at the now-empty Rouge Electric Vehicle Center. According to the press release, “F‑150 Lightning assembly at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center will remain paused as Ford prioritizes gas and hybrid F‑Series trucks, which are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminum.” So every single person working at that plant is getting reassigned to focus on the gas and hybrid models that actually make money right now. Ford brought in $50.5 billion in revenue during Q3, up 9% from the same time in 2024. Its stock has climbed 11.6% in the past year. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

FINTRAC Slaps $126 Million Fine On Crypto Exchange Cryptomus According to an official announcement on October 22, Canada’s FINTRAC has slapped a massive penalty of $126 million on Vancouver-based digital assets trading platform Cryptomus. The exchange was found in breach of multiple federal AML and counter-terrorist financing laws. Notably, the fine imposed by FINTRAC on the trading platform is the largest penalty slapped on a Canada-based virtual assets entity to date. Cryptomus failed to report more than 1,000 suspicious transactions between July 1, 2024, and July 31, 2024. In addition to the 1,000 unreported transactions, Cryptomus was also found guilty of not reporting 1,500 large digital currency transactions with questionable digital trails. It also failed to comply with a Ministerial Directive. The regulator stated that the unreported transactions were largely related to child sexual abuse material, ransomware payments, fraud, and sanctions evasion. Further, Cryptomus failed to keep its compliance policies updated. Per the FINTRAC press release, Cryptomus also did not assess risks of illicit finance, and failed to report crucial business changes as required by law. Commenting on the development, FINTRAC CEO Sarah Paquet said: Given that numerous violations in this case were connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion, Fintrac was compelled to take this unprecedented enforcement action. It should be highlighted that the Canadian financial regulator has been having a relatively busy 2025. Earlier this year, in February, FINTRAC issued an alert about the role of virtual asset funds in cleaning illicit funds tied to fentanyl and opioid trafficking. Similarly, in September, the Canadian police confirmed the largest digital assets seizure in the country’s history. At the time, Canada’s RCMP seized digital assets worth $40 million belonging to Montreal-based crypto exchange TradeOgre. 2025: The Year Of Penalties 2025 has seen an uptick in digital assets entities and traders facing fines for breach of laws. For example, Hungary’s financial watchdog announced that traders could face five years in prison for trading on unauthorized digital assets trading platforms. Similarly, one of the largest global digital assets exchanges by trading volume, OKX, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in the US. As a result, the exchange was fined $504 million. That said, some countries’ citizens are pushing back against draconian digital assets laws. For instance, a controversial digital assets bill in Poland – Bill 1424 – is facing pushback from the Polish virtual assets community. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $109,401, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|AML|Anti-Money Laundering|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Canada|crypto|Cryptocurrency|Cryptomus|digital asset|fintrac,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-24 08:00:34

Related Reading: Crypto Market Records ‘Particularly Robust’ Q3 Performance With 16% Active Trader Growth – Report US President Grants Pardon To Binance Founder On Thursday, the White House revealed that US President Donald Trump had pardoned Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, two years after pleading guilty. In an official statement, the White House’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that the US President “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” Leavitt stated that “In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.” In 2023, Zhao pleaded guilty to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations while being the CEO of Binance. As part of his plea deal, he stepped down from his position in the crypto exchange and served a four-month prison sentence last year. Additionally, Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ). The White House press secretary affirmed that “these actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States’ reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation,” declaring that “the Biden Administration’s war on crypto is over.” Notably, there have been rumors that President Trump could grant a pardon to Zhao after January’s pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Zhao allegedly had been “pushing” a Binance US deal for a pardon since 2024. However, he quickly denied these claims. In an X post, CZ thanked the Trump Administration, stating that he is “deeply grateful” for the long-awaited pardon and “to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.” The Binance co-founder also pledged to “do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto.” CZ Pardon Pushes BNB To $1,100 Following the news, BNB saw a 5.5% jump to reclaim the $1,100 mark. The cryptocurrency has recorded a massive rally over the past few months, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,375 nearly two weeks ago. Altcoin Sherpa highlighted the altcoin’s price action amid the recent market performance. However, he expressed doubt about whether BNB will “continue being the strongest major or not,” at least in the short term. He suggested that Solana (SOL) could have a better performance in the coming weeks, arguing that “both ETH and BNB had incredible runs previously and probably need more time to chill out.” Related Reading: Fetch.AI CEO Offers Reward To ‘Uncover’ Ocean Protocol’s Alleged $120M FET Dump Since last Friday’s correction, BNB has been trading within the $1,050-$1,125 range, failing to break out of the upper level for the past six days. Analyst Open4Profit noted that if the altcoin reclaims the range’s resistance, the price could rally toward its ATH levels and continue its price discovery uptrend toward the $1,500 target. Market watcher CW pointed out that BNB has two key sell walls ahead, one at the $1,180-$1,190 area and another between the $1,200-$1,220 mark, suggesting that the altcoin could face resistance around these levels if the price breaks out. As of this writing, BNB is trading at $1,116, a 10.5% increase in the monthly timeframe.

In a time of growing uncertainty about the structure of global finance, more experts are looking to digital assets like XRP as a solution. Aljarrah suggests that XRP’s function may extend far beyond payments or retail speculation, highlighting its role in managing liquidity globally . The global economy runs on debt, not dollars. When that system breaks, it’ll need a neutral bridge to reset and reprice value. That’s why XRP exists, to absorb and settle the world’s liquidity. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 22, 2025 A System Built on Debt Aljarrah stated that “the global economy runs on debt, not dollars.” This assertion reflects a view held by some economists that debt instruments, rather than fiat currency itself, sustain the movement of global capital. In this framework, money creation relies on credit expansion, and sovereign debt acts as collateral for much of the financial system’s activity. According to Aljarrah, when this debt-based system reaches a structural limit, it will require “a neutral bridge to reset and reprice value.” He believes that the existing monetary framework may reach a point where traditional mechanisms of settlement and valuation no longer suffice. The need for neutrality in this context refers to an asset or technology that is not directly tied to the liabilities of any single government or central bank, and XRP perfectly fits the role of a neutral bridge asset . XRP as a Bridge Asset Aljarrah stated, “That’s why XRP exists, to absorb and settle the world’s liquidity,” outlining his belief that the token could function as this neutral intermediary. The XRP Ledger is designed to facilitate near-instant settlement and currency exchange between financial institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supporters of the technology argue that such capabilities position it uniquely for use in a future environment where cross-border liquidity management becomes more critical than ever. In Aljarrah’s perspective, XRP’s design enables it to handle the transition from debt-based instruments to a system that prioritizes efficient settlement and transparency. Effects on XRP’s Market Role If such a transformation were to occur, XRP’s valuation could become closely linked to its adoption within global payment networks . The token’s utility in real-time gross settlement and foreign exchange operations would place demand on its liquidity pool. That dynamic could influence its price, not as a result of retail trading cycles but through sustained institutional use. Such an outcome depends on significant structural changes within the global monetary framework and widespread coordination among central banks, regulators, and financial institutions, and Aljarrah presents XRP as a strong candidate for this role.

Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Canary Capital’s proposed spot Litecoin ETF remains in limbo after the SEC took no action by its Thursday deadline, leaving the crypto industry uncertain amid a looming government shutdown. Analysts say the regulator’s new approach may render old ETF filing deadlines obsolete, as applicants are now being asked to rely solely on S-1 registration approvals. As I understand it, the shutdown could affect the $LTC ETF approval because the @SECGov still needs to sign off on the S-1 and the agency is operating on a skeleton crew.

Although Wright did not explicitly mention crypto miners in his Oct. 23 letter directed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), industry experts believe the proposed measures could significantly benefit mining operations by streamlining their path to power access. Power demand across sectors like AI and crypto mining to grow In the letter, Wright pushes for the Commission to initiate a formal rulemaking process that would establish “efficient, timely, and non-discriminatory” procedures for large electricity loads, defined as facilities requiring more than 20 megawatts, to connect directly to the bulk transmission system. He argues that such loads are rapidly expanding, led in large part by the growth of AI infrastructure and large-scale data centres. “United States electricity demand is expected to grow at an extraordinary pace,” Wright wrote, citing recent assessments by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) showing the fastest demand growth in two decades. While he points to several contributing factors, including home and vehicle electrification, the letter places particular emphasis on the urgent need to accommodate “increasing quantities of large commercial and industrial load.” Wright maintains that asserting FERC’s jurisdiction over these interconnections “falls squarely within the Commission’s jurisdiction” and is “in the public’s interest.” According to him, this change is essential to revitalising American industry and AI development, both of which “will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system.” Crypto miners could jack in within 60 days The letter urges FERC to begin drafting rules that would enable large-scale electricity users to directly interconnect with the interstate transmission grid, bypassing the delays and limitations associated with connecting through local distribution lines. Wright recommends that if a facility agrees to fund its own necessary network upgrades, connection reviews could be completed in as little as 60 days. S. Matthew Schultz, CEO of Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark, was quick to highlight the implications for the crypto mining sector. In a post on X, Schultz described the letter as a “major signal that DOE recognizes the value of flexible demand in strengthening the grid.” Crypto mining operations, which are capable of scaling their load dynamically in response to grid conditions, could be particularly well-positioned to benefit from an expedited interconnection process, according to Schultz. Bitcoin miners require significant power to operate their mining rigs, which validate transactions and create new blocks. The more miners participate, the higher the hashrate, which helps secure the network. Trump supports crypto mining in the US The changes would fit perfectly within the current administration’s pro-crypto agenda, which has increasingly embraced Bitcoin mining as part of its “ Made in America ” economic strategy. Last year, President Trump hosted a private meeting with Bitcoin mining executives at Mar-a-Lago, after which he publicly stated his desire to see “all remaining Bitcoin mined, minted and made in the USA.” Trump argued that domestic mining not only boosts economic activity and job creation but also helps the country achieve “energy dominance” by monetising surplus power and supporting grid stability. The administration has also taken steps to deregulate the crypto sector, including a January 2025 executive order promoting American leadership in digital financial technologies, which reinforced the right to mine as a protected industrial activity. However, the push to support energy-intensive operations like crypto mining is not without global controversy. In other jurisdictions, regulators have increasingly blamed the sector for placing undue strain on electricity supplies and infrastructure. This has led to policy moves that contrast sharply with supportive calls within the US.

According to an IMF regional economic outlook study for Asia, trade has been crucial to the region’s economic growth, with China serving as a global hub for commodity production within the supply chain. As such, the region is susceptible to the adverse effects of U.S.-China trade tensions and President Trump’s tariffs. IMF urges Asia to deepen regional trade integration The IMF report stated that Asia’s intraregional commerce has increased as a result of trade tensions with the U.S. and a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. The report emphasized that removing trade barriers and encouraging deeper regional trade integration could help Asian nations diversify their export markets, reduce costs, and mitigate the negative effects of the tariff shock. Krishna Srnivasan, Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department, explained that only 30% of exports from Asian nations are produced locally, indicating the region’s dependence on the American and European markets. In contrast, about 60% of all exports are produced within Asia , demonstrating the region’s high level of integration in the trading of intermediate goods. Srinivasan claimed that, as part of trade talks with the U.S., some nations are willing to lower non-tariff barriers. He argued that increased regional trade integration and the association of Southeast Asian Nations economies could result in a 1.4% increase in Asia’s GDP over the medium term. The UN agency expects Asia’s economy to grow 4.5% in 2025, down from 4.6% the previous year but up 0.6 percentage points from its April estimate, due to robust exports driven by pre-tariff shipments. The IMF predicts that trade tensions, poor Chinese demand for manufactured products, and lackluster private consumption in emerging economies will cause growth to drop to 4.1% in 2026. On October 16, the IMF predicted Japan’s economic growth to decrease from 1.1 percent to 0.6 percent, while China’s is expected to slow from 4.8 percent this year to 4.2 percent next year. India is expected to continue growing at a rate of 6.6% this year, the highest among major emerging economies, before falling to 6.2% the following year. Korea’s growth rate is expected to increase from 0.9% to 1.8% this year. For the second consecutive year, the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to grow by 4.3 percent. IMF warns Asia of tariff risks The UN agency updated its projection for Asia’s economic growth, cautioning that regions highly involved in global supply chains may suffer a serious setback if U.S.-China tensions continue to escalate. Krishna Srinivasan mentioned that the Asia-Pacific economy was performing better than anticipated in April, despite being the region hardest hit by U.S. tariffs. Srinivasan cautioned that the “dust on tariffs has not settled yet” and could still rise, posing serious threats to the region’s prospects. U.S. President Trump threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese imports by an additional 100% beginning on November 1. The tariff increase happened in response to Beijing’s expansion of its export curbs on rare earths, which heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China . Srinivasan claimed that a spike in intra-regional commerce and companies’ front-loading cargo ahead of the tariff hikes helped boost exports across major Asian economies. AI-driven technological advancements also increased exports, particularly from Japan and South Korea. Srinivasan added that a weak dollar, rising equity markets, and reduced long-term borrowing costs have all been beneficial to Asia’s economic momentum. On October 20, the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported that, as trade tensions with the U.S. erupted and property market issues continued, China’s economic growth slowed in the three months leading up to the end of September. The NBS claimed that the second-largest economy in the world expanded at its slowest rate in a year, 4.8%, when compared to the same period in 2024. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The ornate structure is already under construction on the East Wing grounds, with groundbreaking having begun earlier this week. White House officials say the $300 million project will be fully privately funded through the Trust for the National Mall nonprofit. The ballroom is intended to host state dinners and other events, replacing costly South Lawn tents. Trump has pledged personal contributions and touted the venue’s longevity for future administrations. While he insists no taxpayer dollars will be used, the donor list has raised eyebrows, with critics warning it could serve as a pay-for-play route to the administration. Crypto firms bolster elite donor list Trump’s new White House ballroom has a donor roster that features around 40 prominent corporations and billionaires. While it blends Silicon Valley powerhouses with defense and energy players, also prominent are companies from across the burgeoning crypto space. The list of tech giants includes major players such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and HP Inc. In early September, Trump hosted several tech titans at a White House dinner. Among defense companies are Lockheed Martin and Palantir. T-Mobile, tobacco firm Altria Group Inc., and railroad operator Union Pacific are also part of the heavyweight donor group. Crypto’s presence stands out with Ripple, Tether and Coinbase. Ripple is the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency and Ripple USD stablecoin, while Tether is contributing via Tether America, the US arm of the world’s top stablecoin provider behind USDT. Coinbase joins the elite list too, having attended an October 15 donor dinner. Individual crypto advocates include Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, as well as Charles and Marissa Cascarilla of crypto bank Paxos. Critics point to ‘pay-to-play’ fears Crypto companies pledging millions of dollars to the infrastructure project comes amid Trump’s continued positive nod to the industry. On Thursday, October 23, the US president pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, adding to a list of similar orders since taking office for a second term in January. While the industry has welcomed the move, ethical concerns have only intensified. Former Bush ethics counsel Richard Painter has called it an “ethics nightmare,” warning of a “pay-to-play” outlook. “It’s using access to the White House to raise money,” Painter told BBC. These corporations all want something from the government. Jessica Tarlov @JessicaTarlov · Follow Donald Trump is building a ballroom twice the size of the White House. He says it’s “his money,” but it’s really from companies chasing favors. Meanwhile, farmers can’t sell soybeans and the government’s shut down. This isn’t what Americans voted for.

During the previous Biden administration, the crypto space complained of an anti-crypto stance, and many firms in the sector that are now cozying up to Trump were largely unwelcome in Washington.

What's Expected? How Will Bitcoin (BTC) and Cryptocurrencies Be Affected? Here Are Three Possible Scenarios!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/markets-focus-on-us-cpi-data-today-whats-expected-how-will-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrencies-be-affected-here-are-three-possible-scenarios/,"While the announcement that the US and Chinese leaders will meet on October 30 has somewhat alleviated trade-related market concerns, investors in global markets are now focused on today's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. The continued government shutdown in the US restricts access to critical data released by public institutions and makes it difficult to formulate predictions regarding the steps the Fed will take regarding interest rates. At this point, the CPI data in question is expected to provide more clues regarding the Fed's meeting next week. What are the CPI Expectations? US September CPI data is expected to be released today at 3:30 PM Turkish time. The data was delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has entered its 24th day. The CPI is the most important indicator for the Fed's interest rate decision, with economists predicting a 0.4% monthly increase and 3.1% annual inflation. This means the CPI, a critical threshold for both traditional and cryptocurrency markets, will surpass 3% for the first time in 2025. What is the Impact on Cryptocurrency? CPI data is closely followed by cryptocurrency investors as well as global markets. At this point, economists predict that the CPI data could lead to significant volatility in cryptocurrencies. A lower CPI could trigger rallies in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies, while higher inflation could trigger a short-term sell-off. “Investors should keep a close eye on this CPI figure. It could shape everything from interest rate expectations to riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies,” said crypto analyst Ash Crypto. Ash Crypto also outlined the possible CPI scenario that could influence the short-term direction of the crypto market. Scenario 1: Bitcoin and Ethereum Fall if CPI Comes Above 3.1%: If the CPI comes above 3.1%, it will mark the highest inflation since June 2024. This typically slows economic growth and makes riskier assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum less attractive. This scenario could signal a decline for riskier assets. Scenario 2: If CPI Comes in at 3.1% as Expected; Neutral but Slightly Hawkish: According to the analyst, this situation could push Fed Chair Jerome Powell to take a hawkish stance and keep risk appetite limited until he sees more clarity from the central bank. Scenario 3: CPI Below 3.1%: A Bullish Catalyst for the Crypto Market: The most positive scenario for cryptocurrencies is a CPI below 3.1%. This is because low inflation increases the likelihood of interest rate cuts, encouraging liquidity inflows into riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. This could be the green light the market has been waiting for. It could provide new momentum for Bitcoin and Ethereum to rise. *This is not investment advice.

In this context, the launch of Studio Chain by Karrat Foundation is not just another flash in the pan. The Layer 2 blockchain, built for web3 gaming and entertainment, aims to avoid the trap of excessive hype and the limitations of blockchain games, which failed to survive market conditions due to unsustainable tokenomics, insufficient investor backing, or poor retention. Studio Chain is powered by $KARRAT, the native gas token, and was developed on Caldera and Arbitrum Orbit. The official launch partner, AMGI Studios, will debut its flagship title, My Pet Hooligan, as the first project on the new layer. The game is an Epic MegaGrant Recipient, won Best Action Game at the 2023 GAM3 Awards, and was officially selected for Mix LA Comic Con 2025, Debut Festival 2025, Mix Fall Game Showcase 2025, and devGAMM Showcase 2025. It is a real-world example of how web3 infrastructure can be used by mainstream entertainment IPs to improve accessibility and user experience. A unique staking-based mechanism democratizes governance Transparent governance with traditional gatekeepers sounds like an oxymoron, but decentralized autonomous organizations have their own set of issues. Theoretically, DAO blockchain governance enables members to manage a collective entity without a centralized authority. However, users’ voting rights are typically proportional to their contributions or stakes in the organization, skewing governance in favor of larger players. Studio Chain introduces Resiliency Nodes, a unique staking-based mechanism. Twenty nodes, each activated by staking 5 million $KARRAT, will go live at launch. The RN model lowers the entry barrier in contrast to conventional validator systems, using open, pooled staking instead of license-based access. As a result, all community members contribute to uptime and security, regardless of how much they invest. The innovative model enhances security amid the ongoing vulnerabilities that threaten DAOs’ integrity and functionality. Interoperability limitations and network congestion complicate operations, while security breaches loom as constant threats. Governance capture is another security issue, which occurs when wealthy stakeholders or external entities manipulate DAO governance processes, undermining community goals and interests. Active community engagement and transparency help prevent governance capture, and Studio Chain’s L2 status and transparency features help ensure that decisions reflect the collective will and not individual interests. Fair token allocation is essential to preventing dominance and ensuring inclusive decision-making, as an unequal distribution centralizes control. Limits on holdings and transparent token issuance promote unbiased, token-based governance and community involvement, reinforcing the decentralized ethos. Studio Chain’s architecture supports token-based incentive systems, interoperability, and on-chain ownership, and enables traditional media workflow integration, potentially allowing studios and creators to access democratized funding channels and mitigate issues with tokenized IP and content rights. This is relevant because blockchain games typically feature decentralized storage and pseudonymous ownership, which pose challenges for copyright enforcement. Due to gaps in copyright law in many countries, these opportunities depend not on statutory entitlement, but rather on the rules of the platforms selling the digital assets and the underlying code. Promising implications for performance and product quality A combination of L2 solutions, custom architecture, and sidechains can fulfill web3 gaming’s promise of being fast, scalable, fun, and affordable. Studio Chain can combine multiple transactions into a single batch before moving them to an L1 solution, reducing gas fees and congestion. It therefore functions as a dedicated web3 gaming network, with Arbitrum’s scaling capabilities guaranteeing the quality of the underlying architecture. Democratizing funding channels is imperative as critics find that many web3 launchpads advance ideas without substance . The current industry needs higher-quality products, not large quantities of them. As of February 2025, Virtuals Protocol has facilitated more than 17,000 AI agent token launches, but questions remain about launchpads’ accountability and sustainability. While projects lacking substance continue to secure funding, most end up failing, reflecting a deeper problem within the industry. Launchpads have been reduced to hollow cash funnels that fund initiatives without requiring a solid technical base or even a real product. Studio Chain’s focus on practical, entertainment use cases is a breath of fresh air in a space that bombards investors with superficial hype and half-baked pitches. Raising capital without reliable support may have worked for earlier web3 projects, where long-term growth considerations took a backseat to token distribution, but it does not benefit the market anymore. Gone are the days of low-effort launches and quick wins; new launches must focus on actual use cases and real products as regulatory scrutiny increases. Reliable infrastructure increases funding opportunities Quality product launches make the case for why blockchain gaming remains viable and worthwhile. The industry is down, but not done. The data at the beginning shows that both the industry reset and the buildup are real. Almost three-quarters (74.8%) of Q2 2025 funding was in infrastructure, while the rest went to web3 game studios. Evidently, investors are betting on the meat and bones of game development. Most developers need several disconnected tools to move a project forward, in addition to many other factors to be addressed, including security, server hosting, maintenance costs, and backend development. It’s no surprise that projects can stall before launching. The focus is predominantly on raising capital, but capital doesn’t eliminate operational bottlenecks in itself. Developers require end-to-end support and the right tools to build holistic products, but resign themselves to patching projects. Layer 2 blockchains’ low-latency infrastructure unlocks high-speed applications, making web3 feel as responsive as web2 without sacrificing its reliability and decentralization guarantees.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the clear choice, combining an innovative dual-lending DeFi protocol that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with unmatched capital efficiency. Its presale has already raised over $17.8 million, with the ongoing phase 6 nearly complete as investors FOMO in. Mutuum Finance is on track to become the next big cryptocurrency, with analysts highlighting its potential to become the next crypto to explode in 2025. For investors seeking a strategic shift from meme-driven assets like SHIB, Mutuum Finance offers a rare combination of utility, presale momentum, and exponential growth potential, making it one of the top cryptos to watch this year. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bears Dominate Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trending downward in a bearish trend after a third-touch rejection, which triggered a strong bearish impulse leg. SHIB sellers pushed the asset beneath its past trading range, and every attempt at a bounce is still losing strength under the falling resistance, which shows diminishing demand. Price is presently in the swap area and below the cluster of trendlines, so the sellers have not lost control yet. If SHIB fails to reclaim the green support box shown below, downtrend momentum can be pulled to the next target zone because bear pressure remains in control. Since SHIB is encountering technical challenges, investors seeking better fundamentals and growth prospects are turning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is stealing the limelight as the next big cryptocurrency in anticipation of the next market cycle. Mutuum Finance’s Hyper-Growing Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming the most popular coin of 2025 following a record-breaking presale success. In six stages, the protocol has registered $17.8 million of sales of its coins to over 17,380 investors, with Phase 6 already sold out more than 70% ahead of expectations. Sustained investor appetite has been generated by the speedy adoption, and Mutuum Finance is being recognized as the next crypto to explode and one of the top new coins of the DeFi space. At the current price of $0.035, MUTM provides investors with the lowest point of entry before the next phase to reach a 14.28% price appreciation. It is an early investment opportunity before a phase of extreme growth. For an investor who seeks a high-potential cryptocurrency with early rewards, MUTM leads the charge with DeFi innovation, real-world applicability, and long-term potential. Earn Passive Income with Crypto MUTM platform users can stake crypto assets, like USDT in liquidity pools and receive passive income. APY rates change with market demand, which means returns vary too. $100,000 staked with a 10% APY delivers $10,000 annually. Your crypto assets will increase steadily without liquidation or direct action. Borrow Without Liquidating Your Assets The platform also offers a chance for the lenders to borrow cash without selling their cryptos. For instance, if you own ETH but need cash for daily purposes or other investment ventures, you can borrow a USDT loan using your ETH as collateral. The loan is not collateralized over a term; the interest is charged in terms of an APY that will pick up prevailing market conditions. This type of structure provides flexibility to lenders while keeping them on their initial outlays. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $17.8 million from over 17,380 supporters, Phase 6 over 70% subscribed at $0.035, the lowest buy-in point before escalating prices. For investors seeking to move away from meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) to a high-utility, high-growth crypto asset, MUTM presents a historic opportunity as the next big cryptocurrency and a next crypto to explode. Its two-way lending DeFi program presents passive returns and convenience of liquid borrowability, presenting true-world financial utility for investors.

Key Takeaways: BitMine chair Tom Lee warned that Bitcoin could still see 50% drawdowns, despite growing institutional adoption. Lee said Bitcoin continues to mirror the stock market, often amplifying equity market moves by double. While cautioning about volatility, Lee remains bullish long-term, predicting Bitcoin could reach $200,000–$250,000 this year. Speaking in an interview with Anthony Pompliano published Thursday, Lee said he expects “50% drawdowns” to remain part of Bitcoin’s price history, even as institutional adoption grows. Tom Lee Says Bitcoin Still Mirrors Stock Market, Warns of 40% Drops His comments come amid rising optimism that Bitcoin’s price swings have softened thanks to spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional participation. However, Lee cautioned that Bitcoin continues to move in tandem with traditional markets, and tends to amplify those moves. “The stock market has more frequent 25% drawdowns,” he said. “So if the S&P is down 20%, Bitcoin could be down 40%.” Lee added that while the broader economy has matured in recent years, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities means sharp corrections are still likely. Despite that, he remains long-term bullish. On the Bankless podcast earlier this month, Lee repeated his prediction that Bitcoin could climb to $200,000–$250,000 by the end of the year. A 50% drop from those levels would put Bitcoin back near $125,000, roughly its current all-time high. On the other hand, if Bitcoin has already peaked for this cycle, as some analysts who follow the traditional four-year cycle argue, a 50% decline from its current price of around $110,000 would push it down to roughly $55,000, levels not seen since September 2024, according to CoinMarketCap data. I sat down with @fundstrat to discuss whether AI is a bubble, why this may be the most hated stock market rally in history, and how misleading economic data shapes investor sentiment. Tom also shares his latest views on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and why innovation in crypto markets is… pic.twitter.com/5GSKz5V1X0 — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) October 24, 2025 Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently issued a similar warning, comparing Bitcoin’s chart to the soybean market of the 1970s, which crashed by half after a massive rally. Historical precedent supports the risk: after hitting $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin plunged nearly 50% to $35,000 in just three months. Still, not everyone agrees with the bearish outlook. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor said in June that the era of deep crypto winters is over: “Winter is not coming back.” Lee, meanwhile, believes Bitcoin may be entering a “longer cycle,” one that could reshape how investors think about both its rallies and inevitable corrections. Tom Lee Doubles Down on Ethereum as DAT Bubble Shows Signs of Bursting As reported, Lee has reaffirmed his bullish stance on Ethereum (ETH) , revealing a $1.5 billion purchase following last weekend’s market crash. Despite warning that digital asset treasuries (DATs) are trading below their net asset value (NAV), suggesting a potential bubble burst, Lee told Fortune he views the pullback as a long-term buying opportunity. Lee’s move was mirrored by BitMine Immersion Technologies, which accumulated 379,271 ETH worth roughly $1.5 billion across three major purchases this week, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The mining firm now holds over 3 million ETH, or 2.5% of the total supply, making it one of the largest corporate holders of Ether. BitMine reportedly aims to control 5% of all ETH in circulation, positioning itself as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Speaking with Cathie Wood, Lee compared Ethereum’s future to how Wall Street shifted from gold to equities after 1971, arguing that ETH could eventually “flip Bitcoin” as the dominant store of value.

Many have turned to technical analysis, reading chart formations and patterns in a bid to pinpoint the next move. Others turn to market sentiment, using social commentary in a bid to determine what might happen next. However, one lesser-known route some analysts have taken is astrology, which is a study of how the movement of celestial bodies affects human behaviour, and ultimately, the Bitcoin and crypto market. Using The Moon Cycles To Predict Bitcoin Movements Crypto analyst Draz is one of the few who use astrology to actually analyze the market and what could happen in relation to the position of the moon. In an X post, the analyst clearly outlined how the moon cycles have been affecting the Bitcoin price, and thus, how the upcoming cycles could play out for the price. Related Reading: XRP Price Teleport To $6: What Happens When The Euphoric Phase Begin Draz explained that the dark phase of the moon, which had occurred back on October 13, had actually pointed to choppy price action for Bitcoin. This comes days after the October 10 liquidation event that saw over $19 billion in losses in a single day. Nevertheless, this choppy price action is expected to still be slightly bullish as it continues to play out. After the Bitcoin price bounced from its $102,000 liquidation lows, Draz also explains that there was an energy drain, coinciding with the last quarter moon. This also follows the previously established trend of the Bitcoin price falling during dark moon periods, with four out of the last five dark moon periods leading to a decline in price. However, there is also a silver lining with this with the advent of the new moon that began on October 21. The new moon has sometimes ushered in price reversals, leading to an uptick in price, but nothing substantial yet. Rather, all eyes now are on October 29, when the real move could begin. Related Reading: Altcoin Season: Here’s What Happens If The Bitcoin Price Sees A Parabolic Move To $200,000 This is because October 29 is when the next First Quarter moon is supposed to appear. This is the precursor to the next bright moon, and these have historically been bullish for price. This will lead into the month of November, where the bulls could really take over. Crypto analyst Draz believes that the month of November could lead to fireworks for the Bitcoin price. Looking at the shared chart, the analyst shows a possible move up to the $138,000 territory, leading into the Last Quarter Moon on November 11.

53573937,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=844110,1761298481,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53573937.jpeg,Canadian judge says crypto platform not responsible after user ignored scam alerts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/canadian-court-exchange-not-liable-scam/,"A British Columbia court has ruled that a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange was not responsible for a customer’s C$671,000 (US$480,000) loss after the woman ignored several warnings that a scam was targeting her. Justice Lindsay LeBlanc of the British Columbia Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit brought by Victoria resident Yan Li Xu against Calgary-based exchange NDAX Canada last Monday, ruling in favor of the platform. The Supreme Court Justice said NDAX fulfilled its duties and acted appropriately to prevent her from being defrauded. NDAX issued four warnings before the transfer According to the written judgment released on Monday, Xu transferred more than C$671,000 in digital assets through NDAX to an external wallet for an online investment opportunity, which later turned out to be fraudulent. NDAX, registered as a money service business with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), had given Xu four warnings about potential fraud before she completed the transactions. Justice LeBlanc wrote that NDAX identified “suspicious financial activity and cautioned the plaintiff not to proceed, but the plaintiff did not heed the warning.” The first warning was issued when Xu accepted the exchange’s Crypto Risk Disclosure, acknowledging that crypto transactions are irreversible. Xu “confirmed to the defendant she had received and understood the Crypto Risk Disclosure by clicking accept on these platform pages.” A second alert soon followed, reminding Xu that crypto withdrawals could not be undone once processed. The disclosure stated: “I understand crypto asset withdrawals are final and irreversible. NDAX will not be liable for losses from my inaccurate information or for delays from network issues outside NDAX’s control.” Xu clicked yes again. The third came on April 18, 2023, when an NDAX employee personally called Xu to verify the transaction. During that conversation, the employee explicitly warned her that she was “likely being scammed” and strongly advised her not to proceed. Xu insisted on continuing, leading the staff member to escalate the matter due to “risk factors.” The phone call, which was recorded, formed part of the court evidence. “I find that the defendant’s warnings to the plaintiff could not have been clearer,” Justice LeBlanc wrote in her ruling. The fourth and final warning came from NDAX compliance officer Julia Baranovskaya, who called Xu again to confirm she understood the repercussions. Baranovskaya explained to Xu she “might be the target of crypto fraud” and reiterated that once the transfer was made, it could not be reversed. “Ms. Baranovskaya testified that the defendant did not know who controlled the recipient wallet as that information was not known to the defendant and all they could do was warn the plaintiff that the First Transaction exhibited signs of potential fraud. This evidence was also unchallenged,” Judge LeBlanc surmised. During the conversation, Xu assured the officer that she was experienced in financial matters. She reportedly said she had traded stocks for over 20 years, was an accountant by profession, and was using her own investment savings. NDAX fulfilled its obligations, Canadian court rules Justice LeBlanc concluded that NDAX had gone beyond reasonable measures to protect the customer. “While the plaintiff’s losses are regrettable,” she wrote, “I find no liability rests with the defendant.” The judgment also asserted NDAX had acted responsibly by flagging suspicious activity, communicating directly with the customer, and providing written and verbal warnings. Xu’s lawsuit had argued that NDAX should have blocked her transaction altogether to prevent the loss, to which the Judge said: “The plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant breached its duty of care and I find that, in any event, the defendant did not cause the losses experienced by the plaintiff.” Canada tightens crypto oversight The ruling comes as Canada’s regulators intensify scrutiny of cryptocurrency trading platforms and compliance failures. Authorities have been pushing for tighter enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing laws in the digital asset industry both locally and internationally. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Wednesday, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada announced a record C$176.9 million penalty against a Vancouver-based cryptocurrency platform, the largest fine in its regulatory history.

53573296,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/industry-fragmentation-meets-its-solution-interview-with-tom-babiak-ceo-of-screx,1761298598,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53573296.jpeg,"Industry Fragmentation Meets Its Solution: Interview with Tom Babiak, CEO of Screx",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/industry-fragmentation-meets-its-solution-interview-with-tom-babiak-ceo-of-screx,"DeFi promised freedom but instead delivered a fragmented ecosystem riddled with incompatible blockchains, countless protocols, and disconnected applications. This complexity creates liquidity fragmentation, divides user attention, and erodes trust across the industry. The consequence is a DeFi landscape that is confusing and difficult to navigate, preventing mainstream adoption and meaningful user empowerment. Industry leaders recognize that the path forward depends on integration and simplification to restore DeFi’s original vision. Screx, a rising player in the space, seeks to address these challenges head-on with a comprehensive platform designed to unify fragmented services. Screx offers an all-in-one DeFi hub that seamlessly connects swaps, staking, lending, farming, perpetuals, escrow, and cross-chain bridging in one intelligent platform. Leveraging Smart Routing technology combined with a powerful AI Assistant, Screx dynamically finds the most cost-effective and efficient transaction paths. Unlike fragmented protocols competing for attention, Screx positions itself as the command center for decentralized finance — focused on clarity, efficiency, and real user needs. Recently, Screx’s presale on Gems.vip, a platform responsible for over $200 million in Web3 fundraising, has accelerated investor interest and validated the project’s industry credibility. For the DeFi community, this means a trusted, scalable solution that breaks down walls and unites fragmented services under one roof. Ultimately, Screx stands as the rebel rewriting DeFi’s future by delivering true simplicity and integration where others created chaos. To better understand Screx’s strategy for tackling DeFi’s fragmentation and its vision for the industry’s future, we spoke with CEO Tom Babiak to explore what differentiates the platform — as well as evaluated its growth prospects. 1. How do you see Screx contributing to reshaping the narrative around DeFi, moving it away from hype and complexity to clarity and real-world utility?DeFi was meant to represent freedom and simplicity, but along the way it became one of the most complex areas of the blockchain industry. Today we have hundreds of apps, dozens of blockchains, and countless protocols that can’t work together. For the average user, that’s not innovation — that’s frustration. At Screx, we’re taking a different approach. We’re not adding another piece to an already fragmented puzzle — we’re organizing what already exists. We’re building an environment that connects the key functions of DeFi in one place, so users can act simply, quickly, and without the need to jump between tools. Our goal is to shift the focus from promises and marketing buzzwords to real utility, coherence, and user experience. We want DeFi to finally become what it was always meant to be — an open and understandable financial system for everyone. 2. Screx uniquely unites multiple DeFi services—swaps, staking, lending, farming, perpetuals, escrow, and cross-chain bridging—under one platform. How does this integration set you apart from your predecessors? If you look at most DeFi projects, each of them tried to solve just one piece of a much larger problem. Some focused on swaps, others on lending, farming, or bridging. As a result, anyone who truly wants to engage with DeFi today must switch between multiple apps, wallets, and protocols — which completely defeats the original idea of simplicity. We’re reversing that model. From the start, we’re designing an environment where all these elements operate within one unified logic and interface. We’re not interested in adding another app to the list — we’re interested in connecting everything that already exists into one cohesive ecosystem. Swaps, staking, lending, farming, perpetuals, and bridging — all working seamlessly within a single structure, without unnecessary switching between platforms.This isn’t just integration for convenience. It’s about creating an intelligent layer where different protocols can actually work together. That level of synergy is what truly sets Screx apart from everything that came before. 3. How do the backgrounds and expertise of the Screx team support the project’s ambitious goals and innovation in DeFi? Screx is built by a team that combines experience from across the market — blockchain and Web3 projects on one side, and traditional finance and banking on the other. This blend of technological foundation and business practice gives us a unique perspective on how to create products that are both innovative and operationally robust. Our team includes people who have collaborated with ecosystems such as Binance and Gate.io, as well as with mining, infrastructure, and fintech projects. We also bring experience from working with institutions in the banking sector, which helps us understand how to connect decentralized finance with the structured logic of the traditional economy. This allows us to view DeFi not only through the lens of innovation but also through efficiency, usability, and security. That experience directly shapes how we’re building Screx — with the user in mind, but with engineering precision and a deep understanding of the financial principles that have guided the industry for decades. 4. Can you explain how Screx’s Smart Routing and AI-powered command center work together to simplify and optimize DeFi transactions? At the heart of Screx lies the combination of two key elements: Smart Routing and an AI-driven analytical layer. These two systems are designed to work together — one handles the process, the other provides understanding and guidance. Smart Routing is the technology we’re developing to automatically find the most efficient path for every transaction. It analyzes multiple networks, protocols, and liquidity pools in real time, selecting the combination that provides the best balance of cost, speed, and security. The user doesn’t need to manage this manually — the system does it transparently and autonomously. The second layer is the AI Assistant — a tool that organizes data, translates complex processes into simple language, and suggests possible actions to the user. Over time, it will evolve into a personal AI DeFi advisor — analyzing user behavior, drawing insights from the market, and proposing actions that help operate faster, cheaper, and safer. The goal isn’t to automate decision-making but to intelligently support the user — making DeFi truly understandable and accessible. 5. For newcomers interested in DeFi, what would be the best way to start engaging with Screx’s ecosystem? Anyone who has ever tried entering DeFi knows the feeling — excitement mixed with confusion. Too many tools, too little trust, and too many steps to figure out on your own. It’s not a technological barrier — it’s a user experience barrier. Screx is being built to remove exactly that. Not by oversimplifying everything into one button, but by creating an environment that explains, guides, and protects the user at every stage. We want newcomers to feel like they’re entering a space that understands their needs, not an experimental lab. The best way to start is simply to join in — become part of our community ( linktr.ee/screx.com ), follow the project’s development, ask questions, and participate in building it. Right now, the SCRX token presale is taking place on the Gems.vip platform — and it’s more than just a token sale. It’s an invitation for those who want to be part of this transformation from the very beginning, before Screx becomes a public tool for the entire industry. We’re building a space where trust, simplicity, and security come together. It’s not just about technology — it’s about creating something that truly works for people. And this journey begins right here, with the presale. 6. You have recently stated, “We’re not competing with protocols, we’re designing a framework that lets them finally work together.” Could you elaborate on how Screx enables this cooperation?From day one, we believed that DeFi doesn’t need another protocol — it needs a structure that allows existing ones to work together. Each of these projects contributes something valuable — some build liquidity, others lending mechanisms, others security layers. The problem is that these layers currently exist side by side but don’t communicate automatically. Screx creates an integration framework where these protocols can cooperate within a single, organized environment. It’s not about replacing anything — it’s about building a bridge, a system that can connect, manage value flow, and communicate across chains in real time. This type of collaboration is not only technological but also strategic. DeFi is maturing, and with that maturity comes the need for standardization, security, and interoperability. That’s exactly what we aim to achieve — a neutral layer where protocols can coexist, cooperate, and drive the industry forward together. 7. Screx recently partnered with Gems.vip for its presale, a platform known for raising over $200 million for Web3 projects. What does this partnership signify for Screx’s credibility and growth? For us, this partnership is much more than just a presale venue. Gems.vip is one of the largest fundraising platforms in Web3, but its true value lies in the standards and the verification process every project must pass before being listed. Every project on Gems goes through technological, operational, and legal evaluation before reaching the sale stage. That means Screx has been vetted by industry leaders — from tokenomics and security mechanisms to regulatory compliance. And it’s that verification, not just the listing itself, that we consider the real mark of quality. From a business perspective, Gems also provides global reach and full operational infrastructure — access to an international community of investors, communication channels, expertise, and scaling support. This allows us not only to raise funds but to build brand awareness and trust from the early stages. In short, our partnership with Gems.vip confirms that Screx meets the highest industry standards and is ready to scale globally. It’s not the beginning of our story — it’s the moment our credibility was validated by the market. Check out our fundraising profile: gems.vip/screx 8. How are you leveraging the momentum of the presale and growing investor interest to build long-term trust and presence in the global Web3 community? For us, the presale isn’t just a fundraising phase — it’s the foundation for building trust, narrative, and community. The way a project runs its presale tells you a lot about how it will operate later. From the start, we’ve emphasized transparency and open communication. Every stage of the sale is public, prices and timelines are clearly defined, and investors have access to all project documentation, including the blackpaper and tokenomics. This approach not only builds trust but attracts people who want to participate in something credible, not just short-lived. At the same time, we use this phase to build relationships, not just transactions. We engage directly with community leaders, partners, and presale participants, collecting feedback and treating this process as part of laying the foundation — not the finish line. We believe that in Web3, trust isn’t built through marketing campaigns but through consistency. That’s why the presale is just the beginning — a moment where we show how we work, how we communicate, and how we plan to build a project that lasts long after the presale ends. 9. What accomplishments or validation are you most proud of since Screx’s launch and presale kickoff? Our biggest achievement isn’t in numbers — it’s in how the market has responded. We started with a simple idea — to unify the fragmented DeFi ecosystem — but the response we received proved it’s not just our vision, it’s an industry-wide need. For us, validation comes from three things. First, the engagement of leaders and partners who joined early and decided to actively support Screx’s growth. Second, the reaction of the community, which continues to expand and contribute not as observers, but as co-creators. And third, the partnership with Gems.vip, which confirmed that we’ve passed full technological and operational verification, placing us among projects with true global potential. Together, these factors prove we’re on the right path — that Screx isn’t just an idea but a growing movement toward a unified, integrated, and secure DeFi environment. We’re still at the beginning of this journey, but the most important thing has already happened — we’ve been noticed, and we’ve earned trust. 10. What future developments, product updates, or expansions are planned to further realize Screx’s mission of simplifying and connecting DeFi? At this stage, our focus is on building the infrastructure that connects the fragmented elements of DeFi into one cohesive environment. This is a period of intensive conceptual and technological work — we’re developing the architecture of Smart Routing, AI-powered analytics modules, and advanced layers of security and privacy. In parallel, we’re creating an open API and developer toolkit that will allow external applications and protocols to integrate seamlessly without needing modification. At the same time, we’re expanding partnerships with leading DeFi protocols and EVM networks to make Screx accessible wherever users already operate. We’re also growing our global footprint — strengthening our affiliate structure and working with KOLs and ecosystem partners to reach diverse markets and user segments. It’s an organic way of building reach and trust — through people who truly understand DeFi and want to help create something of lasting value. We’re not aiming to become “just another app.” Our mission is to build the technological foundation that allows DeFi to evolve faster, operate more efficiently, and finally make sense — for users and for the industry as a whole.

The Bloomberg report indicated that the crypto-related program will be offered globally and will rely on a third-party custodian to safeguard the assets. Recall that such speculations first emerged earlier this summer when the Financial Times revealed the initiative could launch in 2026. However, those rumors were met with significant doubt, given Dimon’s previous stance against the industry. The CEO has a rich history of criticising the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Some of his most colorful categorizations include calling bitcoin a “decentralized Ponzi scheme” and alleging that only criminals use it. However, his stance softened in the past few years, especially since Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in late 2024 and the subsequent regulatory change in the country. Although he remained a skeptic, Dimon said he would defend people’s right to buy bitcoin. JPMorgan is far from the first giant US banking institution to join the cryptocurrency craze. Morgan Stanley and BNY Mellon have been active participants for a long time, while other former naysayers like Standard Chartered have gradually changed their public views as well in recent years.

In the post, CZ criticized the US Senator for misinterpreting his case, claiming that there were no money laundering accusations. He further pointed out that Warren was a crypto skeptic, stating that five days before his sentencing, during the Biden Administration, Senator Warren announced a “war on crypto” on public television. “Is there a clearer example of how ‘Biden’s DOJ’ is being used against crypto?” he asked. Trump’s decision to pardon CZ sparks controversy The exchange between CZ and Senator Warren has fueled intense debate within the crypto community. This backlash followed US President Donald Trump’s public decision to pardon Zhao. Following Trump’s move, democrat Warren shared an X post dated October 23, strongly criticizing CZ, accusing him of fraud and money laundering. According to the senator, CZ admitted to a crime of money laundering and received a prison sentence. However, Warren claimed he later funded Trump’s stablecoin and pushed for a pardon. “Today, he received that pardon. If Congress fails to end this corruption, it will be responsible,” said the US Senator. CZ asked Warren to prove her facts before concluding such allegations. Additionally, he received significant support from the cryptocurrency community. Besides denying Warren’s claims , Zhao also refuted any direct involvement in funding USD1, Trump’s stablecoin initiative. World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol and cryptocurrency firm, issued this project connected to Donald Trump and his family. Nonetheless, a reliable source pointed out that Binance supplied the technical code for the token’s smart contract, which handled its creation and transfer. Later, it was discovered that this token was involved in a significant deal worth $2 billion, as a company in the UAE purchased a share of Binance. Zhao openly rejected the report, referring to it as “another hit piece,” and claimed a competitor supported it. He accused the publication of spreading fear and false information in the crypto community. Meanwhile, the former CEO of Binance expressed relief now that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against him faced a major reversal following Trump’s pardon for banking violations. Regarding CZ’s lawsuit, he was sentenced to a four-month prison term in April 2024 after pleading guilty to charges related to allowing money laundering activities at his cryptocurrency exchange. The federal prosecutors complained that the sentence imposed on Zhao was less than the three years they had requested. News of Zhao’s pardon demonstrates a bullish market for BNB In pardoning Zhao, Trump stated , “They said what he did isn’t even a crime … I granted him a pardon at the request of many good people.” The declaration of his pardon has sparked debates among the cryptocurrency community, with some spreading rumors that CZ may be reinstated to his position at Binance. Concerning this rumor, they mentioned that it would be exciting to see if that happens soon. In the meantime, sources have pointed out that Binance Coin (BNB), the primary cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain, has been ranked as one of the biggest gainers in today’s market following the news about CZ. This was after BNB’s price surged by 5%, exceeding $1,130 once again. With this tremendous success, the sources have acknowledged that BNB has illustrated remarkable growth this year and has already risen more than 100% from its lowest point of $532. Moreover, this recent escalation follows a 61% increase in trading volume to $5.74 billion, suggesting that traders are particularly bullish. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

53574317,613232,1761299674,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53574317.jpeg,Retail Investors Flock to Bitcoin Hyper Presale as Analysts Predict Explosive Growth,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-explosive-potential-according-to-analysts/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Bitcoin Hyper is the latest craze among retail investors, with the presale approaching $25M even as the broader market remains volatile.2⃣ The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin to give it a much-needed upgrade, bringing more speed and scalability to the network.3⃣ According to analysts, $HYPER could potentially hit $0.32 by year-end, leaving large upside for early birds who buy in at $0.013165 now. Bitcoin might be struggling to hold the line at $110K, but Bitcoin Hyper is racing ahead, seemingly unbothered. The surging interest in the project is astonishing, given how volatile the rest of the market is. This anomaly calls for a closer look, especially as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) nears the $25M milestone in its sizzling hot presale, with the $38M hard cap not long away. Investors are still rushing in to grab the token at low prices ahead of its exchange debut. Why Is Bitcoin Hyper Trending? Bitcoin Hyper is building a layer-2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s a daring prospect, but one that’s got retail hyped up. Finally, we have a project that’s dedicated to bringing more speed and programmability to the OG network. Bitcoin remains the unrivalled crypto captain, but its blockchain continues to be slow and clunky and expensive. Bitcoin’s transaction speed lags at just seven per second. Meanwhile, Solana boasts 4,709 practically and 65,000 TPS theoretically. Had $BTC not been the first crypto ever, would it even be as famous as it is today? That’s debatable, but one thing’s clear: Without a Web3 ecosystem of its own, the Bitcoin blockchain is outdated. It’s about time the blockchain kept pace with the rest of the market that has rapidly evolved over the years, disrupting finance, health, entertainment, gaming, and sports, to name just a few. The fact that all of them have happened outside the Bitcoin network is disappointing. Bitcoin can’t dream of mainstream entry unless it fixes its network congestion issues and lack of programmability. So it’s not hard to see why Bitcoin Hyper has emerged as one of the best cryptos to buy now . But haven’t we seen enough projects that make vague, grandiose claims only to keep us waiting for ages after the TGE, and then ghost the community when they realize they aren’t getting anywhere? Well, that’s exactly why Bitcoin Hyper has been defying the broader market downturn over the last few days. It’s not just a claim or a promise. The dev team is posting frequent project updates, which is how we know that rollup settlement models, SVM execution prototypes, and the first dev-facing platform designs are all documented so far. Bitcoin Hyper has a strong layer-2 infrastructure in the making, and the team is making steady progress in product development. Visit Hyper’s website for more project news. This Is How the Layer 2 Works A decentralized, noncustodial Canonical Bridge is used to cross-mint $BTC seamlessly from the base Bitcoin layer to a new wrapped token on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 chain. The wrapped $BTC can move faster and cheaper across DeFi, staking, payments, and numerous other Web3 applications, doing things that might not have been possible on the original network. Thanks to a Solana Virtual Machine integration, the Layer 2 is optimized for speed and scalability. Transactions on Bitcoin Hyper can sometimes be faster than even those on Solana, and developers can use the Layer 2 to launch smart contracts within the Bitcoin ecosystem. But Bitcoin Hyper does this all without ever compromising security. The project has a zero-knowledge settlement system in place, which makes sure that transactions on the Layer 2 are periodically settled back to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. The project has also successfully undergone smart contract audits by leading blockchain firms Coinsult and SpyWolf . Since code vulnerabilities and scams are a valid concern in the crypto space, especially in early projects, this step gives investors the confidence to dive in at a low entry point. Learn more about the project with our full guide to Bitcoin Hyper . Analysts Predict Bitcoin Hyper to Explode The crypto market is going through a brief correction, but long-term conviction remains strong. Institutional adoption and friendlier regulations paint an optimistic, larger picture. Bitcoin options open interest has hit a new all-time high of $63B, with bullish clusters between $120K and $140K. Clearly, strategic investors understand the immense opportunity that lies in buying the dip. Just four days ago, Strategy made news again for purchasing another 168 $BTC , worth ~$18.8M at the time. But small retail traders seeking the upside of low-cap altcoins are not ready to limit their portfolios to heavyweights like $BTC and $ETH. After all, it’s often smaller coins backed by innovative projects that explode during market rebounds. And this season, there are not many top cryptos to watch that can match Bitcoin Hyper ’s appeal. In a recent Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , analysts point out that “Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a long-term player in the Bitcoin Layer-2 space,” citing the new network’s faster transactions, smart contract functionality, and secure layer 1 settlement. This setup gives it a strong edge in the market, even during volatile periods. According to the article, $HYPER could see significant upward momentum, potentially reaching $0.32, in late 2025 or early 2026. Need help to join the presale? See our How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide . The token is selling for just $0.013165 in its viral presale now. That leaves a potential 2,330% upside, even before factoring in the current staking APY of 48%. It’s worth noting, though, as the token price increases with each new stage and the staking APY declines as more investors join in, making the current offer a time-limited one. Get $HYPER before the next price surge. As always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice, and crypto provides no guarantees.

Related Reading: Why This Crypto Analyst Now Believes XRP Price At $21 Is No Longer A Dream While fundamentals are hitting new highs, SOL continues to languish below key resistance levels, suggesting a breakout may be further off than some expect. Institutional Treasuries & Solana ETF Momentum Are Material Solana’s infrastructure is drawing serious attention. Major firms now hold several millions of SOL tokens on their books, according to Coingecko data , institutional treasuries already control roughly 13.5 million SOL, valued at about US$2.56 billion (2.6 % of circulating supply). At the same time, regulatory breakthroughs are shifting the backdrop for institutional capital. Hong Kong’s regulator has approved the first spot Solana ETF, set to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on October 27 in multiple currencies. Such developments signal growing legitimacy for Solana’s ecosystem and may lay the groundwork for longer-term accumulation, yet they have not yet triggered the explosive price rally many are hoping for. SOL Price Action: Solid Foundations, Weak Short-Term Breakout Despite the strong narrative, SOL’s price is clearly struggling to stick above significant resistance zones. Current trading around the $185-190 range shows the token repeatedly rejected near the US$200 mark. Analysts highlight that unless a decisive close above $195 occurs, the immediate upside remains constrained. Breakdown below $185 opens the door to near-term support tests around $175. Technical readings reinforce the caution. Momentum indicators remain muted and key moving averages sit above current levels, implying that for now the market is consolidating rather than charging ahead. Given this dynamic, many analysts believe that while Solana’s eventual upside may be considerable, the timing of that move may be toward 2026 rather than immediate. What Investors Should Take Away For long-term investors, the setup for Solana remains promising. The combination of institutional treasuries, network throughput advantages, and regulatory advances all point to growing structural relevance for the token. However, if you’re seeking a rapid breakout, the current chart suggests caution. Until SOL cracks above major resistance (roughly $195-200) with conviction, the price is likely to remain in consolidation mode.

While institutions weigh inflation data and market liquidity, retail traders are turning their focus toward coins showing early signs of strength. Ethereum ETFs Stir Fresh Optimism Ethereum is finding its rhythm again. Despite ETF outflows of $145 million this week, ETH climbed 0.5% to around $3,973, a steady recovery after a rough month. Analysts say the coming U.S. inflation report could trigger the next market shift — especially if inflation cools. Institutional investors are also watching SharpLink , which expanded its Ethereum holdings to 859,853 ETH worth $3.5 billion. This move signals growing belief in Ethereum’s long-term strength as a treasury asset. SharpLink’s 450% stock rise over six months adds fuel to the bullish case. With the Ethereum ETF conversation heating up , investors are preparing for a stronger ETH rebound, which often lifts the rest of the market. Many now list Ethereum as a must-watch in the coming weeks among the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Solana Eyes a Sharp Recovery Solana (SOL) continues to attract both retail and institutional interest after briefly dipping below $180. Traders view this as a buy-the-dip setup, with many targeting $250 as the next milestone. Analysts such as John Bollinger have pointed out a potential “W” reversal pattern forming, a structure often linked with price recoveries. This technical setup, alongside recent ETF inflows of $156 million into Solana-based products, has boosted confidence in the altcoin’s ability to regain traction. Institutional demand remains strong. SOL products recorded nearly $3 billion in inflows this year, indicating that buyers are positioning early for a rebound. If ETF approvals go through, Solana could lead the next market-wide move , earning its place among the top altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Cardano Analyst Predicts 333% Rally Analyst Javon Marks believes Cardano (ADA) is setting up for a massive upswing. Despite its current price of $0.63, Marks predicts ADA could surge to $2.96 , marking a 333% rally . He explained that Cardano has held a consistent uptrend since breaking out of its long-term descending trendline. The pattern of higher highs and higher lows remains intact, signaling that its structure is still healthy. Other market watchers, such as Chris O , forecast even higher levels, between $5 and $8 , once the next cycle accelerates. With the Ethereum ETF hype spreading through the market, ADA remains firmly on the radar for anyone seeking the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Chainlink Gains Institutional Interest Chainlink (LINK) is drawing renewed attention as large investors and institutions circle back to the project. Despite a short-term dip to $17.52, Grayscale and Bitwise have both filed for Chainlink ETFs , potentially opening the door for regulated exposure to the asset. This move could bring in a new wave of demand, similar to what happened with Bitcoin ETF approvals. At the same time, whale wallets have accumulated over 54 million LINK around $16, tightening supply and creating a strong support zone. With Chainlink leading real-world asset integration through partnerships with SWIFT, ICE, and S&P Global , its utility case remains clear. As institutional activity grows, LINK stands out among the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound in this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Safe Haven Altcoin on the Rise Amid the ETF buzz and market corrections, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn attention as another altcoin to pay serious attention to now . Analysts list it among the top altcoins to buy before the next bullish phase , with its price climbing every hour — no dips, just steady growth. Over 21,000 investors have already joined in, and word is spreading fast about its upcoming CEX listing . As supply tightens, scarcity is setting in, driving more FOMO among early entrants looking for hedge and diversification options. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Price climbs hourly with zero dips Safe haven during broader market declines Upcoming CEX listing fueling demand Growing investor base building scarcity Final Thoughts Market sentiment is turning as ETF news reshapes the landscape. Traders looking for the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound are watching Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Chainlink , and MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. As prices begin to recover, visiting the MAGACOIN FINANCE website early could be the move that sets traders ahead before the next bullish phase kicks in.

Bitcoin’s dominance has steadied, altcoins are gaining traction, and investors are rushing to find what crypto to invest in before November’s momentum begins. Among the few presale projects still priced low yet building a working product, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising names. Priced at only $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6, MUTM combines affordability with functionality—an uncommon mix in today’s market. The project has already raised around $17.78 million from more than 17,450 holders overall, with 74% of this phase’s tokens sold. Once the phase ends, the price will rise 15% to $0.04 in Phase 7. For investors seeking a credible crypto investment before the next wave of listings, this looks like the final discounted entry point. Why MUTM Is Gaining Attention Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that brings genuine value to its users. It will feature both P2C (Peer-to-Contract) pools for stable assets such as ETH, BTC, and USDT, and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) loans for higher-risk tokens like meme coins. This dual setup gives investors flexibility and helps keep liquidity stable while managing exposure across risk levels. Every transaction in the Mutuum ecosystem will create real demand for the MUTM token. When users lend assets, they will receive mtTokens—digital receipts representing their deposits that earn interest. Borrowers will use their collateral to access loans and pay protocol fees, all tied to the MUTM economy. This self-reinforcing cycle means that as the protocol grows, the token’s value is backed by real network activity. Recently the team has announced that the platform’s V1 testnet will go live on Sepolia in Q4 2025, bringing liquidity pools, mtToken minting, and automated liquidation tools into play. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets, ensuring a smooth and transparent initial testnet phase before full deployment. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from most presales is timing. The project plans to launch its protocol and token listing simultaneously, ensuring the token immediately connects to real user activity. Investors will be able to lend, borrow, and stake from the first day—creating live demand rather than relying on speculation. This launch structure also supports early exchange listings by showing working utility from day one. Another driver behind growing investor interest is Mutuum’s buy-and-distribute model. All platform-generated revenue—from borrowing interest and transaction fees—will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This ongoing buyback mechanism creates consistent buying pressure, directly linking platform performance to market demand. Security and Community Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal is further strengthened by its solid security framework. Its audit by CertiK reports a TokenScan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, confirming strong technical reliability. Alongside that, the project runs a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage community participation in safeguarding the protocol. To build engagement, a $100,000 community giveaway will reward 10 winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each—another reason for rising community interest as the presale nears completion. A new daily leaderboard system now offers a $500 MUTM bonus to the user who ranks first within each 24-hour period. To be eligible, the top user must complete at least one transaction during that timeframe. The leaderboard refreshes automatically at 00:00 UTC every day, allowing everyone to compete for the next reward cycle. October’s Last Window for Early Entry Investors looking for what crypto to invest in during October’s last bullish week are seeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout low-cap opportunity. It’s rare to find a token priced at just $0.035 with a functioning DeFi protocol ready for testing and an audited foundation already in place. The project’s numbers tell a clear story. A participant who joined the presale in Phase 2 at $0.015 with $5,000 now holds $12K in value at the current Phase 6 price—more than doubling before launch. When MUTM reaches $1 following listing and adoption, that same holding will be worth $333K. This shows how early participation during presale stages rewards conviction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents more than another presale—it reflects a shift toward practical DeFi solutions that reward real users and real activity. For those watching the last bullish week of October, MUTM stands as a smart, affordable, and utility-backed option ready to rise with the next wave of the market.

Here's the Support Level",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-bull-cycle-isnt-over-yet-according-to-analysis-firm-cryptoquants-weekly-report-heres-the-support-level/,"According to the CryptoQuant weekly report, the Bitcoin (BTC) bull market cycle is not over yet, with short-term support level located around $100,000. CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Bull Cycle Not Over Yet, Short-Term Support at $100,000 According to on-chain data, the total balance of whale addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC has reached approximately 5.16 million BTC. This amount equates to 26% of Bitcoin's circulating supply and suggests that whales have become the most influential group of investors in the market. Throughout 2025, these whale addresses reportedly added a total of approximately 681,000 BTC, while small investor addresses reportedly exhibited a net selling trend. This suggests institutional investors are absorbing individual sales. The annual BTC accumulation rate of whale wallets is 907,000, above the 365-day average of 730,000 BTC, indicating that long-term demand remains strong. However, the report notes that short-term buying momentum is weakening. It also suggests that if the monthly accumulation rate fails to regain momentum, Bitcoin's price may struggle to break above $126,000. Currently, resistance is at $115,000, while support is at $100,000. Analysts predict that if the price breaks below $100,000, a pullback to $75,000 is possible. CryptoQuant states that current data indicates that the Bitcoin market is still in the late stages of its bull cycle. *This is not investment advice.

The model projects a probable range between $2.20 and $3.50, depending on broader market conditions and the performance of major digital assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gemini’s analysis highlights technical resilience and strong network activity as factors supporting the mid-term outlook, while also cautioning that volatility could intensify as speculative momentum rises. Google Gemini’s forecast appears to align with the broader consensus among independent crypto researchers and trading analysts. Multiple market projections have placed XRP’s short-term value in the $2.30 to $2.60 range, suggesting limited downside risk as long as the asset maintains its support level near $2.20. Some analysts have expressed a more optimistic stance, indicating that positive announcements from Ripple’s Swell event or further progress in cross-border settlement adoption could push prices closer to $3.00. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Factors Driving Market Sentiment Market observers note that XRP’s performance remains tightly linked to developments surrounding Ripple’s ecosystem and ongoing partnerships with financial institutions . The introduction of RLUSD , Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin, has also contributed to renewed optimism about broader liquidity within the XRP Ledger. A surge in on-chain transactions and an expansion of enterprise-grade use cases have further strengthened perceptions of long-term value. However, not all indicators point toward a sustained rally. Technical analysts have warned that if XRP fails to maintain momentum above $2.40, short-term traders could trigger a sell-off, leading to a temporary correction. Additionally, lingering regulatory uncertainties and global macroeconomic pressures—such as tightening monetary policies—could weigh on overall crypto market sentiment. Outlook as November Approaches Despite these potential setbacks, the overall tone of the market appears cautiously positive. The period leading into November will likely test XRP’s resilience, especially as the digital asset community anticipates major updates from Ripple’s ecosystem and increased liquidity across exchanges. With Google Gemini forecasting moderate growth and other analysts aligning with a similar outlook, the prevailing sentiment suggests that XRP is positioned for stability rather than extreme price swings.

Trump Pardons Changpeng Zhao of Binance: Bitcoin Hit $111K, BNB Rallied 2%, and Best Presales like $HYPER Prepare for Rally October 24, 2025 • 10:00 UTC In a move that no one expected, Trump issued a full pardon for Changpen ‘CZ’ Zhao , Binance’s founder. After the announcement, CZ publicly expressed his full support for Trump’s crypto plans and administration. The crypto market almost immediately priced in the news and exploded. Bitcoin is up, Ethereum pumped, and BNB and Solana also headed up. Analysts expect a continuation of this bullish trend, with more altcoins following suit. But some of the biggest gainers might be crypto presales, as traders may rotate to them for more profits. One of these is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a project building the next L2 for Bitcoin, bringing sub-second transaction speed and dApp and smart contract support for the chain. The presale is at $24.6M raised, with significant recent whale activity ( $11.3K two days ago ), and it’s getting increasingly more attention as it nears listing.

Solana Historic Pattern Promises 55% Rally as Best Presales like Snorter Token Amp Up October 24, 2025 • 10:00 UTC A trader on X ( Four_IV ) found a bull fractal in Solana’s performance chart that has appeared three times in the past. Every time, it preceded a bull run. He says that if the pattern is validated again, $SOL could breakout above $300, a 55% pump. With more institutions holding $SOL in treasuries and the likes of Fidelity supporting direct $SOL purchases for US customers, Solana’s ascension is all but certain at this point. With this bullish technical pattern promising a $SOL rally, how do you think $SOL-based altcoins will react? Traders are expecting a rally, and many are looking at Snorter Token ($SNORT) as a potential next 1000x crypto. The presale has raised $5.49M to build the quickest and cheapest trading bot on Solana, and its presale ends in 3 days, on October 27. Here’s how to buy $SNORT before the presale ends.

One of the big shifts came from wallets aged over 7 years. The series of price peaks for BTC invited old whale wallets to move their coins. A record number of old BTC whales moved coins in 2025. The transfers originated from wallets aged over 7 years, with the occasional transaction from wallets dated 2013 or even 2010 . Most of the moves came from OG whales, including notorious hack wallets and former exchanges. One of the biggest transfers was for 80K BTC after 14 years of holding, from a still-unidentified whale. Most recently, a whale from the Satoshi mining era sold more of their remaining coins. The whale’s wallets held up to 8K BTC, and are down to 3,850 coins after sending 150 BTC to exchanges. Some of the coins moved went to exchanges, but in 2025, there were more ways to tap the value of BTC . Older whales found themselves sitting on what looked like hefty treasuries, and some went on to support treasury companies. For others, lending was a way to tap the value of BTC without selling directly. The price peaks of BTC incited more old whales to move their coins, either for security or to realize profits. | Source: CryptoQuant . BTC absorbed most of the whale selling In 2025, the BTC market was robust enough to absorb the whale selling. However, the occasional short-term selling of large amounts of BTC is pushing the price downward. Some of the sellers combine spot trading with derivative positions, attempting to pressure the price of BTC while also going short. The rise of perp DEX trading in 2025 also helped activate whale wallets . Some of the OG whales moved older coins to make use of derivative markets, instead of realizing profits on spot markets. Over 50% of BTC is still held by individuals Of the BTC accounted for, over 50% is still held in wallets belonging to private individuals. On-chain investigators have identified the current treasuries, miner reserves, exchange wallets, custodial and ETF wallets. A total estimated 53.48% of BTC wallets are held by private individuals, of which around 170K wallets have been tagged and tracked. For smaller holders, there are also significant shifts in accumulation and trading . In the past year, over 2.41M new shrimp wallets started buying, with under 1 BTC. The category of ‘shark wallets’ with 100 to 1,000 BTC was also growing fast. In the past year, 3,461 new shark wallets were generated. In total, 14 of the biggest whale wallets with over 10K BTC were split, while 20 whale wallets with 1K-10K BTC also moved their coins. Despite the lower number of whales, large-scale wallets are showing they are still capable of controlling the market. Newer whale wallets are trading more actively. On the other hand, the accumulated 1M BTC in treasuries has almost no direct impact on the market, which can be swayed with a relatively low transfers of active coins. Get seen where it counts.

One DeFi crypto is rapidly stealing the spotlight from even Solana (SOL). That token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-rising decentralized finance project redefining how users lend, borrow, and earn within one ecosystem. Priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.8 million in record time, a clear sign of mounting investor confidence. Investors have less time remaining since phase six is approaching closure. This phase has been FOMO-packed. MUTM’s innovative dual-lending model combines Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with Peer-to-Peer agreements, giving users unmatched capital efficiency and control. As Solana faces mounting pressure from network congestion and whale profit-taking, Mutuum Finance is the next breakout DeFi crypto with the fundamentals and momentum to outperform leading altcoins in the 2025 rally. Solana (SOL) Price Outlook: Consolidation Prior to a Big Rally Solana (SOL) has consolidated steadily since January 2024, marking a period of heavy re-accumulation as investors position themselves for the next significant move. Market observers are confident that the sideways trend is building a strong foundation for a colossal breakout, with estimates aiming for a possible rally to $700 by Q1 2026 if momentum persists. The ongoing development activity of the network and increasing institutional interest also back this long-term bullish forecast. Nevertheless, while Solana’s consolidation phase may provide an opportunity for long-term investors, others are focusing increasingly on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the top crypto rapidly building momentum in anticipation of the next crypto market boom. Mutuum Finance’s Stable Growth Fosters Investors’ Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making a lot of noise in the DeFi ecosystem as one of the most promising cryptos to follow this year. Investors looking for the best cryptocurrency coin to buy are keeping a close eye on MUTM as a breakout coin. The token is now in Presale Phase 6 and is valued at $0.035, 16.17% up from Phase 5, and this is as low as it gets. Demand has been extremely robust, with more than 17,380 participants contributing more than $17.8 million to date. With more than 70% of Phase 6 already sold, Mutuum Finance is proving incredible investor demand and establishing itself as a high-growth, long-term value DeFi crypto. Existing early investors are growing progressively active in considering MUTM as the top crypto to buy to gain exposure to early-stage crypto investment opportunities. Two Different Markets: P2C and P2P Mutuum Finance works under two primary markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Under the P2C market, the users borrow or lend crypto assets using smart contracts that allow the transaction to take place automatically. The automatic process provides smooth, secure, and transparent operations for all the users without any manual intervention and fewer risks. P2P market provides lending and borrowing directly among users without using the mutual liquidity pool. The model enhances security with high-standard tokens only, no centralized coins, exploit risk tokens, or no minting limit tokens. APY rates on this market are based on demand for a particular token, which provides flexibility to lenders and borrowers as well as the possibility of achieving higher yields. Security and Reliability All P2P and P2C marketplace transactions are backed by audited, decentralized smart contracts. This provides a secure and stable environment where users can lend, borrow, and provide assets with confidence, knowing their funds are backed by advanced blockchain protocols. Mutuum Finance has already garnered over 17,380 participants, with over $17.8 million generated in its presale, an indication of increasing confidence among investors. Phase 6 has less than 30% of its allocation unsold, with the token being made available at just $0.035. This represents a one-time opportunity for early adopters to gain exposure before the 2025 bull run. Those investors who wish to lock in maximum long-term DeFi crypto gains are urged to act quickly to become a member of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem, to benefit from its double-lending P2C and P2P markets, and to get ahead of the next market surge.

53577884,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=211709,1761305411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/53577884.jpeg,AI Browser Wars: Microsoft’s Stunning Copilot Relaunch Challenges OpenAI’s Atlas,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-browser-clash/,"BitcoinWorld AI Browser Wars: Microsoft’s Stunning Copilot Relaunch Challenges OpenAI’s Atlas In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the tech giants are locked in a fierce battle for dominance. Just two days after OpenAI unveiled its innovative Atlas browser, Microsoft made a stunning move, relaunching an ambitious project that embeds artificial intelligence directly into its core Edge browser. For those in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space, this development isn’t just about faster browsing; it signals a fundamental shift in how we interact with digital information, potentially impacting everything from market analysis to decentralized application (DApp) interfaces. The rise of the AI browser promises a new era of intelligent web navigation, but what does this sudden, nearly identical dual launch mean for the future of the internet? Unpacking Microsoft Copilot Mode: A Dynamic AI Companion Microsoft’s renewed push for Microsoft Copilot Mode in its Edge browser is more than just an update; it’s a strategic declaration. Initially rolled out in July with basic functionalities like a search bar on new tabs and natural voice navigation, the feature didn’t initially capture widespread attention. However, the latest iteration, championed by Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, positions Copilot Mode as a true ‘AI browser’ – a dynamic, intelligent companion designed to follow you across the web. Suleyman highlighted its advanced capabilities: Contextual Understanding: With user permission, Copilot can analyze open tabs and reason over their content. Information Synthesis: It can summarize complex information and compare data points across multiple sources. Actionable Insights: Beyond just information, Copilot can perform actions like booking hotels or filling out forms, streamlining online tasks. This evolution from a simple extension to a full-fledged AI assistant marks a significant leap, aiming to make web browsing profoundly more efficient and personalized. Imagine a world where your browser anticipates your needs, offering relevant data or even completing tasks as you research potential crypto investments or interact with DeFi platforms. The OpenAI Atlas Reveal: Pioneering the Next Generation of Browsing Adding a layer of intrigue to this unfolding narrative is the recent launch of OpenAI Atlas . While details are still emerging, OpenAI’s venture into the AI browser space signals a broader industry consensus on the direction of web interaction. The timing, just days before Microsoft’s major Copilot announcement, is particularly striking. Though the development cycles for such complex products typically span months, the near-simultaneous public unveiling of two visually and functionally similar AI-powered browsers highlights the intense competition and rapid innovation occurring at the forefront of AI. The core concept behind Atlas, much like Copilot, revolves around an intelligent layer that understands, summarizes, and assists users with their browsing activities. This move by OpenAI, a company synonymous with groundbreaking AI models like GPT, underscores the importance of integrating powerful AI directly into the user’s primary interface with the internet. Are AI Assistants Becoming Homogenous? The Striking Resemblance The most arresting aspect of these dual launches is the uncanny visual and functional similarity between Microsoft Copilot for Edge and OpenAI Atlas. As the original report noted, side-by-side comparisons reveal remarkably analogous user interfaces. Both feature a ‘ride-along’ function, typically integrated into a new tab or split-screen, providing contextual AI assistance as you navigate. While minor differences exist – such as color schemes or button conventions – the core experience of having an AI assistant intelligently process and act upon your browsing activity appears to be remarkably consistent across both offerings. Why such a strong resemblance? Part of it is functional design; there are only so many intuitive ways to integrate a chatbot-like interface into a browser. However, it also speaks to a shared vision for the future of web interaction, driven by advanced underlying AI models. For users, the true differentiator might not be the visual layout, but the intelligence, accuracy, and responsiveness of the AI model powering each browser. Why the Edge Browser is Pivotal in the AI Race For Microsoft, the integration of Copilot Mode directly into the Edge browser is a strategic masterstroke. While Chrome dominates the browser market, Edge, powered by Chromium, offers Microsoft a critical avenue to embed its AI innovations deeply into the user experience. This isn’t just about an add-on; it’s about transforming the browser into an intelligent hub. By making the browser itself an AI-first product, Microsoft aims to: Enhance User Productivity: Automating tasks, summarizing content, and providing instant insights can significantly boost efficiency for professionals and casual users alike. Strengthen Ecosystem Lock-in: A superior AI-powered browsing experience can entice users to adopt Edge, reinforcing Microsoft’s broader ecosystem of AI-enabled products and services. Leverage Data for AI Improvement: With user permission, the browser can gather valuable data on browsing patterns, which can be used to further refine and improve the underlying AI models. This deep integration could be a game-changer, making Edge a compelling alternative for users seeking a truly intelligent web experience. For the crypto community, an AI-enhanced Edge browser could mean more efficient research into new tokens, better management of multiple DApp tabs, or even AI-assisted risk assessments. Challenges and Opportunities: Navigating the AI-Powered Web While the advent of the AI browser promises unprecedented convenience, it also brings a host of challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Data Privacy: The ability of AI browsers to ‘see and reason over your open tabs’ raises significant privacy concerns. Users will need assurances about how their data is collected, stored, and utilized. Security Risks: An AI capable of performing actions like filling forms or booking hotels presents new attack vectors if compromised. User Adoption: Shifting ingrained browsing habits will be difficult, even with compelling AI features. Accuracy and Bias: The underlying AI models must be robust, accurate, and free from harmful biases to ensure reliable assistance. Opportunities: Personalized Web Experiences: Browsers can adapt to individual user preferences and needs, offering highly tailored content and services. Enhanced Productivity: Automation of mundane tasks frees up user time for more complex and creative endeavors. Accessibility: AI assistants can make the web more accessible for individuals with disabilities, offering advanced navigation and content comprehension tools. Innovation in Crypto/Web3 Interaction: AI browsers could revolutionize how users interact with blockchain applications, making DApps more intuitive, secure, and efficient for managing digital assets or engaging with decentralized finance. Imagine an AI assistant that monitors gas fees across chains or helps you understand complex smart contract interactions. The Future is Intelligent: A Compelling Summary The simultaneous launch of Microsoft Copilot Mode and OpenAI Atlas marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the internet. It signals a clear trajectory towards an AI-first web, where our browsers are no longer just windows to information but intelligent companions that actively assist, summarize, and act on our behalf. While the visual similarities highlight a convergence in design, the true battle will be waged on the intelligence and utility of the underlying AI models. For the crypto community, these developments could pave the way for more sophisticated tools for market analysis, DApp interaction, and secure navigation of the decentralized web.

This also aligns with the tight range that the meme coin has been trading in over the last few weeks, and could signal a restart of a consolidation trend. If the Dogecoin price is to see any meaningful recovery from here, then there is a major level that stands in the way. This raises the question: Will the last quarter of the year be bullish for Dogecoin? The Level That The Dogecoin Price Must Break A pseudonymous crypto analyst who goes by the name Catonese Cat on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has highlighted the level that has continued to hold the Dogecoin price down. This level lies at the 0.886 Fibonacci level, aligning with the price level just above $0.26, which has been a roadblock to its recovery. Over the last few months, the Dogecoin price has failed to break above this level, and this suggests that this is where the bears are mounting their major defence. With the most recent recovery, the Dogecoin price had risen toward this level, but the weak momentum quickly faded, and the price crashed back down under pressure. Highlighting this trend, the crypto analyst believes that this is the level holding the Dogecoin price back . The post explains that if the meme coin is able to break above the 0.886 level for good, then it would mean that the Dogecoin price is turning incredibly bullish. However, with the price still trending well below this level, Catonese Cat explains that it means that Dogecoin is actually not ready to be incredibly bullish. With October almost gone, all eyes are now on November, which is historically a bullish month, to see what the crypto market holds . Why November Could Be A Game-Changer Looking at the past performance of the Dogecoin price in the month of November, it comes as no surprise that analysts are looking at this month favorably. Over the last two years, the price has risen drastically in November, leading to some of the highest gains for each respective year. On average, the Dogecoin price has seen double-digit positive returns of 18.9% in the month of November, making it a highly profitable month, as data from CryptoRank shows . Additionally, the last quarter of the year often leans bullish and could support a price reversal, especially if Dogecoin is able to reclaim the 0.886 Fib level .",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-24 11:30:58

In a post shared with a chart comparison, he showed XRP’s 2017 weekly candles alongside the present pattern, noting how the price had experienced a short-term decline before recovering strongly. The chart included a reference to XRP’s previous 13,000% advance during that year’s rally. According to the comparison, XRP’s price structure in late 2025 appears to be repeating a similar sequence of movements observed in 2017. In that earlier cycle, XRP consolidated for months before breaking sharply upward. The image shared by Steph illustrates the familiar compression and recovery that came before the explosive increase. While historical setups do not guarantee future outcomes, the analyst’s reference to the past has drawn renewed focus on XRP’s current technical posture. $XRP ’s structure is mirroring the 2017 setup that preceded a 13,000% rally. pic.twitter.com/D15w2UfSYO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 22, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Price Projection Based on Historical Rally If XRP were to repeat the 13,000% move seen in 2017, it would represent a dramatic appreciation from its present level. With XRP trading around $2.5, an equivalent percentage increase would place a potential target near $325. Many traders are examining whether the present setup can generate comparable momentum under current market conditions. Factors such as liquidity, market maturity, and institutional involvement have evolved since 2017, which could influence the extent or speed of any future price acceleration. The chart suggests that XRP’s structure remains technically aligned with the framework that preceded one of its strongest historical runs. Technical analysts often revisit historical data to identify recurring setups that may offer insight into market psychology. In this case, Steph’s observation points to how XRP’s multi-year price structure could potentially lead to a breakout if similar dynamics repeat. Looking Ahead The idea that history may be repeating itself adds an element of anticipation to XRP’s outlook as it approaches 2026. For traders and investors watching the chart, the focus now lies in whether the current consolidation phase will once again serve as a launch point or fade into a longer accumulation period. XRP’s next major directional move could determine how closely the 2025 setup truly matches the legendary rally of 2017.

Microsoft recently unveiled Mico, an expressive AI avatar for its Copilot, signaling a bold new direction for human-computer interaction. This development is particularly relevant to anyone interested in the future of digital interfaces, including those within the cryptocurrency space, where intuitive and trustworthy AI could transform how we interact with complex financial systems. What is Microsoft AI ‘s Mico, and Why Does it Matter? Mico, short for ‘Microsoft Copilot,’ is designed to be the visual ‘face’ of Microsoft’s powerful AI chatbot. Introduced at the company’s Copilot fall release event, Mico aims to offer a ‘warm’ and ‘customizable’ visual presence. This avatar is engineered to listen, react, and even change colors, reflecting the nuances of your interactions. For many, Mico immediately evokes memories of Microsoft’s infamous productivity assistant, Clippy. Far from shying away, Microsoft has embraced this legacy, even including an Easter egg where tapping Mico multiple times transforms it into Clippy – a playful nod to its predecessor. Mico is initially available in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., bringing with it advanced capabilities: Memory Retention: Mico can save memories of your conversations, ensuring a more personalized and continuous experience. Learning from Feedback: The avatar learns from user feedback, constantly refining its responses and interactions. ‘Learn Live’ Mode: Exclusively for U.S. users, this mode transforms Copilot into a tutor, guiding you through concepts rather than just providing direct answers. Enhanced Research: Improvements have been made in handling health-related questions and deep research tasks, making Copilot a more reliable informational assistant. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, emphasized the company’s commitment to ‘humanist AI.’ He stated, “As we build this, we’re not chasing engagement or optimizing for screen time. We’re building AI that gets you back to your life. That deepens human connection. That earns your trust.” This philosophy underscores a significant shift towards AI that serves human well-being rather than merely maximizing interaction metrics. The Return of Clippy: How Mico Embraces its Legacy as an AI Companion The immediate comparison of Mico to Clippy is no accident. Clippy, despite its mixed reception, left an indelible mark on digital culture. Mico, however, represents a modern, more sophisticated iteration of the AI companion concept. Unlike its paperclip ancestor, Mico is designed for deep, evolving interaction, aiming to build trust and provide meaningful assistance. This move by Microsoft highlights a growing trend in the AI industry to anthropomorphize AI, making it more approachable and intuitive for users. Other major players in the AI space are also exploring visual and personality-driven AI: ChatGPT: Offers a visual experience alongside various voice options. xAI’s Grok: Has ventured into more ‘risqué’ AI companions, indicating diverse consumer demand. The proliferation of AI companion apps in app stores, generating millions in revenue, clearly demonstrates a consumer appetite for AI characters. Microsoft’s challenge with Mico will be to ensure its ‘floating blob’ resonates with users in a way that is both helpful and engaging, fostering genuine connection without becoming a distraction. Beyond the Blob: Enhancing Interaction with Copilot ‘s New Features Beyond Mico, the latest update introduces a suite of powerful features designed to make Copilot an even more integral part of daily digital life. These enhancements are geared towards deeper integration and more nuanced interaction: ‘Real Talk’ Mode: This innovative mode allows Copilot to mirror the user’s conversational style. Crucially, it’s designed to be ‘grounded in its own perspective,’ meaning it won’t be overly sycophantic. Instead, it can push back and challenge your ideas, encouraging diverse viewpoints and critical thinking. Collaborative Chats: Users can now invite friends into their Copilot AI chats, transforming individual AI interactions into shared experiences. Long-Term Memory Support: Expanding on Mico’s memory capabilities, Copilot itself gains robust long-term memory, ensuring continuity and personalized assistance across sessions. Productivity Connectors: Integration with essential productivity apps like email and cloud storage streamlines workflows, allowing Copilot to assist across various digital tasks. Microsoft is also aggressively evolving its Edge browser into an ‘AI browser.’ This means Edge will soon be able to ‘see’ your tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take action on your behalf, such as booking a hotel or filling out forms. This positions Edge to compete directly with other AI-powered browsers like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, Dia, and the market leader Chrome, which has integrated its Gemini AI. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for the AI Chatbot Era While the advancements in AI chatbot technology, including Microsoft’s Copilot and Mico, promise unprecedented convenience and personalized assistance, they also present significant challenges. One critical concern is finding the balance between a helpful conversational AI and one that might lead users down problematic paths. Reports of ‘AI chatbot psychosis,’ where users have their delusional beliefs reinforced by AI conversations, highlight the ethical and psychological complexities involved. Microsoft’s emphasis on ‘Real Talk’ mode, which encourages diverse perspectives and even challenges user ideas, is a step towards mitigating such risks. By grounding the AI in its own perspective and enabling it to push back, the company aims to foster healthier, more critical interactions. The future success of these AI companions will depend not only on their technological prowess but also on their ethical design and the ability to earn and maintain user trust. The continuous evolution of AI, as showcased by Microsoft’s latest updates, points towards a future where AI assistants are not just tools but interactive entities that learn, adapt, and even challenge us. This transformative shift will undoubtedly redefine our relationship with technology and reshape our digital lives.

For those invested in the digital economy, particularly in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies that often leverage powerful AI for analytics, trading, and security, the underlying infrastructure’s performance directly impacts innovation and cost. This is where AI inference becomes a critical bottleneck and a significant opportunity. A new player, Tensormesh , has emerged from stealth with a formidable $4.5 million in seed funding, promising a revolutionary approach to squeezing unparalleled performance from existing AI server loads. What is AI Inference and Why is it Crucial Now? AI inference refers to the process where a trained artificial intelligence model makes predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data. It’s the ‘thinking’ part of AI, where models like large language models (LLMs) process your queries, generate responses, or analyze complex datasets. With the AI infrastructure push reaching staggering proportions, the sheer volume of these inference tasks is immense. Every chatbot interaction, every AI-powered recommendation, and every autonomous system decision relies on efficient inference. The challenge lies in the fact that these operations are incredibly resource-intensive, primarily taxing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). As AI models grow larger and more complex, the pressure to optimize every computational cycle intensifies. Businesses and researchers are under more pressure than ever to extract maximum value and performance from their expensive GPU investments. This drive for efficiency is precisely where Tensormesh aims to make a significant impact. Unveiling Tensormesh : A Game-Changer in Efficiency Launching out of stealth this week, Tensormesh has successfully secured $4.5 million in seed funding, an investment led by Laude Ventures, with additional angel funding from database pioneer Michael Franklin. This substantial backing underscores the market’s recognition of the urgent need for enhanced AI computational efficiency. At its core, Tensormesh is dedicated to building a commercial version of the open-source LMCache utility. This utility, initially launched and maintained by Tensormesh co-founder Yihua Cheng, has already gained significant traction in the open-source community. Its proven capability to drastically reduce inference costs and boost performance has drawn in integrations from heavy hitters like Google and Nvidia. Now, Tensormesh is poised to translate this academic and open-source reputation into a viable, impactful business solution. How LMCache Revolutionizes GPU Optimization The secret sauce behind Tensormesh’s offering is its innovative handling of the key-value cache (KV cache). The KV cache is a memory system crucial for processing complex inputs more efficiently by condensing them down to their key values. It stores intermediate computations, preventing redundant work when processing sequences, especially in generative AI models. Here’s how Tensormesh’s approach provides unparalleled GPU optimization : Traditional Architecture: In most current AI architectures, the KV cache is discarded at the end of each query. Tensormesh co-founder and CEO Junchen Jiang vividly illustrates this inefficiency: “It’s like having a very smart analyst reading all the data, but they forget what they have learned after each question.” This constant re-computation is a massive drain on precious GPU resources and a significant source of inefficiency. Tensormesh’s Innovation: Instead of discarding this valuable cache, Tensormesh’s systems intelligently hold onto it. This allows the KV cache to be redeployed and reused when the model executes a similar process in a separate query. Imagine an analyst who remembers everything they’ve ever learned, building on past knowledge rather than starting from scratch. Overcoming Memory Constraints: GPU memory is a finite and extremely precious resource. To manage the persistent KV cache effectively, Tensormesh’s system spreads this data across several different storage layers. This sophisticated memory management ensures that while the cache is retained, the overall system performance is not compromised. The reward for this intricate engineering is substantial: a potential reduction in inference costs by as much as 10x and significantly more inference power for the same server load. This is a game-changer for businesses heavily reliant on AI, translating directly into massive cost savings and enhanced capabilities. The Impact on AI Infrastructure and Beyond The implications of Tensormesh’s technology extend across various sectors of AI infrastructure . The change is particularly powerful for specific types of AI applications: Chat Interfaces: Conversational AI models, such as those powering customer service bots or interactive assistants, need to continually refer back to the growing chat log as the conversation progresses. Reusing the KV cache means these models don’t have to re-process the entire conversation history with each new turn, leading to faster, more fluid, and more cost-effective interactions. Agentic Systems: These AI systems, designed to achieve specific goals by performing a sequence of actions, similarly accumulate a growing log of actions and goals. Tensormesh’s persistent KV cache allows these agents to maintain context and build upon their past decisions without incurring repetitive computational overhead. While, in theory, AI companies could attempt to implement these cache retention strategies on their own, the technical complexity involved is daunting. Junchen Jiang highlights the scale of this challenge: “Keeping the KV cache in a secondary storage system and reused efficiently without slowing the whole system down is a very challenging problem.” He adds, “We’ve seen people hire 20 engineers and spend three or four months to build such a system. Or they can use our product and do it very efficiently.” Given the Tensormesh team’s deep expertise and extensive research in this specialized process, the company is betting on high demand for an out-of-the-box product that simplifies this intricate problem. Their solution promises to democratize advanced AI efficiency, making it accessible to a broader range of organizations without requiring massive internal R&D investments. The Future of Efficient AI Tensormesh’s emergence marks a significant milestone in the quest for more efficient and cost-effective AI. By addressing a fundamental inefficiency in how AI models handle memory, they are paving the way for more powerful, responsive, and sustainable AI deployments. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of technology, from financial algorithms in crypto to advanced scientific research, solutions that optimize computational resources will be invaluable. The $4.5 million in seed funding is not just an investment in a company; it’s an investment in the future of AI itself. With LMCache already demonstrating its prowess with industry giants, Tensormesh is well-positioned to become a cornerstone of next-generation AI infrastructure , enabling developers and businesses to unlock the full potential of their AI models without breaking the bank.

It’s followed by Aster (ASTER) and World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , which are up by 12.9% and 12.1% to $1.14 and $0.1425, respectively. On the other hand, Tron fell the most, followed by HTX DAO (HTX)’s 1.6% fall and Flare (FLR)’s 1.5%. Traders and investors are very cautious at the moment. Currently, they’re waiting for further economic and geopolitical signals on the market direction. Notably, many are waiting for the US consumer price index report , which is set to come out today, after being delayed from 15 October. Meanwhile, the US president pardoned Changpeng Zhao , the convicted founder of crypto exchange Binance , after months of Zhao’s efforts to boost the president’s family’s crypto company. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that “the convergence of Mr Zhao’s pardon application and Binance’s financial entanglements with the President’s family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system.” Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.

(Still in flight, more posts to come.)… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 23, 2025 ‘Increasing Volatility Potential’ Bitunix analysts commented that liquidation heatmaps in the crypto market show a dense BTC liquidation cluster above $114,000. There is a strong buy-side support concentrated in the $105,000–$106,000 range. “Combined macro uncertainty and tightening dollar liquidity are driving a rise in short-term risk aversion, increasing volatility potential,” the analysts say. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve’s “data blackout underscores a decline in policy transparency and a distortion of market signals. When official data becomes unreliable, capital increasingly turns to real-time market pricing as the ‘only credible indicator’.” “This shift, paradoxically, strengthens crypto markets’ relative advantage in liquidity-based price discovery. Over the long term, data sovereignty and informational transparency are poised to become the new frontiers in monetary trust,” the analysts say.

Moreover, “as mainstream adoption accelerates Bitcoin’s integration as a core component of the global financial system, institutions holding BTC want to put their assets to work, and that’s where Bitcoin DeFi comes in,” he adds. “The foundations being built today, including hybrid chains like BOB, are transforming Bitcoin from a static asset into a programmable financial infrastructure, fit for institutions.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC trades at $111,254. Earlier in the day, BTC climbed from the intraday low of $108,872 to $111,295. However, it then dropped back to the $109,000 level. Nonetheless, it has subsequently increased to the day’s high of $111,481. It has turned green in the 7-day period, now being up by 4.1%. If BTC breaks above $111,750, it could move toward $115,900 and $120,000. This would result in a confirmed renewed bullish momentum. However, if it closes below $107,350, the coin could drop further to $104,500 and $101,100. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,976. Similar to BTC, ETH climbed from the low of $3,816 to $3.926. The price dropped to $3,825 before jumping to the intraday high of $3,987. ETH is now 4% up in the 7-day period, returning to green in this timeframe. The coin has a chance to reclaim the $4,000 level, which would boost its trajectory towards $4,150. This bullish momentum could propel it further towards $4,300. On the other hand, if ETH falls below $3,700, it may proceed back to $3,500 and $3,350.

Of the 12 ETFs, four recorded inflows, and two saw outflows. At the top of the green list is BlackRock with $107.78 million, followed by Bitwise’s $17.41 million. The highest outflow is Grayscale’s $60.49 million, closely followed by Ark&21Shares’ $55.02 million. However, the US ETH ETFs saw a second day of outflows in a row on 23 October, with $127.51 million . The total net inflow now stands at $14.45 billion. Six of the nine finds saw negative flows, while there were no inflows. Fidelity let go of $77.04 million, and BlackRock released $23.35 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity has added Solana trading to its suite of crypto products to give access to both institutional and retail investors. Speaking of Solana, Solmate Infrastructure , a Cathie Wood-backed Solana-focused digital asset treasury, saw its shares jump by nearly 50% on Wednesday. This came after it announced plans for a major mergers and acquisitions strategy and confirmed additional SOL purchases at discounted market prices.

The crypto market has increased over the past day, and the stock market saw a rise during work hours on Thursday. By the closing time on 23 October, the S&P 500 was up by 0.58%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.88%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.31%. The investors were absorbing the latest batch of earnings reports coming from the US, as well as the US-China news that Washington may curb software exports to China and that the two presidents may meet. Is this rally sustainable? The current increases are minor and in danger of shifting back to red. The rally may not be situated firmly as the basis for a significant leg up – at least not yet.

The finance ministry in Moscow has already added well over a thousand mining companies to a special register for entities engaged in the profitable business, in which Russia has become a major player. Russian government goes after mining profits Russia’s Ministry of Finance (Minfin) has set out to identify the majority of crypto mining firms in the vast country, in an effort to find out who’s minting Bitcoin and what they are making out of it. The industry has been growing, especially since its legalization last year, turning Russia into a leading mining hotspot. But not all mining enterprises are reporting to the state and paying taxes. Speaking at a plenary session of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, the head of the Russian Treasury, Anton Siluanov, revealed that the department is now topping up its database for crypto miners. Quoted by the TASS news agency and the Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media, the finance minister detailed: “Indeed, we have already started forming a register of miners, and it already contains 1,364.” Siluanov emphasized that the Minfin is determined to tax the mining sector, a large portion of which has been operating in the shadow economy, with many “gray” miners evading registration and taxation. Russia has been tempted to exploit its competitive advantages in the coin minting business, such as abundant and cheap energy, unused generation capacities from Soviet times, and cool climatic conditions in many parts of its huge territory. Mining became the Russian Federation’s first legalized and comprehensively regulated crypto-related economic activity in 2024. The adopted legislation allows both legal entities and individual entrepreneurs to mine digital currencies, as long as they register with the Federal Tax Service ( FNS ) and pay their due taxes. Russia is yet to register all crypto mining firms A year later, officials in Moscow have acknowledged that less than a third of all those involved in the industry have been added to the FNS register. Numbers may be even worse when it comes to the mandatory registration of imported mining equipment, and there have been proposals to offer amnesty to encourage compliance with the rules. On top of that, there’s the problem with “black” miners, or those who mine using stolen electricity by illegally connecting to the grid, often using existing infrastructure at abandoned industrial and agricultural sites. Illegal crypto farms like these have mushroomed across the Eurasian nation, with the Russian republics in the North Caucasus and some Siberian territories taking the lead. Another group of “amateur” crypto miners, minting digital coins in their homes, basements and garages, are not required to register at all, if they keep their monthly electricity consumption under 6,000 kWh. All these categories have contributed to growing energy deficits some parts of the country, forcing local authorities in about a dozen Russian regions to introduce seasonal or permanent restrictions, approved by the federal government, and even impose six-year bans in some cases. According to a recent estimate, Russia’s state budget is losing over $120 million a year in uncollected taxes from illegal or unregistered crypto farms, as reported by Cryptopolitan earlier this month. Moscow aims to also tax crypto settlements Anton Siluanov reminded that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia recently agreed to legalize cryptocurrency transactions in foreign trade, allowing their use in cross-border payments beyond the currently existing “experimental legal regime.” The upcoming legislative amendments, which the financial regulators are going to draft together, will also regulate cryptocurrency trading and the operations of cryptocurrency exchanges. “So that this area is legalized, receives a legislative basis, and we can accordingly collect taxes from these settlements, as with any financial assets,” the Minfin chief elaborated. “I think that we need to move as quickly as possible in this direction. This will be beneficial to everyone: both those who are engaged in international settlements, cross-border payments, and those who use cryptocurrency as a source of settlements and a source of savings,” added the Russian finance minister.

Czy rynek krypto czeka fala regulacji?,https://bitcoinist.com/kanada-naklada-rekordowa-kare-na-cryptomus/,"Kanadyjski organ nadzoru finansowego FINTRAC wydał ogłoszenie o rekordowej karze w wysokości 126 milionów dolarów , którą nałożył na platformę wymiany kryptowalut Cryptomus . Co jest powodem tak dotkliwej kary? Według organu doszło do rażącego naruszenia przepisów dotyczących przeciwdziałania praniu pieniędzy, a także finansowaniu terroryzmu. To najwyższa kara w historii kanadyjskiego rynku kryptowalutowego. Stanowi ona również sygnał, że regulatorzy na całym świecie coraz uważniej przyglądają się branży kryptowalut. Czy wspomniane wydarzenie wpłynie na całą branżę? Tysiące niezgłoszonych transakcji Oficjalny komunikat FINTRAC z 22 października informuje, że Kanada nakłada rekordową karę na Cryptomus, oskarżając podmiot o nie zgłoszenie ponad 1000 podejrzanych transakcji. Zostały one dokonane pomiędzy 1 a 31 lipca 2024 roku. Co więcej, platforma nie przekazała informacji o innych 1500 dużych transakcjach cyfrowych . Wszystkie z nich według FINTRAC nosiły znamiona nielegalnych operacji. FINTRAC wskazał również, że Cryptomus nie dostosowywał swoich procedur AML do aktualnych przepisów. Podmiot nie raportował zmian w działalności firmy. Takie moderacja są obowiązkiem każdego podmiotu działającego na rynku finansowym. FINTRAC: „Musieliśmy podjąć bezprecedensowe działania” Szefowa FINTRAC, Sarah Paquet , podkreśliła, że skala naruszeń była na tyle duża, iż urząd nie miał innego wyjścia, jak nałożyć najwyższą możliwą sankcję. „Biorąc pod uwagę, że liczne naruszenia w tej sprawie były powiązane z handlem materiałami dotyczącymi wykorzystywania seksualnego dzieci, oszustwami, płatnościami ransomware i obchodzeniem sankcji, FINTRAC był zmuszony podjąć te bezprecedensowe działania egzekucyjne” – powiedziała Paquet. To nie pierwszy raz w tym roku, gdy kanadyjski regulator podejmuje zdecydowane kroki wobec branży kryptowalut. W lutym FINTRAC ostrzegał przed wykorzystaniem aktywów wirtualnych w praniu pieniędzy pochodzących z handlu fentanylem. Z kolei we wrześniu kanadyjska policja dokonała największego w historii kraju zajęcia cyfrowych aktywów, przejmując 40 milionów dolarów z platformy TradeOgre . Rok 2025 to fala kar i zaostrzone przepisy Rok 2025 można śmiało określić jako rok sankcji i kar dla firm z branży kryptowalut. Na całym świecie regulatorzy zaostrzają kontrole i egzekwują przepisy dotyczące rejestracji działalności. Węgierski organ nadzoru finansowego zapowiedział, że traderzy korzystający z niezarejestrowanych giełd mogą trafić do więzienia nawet na pięć lat. W tym samym czasie amerykański Departament Sprawiedliwości nałożył na giełdę OKX karę w wysokości 504 milionów dolarów za prowadzenie niezarejestrowanej działalności związanej z przekazem pieniężnym. Rosnąca liczba postępowań pokazuje, że era braku nadzoru w świecie kryptowalut powoli dobiega końca. Dla inwestorów detalicznych to sygnał, że warto uważnie wybierać projekty, w które angażują kapitał. Wiele osób zastanawia się dziś, w które krypto warto inwestować , gdy globalne organy ścigania zaostrzają kontrolę nad rynkiem. Nowe standardy bezpieczeństwa w krypto. Snorter Token jako przykład odpowiedzialnego projektu Na tle afery z Cryptomus wyróżniają się projekty, które od początku stawiają na zgodność z przepisami i przejrzystość. Jednym z nich jest Snorter Token , który jest innowacyjnym projektem powiązany z narzędziem Snorter Bot . Umożliwia on błyskawiczny handel kryptowalutami bezpośrednio z poziomu Telegrama. Snorter został stworzony z myślą o traderach detalicznych, zwłaszcza tych, którzy działają w świecie memecoinów i cenią sobie prędkość transakcji oraz bezpieczeństwo. J ego bot analizuje inteligentne kontrakty, wykrywając potencjalne zagrożenia, takie jak honeypoty czy rugpulle. W odróżnieniu od wielu projektów, które dopiero po czasie dostosowują się do przepisów, Snorter od początku jest zgodny z regulacjami MiCA obowiązującymi w Unii Europejskiej.. Transparentna tokenomika i realne zastosowanie Token SNORT nie jest instrumentem inwestycyjnym, lecz narzędziem użytkowym . Pozwala obniżyć prowizje w Snorter Bocie z 1,5% do 0,85%, odblokować funkcje premium oraz brać udział w procesach decyzyjnych systemu DAO. Łączna podaż wynosi 500 milionów tokenów i jest stała. Dzięki temu projekt unika inflacyjnych mechanizmów, które często prowadzą do spadku wartości innych kryptowalut. Dodatkowo Snorter oferuje funkcje stakingu i kopiowania transakcji topowych portfeli. Wszystko to w połączeniu z prędkością transakcji poniżej sekundy i wsparciem dla wielu blockchainów (Solana, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base) sprawia, że to narzędzie realnie odpowiada na potrzeby rynku. Wśród społeczności coraz częściej pojawia się pytanie, jakie altcoiny kupić , by połączyć bezpieczeństwo z innowacyjnością. Snorter Token wydaje się tu naturalną odpowiedzią, gdyż łączy funkcjonalność, użyteczność i przejrzystość, a to dziś rzadkość w świecie kryptowalut. Odpowiedzialność zamiast chaosu Afera z Cryptomus pokazuje, że brak zgodności z regulacjami może mieć katastrofalne skutki. W przypadku zaniechań dotkliwe konsekwencje czekają zarówno firmy, jak i użytkowników detalicznych. Inwestorzy coraz częściej szukają więc projektów, które nie tylko obiecują zyski, ale też dbają o bezpieczeństwo i etykę. Snorter w swoim whitepaperze , jasno określa ryzyka inwestycyjne, nie obiecuje gwarantowanych zysków i informuje o wszystkich aspektach prawnych. Takie podejście może wkrótce stać się standardem w branży. Nie brakuje głosów, że właśnie projekty pokroju Snorter Token wyznaczają kierunek dla przyszłości rynku. Zamiast spekulacyjnego chaosu zapewniają transparentność, zgodność z prawem i rzeczywiste korzyści dla użytkowników. Co dalej z rynkiem krypto? Choć decyzja FINTRAC może wydawać się ciosem dla branży, w dłuższej perspektywie może przynieść pozytywne efekty. Wprowadzenie jasnych zasad i egzekwowanie przepisów zwiększy zaufanie inwestorów i ograniczy przestrzeń dla oszustw. Tym samym przestrzeń dla projektów odpowiedzialnych będzie się powiększać. Coraz więcej inwestorów zaczyna doceniać znaczenie bezpieczeństwa, automatyzacji i uczciwej komunikacji z użytkownikami. W miarę jak rynek dojrzewa, kluczowe staje się nie tylko to, ile można zarobić, ale też jakie są prognozy Snorter i innych projektów, które stawiają na zrównoważony rozwój.",Legislation,EN,0,0,ETH|MATIC|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-24 11:45:46

The custodian admitted it cannot meet customer withdrawal requests and failed to produce basic financial documentation, including account reconciliations and recent monthly statements. Financial Difficulties From Previous Leadership Current CEO Anthony Botticella, who assumed the position in December 2023, stated in a signed declaration, “ I learned after assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer that the Trust was experiencing severe financial difficulties and challenges related to events that occurred prior to assuming my role. ” “ These pre-existing issues materially affected the Trust’s ability to continue as an ongoing viable entity ,” he added. Fortress was unable to provide financial statements for July, August, or September, according to the Nevada regulator. The shutdown follows a troubled history for Fortress Trust, which was founded by Scott Purcell, the former CEO of Prime Trust. In 2023, Ripple backed out of an acquisition deal after Fortune published a story revealing that Fortress had lost nearly $15 million in a hack involving third-party vendor ReTool. The incident occurred just 20 days after Ripple initially announced its intent to acquire the custodian, with Purcell telling Bloomberg at the time that a third-party service was breached, but his company hadn’t been directly hacked. I can’t express enough how upsetting this Fortress Trust episode is to me. I really don’t want to talk about it at all, because it actually has nothing to do with BitGo. But because Fortress was not forthcoming about what actually did happen, we are now indirectly affected -… https://t.co/jXZYGBt93B — Mike Belshe (@mikebelshe) September 11, 2023 $15M Security Breach The security incident in September 2023 involved San Francisco-based ReTool, a company serving Fortune 500 clients that constructed the portal allowing several Fortress clients to manage cryptocurrency funds. ReTool confirmed it fell victim to a phishing attack affecting 27 of its customers, targeting a specific group of crypto-oriented clients. The attack left those who configured ReTool’s software as recommended unaffected, with the company emphasizing “ Although an attacker had access to Retool cloud, there was nothing they could do to affect on-premise customers. “ Ripple made a $15 million down payment to help Fortress reimburse affected customers as part of their acquisition deal. Fortress initially covered most affected customers, with Ripple stepping in to ensure all clients were made whole within a week. BitGo and Fireblocks, the wallet providers used by Fortress, clarified that their systems were not breached. Swan Bitcoin, a brokerage firm that uses Fortress’ BitGo wallets for client funds, confirmed that the coins stored in those wallets remained secure throughout the incident. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company would not proceed with the Fortress Trust acquisition just 20 days after the initial announcement. A few weeks ago, we signed a letter of intent to acquire Fortress Trust – we’ve since made the decision not to move forward with an outright acquisition, though Ripple will remain an investor in @Fortress_io. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) September 28, 2023 Garlinghouse stated that while the Fortress team was “ incredibly talented and had built products solving real customer problems ,” the company decided to retract its acquisition offer. Purcell downplayed the acquisition’s cancellation to Cointelegraph, calling it “ not a big deal ” and saying the change in plans was unrelated to the security incident. Nevada Tightens Crypto Custody Oversight The Fortress case took a similar pattern to Nevada’s earlier enforcement against Prime Trust , which lost access to more than $80 million in customer funds and was later placed into receivership. Fortress served over 250,000 clients before the cease-and-desist order effectively halted its operations. The regulator barred Fortress from accepting new deposits or transferring assets, mirroring prior actions taken against other failed Nevada-based crypto custodians. Nevada’s enforcement wave has extended beyond custodians. Earlier this year, a federal judge upheld a cease-and-desist order blocking Robinhood from offering sports betting-related event contracts.

Stating that the direction of Solana is still unclear, MakroVision said that the search for direction for the Solana (SOL) price continues. Analysts noted that the SOL price is fixed at the 0.5 Fibonacci level and that SOL is currently moving within a triangle formation. Based on this model, analysts said Solana will soon move in one direction, but that direction is still unclear. Analysts pointed to $177 as the short-term bottom and should be defended. They added that a break below this level could take the price to $159. Analysts, however, emphasized the importance of $204 in the long term, saying that Solana's positive momentum would only resume if the price breaks above $204. In this case, SOL could rally back to $223, where the next major resistance level awaits. Analysts recently noted that Solana is consolidating in a neutral structure after the sharp correction. A clear breakout of Solana from the current triangle is likely to determine the next trend.

DeepSnitch AI , on the other hand, raised $460K despite the recent 2% price increase to $0.01992, indicating massive interest in the project’s robust utility and usability. Latest regulatory strides in crypto Fidelity, one of the largest global asset managers, added Solana to its platform . Thus, SOL will be available to trade for both retail and institutional traders through Fidelity’s infrastructure. This signals that crypto, and more specifically, altcoins, are reaching a new level of maturity as an asset class. Solana’s developers pointed out that the network is set for growth, with the ultimate target being a capital market that could rival Wall Street. In other words, the blockchain may eventually host RWAs, including collectibles, stocks, and other funds, which will, in theory, infuse liquidity that is currently stuck in traditional assets. Although US regulators are interested in modernizing the financial system by introducing a 24/7 trading schedule, crypto companies are also making significant strides toward breaking the traditional markets. For instance, Aave Labs acquired Stable Finance , the company the eponymous mobile app centered around depositing funds from both crypto wallets and bank accounts to earn yield on stablecoins. A continuation of Aave’s efforts to break out into the institutional scene, the latest acquisition follows moves such as integration with yield-bearing stablecoins through Maple Finance, as well as the launch of Horizon, a marketplace for tokenized assets. According to Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, US senators are likely to advance crypto market structure regulation soon, citing agreement on the main issues, with 90% of the framework already agreed upon. This could usher in a more favorable and generally safer era for crypto assets, which may in turn cause the market to enter a full-on bull run. In anticipation of further developments, investors rotate into smaller coins with higher upside, with presales taking the spotlight. Best 3 presale coins right now DeepSnitch AI: What’s behind the DSNT buzz? Although a new project in the presale space, DeepSnitch AI had no problem raising $460K during the second stage. While some investors are aping the coin due to its high upside potential, many chose to support the project due to the real-world value it presents. DeepSnitch AI proposes a noble idea: bridging the gap between retail traders and whales. By providing an analytics suite that consists of an AI-driven dashboard that compiles analytics from five AI agents, users could trade more effectively, moving at a pace similar to whale investors. The way the agents achieve this is by keeping a continuous lookout on different areas of the market (Telegram and other social media threads included) for whale moves, sentiment shifts, and insider trades. Since it also employs an AI alert system, DeepSnitch will also notify you of imminent scams, rug pulls, FUD storms, and other risks. Tools of such efficiency are useful for both experienced and newbie investors. Because the project also operates in the growing AI category, its mass appeal could allow it to climb to the top of its respective sector. Plus, most AI projects play it overtly professional, which may turn off traders who are exposed to smaller alts such as meme coins. DeepSnitch AI leans into this crowd by implementing a meme-friendly design and reserving 30% of its token supply for marketing. This could not only make the suite recognizable (each agent will sport a meme character design), but it could also help the project go viral. Priced at $0.01992, DeepSnitch AI still presents an affordable entry into the bustling market. With meme appeal and robust fundamentals, the project might be the presale that yields astronomical, life-changing returns. Investors believe that DeepSnitch AI could even go 100x after launch. Put differently, investing as little as $300 at the current price could yield you $30K. 2. BlockDAG news: Can the slow BDAG news harm the future launch? BlockDAG is one of the most prominent presales at press time due to its proposed L1 that implements a DAG-PoW architecture. This approach will speed up on-chain transactions to a blistering rate, promising up to 15K transactions without sacrificing security. The latest BlockDAG news came from the development team in early October, revealing the new optimizations of the mining pool setup for ASIC miners, and refinements of X1 and X10 devices. However, still no updates on the BlockDAG launch date, which is something that the community is awaiting after the first deadline in August was missed. Meanwhile, BDAG price prediction sets the target at $0.00251 by the end of the year, which is a sizable increase from the current entry point of $0.0015. 3. Little Pepe: Is a meme presale valuable? Due to its presentation, Little Pepe looks nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the pedigree of the original PEPE. However, while this is partially true, the project also plans on supercharging its offerings by incorporating a few simple utility functions. While these mechanisms are simple, they’re a welcome addition. For instance, Little Pepe runs on an L2 with a zero-trading-tax model for smooth transactions. In addition, there’s also a staking function, community governance, with sniper protection. To ensure long-term growth, the project will also implement a meme launchpad and an NFT marketplace at some point in the future. LILPEPE may end up trading at $0.00725 if it launches in Q4, with the long-term target set at $0.015. Final words: New crypto era? As crypto’s regulatory journey progresses, there’s a high possibility that the market will soon recover from its October slump, driving the value of all sectors through the roof. Presales are a good way to start preparing for the pump, especially if you choose a project that can deliver on its promises, such as DeepSnitch AI. Although BlockDAG is certainly worth checking out, the slow BlockDAG news and an unclear launch date could be a massive red flag, despite the project’s solid utility. DeepSnitch is set for release by the end of January 2026, which means it will hit the exchanges as the market reaches its boiling point. Jump into the DeepSnitch AI presale to get early access. FAQs What’s the latest BlockDAG news update? The BlockDAG team recently optimized its mining pool for ASIC miners and refined X1 and X10 devices. However, investors are still waiting for an official launch date after a missed August deadline. 2. Why is Fidelity adding Solana? Fidelity’s decision to list Solana marks a major institutional step toward mainstream crypto adoption, especially in terms of altcoins, bridging traditional finance and decentralized finance. 3. How is DeepSnitch AI maintaining momentum despite the price increase? DeepSnitch AI continues to attract investors due to its robust AI trading suite, meme-friendly branding, and potential for 100x gains. The project raised over $460K even after the token increased to $0.01992. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

53578013,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=211703,1761306610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/53578013.jpeg,Sora AI: Unveiling Revolutionary Pet Videos and the Highly Anticipated Android App Launch,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sora-ai-app-updates/,"BitcoinWorld Sora AI: Unveiling Revolutionary Pet Videos and the Highly Anticipated Android App Launch The digital landscape is constantly evolving, driven by groundbreaking innovations that reshape how we interact with technology and create content. For those deeply immersed in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence often parallel the disruptive potential we see in decentralized finance and digital assets. Just as blockchain empowers creators with true ownership, Sora AI is democratizing video creation, making sophisticated tools accessible to everyone. OpenAI, a pioneer in AI research, is once again at the forefront, rolling out a series of transformative updates to its viral AI-generated video app, Sora. These enhancements promise to redefine personal content creation, bringing unparalleled creative freedom to users and setting the stage for an even broader reach with the upcoming Android version. This isn’t just about making videos; it’s about empowering a new wave of digital expression, reminiscent of the innovative spirit that fuels the crypto space. Sora AI: The Next Frontier in Creative Expression Since its late September launch, OpenAI’s Sora app has taken the digital world by storm, swiftly climbing to the top of the App Store charts in the U.S. and Canada. Its ability to generate stunning, high-quality videos from simple text prompts has captivated millions, demonstrating the immense power of AI Video Generation . The app’s meteoric rise, achieving approximately 2 million downloads in less than a month despite being invite-only and limited to just two countries, underscores a massive demand for accessible, powerful creative AI. Sora isn’t just a novelty; it represents a significant leap forward in how individuals can produce engaging visual content without needing extensive technical skills or expensive equipment. This accessibility mirrors the crypto ethos of lowering barriers to entry for financial and digital participation. The forthcoming updates are poised to solidify Sora’s position as a leading platform, introducing features that are not only innovative but also deeply personal and socially engaging. The core appeal of Sora lies in its simplicity and effectiveness. Users can articulate a scene, a character, or an action, and the AI brings it to life with remarkable fidelity. This empowers storytellers, marketers, and everyday users to visualize their ideas instantly. The upcoming enhancements build upon this foundation, moving beyond mere generation to offer more control, personalization, and social interaction. This evolution is critical for any platform aiming for sustained relevance in a fast-paced digital environment, much like how blockchain projects continually update their protocols to meet user demands and expand utility. Unleashing Pet AI Videos with Character Cameos One of the most anticipated and delightful additions to Sora is the introduction of character “cameos,” particularly the ability to generate Pet AI Videos . Imagine transforming your beloved dog, a mischievous guinea pig, or even a cherished stuffed toy into an AI persona that can star in its own video adventures. This feature takes personalization to an entirely new level. As announced by Sora head Bill Peebles on X, these new creation tools, including character cameos, are set to arrive in the coming days. The process is intuitive: users will provide the app with a recorded video of their pet or object as a reference file. Sora’s advanced AI then processes this input, creating an AI character that can be animated and integrated into various video scenarios. This means your pet could be seen skateboarding, flying through space, or having a tea party – all within a few taps. The term “cameo” in Sora’s context refers to the app’s capability to create an AI avatar of a person or object from a reference video. These AI personas can then be shared with friends, allowing collaborative video creation where your AI character can appear in their generated content. Peebles highlighted the expectation for users to “register lots of crazy new cameos,” which speaks to the boundless creativity this feature will unlock. To manage this influx of unique characters and make them easily discoverable, OpenAI is updating the generation user interface (UI) to display the latest trending cameos in real-time. This dynamic system will not only showcase popular creations but also inspire users with new ideas for their own pet and object cameos, fostering a vibrant, creative community. This blend of personalization and community interaction is a powerful driver for user engagement, echoing the success of decentralized social platforms that reward unique contributions. Enhanced Social Features and Collaborative AI Video Generation Beyond individual creative pursuits, OpenAI is significantly enhancing Sora’s social dimension, aiming to transform it into a more interactive and collaborative platform for AI Video Generation . An updated social experience is currently underway, designed to introduce novel ways for users to engage with Sora alongside their friends and communities. These improvements may include the establishment of dedicated channels tailored to specific groups, such as a university, a company, a sports club, or any other shared interest. This move towards community-centric features will allow users to share their AI-generated videos within curated spaces, fostering a sense of belonging and collective creativity. Imagine a university channel where students can share AI videos of campus life, or a sports club using AI to create highlights or humorous skits featuring their members’ AI avatars. The vision for these enhanced social features extends beyond simple sharing. It aims to facilitate collaborative content creation, where friends can build upon each other’s ideas or incorporate shared cameos into their videos. This communal aspect is crucial for building a sticky application, turning individual users into a connected network of creators. Furthermore, OpenAI is introducing basic video editing features, starting with the fundamental ability to stitch together multiple clips. While this might seem modest, it represents a crucial step towards giving users more control over their generated content, allowing them to refine narratives and combine different AI-generated scenes into a cohesive story. More advanced editing tools are promised to be added over time, indicating a roadmap focused on empowering users with a comprehensive suite of creative controls directly within the app. This iterative development approach, adding features based on user needs, is a hallmark of successful tech platforms, including many in the blockchain space. The Anticipated Sora Android App Launch Perhaps one of the most impactful announcements for broader accessibility is the imminent launch of the Sora Android App . Currently, Sora’s phenomenal success has been limited to iOS users in the U.S. and Canada. However, OpenAI has confirmed that the Android version is “actually coming soon,” as reiterated by Bill Peebles. While a specific launch date remains undisclosed, the anticipation among Android users is palpable. The expansion to the Google Play Store will dramatically widen Sora’s reach, opening the app to hundreds of millions of potential new users globally. This move is not merely about increasing download numbers; it’s about democratizing access to cutting-edge AI video generation technology for a significant portion of the world’s smartphone users. For many in the crypto community, accessibility and inclusivity are core tenets, and Sora’s expansion aligns perfectly with this philosophy. The current availability for pre-registration on the Google Play Store builds excitement and allows OpenAI to gauge initial interest. The “soon” timeline, while vague, suggests that the development is in its final stages, and users should prepare for a transformative experience on their Android devices. The launch of the Android app is expected to further accelerate Sora’s growth trajectory, potentially pushing its download figures far beyond the impressive 2 million already achieved. This broader adoption will undoubtedly lead to an explosion of new content, diverse creative expressions, and an even larger community of AI video creators. It also presents a significant competitive advantage, solidifying Sora’s market position against other emerging AI content tools. The strategic importance of this cross-platform availability cannot be overstated for a viral application aiming for global dominance in the creative AI space. Optimizing User Experience: Performance and Moderation in OpenAI Sora Updates OpenAI is not only focused on adding new features but also on refining the core user experience, addressing critical feedback from its burgeoning user base. Key among these improvements are efforts to reduce the excessive moderation of generations and to enhance the overall app performance. Some users have have voiced concerns that Sora’s moderation has been overly strict, sometimes hindering creative expression or preventing certain types of content from being generated. OpenAI’s commitment to “reduce the excessive moderation” indicates a responsiveness to user feedback, aiming to strike a better balance between safety and creative freedom. This is a delicate but crucial act, as platforms must protect users while fostering an environment where innovation can thrive. For OpenAI Sora Updates to truly empower users, the moderation framework needs to be perceived as fair and reasonable, allowing for a wider range of imaginative content. Simultaneously, the company is dedicated to improving the app’s overall performance. As more features are added and the user base expands, maintaining a smooth, responsive, and reliable application becomes paramount. Performance enhancements could include faster video generation times, smoother UI navigation, reduced crashes, and optimized resource consumption, particularly important for mobile devices. A seamless user experience is vital for retaining users and encouraging continued engagement, especially in the competitive app market. These behind-the-scenes optimizations, though less flashy than new creative tools, are foundational to Sora’s long-term success. They ensure that the powerful Creative AI Tools remain accessible and enjoyable for everyone, from casual users to aspiring digital artists. This commitment to both innovation and operational excellence is what distinguishes leading tech companies and drives their continued growth, much like robust infrastructure supports a thriving blockchain ecosystem. The Future is Now: Unlocking Unprecedented Creative Potential The array of updates coming to OpenAI’s Sora app represents a significant leap forward in the realm of AI-generated content. From the whimsical charm of pet AI videos and character cameos to the strategic expansion with the Sora Android app, these developments are set to democratize advanced video creation like never before. The enhanced social features promise to transform individual creativity into a collaborative, community-driven experience, while improvements in moderation and performance underscore OpenAI’s commitment to a user-centric design. Sora is not just a tool; it’s a canvas for imagination, an enabler of stories, and a bridge between an idea and its visual manifestation. For individuals and businesses alike, the implications are profound. Content creators can produce engaging material with unprecedented speed and personalization. Social media users can express themselves in novel, entertaining ways. And the broader digital economy will undoubtedly see new forms of interaction and commerce emerge around AI-generated media. As Sora continues to evolve, it reinforces the notion that AI is not just automating tasks but augmenting human creativity, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the digital age. These updates solidify Sora’s position as a trailblazer, paving the way for a future where everyone can be a video producer, bringing their wildest ideas to life with just a few taps.

53579080,https://invezz.com/?p=2939801,1761306885,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,21Shares launches Pendle ETP on Swiss Exchange,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/24/21shares-launches-pendle-etp-on-swiss-exchange/,"21Shares, a leading provider of crypto exchange-traded products, has debuted the 21Shares Pendle ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange. While this launch has not resulted in an immediate flip in Pendle price, it is a signal of growing confidence and demand, and could see European investors get regulated access to Pendle’s token and decentralized finance ecosystem. PENDLE traded around $3.10 on Friday, down 3.9% in the past 24 hours as bulls struggled. 21Shares adds Pendle ETP to European offering On Oct. 24, 21Shares announced the launch of its Pendle ETP with ticker APEN. The exchange-traded fund is now live on the SIX Swiss Exchange and will provide investors with a seamless, liquid avenue to gain exposure to Pendle through familiar channels like banks or brokers. As one of the top interest rate derivatives protocols in DeFi , Pendle enables sophisticated yield strategies without the complexities of direct blockchain interaction. Priced to mirror Pendle’s native token performance, APEN tracks the asset while offering the security and transparency of a Swiss-listed product. What sets APEN apart is Pendle’s role as a foundational financial primitive driving explosive growth in onchain markets. At its core, Pendle innovates by dissecting yield-bearing assets. These include assets such as staked Ethereum (stETH) and stablecoin yields. Yield is more than a passive return as Pendle makes these dynamic, tradable commodities. “Pendle’s breakthrough is its ability to split yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components, which are then tradable separately. This transforms yield from a passive byproduct into an active market, enabling fixed-income strategies, yield speculation, and onchain risk management,” 21Shares wrote on its product page . What this means is that investors can pursue both fixed-income plays and speculate on future yields. They can also hedge risks onchain, a scenario that mirrors the trillion-dollar traditional fixed-income sector but in a decentralized framework. Crypto ETP adoption on the rise 21Shares’ debut of the Pendle ETF coincides with the accelerating institutional embrace of crypto investment products across the globe. This market has seen total assets under management (AUM) swell to over $220 billion as of October 20, 2025. Asset manager CoinShares shared this in a weekly report on Monday, noting global net outflows of $513 million triggered by a Binance liquidity event, did little to dent optimism. “Digital asset ETPs saw US$513M in outflows after the 10 Oct liquidity cascade, though ETP investors largely shrugged it off,” CoinShares head of research James Butterfill noted. Like 21Shares, another ETP issuer on an upward streak is DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour. The Valour SKY ETP went live on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market this week, targeting the Sky (SKY) token, which is native to the formerly MakerDAO network. As regulators harmonize frameworks like MiCA, these developments signal a potential aggressive buying. Notably, ETPs are bridging DeFi’s yield frontiers with compliant, scalable access, and traction for spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum spot ETFs signal this growth.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s price increased to $0.0646 in the past 24 hours.

The high volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of further price spikes, which, if they occur, can lead to a retest of the $0.0666 resistance. Why is GRT down? The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bears, as the price was decreasing, so the coin is moving up today after finding support. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, The Graph token should rise above $0.5 in 2030. In that year, the price will range between $0.512873 and $0.562506. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ The Graph Forecast, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

Blockchain data shared by Whale Alert revealed the movement on Thursday, which marked the first transaction from the address in 14 years. Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Wallet Activity Raises Questions According to data from the mempool and Nansen, the whale once held as many as 7,850 BTC. The last known activity occurred in June 2011 when the owner consolidated about 4,000 coins into one address. This week’s 150 BTC transfer was the first sign of movement since then. Blockchain analyst Emmett Gallic noted that the same individual might have once controlled over 8,000 BTC across several wallets. Over time, the holder appears to have been selling small amounts through different addresses. After the recent transfer, the balance now stands at roughly 3,850 BTC. The transferred amount stands as only a small fraction of the wallet’s total balance and an even smaller share of daily Bitcoin trading volume , which is more than $20 billion. That means the market effect from this move is minimal. Why the Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Wallet Movement Matters Movements from early Bitcoin wallets always draw attention because they date back to the network’s beginnings. These coins were mined when Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto , was still active in online forums. Glassnode data shows that only a few pre-2011 wallets send transactions each year. Each time this happens, speculation grows about whether the owner could be Satoshi himself or one of the earliest miners. While such theories are common, they rarely hold up under scrutiny. Most old wallets that move funds turn out to belong to early miners or developers who have stayed quiet for years. Market reactions to these awakenings are usually brief. Traders tend to worry that old holders might sell. This creates short-term price pressure. However, past examples show that these coins are often just being moved to new and more secure wallets rather than being sold. The Market Context Behind the Move The wallet’s awakening comes during a volatile period for Bitcoin. Prices have been consolidating between $108,000 and $111,000 after a drop from the recent all-time high of $126,000. Earlier this month, the market saw $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated. Despite that, Bitcoin has shown strength. The Fear and Greed Index currently shows cautious optimism as traders wait for the next major price move. The 150 BTC moved this week makes up a tiny fraction of overall market liquidity. Fear and greed index shows caution among traders | source: CoinMarketCap Analysts say that unless those coins are later traced to an exchange wallet, there is no reason to expect selling pressure. Why These Old Wallets Keep Moving There are several possible explanations for these movements. The wallet owner could be transferring coins for better security or even managing inheritance plans. Bitcoin security standards have changed since 2009, and many early users are now updating how they store their holdings. Past awakenings from Satoshi-era wallets, including several in 2021 and 2023, did not cause any lasting market impact. Those transfers were later confirmed to be reorganisation transactions rather than large-scale liquidations. Crypto analyst Willy Woo has previously pointed out that long-term whales holding over 10,000 BTC have been gradually selling since 2017. However, smaller holders from the early days often move coins without adding new supply to exchanges.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-24 12:01:11

The feature is powered by the Aster decentralized exchange (DEX) and will later include utility tied to the TWT token. “Pure trading freedom, without giving up your keys,” the team says, highlighting the move to bring advanced trading fully on-chain. With the new feature, Trust Wallet offers: access to 100+ trading markets up to 100x leverage self-custody and full control of funds all transactions executed directly on the blockchain “You can hold a position for as long as you want or close it at any time — that’s why they’re called perpetual futures,” the company explains. Perpetual futures have traditionally been available only on centralized exchanges with complex interfaces. Trust Wallet aims to change this by offering a simple trading experience, deep liquidity through Aster, transparent on-chain execution, and potential fee discounts for TWT holders. The feature currently supports BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), and Solana (SOL), with more networks on the way. High-Risk Feature With Restricted Regions The team reminds users that leveraged trading carries significant risk and may not be suitable for everyone. The service is not available in the US, UK, and other restricted regions.

While the price has bounced, the broader sentiment remains cautious. The key question is whether this bounce is a real reversal or just a temporary relief before another leg down. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC found support and bounced off the 200-day moving average around $108K. This area has held as strong demand in previous corrections, and used to act as a base for the latest bullish move in September and early October. However, the asset still hasn’t broken back above the dotted midline of the channel or the 100-day MA, both located around the $115K mark. Until we see a daily close above these two resistance elements, the buyers cannot regain full control. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4H timeframe, BTC is testing the descending trendline from the recent high and is currently hovering around the $111K level. The structure is showing a potential breakout, but the price needs to close above the $112K area to confirm a shift in short-term momentum. The RSI is also pushing toward 60, suggesting growing bullish pressure but not yet overextended. In case the descending trendline breaks to the upside, the price will likely target the $116K resistance zone in the upcoming days. On the other hand, a failed breakout would probably lead to a deeper decline toward the critical $100K demand zone. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest Analyzing the futures market sentiment, open interest is forming a base around 35 billion after a sharp flush, indicating that while some traders are stepping back into leveraged positions, the overall market sentiment is still uncertain. With the open interest still relatively high compared to recent historical levels, the risk of another cascade liquidation remains, especially if the market breaks below the mentioned resistance levels. If BTC fails to reclaim $115K cleanly, another wave of long liquidations could follow, especially heading into the weekend.

Something Big Coming?,https://timestabloid.com/a-hyperliquid-whale-just-opened-a-massive-1m-xrp-long-position-something-big-coming/,"When traders sense something big brewing, it often begins with a whisper — a sudden surge of open interest, a flurry of whale activity, or a sharp build-up of leveraged exposure. Today, XRP has found itself at the center of such intrigue once again after reports surfaced of a massive long position on Hyperliquid, stirring intense speculation about whether the token could be gearing up for its next major move. The Buzz Around a $1 Million XRP Long According to crypto trader and on-chain observer Xaif, a whale recently opened a $1 million long position on XRP with 10x leverage at around $2.40 on the decentralized derivatives platform Hyperliquid. The revelation quickly spread across X, igniting debate among traders who view such a position as a bold signal of confidence in XRP’s short-term trajectory. If genuine, the position implies a notional exposure of $10 million, positioning the trader to benefit substantially from even modest upward price movements, but also facing significant liquidation risk if the market turns against them. In a market as sentiment-driven as crypto, such activity often fuels excitement, particularly when it appears just before a potential breakout. JUST IN: A Hyperliquid whale has opened a MASSIVE $1M XRP long position with 10x leverage at $2.40 Looks like someone’s betting BIG on #XRP making a move soon! pic.twitter.com/RnhyNJhOFE — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 23, 2025 Hyperliquid and Its Transparency Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for on-chain transparency, non-custodial trading, and real-time order book visibility. Because positions on the platform are stored directly on-chain, large trades can, in theory, be independently verified through Hyperliquid’s public blockchain explorer or third-party tracking tools such as HyperTracker. This transparency feature gives the community the ability to confirm whether such a large leveraged position truly exists, and whether it remains open or has already been liquidated or reduced. As of report time, no verifiable on-chain record confirms a $1 million XRP long position at the stated entry price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Reaction and the Bigger Picture Despite the uncertainty surrounding the claim, Xaif’s post succeeded in reviving bullish discussions around XRP. The community remains divided; some see the news as a possible precursor to a price breakout, while others view it as an example of how misinformation can quickly spread in a speculative market environment. The event also comes amid broader optimism in the XRP ecosystem. Institutional interest continues to grow , with liquidity partnerships expanding and investor sentiment leaning bullish after Ripple’s steady progress in cross-border payment infrastructure and regulatory resolution. Final Thoughts Xaif’s report has undoubtedly added fuel to the conversation around the token’s next big move. However, as the facts stand, the on-chain evidence remains inconclusive. Traders are therefore urged to verify such claims through blockchain data rather than rely solely on viral posts or screenshots. The development highlights a deeper truth: in the high-stakes world of crypto derivatives, even the rumor of a whale bet can shift sentiment, and sometimes, that’s enough to move markets on its own.

In a Tages-Anzeiger newspaper interview on Friday, Keller-Sutter stated, “It’s not possible to forecast. Everything depends on whether the U.S. president gives the green light or not.” It also follows a spat between the nations, most notably when Trump slapped a 39% penalty on Swiss exports in August 2025 over what he said was a trade deficit with the nation. The decision came after a phone call with Keller-Sutter, whom the Swiss people had criticized for not handling the conversation properly. Later, Trump said she “didn’t want to listen” to his concerns about a U.S. deficit. Still different from initial assumptions, the conversation was not initiated by Keller-Sutter, but by the US Trade Representative. In response to the tariffs being imposed by the Trump administration, Swiss officials have presented a package of new investment commitments and deficit-cutting measures to negotiate more favorable tariff terms . The United States accounts for 17% of Switzerland’s exports Switzerland has been negotiating for improved tariff terms with the Trump administration, presenting investment pledges and initiatives aimed at helping reduce the U.S. deficit. Keller-Sutter had previously confirmed that Swiss officials are continuing to discuss tariffs with the U.S, noting that although U.S. tariffs cover less than 10% of Swiss exports, certain sectors have been severely impacted. She pointed out that machinery manufacturers were particularly at risk, seeing that Germany’s economic slowdown already strained them . When the tariffs were first imposed, many Swiss economists and officials heavily disapproved of them, calling them unfair. At the time, Jan Atteslander, director of international relations for the Swiss business federation Economiesuisse, commented, “Thirty-nine percent tariffs: I was just shocked. This is unjustified; you can’t explain why they are so high.” The United States absorbs nearly 17% of Switzerland’s total exports, making it a crucial market for the Alpine country. The pharmaceutical sector is Switzerland’s most valuable export to the U.S. Although it escaped the current 39% tariffs, Trump had threatened to implement a 100% levy on imported medicines. Medical technology products are also a key export to the U.S. Swiss MPS CEO Gilles Robert said his company had already been offering the best possible prices before the new tariffs took effect, noting that there was no room left to lower prices given tight margins. Adrian Hunn, of SwissMedTech, has so far warned that American patients would end up paying more for medical devices as a consequence. Some believe that Switzerland could weather difficulties Nonetheless, Switzerland has been working to expand into new markets and recently signed a trade agreement with India that took effect on October 1. The country has also finalized a deal with the South American trade bloc Mercosur. Moreover, it is updating its long-established deal with China and still maintains its free-trade relationship with the European Union, which buys around 50% of Swiss exports. Some continue to hold out hope for a U.S. policy reversal, but there is calm assurance that Switzerland can endure the difficulties. Atteslander even remarked, “To be a successful export nation, you have to have resilience in your DNA.” However, what may suffer most in the long run are the once-close business relations between Switzerland and the U.S. There’s a real sense of disappointment in Switzerland, where companies not only valued the American market but took pride in working with it.

A prominent crypto analyst holds a bullish Ethereum price prediction as the token could soon step out of a text-book accumulation phase. If Richard Wyckoff were alive, he would buy $ETH here. pic.twitter.com/0ZWXcgJZ9C — Poseidon (@CryptoPoseidonn) October 22, 2025 The popular trader Poseidon, who has more than 170,000 followers on X, used Wyckoff pattern analysis to determine that the top altcoin could soon explode as buyers have been accumulating the token for days, following its latest pullback. This would set the stage for ETH’s next leg up, and possibly the strongest of the cycle, at a point when market conditions are favorable. Poseidon sees Ethereum climbing to at least $8,000 if his prediction comes to fruition. The key support to watch, based on Poseidon’s estimates, would be the $3,800 level. ETH has bounced off this mark lately, emphasizing its relevance for market participants, as buying pressure remains strong at that area. Ethereum Price Prediction: A Confirmed Breakout Out of Consolidation Could Push ETH to $8K The daily chart shows how smaller accumulation phases have played out in the past and have pushed ETH to higher highs in three previous occasions. The last of these two delivered a 67% gain after a confirmed bullish breakout out of a consolidation rectangle. Back then, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbed to overbought territory, confirming that bullish momentum was accelerating. A move above $4,800, preferably accompanied by above-average trading volumes, could mark the beginning of this next leg up for ETH, with a first target set $8,000 at least, which is in line with Poseidon’s forecast for the top altcoin. Same as Ethereum, early presales offer significant upside potential during this cycle.

According to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $20.33 million on October 23, while Ether spot ETFs recorded combined net outflows of $127.47 million. Capital Rotates From Ethereum to Bitcoin ETFs Amid Market Uncertainty Bitcoin ETF outflow was led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which pulled in $107.78 million. Bitwise’s BITB followed with $17.41 million in inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC added $7.22 million. Grayscale’s GBTC, however, saw a significant outflow of $60.49 million, marking the largest daily withdrawal among Bitcoin funds. Source: SoSoValue The total net asset value of all U.S.-listed Bitcoin spot ETFs now stands at $149.43 billion, representing 6.84% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Cumulative net inflows since their approval have reached $61.89 billion. BlackRock continues to dominate the sector with $88.87 billion in net assets under management, followed by Fidelity with $22.72 billion and Grayscale’s GBTC with $18.98 billion. Despite GBTC’s outflows, Bitcoin ETFs overall saw a weekly net inflow of $355.76 million, highlighting investor interest in the asset even amid volatile macroeconomic conditions. Ethereum ETFs, in contrast, extended their losing streak, extending the loss from the previous day. Fidelity’s FETH led the withdrawals with $77.04 million in outflows, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA with $23.31 million. Source: SoSoValue Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV lost $8.85 million and $5.65 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s ETHE and mini ETH funds saw $5.71 million and $6.91 million in redemptions. As of Thursday, the total net assets of all Ethereum spot ETFs stood at $26.02 billion, about 5.63% of the asset’s total market value. Cumulative inflows remain positive at $14.45 billion, but weekly data show net outflows of $150.31 million. The rotation between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs comes amid heightened geopolitical risk and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy. Trump Warns of 155% Tariffs on Chinese Goods; Global Markets React On Monday, President Donald Trump reignited trade tensions with China, threatening to impose tariffs of up to 155% on Chinese goods starting November 1 unless a new trade agreement is reached. The comments, made during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, shook financial markets and pushed investors toward safer assets, including Bitcoin. Trump threatened China with 155% tariffs starting Nov 1, following an $8.5B Australia minerals agreement. Over $329M in crypto liquidated. #China #Tariff #Australia https://t.co/nlagSWbX6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 Trump accused China of exploiting the U.S. “for years,” adding that “China’s paying 55 percent and a potential 155 percent come November 1 unless we make a deal.” The White House later confirmed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Kuala Lumpur this weekend in an attempt to avert escalation ahead of Trump’s expected meeting with President Xi Jinping during the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea. The renewed trade tensions follow months of tit-for-tat measures between Washington and Beijing, including new export restrictions and 100% tariffs on advanced technology components. Also, markets are now awaiting Friday’s delayed U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for September , expected to show inflation rising to 3.1% annually, the first time above 3% this year. Economists expect a 0.4% monthly increase in CPI. A higher-than-expected reading may dampen expectations of an imminent rate cut, but analysts say the central bank remains focused on signs of labor market weakness rather than inflation alone. Tomorrow's CPI data will be crucial for the market. It will be released at 8:30am ET. The expectations are at 3.1%, while last month's CPI was 2.9%. This will be the first major data release since the U.S. government shutdown 22 days ago. Given that last month's CPI was 2.9%,… — Ted (@TedPillows) October 23, 2025 Analysts say the standoff has fueled uncertainty across global markets, with risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, responding sharply to shifts in sentiment. Ethereum Accumulates as Bitcoin Struggles to Extend ‘Uptober’ Gains Bitcoin traded around $111,300 at press time, holding steady near the upper end of its weekly range between $107,000 and $111,500. The flagship cryptocurrency remains 2.3% below its monthly open, leaving the possibility of a negative “Uptober” performance if prices fail to recover before month’s end. THIS IS THE WORST UPTOBER EVER. The only worse one was 2014 (-13%). 2013: +60% 2017: +50% 2021: +40% 2025: -4% Bad Uptober usually means one thing: MOONVEMBER. pic.twitter.com/6BMrNp4afD — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) October 23, 2025 Data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin typically gains around 20% in October during bull market years, which would place the target near $130,000.

Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) recently filed a 8-A Form with the SEC, a procedural step before an ETF can list and trade on a US exchange. This filing also includes changing Bitwise’s listing venue from Cboe BZX to NYSE Arca, an exchange used by major ETFs like $BTC and $ETH spot ETFs, boosting BSOL’s liquidity potential and institutional credibility. While BSOL is gearing up for its NYSE listing, an SEC green light is still pending, given the ongoing US government shutdown . Bitwise, however, has more up its sleeve. It submitted a fifth amendment on October 8 to include a staking in the fund name, a major differentiator in ETF markets that emphasizes the passive yield potential. In addition to the name change, Bitwise has also set an ultra-low management fee of 0.20% , which could attract massive inflows from high-yield seeking investors. Furthermore, Bitwise plans on capturing the market by completely waiving the management fee for the initial three months or until the AUM hits $1B. Bitwise isn’t walking into this alone – it’s working with heavyweights like Chapman & Cutler LLP (legal), Fenwick & West LLP (tax), KPMG (audit), Attestant (staking provider), and Coinbase Custody, to bolster investor confidence and for regulatory credibility. While that’s the news on Bitwise, 21Shares Solana ETF (VSOL) also filed a Form 8-A recently to list on Cboe BZX. It has since been approved, making it the first major ETF to provide staking rewards to holders. In light of these fillings, $SOL surged by around 6% , clocking an intraday range between $188 and $192. While the day’s rally packed heat, $SOL Futures Open Interest jumped over 3% to $9.08B , indicating that derivative traders are betting on further upside. As institutional confidence in Solana builds, every corner of its ecosystem is feeling the lift. One standout project riding Solana’s explosive momentum is the Snorter Token ($SNORT), a Telegram-based trading bot offering lightning-fast transactions with minimal fees, now entering the final stretch of its presale. Snorter Bot ($SNORT): The Next Big Telegram-Native Trading Bot For Lightning-Fast Trades Powered by Snorter Token ($SNORT) , the Snorter bot is set to follow in the league of Maestro, Banana Gun, and Trojan, emerging as a high-upside player in the trading bot arena. It already stands out from the crowd with its USP – engineered to sniff out the next 100x meme coin before it goes viral. Built on the Solana ecosystem, it will offer ultra-fast transactions at a near-dust fee (0.85% for $SNORT holders), providing you an edge in a market that’s on the mend. Snorter bot isn’t all about hype; it will bring a utility-driven ecosystem with a faster sniper and advanced trade-sniffing intelligence, giving you the edge to outsmart whales. The Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the native token fueling every pulse of this blazing-fast ecosystem.

Discover how to buy $SNORT in our detailed guide. Entering its final three days, Snorter Token ($SNORT) is stealing the spotlight – pulling in $5.4M+ and counting. Each $SNORT token now sits at $0.1083, with a dynamic staking APY of 102%. According to our $SNORT price prediction , the token has the potential to soar to $0.94 by the end of 2025, delivering a 768% return from today’s price. If you HODL until the end of 2026, your gains could climb to 1,673% as the token is expected to reach $1.92. When the market’s this wild, missing plays like this can sting. Big wallets are already circling, with one whale snapping up $11.5K worth of $SNORT earlier this month. With the presale ending in just three days, don’t miss the final window to secure your share of $SNORT. Get in on $SNORT today before the whales scoop it all up.

This week, the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled that NDAX was not responsible for the loss because the exchange fulfilled its duties by warning Xu multiple times. NDAX Warnings Could Not Have Been Clearer Xu opened her NDAX account on April 10, 2023, after an online acquaintance convinced her to invest in a scheme promising returns of up to 1% per day. To fund this “opportunity,” she remortgaged her home and borrowed from a friend. Over the next five weeks, she deposited C$671,000 into her NDAX account and used it to buy Ethereum. Canadian woman sues crypto exchange for scam and loses | source: X Soon after, Xu attempted to transfer the crypto to an external wallet. NDAX flagged the withdrawal as suspicious and contacted her on April 18 to verify the details. The exchange informed her that the transaction “showed risk factors” and would be escalated for review. Despite being warned that she was likely being scammed, Xu demanded that NDAX release the funds immediately. Judge Lindsay LeBlanc, who presided over the case, wrote in her ruling that NDAX’s warnings “could not have been clearer.” She added that while Xu’s losses were “regrettable,” the company performed its duties by warning her. Four Warnings Before the Transfer Court documents revealed that Xu ignored four separate warnings from NDAX staff before the transfer went through. For the first warning, NDAX presented a “Crypto Risk Disclosure” notice on its platform. It explained that sending crypto to an untrusted wallet could result in permanent loss. It urged Xu not to proceed if anyone had remote access to her device or if the wallet was not trusted. Xu clicked “accept” and confirmed she understood the risks. For the second warning, the platform displayed a confirmation message that required her to acknowledge that crypto transfers are irreversible. She again clicked to proceed.For the third warning, an NDAX employee called Xu directly, explaining that her transaction seemed fraudulent and that she was likely being scammed. The call was recorded. Yet, Xu still insisted on completing the withdrawal and threatened legal action if NDAX delayed it.For the fourth warning, NDAX’s compliance officer, Julia Baranovskaya, called Xu to confirm she understood the risks. During the conversation, Xu said she was an experienced accountant who had traded stocks for over 20 years and was fully aware of what she was doing. After confirming the request, NDAX processed the transaction as instructed. Despite these warnings, Xu transferred her entire Ethereum balance to a wallet controlled by the scammers. How the Crypto Scam Unfolded Xu testified that she had met someone online who introduced her to the scam investment. At first, the individual asked for small amounts of money, which were later returned with profit to gain her trust. Encouraged by these early “returns,” she was persuaded to invest a larger sum. The scam promised daily profits of 1%, an offer that experts say is a clear red flag. Believing the opportunity was legitimate, Xu mortgaged her home. She borrowed from a friend and sent hundreds of thousands of dollars through NDAX to purchase Ethereum. Once the crypto left her account, it was gone for good. Blockchain analysis later confirmed that the recipient wallet belonged to a third party unconnected to NDAX.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-24 12:14:15

The private event brought together C-level representatives from stablecoin issuers, investment banks, prime brokers, and fintech firms to discuss the accelerating adoption of stablecoins and their role in reshaping cross-border payments and corporate treasury management. An evening at the FC Barcelona museum Guests began the evening with a private tour of the FC Barcelona Museum, exploring the club’s storied legacy through its trophies, memorabilia, and interactive exhibits. They were later joined by Bojan Krkić, the former FC Barcelona forward and now Football Department Coordinator, who spoke about shared values between sport and business. Source: WhiteBIT Stablecoins in institutional finance At the center of the event was a panel discussion titled “From Trading to Treasury: Challenges and Opportunities in Institutional Adoption of Stablecoins.” Moderated by WhiteBIT Chief Commercial Officer Sergii Bulgakov, the panel included executives from Paxos, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton, representing three distinct pillars of the new financial architecture: stablecoin issuer, digital asset trading, and investment banking. Once perceived as a proxy for crypto trading, stablecoins are now finding a place in corporate treasuries and global payment flows. “People use stablecoins because it’s an effective form of commerce,” said a Paxos representative. “They remove friction, volatility, and offer 24/7 settlement — making it a perfect vehicle for exchanging value across the borders.” Source: WhiteBIT This efficiency can also be unlocked to benefit corporate treasuries. As VanEck’s representative noted: “Corporates can use stablecoins to optimize their cashflow and earn extra yield on stablecoin balances making it an alternative investment tool.” Innovation in the sector continues to accelerate. Paxos recently launched the Global Dollar Network, designed to make regulated, dollar-backed assets accessible worldwide. Franklin Templeton’s Benji tokenized money market fund is another example of how traditional finance and blockchain can successfully merge. The real transformation, they noted, lies in how traditional finance is shifting from account-based systems to wallet-based ecosystems, where stablecoins serve as the settlement layer for global money flows. With Citibank projecting that stablecoins will become a $4T market by 2030, most of the world’s population could be using them daily, without even realizing it. WhiteBIT’s institutional expansion Since launching WhiteBIT Institutional Services in 2023, the exchange has introduced professional-grade trading tools, custody infrastructure, and Crypto-as-a-Service solutions for banks, fintechs, and telecoms seeking to integrate digital assets. Through these initiatives, WhiteBIT aims to continue “building the bridge between traditional and digital finance,” enabling institutions to participate in blockchain-powered financial systems with greater efficiency and compliance.

PENGU net exchange flows. Source: Coinglass. Traders are choosing to hold rather than keep liquidity on exchanges, reinforcing optimism that October could mark the start of Pudgy Penguins’ next major move higher. Pudgy Penguins Price Prediction: Could PENGU Rally Before Halloween? This pattern of large whale order sizes closely mirrors a 10-month cup-and-handle pattern. PENGU is now consolidating within the handle, with a retest of its lower support possibly setting the stage for the next leg up—the setup whales appear to be betting on. Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The RSI is building back up from near-oversold conditions, suggesting buyers are stepping back in at lower prices. The MACD histogram also trends towards a potential golden cross, hinting at the early stages of a new uptrend. A past demand zone at $0.29 is a likely breakout zone. Once flipped to support, the next level to watch is the pattern neckline at $0.48 for confirmation of the bullish structure. Fully realized, the pattern could see the Pudgy Penguins price extend to $0.60, marking a potential 28x move from current prices. However, the full move is unlikely to materialize before Halloween. Catalysts for demand, like continued U.S. interest rate eases running into 2026, will likely be required to fuel the move. The immediate $0.29 level is a much more credible near-term target. Best Wallet: The Smarter Way to HODL This Cycle Traders are once again moving high-potential plays like PENGU off exchanges into self-custody. But this cycle, many are choosing Best Wallet ($BEST) over MetaMask or Exodus. As traders pull high-potential plays like PENGU off exchanges and back into self-custody, many are opting for Best Wallet ($BEST) over the old go-tos MetaMask and Phantom. The difference? Utility. Best Wallet gives users an edge with its “Upcoming Tokens” feature, a built-in screener that highlights promising early-stage projects before they hit the spotlight. This isn’t just another wallet. It’s made for the bull market—putting discovery, storage, and opportunity all in one place. And it doesn’t stop at storage. With Bestcard, users can spend stablecoins anywhere Mastercard is accepted, bridging crypto seamlessly into everyday life. So far, the presale has raised over $16.6 million, and momentum is only growing. Early buyers of $BEST are positioning themselves ahead of listings — and ahead of the next wave of market upside.

In this article, we will analyze the cause of the disruption and provide additional key details. Coinbase Problems During the Weekend? The leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange, which has over 100 million users, announced on X that it will be temporarily offline on October 25, at about 7 AM PT, due to a scheduled systems upgrade. “All trading (except perpetuals futures on INTX) across Coinbase.com (Simple and Advanced Trade), Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime will be unavailable. All transfers will be unavailable on Coinbase Exchange, and any in-flight transfers will be delayed,” the disclosure reads. The company’s team advised people to follow its official account on the social media platform for updates on the matter and promised to post reminders and details on a designated website. Some users commenting on the post expressed frustration that the upgrade will occur during the weekend, while others complained that such outages happen pretty regularly. It is important to note that the biggest crypto exchange, Binance, also experienced a severe disruption recently. During the market crash on October 10, multiple users reported errors and technical glitches, while some were unable to place orders for some time. Shortly after, the company established a multi-million-dollar fund to reimburse affected clients, blaming sharp market fluctuations for the operational hurdles. Coinbase’s Recent Listings Earlier this month, the exchange placed Binance Coin (BNB) on its roadmap. The section consists of cryptocurrencies, which may be officially listed if they meet certain criteria. The move was somewhat surprising because BNB is the native token of the biggest competitor, Binance. Despite the controversy, Coinbase added support for the asset on October 22 and revealed that it is available on the company’s website, its application, and Coinbase Advanced. “The opening of our BNB-USD trading pair will begin when liquidity conditions are met, in regions where trading is supported,” it stated. Other cryptocurrencies recently listed by the exchange include aPriori (APR) and Meteora (MET), whereas trading for Freysa (FAI) and Moonwell (WELL) perpetual contracts was suspended .

The company has launched its own Layer-1 blockchain, Tempo, while also acquiring the stablecoin platform Bridge and crypto wallet provider Privy, according to a JPMorgan report . The bank says Stripe now sees digital asset infrastructure as a core driver of its next phase of growth. The payments giant became profitable in 2024 and processed more than $1.4 trillion in total transaction volume. JPMorgan estimates Stripe’s potential addressable market at over $350 billion, calling the company a “ beneficiary of borderless financial services .” Analysts also noted that Stripe’s early alignment with AI startups has given it an advantage as agentic commerce — transactions initiated and executed by AI agents continues to rise. Tempo, Stablecoins, and AI Give Stripe a New Edge Through the acquisitions of Bridge and Privy, Stripe is expanding deeper into stablecoins, payments, and on-chain infrastructure. CEO Patrick Collison describes Tempo as a payments-focused Layer-1 blockchain built for real-world financial use cases, not experimental crypto hype. “These initiatives position Stripe to benefit from the integration of AI agents, stablecoins, and programmable money into global commerce,” JPMorgan noted. However, analysts also point to risks tied to scale and regulation, especially around stablecoins in the United States and under MiCA in Europe. Earlier this year, Stripe also introduced stablecoin subscription payments, reinforcing its strategy of blending traditional finance with blockchain-based rails. With Tempo, stablecoins, and programmable money, Stripe is signaling that the future of payments will be faster, borderless, and increasingly on-chain.

The program is expected to roll out by the end of 2025 and will operate globally. The pledged digital assets will be stored with a third-party custodian, whose name has not yet been disclosed. JPMorgan already accepts cryptocurrency ETFs as collateral, and industry observers say this move is a natural evolution of the bank’s digital-asset strategy. The institution has not issued an official comment on the upcoming launch. A Symbolic Shift on Wall Street The step is being described as both symbolic and practical for JPMorgan. CEO Jamie Dimon, once a vocal Bitcoin critic who dismissed it as a “PR scam” increasingly acknowledges the asset class as something institutional clients now demand. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency access to E*Trade users, while Fidelity, State Street, and BNY Mellon have already launched digital-asset custody services for institutional investors. Analysts say the trend reflects a shift from skepticism to structured adoption across global finance. How Other Major Banks Are Implementing Crypto Strategies While JPMorgan moves into crypto-backed lending, other global institutions are expanding in parallel directions. Goldman Sachs has restarted its crypto trading desk and is exploring tokenization initiatives for institutional products. Deutsche Bank is developing regulated custody services for digital assets in Europe, aiming to support both private funds and corporations. Meanwhile, HSBC and UBS are focusing on blockchain-based settlement solutions rather than direct crypto exposure, signaling that every bank is choosing its own lane — but all are moving in the same overall direction. Together, these efforts show that crypto is no longer an experiment on the sidelines. Instead, it is becoming a competitive requirement for major banks, especially as institutional clients demand secure, regulated ways to interact with digital assets.",News|Business,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-24 13:33:24

The addition of yield blurs the line between payment tools and investments, the organization warned. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) issued warnings on the expansion of stablecoin yield products. The organization noted the current trend of stablecoin adoption, but warned about yield-based apps and products. As Cryptopolitan reported , the BIS has been critical of stablecoins in the past, alongside a generally negative stance on crypto. “ These practices may blur the lines between payment instruments and investment products. They may compete with bank deposits but are often provided without equivalent prudential oversight, deposit insurance and transparency, exposing users to consumer protection gaps and losses,” warned BIS in a recent analysis. Stablecoins quickly expanded to a total supply of 305.9B tokens, split between general payment assets and specialized tokens linked to yield-based products. The stablecoins are held in 42.1M addresses, up 4% in the past month. BIS warns against conflicts of interest for stablecoins and lending services The BIS warned that the popularity of stablecoins can trigger conflicts of interest with traditional banks. Additionally, yield-bearing and lending apps can create conflicts of interest. The space is still unregulated when it comes to yield, despite the existing framework for stablecoin backing. The BIS even called for additional regulations for decentralized crypto asset service providers (CASPs), which provide yields. For now, there are no specific restrictions against decentralized yield and lending protocols, and no protections for retail users. One of the sources of conflict is the relatively higher savings rates for some stablecoins, which vastly exceed banking deposit rates for US customers. However, the BIS warned that those yield-bearing products were entirely unregulated and had no safety mechanisms for depositors. “ Yield-bearing products that mimic savings accounts can expose users to potential losses and adverse contractual outcomes, such as being treated as unsecured creditors, if the intermediary were to fail,” explained BIS in its recent report . Some stablecoin protocols tap the yield from US T-Bills, either directly or through tokenized products like BUIDL. Unlike banks, the protocols are sharing more of their yields with users. There are exceptions like USDT, which mostly retains the interest on its T-Bills. Aggressive yields depend on protocols, not stablecoins Stablecoins are accepted by multiple protocols, and the final yield depends on those decentralized apps. Even regulated stablecoins like USDC have ended up in high-yield vaults or protocols. Stablecoins expanded their total supply, while yield opportunities increased, with additional incentives coming from airdrop farming. Total stablecoin supply is above 305B tokens. | Source: Artemis Most of the liquidity is currently stored on Aave, Morpho, Maple Finance, and Sky Protocol. However, there is a long tail of smaller yield products, with APY above 100% or as high as 1,000%. Most traders still avoid those protocols for their unrealistic, unsustainable yields. More commonly, yields on popular protocols range between 4% and 7%. Even those offers are more appealing compared to bank deposits. Yield from stablecoins often has additional incentives, such as airdrop farming. For the past year, more users have chosen to farm new tokens, rather than trade riskier and more volatile crypto assets.

Crypto has a tendency to change, and perhaps the next magic moment is still ahead. Investors have begun looking at projects under the $1 mark, based on novelty and interesting features. The three prominent tokens to this day are Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Kaspa (KAS), and Algorand (ALGO). Each of these occupies its own market segment: early viral presale, leading-edge new blockchain design, and eco-friendly Layer-1 protocol innovation. When these two factors are combined in one stock, they become the ideal ‘penny stocks’ to add to a portfolio under $1. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the presale powerhouse with viral momentum Little Pepe has quickly established itself as one of the most talked-about new tokens on the market. The token recently concluded Stage 13 of its presale, raising over $27.1 million at a price of just $0.0022. Before the token’s listing on major exchanges, investors are rushing to acquire it. Early signs suggest significant potential for this token, comparable to that of Pepe and Shiba Inu. The project also prioritizes fairness and transparency, with zero buy/sell taxes, anti-sniper bot protections, and a completed Certik audit, all of which have helped strengthen investor trust. What sets Little Pepe apart is its timing. With its presale nearing completion, investors who enter now can capture the early-stage growth phase before exchange listings drive prices higher. Analysts expect a potential 20- to 50-fold rally in the months following the launch if community engagement continues at its current rate. For those seeking a new meme-to-mainstream success story, Little Pepe stands as the top candidate under $1. Kaspa (KAS): fast-growing blockchain with technical depth Kaspa has become one of the fastest blockchain networks, while the price has managed to stay below the $0.10 mark. The BlockDAG technology at the core of everything Kaspa does enables it to create multiple blocks simultaneously. It achieves a previously unattainable scale and speed of transaction processing, and a degree of decentralization that few other networks can match. The project has gained popularity among programmers and institutions interested in building an efficient blockchain infrastructure, as Kaspa’s technological approach aims to address the issues of technical scalability and network throughput, which have increasingly affected older blockchains, without compromising security in the process. With a price of $0.05 and how quickly Kaspa is taking the crypto world by storm, Kaspa will likely be in the $0.50 to $1.00 range during the next bull cycle. Algorand (ALGO): a layer-1 that sustains and the real world adopts. Algorand is one of the few blockchains that offer near-instant settlement, extremely low fees, and a significantly lower environmental impact compared to others. Besides its technical benefits, Algorand is utilized in various areas, including tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and government-level digital systems. Real-world applications, such as smart contract programming languages and stablecoin projects, demonstrate that it can be both fast and eco-friendly. Despite achieving all of this, the token trades at around $0.18, allowing new investors to enter a top 20 project for a fraction of the all-time high. Analysts predict that ALGO will double or triple in value during the next bull market, particularly with the increasing adoption by institutional investors. Conclusion Although Dogecoin is likely to maintain its cultural significance, the substantial upside potential it once had may have already passed, leading investors to seek the next promising early-stage opportunity. Little Pepe, Kaspa, and Algorand are looking to fill that gap. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) offers early-stage speculative returns with meme energy and real blockchain utility. At the same time, Kaspa (KAS) is technically revolutionary with a scalable BlockDAG architecture and a rapidly growing developer community. Algorand (ALGO) is a sustainable Layer-1 network, and we have a strong track record of utility. Together, they create a diversified mix of speculative and structured opportunities all priced under $1. For investors looking to follow up their Dogecoin success with a new generation of high-potential projects, this trio might just define the next wave of crypto’s breakout stars.

These findings mark the first time Meta has been formally accused under the DSA. The investigation reveals that both platforms failed to provide adequate access to public data for researchers, hindering efforts to assess their impact on public health and safety. Additionally, Meta is accused of implementing deceptive design practices, known as “dark patterns,” that make it difficult for users to report illegal content. These practices contravene the DSA’s requirements for straightforward “Notice and Action” processes. In response, a Meta spokesperson contested the claims, stating that the company had already implemented changes aligned with DSA standards. The EU urges tech firms to comply with the regulations set The EU has established several regulations to govern large tech companies. An example is the Digital Services Act, which limits the influence of these tech giants. Sources have also discovered that the EU’s executive branch has been initiating multiple investigations under another significant law, the Digital Markets Act . Regarding the commission’s allegations against Meta, individuals in the tech ecosystem have raised heated debates. To address these concerns, Ben Walters, a spokesperson for the tech company, stated that they disagree with any claims filed against them regarding the alleged violation of the DSA. He further pointed out the company’s efforts to find a common ground on the situation as they were still negotiating with the European Commission on these issues. When reporters asked Walters to comment on their operation, the representative stated that since the introduction of the DSA in the European Union, they have made several adjustments to their content reporting options, appeals process, and tools for data access. Therefore, with these changes in place, Walters believes that Meta meets the law’s requirements. TikTok declined to comment on a request from reporters. Still, the EU emphasized that it is important for researchers to access information from social media platforms. This enables the public to examine any tech-related physical or mental health impacts. TikTok finds itself in trouble again with the EU In preliminary findings, the commission noted that Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok may have implemented complex procedures and tools that hindered researchers from seeking public data. As a result, researchers regularly end up with incomplete or unreliable data, making it hard for them to study whether users, including young people, are exposed to illegal or harmful content. To tackle this issue, the Commission has called on these tech firms to review its findings and reply in writing. Suppose the Commission’s initial findings are correct, it can make a non-compliance decision, which could ultimately lead to a fine of up to 6% of their total yearly revenue globally. This is a significant amount for Meta and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. In the meantime, Ireland’s privacy regulator earlier imposed a substantial fine of about €530 million, equivalent to around $601.3 million, on TikTok. This was after they alleged that the tech company had transferred users’ data in the EU to China. According to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which oversees TikTok’s privacy matters in the EU, TikTok violated the GDPR data protection law by sending European user data to China. To serve as an example to other tech firms with similar intentions to TikTok, the regulator ordered the tech company to ensure its data processing meets the rules within six months. It also mentioned its intentions to stop TikTok from sending data to China if it does not adhere to the rules set at that time.

Here's Why!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/famous-exchange-ceo-announces-the-long-expected-altcoin-season-will-not-come-heres-why/,"Bitcoin hit new ATHs as it raced from record to record throughout 2025. However, the same wasn't true for altcoins. While some altcoins like Ethereum and BNB broke their previous records and reached new ATH2, most altcoins still haven't experienced an explosive rally. Altcoin Season Will Not Come! While expectations for the start of the major altcoin season continue despite all the negativities, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen made statements that would upset investors. Accordingly, Bitget CEO claimed that the expected altcoin season will not start this year or next year. “Altcoin season won't even come in 2025 or 2026.” Stating that investments in web3 projects have decreased significantly recently, the famous CEO said that this situation, coupled with the harsh corrections, has increased the risk of investing in altcoins. “Since last year, venture capital (VC) firms started to withdraw from investing in web3 projects, and this year this trend has become much more clear. The sharp crash on October 11th also dealt a fatal blow to altcoins, and they suffered serious damage. The situation worsened as the collapse and investments in web3 projects dried up. For these reasons, the risk-reward ratio that individual investors must accept in altcoin trading has now reached very low levels. Stating that the market needs time to recover, Chen said, “now is not the time to sell or buy.” Bitcoin (BTC) is Preferred! Stating that market peaks come not from fear but from extreme greed, the famous CEO said: “Some family offices are taking steps to allocate 5% to 20% of their assets to Bitcoin (BTC), and in the current climate, this is a reasonable assessment. Since October 11th, the market is still in recovery. Weekly trading volumes on major exchanges have decreased by 20-40%, and some major market makers have been liquidated due to increased leverage. The current market is in a state of doubt. The idea of making a lot of money in the short term should be abandoned, as staying in the market is paramount. *This is not investment advice.

Behind the headline is a bigger play: Coinbase doesn’t just want to be the place where people trade crypto — it wants to control the financial infrastructure of Web3 itself. With Echo, Coinbase isn’t buying hype. It’s buying infrastructure, distribution, and future market power. Coinbase Wants to Own the Next Financial Rails Echo’s technology makes it possible for startups and institutions to raise capital directly on-chain — issuing tokens, distributing them to global investors, and managing compliance in a streamlined system. That’s not just a feature. That’s a financial railway. If Coinbase controls it, here’s what it could dominate next: On-chain IPO-style launches Tokenized securities and fundraising rounds Global retail access to private markets A new issuing layer on top of Base and Coinbase Prime In other words: not just trading after assets exist — but controlling where they begin. For a company already pushing Base, USDC, and institutional custody, Echo plugs directly into a much larger puzzle. If Coinbase owns the rails for raising money, issuing tokens, and listing them — does that make it the Nasdaq of Web3? A lot of signals say that’s the plan. Analysts already estimate the tokenization market could surpass $10 trillion by 2030, and Coinbase clearly wants a front-row seat before Wall Street gets there. Echo gives Coinbase something most exchanges don’t have: upstream control of capital formation. If it succeeds, Coinbase won’t just compete in Web3 — it could own the terrain everyone else has to build on. And that’s why this deal matters.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-24 13:49:54

Yet despite the modest rebound, analysts are raising concerns over a new risk that’s far bigger than macro cycles or regulation: quantum computing. Crypto analyst Charles Edwards warns that unless Bitcoin upgrades its cryptography soon, possibly within a year, the network could face its worst bear market in history. Speaking at Token 2049, Edwards highlighted two rising threats: Growing exposure of corporate treasuries to digital assets. Accelerating progress in quantum computing that could compromise blockchain security itself. How Quantum Computing Could Break BTC Bitcoin relies on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to secure transactions and wallet ownership. Quantum computers could theoretically crack ECC using algorithms that can compute private keys from public ones, effectively unlocking BTC wallets in minutes. Research cited by Edwards suggests that roughly 2,300 logical qubits could break Bitcoin’s encryption, a milestone that might be reached within 2–8 years. McKinsey’s projections place the arrival of “Q-Day”—when quantum computers surpass traditional encryption, within the next decade. Key developments fueling the concern include: Global Race: Tech giants such as Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Meta are scaling quantum systems. Government Investment: China leads global spending, with more than $55 billion allocated to quantum initiatives—about double the U.S. total. Early Vulnerability: Bitcoin’s ECC is weaker than RSA, meaning it could be compromised even sooner. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin estimates a 20% chance that quantum computers could disrupt cryptographic networks by 2030, underscoring the urgency of transitioning to quantum-secure wallets. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Levels Ahead Technically, BTC/USD is consolidating between $107,000 and $114,000, forming a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, a structure that often precedes strong breakouts. The 20-EMA and 50-EMA are flattening, suggesting a tightening of momentum, while the RSI near 60 indicates mild bullish bias. A break above $114,100 with volume could lift BTC toward $115,900–$120,000. A fall below $111,000 may expose $109,000 and $107,000 as key downside supports. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum remains balanced, but traders are cautious as broader sentiment hinges on whether the crypto industry can navigate the quantum dilemma before it becomes a market-wide risk. In Edwards’ words : “I used to think future Bitcoin bear markets would have smaller drawdowns. But if we don’t solve quantum next year, we’ll probably face the biggest one ever.” I used to think future Bitcoin bear markets would have a lower drawdowns. But if we don't solve on Quantum next year, we probably get the biggest bear market ever. — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) October 22, 2025 Whether BTC breaks out technically, or breaks down fundamentally, will depend on how fast developers act before the quantum clock runs out. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $24.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013165 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture linked to the Trump family, sold part of its locked token holdings to Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 for inclusion in the latter’s long-term crypto reserve. Though WLFI didn’t specify the amount, on-chain data suggests about 100 million tokens were sold at $0.25 each, totaling roughly $25 million. WLFI recently sold tokens at $0.25 to Hut8 for their treasury. The locked tokens sent from the WLFI treasury were simply to satisfy that sale — not new issuance, not dilution. We appreciate Hut8’s support as a long-term partner. 🦅 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) October 3, 2025 Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price up today? Sellers failed to maintain their dominance, resulting in an upward push toward $0.14. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction October 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in October month. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.15 and a maximum price of $0.3, with an average of $0.2 in October.

South Korea’s Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan admitted Friday that the split is still “sharp,” warning there may be no agreement in time for the summit. And yeah, this standoff could screw up tariff cuts that were promised months ago. Kim returned early Friday morning from Washington after a second round of trade talks in less than a week, this time with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “From our perspective, we believe the amount should be smaller, while the U.S. maintains that it needs to be larger,” Kim said, pointing to the part of the deal that actually involves real cash, not just pledges or paper promises. He was joined in D.C. by Policy Chief Kim Yong-beom, who said both governments still have a “long way to go” before anything gets signed. South Korean tariffs remain frozen at 25% The delay means 25% tariffs on Korean cars and auto parts are still in place, instead of dropping to 15% as agreed back in July. Meanwhile, Japan got its deal finalized in September, which now gives Tokyo-based automakers a big price edge over Korean rivals in the U.S. market. Seoul clearly doesn’t want to get bullied into accepting the same profit terms Japan signed onto, especially when the cash burden could punch a hole through its currency reserves. And the numbers being thrown around aren’t small. According to Chosun Ilbo, Washington wants an average of $25 billion a year for eight years, but Seoul insists it can’t go above $15 billion annually. That’s a $10 billion per-year gap. And the Bank of Korea isn’t happy either. It has warned that $20 billion per year is already the upper limit if they don’t want to mess with the won’s stability. Anything higher than that, and they’re risking major shocks to the Korean financial system. Finance Minister Koo Yun Cheol said this week that the two countries are still hammering out the structure of the package, not discussing a currency swap. But that’s odd, because last month Prime Minister Kim Min-seok told Bloomberg that without one, the deal would be a disaster for the Korean economy. It’s unclear why the swap idea was shelved or who killed it. The U.S. is also demanding a 90% cut of the profits once the initial capital is recovered, echoing the deal they already locked in with Japan. Kim Jung-kwan admitted “we haven’t set a time limit yet,” but said they’re “doing our best to uphold our position until the end.” He wouldn’t confirm the $25 billion figure, but said profit-sharing was definitely part of the conversation.

Bull Run Predictions Catch Attention",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-solana-price-at-1000/,"Crypto analyst Remi has made his bull run predictions for coins like XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Despite the price targets being ambitious, the analyst described them as “semi-conservative,” suggesting the coins could rally much higher. XRP And Solana To $1,000, And Cardano To $100 In an X post, Remi predicted that XRP and Solana will rally above $1,000 while Cardano will reach $100. He stated that these price targets are based on information, research, and historical performance. The analyst also made predictions for HBAR, XLM, ONDO, LINK, XDC, and QNT, all of which he expects to record astronomical gains. Related Reading: Technical Analysis Suggests XRP’s Playbook From 2017 Could Repeat In 2025 Interestingly, the analyst stated that these were semi-conservative targets for XRP, Solana, and Cardano and that he personally thinks they could rally higher. He added that these targets might not even come close to his expectations and that they are simply based on utility and a super cycle without any black swan events. Remi also advised investors not to make the same mistake he made during his first bull run by leaving profits on the table in hopes that coins like XRP, Solana, and Cardano will go higher. He told them not to be greedy and take profits at different intervals. The analyst added that they should not wait for the high numbers because they might not happen for various reasons. Furthermore, the crypto analyst advised investors on custody, urging them to secure their XRP, Solana, and Cardano in a cold wallet. He explained that crypto exchanges are “in it to win it” and are not here for the customers. Meanwhile, the analyst didn’t mention what utility could spark these runs for these coins. However, it is worth noting that XRP, Solana, and Cardano are all set to have their spot ETFs, although it remains to be seen how high these coins could reach on the back of these institutional inflows. Why the Price Targets Are Not “Crazy” Remi admitted that the price targets for XRP, Solana, and Cardano may seem crazy, but assured that they are not. He explained that the market cycle is now 5 years instead of 4, indicating that “huge numbers are coming.” He noted that these big numbers will coincide with the voting season. Related Reading: Solana Price At Risk Of 50% Crash To $104 After Forming This Larger Bearish Trend This is why he thinks there will be a super cycle that runs into the fourth quarter of next year. He told XRP, Solana, and Cardano holders to be mindful of the winter Olympics next year, in February, warning that any major attack during the event would disrupt the cycle. As such, he remarked that it may be wise to take a little profit early on before the event. Notably, experts like Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan have also stated that the four-year cycle is likely over, predicting that the bull run could extend.

The bank now believes Coinbase’s Base network could represent a $34 billion opportunity, calling the Layer-2 ecosystem a potential breakout revenue machine for the company. This marks one of the strongest signals yet that Wall Street is finally taking Web3 infrastructure seriously, not just crypto prices. Base: The “Hidden Engine” Behind Coinbase’s Future According to JPMorgan’s note, Base could become a massive fee-driven ecosystem, earning revenue from: on-chain transactions, developer activity, DeFi and app expansion, and future tokenized markets. In other words, Coinbase could profit even when markets are flat, as long as Base keeps growing. JPMorgan’s thesis centers on one core belief: Web3 will reward the platforms that own the rails, not just the traffic. Base, as a Coinbase-controlled Layer-2, puts the company in a position to earn recurring fees from every transaction, every app, and every on-chain product built inside its ecosystem. Unlike Coinbase’s exchange business — which rises and falls with market cycles — Base represents ongoing, compounding network revenue . And in an environment where developers are fleeing expensive Layer-1 chains for cheaper alternatives, Base’s low-cost model gives Coinbase a powerful competitive edge. If Coinbase moves from “exchange revenue” to “infrastructure revenue,” its business becomes: more scalable, more predictable, and much more valuable. And that’s exactly what JPMorgan is betting on.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-24 14:03:21

Nel primo piano c’è un obiettivo chiaro, cioè portare la scalabilità a livelli modello Solana e superare il collo di bottiglia dei famosi 7 TPS, che oggi creano code, tempi di conferma lunghi e pagamenti che in ore di punta diventano frustranti per chiunque. Nelle discussioni sulla presale, molti la citano tra le migliori crypto presale , complice la narrativa “upgrade di Bitcoin” che di solito accende l’immaginario degli investitori e porta capitali freschi; a Q4 l’interesse è alto e il clima di mercato tende al bullish . Vai a Bitcoin Hyper Perché serve un Layer-2 veloce Quando la rete è affollata, la priorità a chi paga più commissioni lascia in coda micro-pagamenti e transazioni economiche, con un effetto a catena che tiene lontani nuovi utenti e rallenta builders e aziende che chiedono finalità più prevedibili. I numeri dell’ ecosystem non aiutano, perché nel 2025 la maggiore attività degli sviluppatori è su Ethereum e poi su Solana, mentre Bitcoin arranca, segno che i limiti di TPS frenano idee e applicazioni che vorrebbero girare senza colli di bottiglia. Soluzioni esistenti hanno provato a mettere una pezza; Lightning ha sofferto tra bug, routing complicato e canali sbilanciati, altre Layer-2 hanno stretto troppo sulla centralizzazione o chiesto ai miner compromessi difficili, quindi lo spazio per innovare c’è eccome. Cosa promette Bitcoin Hyper, in pratica Bitcoin Hyper dichiara un’architettura che combina SVM e Canonical Bridge per avvicinare la capacità di produzione di Solana al mondo Bitcoin, con esecuzione rapida degli smart contract e trasferimenti che mirano a svolgersi in secondi, non minuti, e costi più bassi e prevedibili. La SVM ha già dimostrato prestazioni elevate in ambienti dove la concorrenza delle transazioni è intensa, e qui punta a sbloccare applicazioni DeFi, gaming e pagamenti veloci, dove serve capacità di calcolo parallela e una latenza ridotta fin dal primo click. Il Canonical Bridge dovrebbe connettere Hyper e Layer-1, “wrappando” i bitcoin sulla rete Hyper dopo la conferma nel Relay Program ; i token restano utilizzabili nell’ecosistema finché non si decide di rientrare, superando l’attuale fee-based priority che frena l’uso. Perché stanno entrando i capitali L’idea di eliminare le code tramite capacità e finalità quasi istantanea piace sia ai piccoli sia agli istituzionali, poiché riduce l’ansia del price discovery nei picchi di rete e permette user experience più lineare, elemento chiave per l’adozione quotidiana. I flussi della presale mostrano acquisti pesanti, con whales da 379.900, 274.000 e 180.600 dollari, oltre a movimenti più piccoli come 11.300 dollari; segnali che fanno pensare a fiducia nell’esecuzione tecnica e nella possibilità di costruire liquidità in tempi brevi. Al momento i token si comprano a 0,013155 dollari, con staking dinamico al 48% che attrae chi ama rendite immediate, sebbene il rendimento scenda quando gli staker aumentano; gli step di prezzo in presale tendono a salire col passare delle waves . Tempistiche, narrativa e rischi La finestra di uscita è tra Q4 2025 e Q1 2026, quindi c’è tempo per test, audit e partnerships ; se il mercato resta bullish , la story di “Bitcoin che scala” può restare centrale, ma l’esecuzione dovrà essere impeccabile e le go-live progressive. Il team promette scalabilità e riduzione drastica dei tempi, tuttavia le lezioni passate di Lightning insegnano che instradamento, sicurezza dei bridge e UX dei wallet fanno la differenza; servono strumenti semplici e documentazione chiara per non perdere la spinta iniziale. Se l’integrazione con builders e exchanges arriverà in fretta, Hyper può diventare terreno fertile per app ad alta intensità di traffico, dove la stabilità del TPS conta più del picco massimo, e dove fees stabili aiutano a pianificare modelli di business. Scenario di prezzo e prospettive C’è chi immagina un rally post-lancio, dopo la classica fase di “cash-in” iniziale, con obiettivi a 1,50 dollari entro il 2030 e ritorni teorici nell’ordine dell’11.302%, calcolati sul prezzo attuale; ipotesi ottimistiche che dipendono da execution e contesto macro. Il sentiment di novembre tende al bullish e aiuta la narrativa della presale, ma resta fondamentale la gestione dei rilasci e l’arrivo di casi d’uso reali; senza traction concreta, il mercato ricalibra in fretta, e la community chiede progressi misurabili. Per ora la storia regge su tre pilastri: tecnologia riconoscibile, ponte con Layer-1 e focus su commissioni basse e finalità rapide, perché gli utenti vogliono pagare in pochi secondi e gli sviluppatori vogliono costruire senza temere colli di bottiglia.

They Are Repositioning for What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/researcher-on-xrp-etf-they-didnt-delay-the-launch-they-are-repositioning-for-whats-coming/,"The cryptocurrency market rarely moves by accident. When key events shift on the calendar, especially those involving exchange-traded funds (ETFs), it often signals more than an administrative delay. Analysts now believe the recent postponement of the Themes Crypto ETF to November 6, 2025 , is not random but a calculated move. Rather than a setback, it appears to be a strategic repositioning for a moment of significant regulatory clarity that could redefine the digital asset landscape, especially for XRP. Timing, Not Hesitation ETF launches follow strict regulatory calendars tied to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) review periods. While some observers interpreted the Themes ETF pushback as indecision, others see it as deliberate timing. The SEC’s evolving framework for altcoin-based ETFs has already forced multiple issuers to extend their review cycles. Rather than rushing into an uncertain regulatory environment, major players appear to be synchronizing their product rollouts with what many anticipate will be the final phase of crypto policy alignment in the United States. They didn’t “delay” the ETF launch — they timed it. November 6, 2025 isn’t random. That’s when the real clarity hits. They know what’s coming… and they’re positioning around $XRP . This isn’t a delay — it’s a setup. pic.twitter.com/dCgT9q3BLd — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 24, 2025 The significance of the November window cannot be overstated. It coincides with the expected conclusion of several SEC review extensions and policy consultations on how altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Ethereum fit within the new exchange-traded product framework. In short, the so-called “delay” may actually be a signal that institutions are bracing for regulatory clearance, not avoiding it. Ripple Bull Winkle’s Strategic Observation In a video shared on X, researcher Ripple Bull Winkle challenged the notion that the ETF timeline shift was random. He argued that the move was purposeful and deeply tied to the upcoming regulatory environment. “Was this planned from the start? The Themes ETF just delayed its crypto ETF rollout until November 6th,” Bull Winkle said. “If you ask me, it’s not random; that is very strategic because, think about when the regulatory clarity clock runs out. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana — they already told you which ones that day are setting up for. So why delay unless you already know what’s coming?” His remarks suggest coordination across issuers, regulators, and liquidity providers, implying that market insiders are positioning around the expected regulatory green light. As he noted, “This isn’t speculation anymore, it is all about timing.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why November 6 Could Be Pivotal for XRP The date November 6, 2025, now looms large in the crypto industry. It aligns with the anticipated release of SEC updates on altcoin classifications and the conclusion of pending ETF reviews. Should the Commission finalize its stance by then, tokens like XRP, already classified as not a security by the courts , would be positioned for rapid institutional integration. Market analysts suggest that XRP’s inclusion in an approved ETF could dramatically enhance liquidity and adoption. The timing would also coincide with broader infrastructure improvements across custody solutions and crypto-tracking indexes, potentially paving the way for mainstream portfolio exposure. Coordinated Setup, Not a Delay Ripple Bull Winkle’s analysis reframes the narrative: what many call a “delay” may actually be a setup. The coordinated timing hints that major market participants are aligning their strategies to a pre-determined moment when regulatory uncertainty clears. In essence, the wait may not be about readiness; it may be about precision. If correct, November could mark a new phase in the institutionalization of crypto, with XRP positioned at the forefront of that evolution . As Bull Winkle succinctly put it, “They know what’s coming, and they’re positioning around XRP. This isn’t a delay, it’s a setup.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The altcoin now has regulated exposure to a network with over $5.8 trillion in assets under management, joining Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin with a new touch point for adoption at the institutional level.

Solana Price Prediction: Institutions Could Drive $1000 SOL A small share of Fidelity’s multi-trillion-dollar market could give Solana the push it needs to break free from its 7-month ascending channel. The altcoin continues to form higher lows along the lower channel support, in line with the $175 demand zone. This creates a strong confluence of support and a potential launchpad setup for the next breakout attempt, particularly as momentum indicators lean bullish. The RSI is climbing back toward neutral, signaling renewed buy pressure, while the MACD edges toward a golden cross above the signal line—both early signs of a fresh Solana price uptrend. The $300 level remains the critical breakout threshold. A flip of that resistance into support could open the door to new price discovery, with targets around $500 for a potential 160% gain. Still, as Solana enters mainstream corporate balance sheets and institutional exposure deepens through spot ETF, the rally could extend another 425%, propelling SOL toward $1,000. Snorter Bot: This Tool Opens Access to Solana’s Strongest Plays When Solana starts moving, its native meme coins don’t just follow — they often go parabolic. Snorter ($SNORT) is quickly becoming the go-to tool for traders aiming to capitalize on the sharpest plays within Solana’s high-volatility ecosystem. Snorter Bot equips users with a complete competitive edge: limit-order sniping for perfect entries, MEV-resistant swaps that outsmart frontrunners, copy trading that mirrors top performers, and rug-pull protection that filters out scams before you commit.

Dynamic Airdrop Conversion: Time as a Variable Most airdrops that end once tokens are claimed, River’s Dynamic Airdrop Conversion begins at that moment. The mechanism introduces time-encoded tokenomics — allowing users to convert River Pts (ERC-20) into $RIVER at any time within 180 days after TGE. River Pts , the ecosystem points in ERC-20 format, have risen 40x since launch, reflecting growing market awareness of the arbitrage strategies between River Pts, $RIVER, and perpetual futures.

This continuous process turns the airdrop into a live market, where users can either hold River Pts for higher future conversion or lock in profits by shorting $RIVER perpetuals, creating a natural balance between liquidity and time-based appreciation. Conversion Example — 1M River Pts The conversion curve shows how time relates to the amount of tokens a user receives.

Based on reports, the token is down 45% year-to-date and 15% over the last 30 days. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions The memecoin’s price action has left holders wondering when — or if — a strong rebound will arrive. Volume and price swings have cooled, and market mood is leaning toward fear with the Fear & Greed Index at 30. Analyst Forecasts Late Surge According to MMB Trader, the stretch of quiet price action is not the end story for SHIB. He described the token as a “dead and sleeping coin” that often surprises late in a cycle. The key level to watch, he said, sits near $0.00001740. That line traces back to a trend that began after the March 2024 peak of $0.00004567. If SHIB breaks above that trendline and then holds it on a retest, the trader argued, the price structure would shift toward bullish. Three Breakout Targets Reports have disclosed three specific upside targets tied to that scenario. The first target is $0.00003364 — a rise of 235% from the current price of $0.00001003. The next target is $0.000055480, which would represent about 450% growth from today’s level. The most ambitious point in this view is $0.00007730, equal to roughly a 670% gain. Some analysts have a similar upside figure, calling for a move to $0.000081 if a sustained breakout happens. Mixed Signals From Models And Indicators Other forecasts are more modest. Based on CoinCodex data, SHIB is expected to reach $0.00001183 by November 23, 2025, a rise of 16% from the current price. Technical indicators in some services are showing Bearish sentiment now. Over the last 30 days SHIB posted 16/30 green days, or 53%, with price volatility around 8.91%. These details show activity is present, but it has not yet produced a clear directional push. Risk And Market Context Trading this token remains risky. Millions of holders are exposed while the market waits for a clear catalyst. A breakout above the trendline would likely be followed by a retest, which traders often use to confirm whether the move has real strength. If the retest fails, the price could fall back into its prior range. That scenario is as possible as a breakout, given the current low volatility and reduced volume. Related Reading: ‘Unthinkable Scenario’ Required For Bitcoin To Hit $250K, CEO Says Possible Rebound Based on reports and analyst calls, a late and rapid recovery for Shiba Inu is possible, but far from certain. The market is split between cautious models that predict single-digit gains and chart-based calls that map out several hundred percent rallies. For now, the trendline near $0.00001740 will be watched closely, and any decisive move above it would change the outlook quickly.

Two Altcoins That Couldn't Get Along Finally Found a Solution! A $120 Million Deal Reached!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-grand-alliance-was-broken-two-altcoins-that-couldnt-get-along-finally-found-a-solution-a-120-million-deal-reached/,"As you may recall, in the first days of October, the Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Foundation announced its withdrawal from the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI), which it formed together with Fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX). Following this news of the split, the price of ASI dropped by double digits. Following the collapse of the trilateral alliance, a dispute arose between Fetch.ai and the Ocean Protocol Foundation. However, the duo decided to resolve their ongoing token disputes without going to court and reached an agreement. Accordingly, the agreement in question includes the return of 286 million Fetch.ai (FET) tokens worth approximately $120 million. What happened? Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh said on Thursday that his team would cease all legal action if Ocean Protocol returned the 286 million FET tokens allegedly sold during the merger. “They are waiting for a legal offer from us to return the tokens. You can receive my letter tomorrow. The offer is simple: Give the tokens back to my community. I will waive any legal claims. GeoStaking, a validator node affiliated with Fetch.ai, reportedly mediated the talks, and Ocean Protocol agreed to the rollback after a formal proposal was submitted. The agreement will allow both parties to resolve their disputes without the need for lengthy litigation that could damage their reputations and finances. Additionally, the agreement will enable both projects to focus on collaboration and innovation in the field of decentralized artificial intelligence and Web3. How Did the Dispute Begin? Founded in March 2024, ASI aimed to unify the Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol ecosystems under a single, unified AI token. This process involved converting AGIX and OCEAN tokens into Fetch.ai's FET token at fixed rates, after which FET was rebranded as ASI. Because no new smart contract was created, most exchanges and data platforms still list the token with the ticker symbol FET. However, Ocean Protocol announced its withdrawal from the trilateral alliance. The dispute between Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol began after Fetch.ai accused Ocean Protocol of converting 661 million OCEAN tokens into 286 million FET tokens through a multi-signature wallet affiliated with the project. Ocean Protocol founder Bruce Pon denied the allegations, stating that the recent drop in the FET price had nothing to do with Ocean's exit from the ASI Alliance, which was formed by the merger of Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET. *This is not investment advice.

The surge was driven by growing market attention on River’s Dynamic Airdrop Conversion , the first time-encoded tokenomics mechanism that connects conversion behavior to time-based value. Dynamic Airdrop Conversion: Time as a Variable Most airdrops that end once tokens are claimed, River’s Dynamic Airdrop Conversion begins at that moment. The mechanism introduces time-encoded tokenomics — allowing users to convert River Pts (ERC-20) into $RIVER at any time within 180 days after TGE. River Pts , the ecosystem points in ERC-20 format, have risen 40x since launch, reflecting growing market awareness of the arbitrage strategies between River Pts, $RIVER, and perpetual futures. In practice, River Pts function like a call option on $RIVER — their value rises as the conversion ratio improves. This continuous process turns the airdrop into a live market, where users can either hold River Pts for higher future conversion or lock in profits by shorting $RIVER perpetuals, creating a natural balance between liquidity and time-based appreciation. Conversion Example — 1M River Pts The conversion curve shows how time relates to the amount of tokens a user receives. Holding 1M River Pts from Day 1 to Day 180 can result in up to a 270x difference in $RIVER output, depending on when conversion occurs. This structure lets users see how time directly changes the value they receive — prices move with market behavior, not fixed unlocks. Dynamic Airdrop Conversion : https://app.river.inc/airdrop Market Dynamics $RIVER Perps listed on Binance, Bybit, Bitget, KuCoin, and Gate $100M+ total trading volume in 24 hours. 80K addresses and 40K X accounts eligible for River airdrop. The Season 3 airdrop continues post-TGE — users can earn River Pts by using stablecoin, tweeting, or joining ecosystem campaigns. The River Pts–$RIVER mechanism has generated notable community interest, with discussions centering on the interplay between timing, conversion rates, and potential arbitrage opportunities. Participants are analyzing different strategies, including when to convert and how perpetual contracts may be used for hedging. Others are engaging with Season 3 as a method of accumulating River Points. Why It Matters Dynamic Airdrop Conversion reframes token distribution as a market mechanism rather than a release schedule. It establishes a measurable interplay between time, behavior, and liquidity, and each user decision directly influences price formation and supply dynamics. The approach represents a shift in tokenomics toward a more open and adaptive structure, where participation dynamics influence outcomes rather than predefined parameters. Within the community, some view this as a significant development—comparable to the introduction of automated market makers (AMMs)—in that it introduces a time-encoded framework where value is shaped by user activity and market behavior.

Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh said on Thursday that his company will drop all legal claims against Ocean Protocol if the latter agrees to return 286 million FET tokens, worth about $120 million at the time of the alleged transfer, to the Fetch community. Peace or Persistence? Will Ocean Return the Tokens and End the Feud? The announcement came during an X Spaces session, where Sheikh described the offer as a final attempt to settle the matter without a lengthy legal battle. “They are expecting a legal proposal from us for the return of the tokens,” Sheikh said. “You can have my letter tomorrow. The offer is simple: give my community back the tokens. I will drop every legal claim.” Tune in live today at 20:00 UTC to an open conversation with https://t.co/kJ9URVqmjT CEO – Humayun Sheikh as we openly discuss Ocean's response and claims. https://t.co/hKfrCBIKjC — Fetch.ai (@Fetch_ai) October 23, 2025 He added that Fetch.ai would cover any associated legal costs if the tokens are returned, calling the move “an effort to protect the community and move forward.” GeoStaking, a Fetch.ai validator node that helped mediate the discussions, confirmed that Ocean Protocol is willing to return the tokens once a formal written proposal is submitted. The proposal could be finalized as early as Friday, potentially putting an end to months of escalating tensions. The dispute stems from Fetch.ai’s accusation that an Ocean Protocol-linked multisignature wallet converted 661 million OCEAN tokens into 286 million FET tokens and later transferred a large portion of them to centralized exchanges. Source: Bubblemaps Blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps reported that around 160 million FET were sent to Binance and another 109 million to GSR Markets, totaling roughly $120 million in transactions. Ocean Protocol denied any misappropriation, calling the claims misleading and insisting that all token conversions were carried out transparently under its treasury management policies. The foundation withdrew from the Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance on October 9, citing governance disagreements and legal constraints. The withdrawal statement confirmed the exit but did not address the disputed transfers. What Went Wrong in the ASI Alliance? Fetch.ai and Ocean’s Feud Test AI Token Unity The ASI Alliance, formed in 2024 , merged Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET under a unified token framework using FET as the central asset. The collaboration was intended to advance decentralized artificial intelligence infrastructure by combining their respective data, compute, and model-sharing technologies. Tensions, however, escalated in mid-2025 after Fetch.ai alleged that Ocean Protocol minted additional OCEAN tokens prior to the merger and later converted them into FET without proper disclosure. Sheikh claimed that the transferred tokens were meant for “community incentives” but were instead distributed across multiple wallets and sold through exchanges. On October 21, Sheikh offered a $250,000 bounty for information about the signatories of the OceanDAO multisignature wallet and their connection to the Ocean Protocol Foundation. I’m offering a $250k reward to anyone who can uncover the OceanDAO signatories and their connections to Ocean Foundation ! https://t.co/PmGBtou9vI — Humayun (@HMsheikh4) October 21, 2025 He also threatened to fund class-action lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions , urging affected holders to gather evidence of potential losses. Ocean Protocol responded in a public statement denying all allegations and asserting that its treasury “remains intact.” The foundation confirmed that the dispute had entered formal arbitration under the ASI merger framework and claimed that it had offered to waive confidentiality to ensure transparency. The offer, Ocean said, was declined by Fetch.ai. FET Token Down 93% as Fetch.ai–Ocean Rift Shakes AI Blockchain Sector In a separate blog post, Ocean founder Bruce Pon argued that the steep decline in FET’s price, down over 93% from its 2024 peak of $3.22 to around $0.26, was unrelated to Ocean’s exit or any token conversions. “The drop was due to broader market sentiment and volatility,” Pon wrote, blaming liquidity issues and large-scale FET sales by other alliance members for draining community trust. Ocean’s statement also accused the ASI partners of disregarding decentralization principles by rushing the merger, ignoring audit recommendations, and pressuring members into decisions without consensus. It said Ocean “maintained fiscal discipline” and “acted solely for the benefit of its community,” while accusing Fetch.ai and SingularityNET of executing poorly timed liquidity deals that amplified market instability. Sheikh dismissed those claims, saying Ocean should have raised its concerns instead of liquidating community tokens. He reiterated that returning the 286 million FET would allow both sides to avoid protracted litigation and rebuild confidence among token holders. FET Token Price Chart Source: CoinGecko The feud has had a severe impact on market sentiment. Fetch.ai’s FET token is currently trading at around $0.259, representing a 64% decline over the past three months and a drop of more than 92% from its all-time high. Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN token has also fallen about 4% in the last 24 hours to $0.30, though it remains up 36% over the past week. The settlement proposal marks a potential turning point for both AI-blockchain projects. If Ocean Protocol formally agrees to return the tokens, it could end one of the crypto industry’s most contentious disputes of 2025, a feud that not only rattled investors but also tested the credibility of decentralized governance within high-profile blockchain alliances.

Matthew Modabber said , “There will be a token, there will be an airdrop We could have launched a token whenever we wanted, and it’s just how thorough we want to be about it. We want it to be a token with true utility, longevity, and to be around forever, right?

This has led to Polymarket traders becoming increasingly strategic as expectations mount over a potential token launch. As per recent reports, users on the popular prediction market platform have started refining their usage behavior in hopes of qualifying for an anticipated airdrop. However, the timing of Polymarket’s token launch remains uncertain as prediction trackers see any token hopes delayed at least until 2026, with the probability of a token before the end of 2025 below 30%. Additionally, the company’s immediate focus remains on its US relaunch . “There’s no need to rush a token when the US rollout comes first,” Modabber said. He added that the token will follow once the domestic platform is fully operational. Kalshi’s trading volume outpaces Polymarket’s At the same time, Polymarket is in talks to raise money at a valuation of up to $15 billion, as reported by Cryptopolitan. This comes after Intercontinental Exchange, the parent firm of the New York Stock Exchange, invested $2 billion in the company. That deal valued the company at $9 billion, which is more than the $1.2 billion it was worth after a $150 million round led by Founders Fund in June. Additionally, Polymarket is expanding its reach beyond just cryptocurrency. It has teamed up with DraftKings to clear prediction markets and signed a multi-year license arrangement with the National Hockey League, which underscores its increasing mainstream presence. Meanwhile, according to on-chain data, Kalshi remains ahead of Polymarket. Last month, Kalshi recorded trading volumes of $2.9 billion while Polmarket recorded trading volumes of $1.4 billion. Institutional traders and retail players are attracted to Kalshi’s regulated status, as it is overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which contributes to its growth.

The question on every trader’s mind: how high can BNB go now that its founder is free – and how will AI tools like Grok forecast the next leg for $BNB and top altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ? BNB Price Analysis: Sentiment Turns Sharply Bullish BNB’s comeback is more than just a headline bounce. The token has already been on a tear this year, climbing 88% compared to Bitcoin’s 62%, and the past 12 months show a consistent rise in active addresses — proof that its momentum is rooted in real network growth, not just speculation. That bodes well for continued performance, especially when combined with the news of CZ’s pardon. According to Elon Musk’s Grok AI, the latest predictions show quite a range – and major potential: 1️⃣ Short-Term (Next 1-3 Months): Expect consolidation around $1,050-$1,300, with dips to $1,100 as buy opportunities. A breakout above $1,160 could target $1,200 quickly. 2️⃣ Medium-Term (6 Months): $1,400-$1,500 likely if Bitcoin holds above $90K. 3️⃣ 12-Month Outlook: 20-60% growth, reaching $1,400-$1,900 by October 2026. The most bearish predictions see $BNB falling to around $700. The more bullish predictions suggest that BNB could reach $1500, in line with what some investors believe on Polymarket, where the current odds for a new all-time high for $BNB before the end of the year stand at 38% . The Trump 2.0 era continues to reshape crypto policy – and official US presidential residences . With Fed rates expected to fall at the next meeting and softer-than-expected CPI data, the stage is set for a multi-asset crypto bull phase led by utility tokens like $BNB and next-generation Layer 2 networks like $HYPER. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The Next Major Altcoin Contender Is a Critical Bitcoin Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) operates as a hybrid Bitcoin Layer-2 platform merging Bitcoin’s canonical security with Solana’s high-speed virtual machine. What is Bitcoin Hyper? It’s the critical Bitcoin upgrade that transforms Bitcoin from a mere store of value into a game-changing, scalable network. Key innovations include: Canonical Bridge Architecture : Wraps Bitcoin into a Solana Virtual Machine environment, unlocking DeFi utility and micro-payments. Scalability : Thousands of transactions per second vs. Bitcoin’s 7 TPS average. Staking and Yield : Early participants earn a dynamic 48% APY by staking $HYPER during the presale. Adoption : Nearly $25M raised in presale funding, placing it among 2025’s most-watched L2 projects. Bitcoin Hyper extends $BTC into the realm of DeFi, AI integration, and institutional staking – frontiers worth billions in untapped value. By bridging BTC’s $2 trillion liquidity to Solana-speed execution, it offers a technical edge comparable to early Ethereum or Solana growth stages. The combination of speed and reliability has attracted nearly $25M to the presale so far. Our price prediction indicates that $HYPER could reach $0.20 by the end of 2026, representing a 1,400% increase from its presale price of $0.013165. To avoid missing out, learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper with our detailed guide. That puts $HYPER squarely among the best altcoins to buy . Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website. Trump’s pardon of CZ and BNB’s rally marks the first wave of renewed optimism – and Bitcoin Hyper stands ready to capitalize. As always, do your own research — this isn’t financial advice.

The token recovered on increased buying interest from whales, in addition to acquisition news from the Pump.fun team. PUMP is up over 13% in the past week, recovering the $0.004 level. Even though the token did not break out with a full rally, it has stemmed its slide and returned to levels from before the October 10 crash . PUMP responded positively to the news of Pump.fun acquiring a multi-chain trading app. Pump.fun announced the acquisition of the Padre app, a product created by a small team that forged a partnership with the meme launchpad.

I very clearly remember how users that initially joked about Padre turned into loyal users of the product only weeks later,” said Cohen in an X post . “ The Padre team has shown the most grit, execution capability and integrity out of any crypto team I have gotten to know,” he continued. The Pump.fun team has remained active in boosting the platform’s influence, retaining the top spot as a meme generation launchpad. Pump.fun may spread its influence through the Padre trading app, as it still fights for dominance against Four.meme and BNB Chain meme tokens. PUMP aims to regain mindshare One of the obstacles for a PUMP rally is the relatively low mindshare of the token. In the past month, the mindshare of PUMP fell by over 52%, based on Messari data. The mindshare of PumpSwap has also fallen significantly. PUMP lost mindshare in the past month, as attention shifted to other meme platforms. | Source: Messari However, the platforms are still being used at a high baseline level, and are among the top fee producers on Solana. For now, PUMP retains its price levels, but trading volumes have slowed down since September, falling to under $300M in daily trades. PUMP open interest remained at around $354M, with $143M on Hyperliquid . The token is among the most active on Hyperliquid, with slightly more aggressive short positions. Overall, PUMP is balanced in terms of long and short traders. For now, long positions are slow to return, though some expect PUMP to break out in the coming months. Whales return to PUMP PUMP saw recent demand from whales, with two addresses buying the token in the past day. One whale withdrew $2M USDC from Kraken to buy 517.97M PUMP. The whales returned just days after PUMP showed signs of smart money inflows . The other whale deposited 3M USDC on Hyperliquid to open a 2X long position . Currently, the biggest long position on Hyperliquid has a value above $10M. The two top PUMP positions are short, with a notional value of $13M and $11M.

These companies, major cryptocurrency companies, were reportedly included in the list of sponsors of the Trump administration's “White House Ballroom” project. Other major donors include major companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft. President Donald Trump officially announced the White House ballroom construction plan in July. At that point, it was announced that the project, which included the renovation of the White House East Wing, would be funded by private donations rather than taxpayer money. Construction of the ballroom, which will cover approximately 8,360 square meters and can accommodate more than 650 people, began in September. The total cost is estimated at approximately $300 million. President Trump described the project as “a visionary building that will symbolize America's cultural renaissance,” adding, “This ballroom is a historic endeavor funded entirely by private donations.” Trump has received numerous donations from the cryptocurrency industry over the past year. In August, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss donated 18 Bitcoin to a pro-Trump political action committee, while in January, prominent industry figures like Circle, Ripple, and Coinbase donated to Trump's inaugural committee. The cryptocurrency sector also supported Trump's election by providing significant political funding in the 2024 US presidential election. Fairshake, backed by Ripple and Coinbase, raised more than $200 million to support candidates in critical districts during the last election cycle. *This is not investment advice.

Whale accumulation and renewed developer activity on the Solana network have boosted sentiment, fueling expectations of a sustained uptrend heading into Q4. However, while SOL’s recovery signals renewed market confidence, retail investors are increasingly turning their attention toward a new DeFi altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. Currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has raised more than $17.8 million. Investors have less time remaining since the phase is already over 70% sold out. As Solana continues its climb, Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to buy for investors aiming to capture early-stage growth potential before the next bull-run peaks. Solana (SOL) Price Forecast: Bulls Eyeing a Return to the $250 Mark Solana (SOL) is gaining strength once again as bulls gather momentum at its current support levels. According to analysts, if Solana is able to hold this critical base and keep pushing to the upside, a breakout can easily retest the $240–$250 resistance level in the next sessions. The chart suggests that the said bullish beauty may be awakening once more, beckoning a possible return of the upper uptrend. As traders closely monitor Solana’s next clear direction, investor attention is also increasingly focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gradually gaining market attention in anticipation of 2025’s predicted rally. Many consider MUTM the best cryptocurrency to invest today due to its early-stage growth potential. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is skyrocketing in presale stage 6 powered by strong investor demand. This phase is now almost sold out, and the $0.035 token presents a good buy-in opportunity before Phase 7 starts and prices go higher. The rally reflects investors’ confidence, making MUTM the best crypto to buy for those looking to enter early in the DeFi market. Over 17,380 investors have bought more than $17.8 million worth of MUTM tokens. The massive turnout is indicative of increasing global interest in Mutuum Finance’s decentralized platform, strong fundamentals, and long-term growth prospects. Its performance has many labeling MUTM the best cryptocurrency to invest today for early adopters seeking high upside. Earn Passive Income as a Supplier As a supplier on the platform, you can lock crypto assets, including USDT, into the liquidity pool and receive passive income in the form of the annual percentage yield (APY). The APY is also subject to market demand in a bid to have your returns match up to prevailing trends in the crypto market. Taking the example of an average APY of 10%, a $50,000 deposit has the potential to earn $5,000 in passive income within one year. It is a convenient and easy manner of putting your crypto assets to work without selling or trading them actively. Borrow Funds Without Selling Your Assets For borrowers, the platform provides a flexible way of attaining liquidity without having to sell your current assets. For example, if you have ETH but need money for other investments or personal use, you can borrow USDT using your ETH as collateral. Loans have no repayment schedule. They earn interest according to an APY based on market demand. This structure enables borrowers to keep ownership of their underlying assets while gaining access to the capital they require. Mutuum Finance has garnered more than $17.8 million from over 17,380 investors, and with more than 70% of Phase 6 now sold, $0.035 tokens are selling out quickly. Early adopters can take advantage of its dual-lending P2C and P2P ecosystem, generate passive income, and enjoy flexible borrowing, while positioning for early-stage growth in front of the next bull run. Don’t wait. Go to the official Mutuum Finance platform now and buy your tokens before Phase 6 ends and prices increase in Phase 7, as MUTM continues to be the best crypto to buy in 2025.

53585857,613096,1761321646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53585857.jpeg,New Bitcoin Improvement Proposal Aims To Improve Privacy: Here’s How,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-improve-privacy/,"A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal titled “Chain Code Delegation for Private Collaborative Custody” has been opened on the Bitcoin BIPs repository, targeting a long-standing privacy leak in multisig collaborations that rely on shared extended public keys. The technique, authored by Bitkey engineers and collaborators, with a public explainer from Bitkey, proposes withholding BIP32 chain codes from non-privileged participants so that cosigners can help with recovery and policy enforcement without gaining sweeping visibility into a user’s balances and transaction history. Bitkey says it plans to implement the scheme first if it becomes an accepted standard. How The BIP Enhances Bitcoin Privacy The crux of the privacy problem is well known to wallet engineers and custodial partners: in typical collaborative or assisted multisig , the cosigner is handed an xpub plus chain code, which lets them deterministically derive the addresses in a user’s wallet and, by scanning the blockchain, infer balances and flows. Bitkey’s post frames the status quo plainly: sharing a key with a third party has “traditionally meant giving that party visibility into a user’s wallet balance and transaction history.” The new approach, they argue, “aims to remove that tradeoff” by withholding chain codes entirely and revealing only what is minimally necessary at spend time. The proposed BIP’s abstract is crisp about the change in trust boundaries: “We propose a new BIP for Chain Code Delegation, a collaborative custody technique that involves privileged participants (delegatee) withholding BIP32 chain codes at key setup time from a delegator, and sharing only enough information for non-privileged participants to provide their signature.” In the non-blinded flow, “the delegatee derives a per-spend scalar tweak t from the (withheld) chain code, the delegator computes the child key (x+t, P+tG), and produces a standard signature over the transaction’s sighash.” The blinded flow layers Schnorr blind signing on top so that the cosigner remains oblivious to the final message while still enforcing the per-spend tweak, leveraging the linearity of Schnorr for correctness. Functionally, the technique narrows what a cosigner can learn and when. Rather than permanent, global observability over all derived addresses, the cosigner only sees per-spend data as needed. The Bitkey explainer translates this into a user-facing promise: cosigners can assist with recovery or spend policies “without learning anything about unrelated transactions or overall balances.” If widely adopted, that shift would make collaborative custody wallets more comparable to DIY multisig on privacy, while preserving the operational benefits that have made assisted models attractive to mainstream and enterprise users. The design has been incubating in the open. A technical discussion thread on Delving Bitcoin over the summer summarized two key benefits that extend beyond privacy: limiting the “security blast radius” because, without the chain code or undisclosed tweaks, a custodian’s key is effectively unspendable for UTXOs they haven’t been explicitly delegated for; and tightly scoping what gets revealed at the moment of spend, often just before those outputs are consumed. That thread foreshadowed the BIP now filed and offers useful context for reviewers tracing how the proposal hardened through feedback. Bitkey positions itself as the first mover on implementation once the standard is vetted. “Bitkey plans to be the first to implement Chain Code Delegation in production,” the company wrote, arguing that it will enable “a private collaborative wallet—something that hasn’t been possible until now.” The explicit intention is for the technique to be an “open, community-vetted standard that any wallet or custody provider can adopt,” not a vendor-locked feature. Prominent industry accounts amplified the announcement on X. Principal executive officer and chairman of Block, Inc Jack Dorsey highlighted Bitkey’s focus on pushing privacy improvements from product to protocol.

That’s coming from a stock that’s barely moved this year, up less than 1% year-to-date. The firm resumed coverage on the e-commerce and cloud giant with an overweight rating, calling the current valuation “an attractive entry point” based on its 22.9x 2027E price-to-earnings ratio. The main reason? Artificial intelligence is reshaping everything, and KeyBanc thinks Amazon’s cloud arm, AWS, is still in the game, despite what the skeptics say.“AWS has still been growing absolute revenue dollars near or better than competitors,” the bank wrote. KeyBanc pointed to gigawatt-scale data center expansions like Project Rainier and heavyweight AI customers such as Anthropic as signs of a rebound into 2026. “We would be surprised if AWS was left behind in the AI revolution,” they added. Analysts bullish on Amazon’s grocery business KeyBanc also sees Amazon’s advertising business as a key source of upside, calling out both on-platform ads (like sponsored product listings and Prime Video placements) and off-platform opportunities. “We believe Amazon’s off-platform business is better positioned than Google’s Network business,” the note said, citing the company’s exclusive user data as a long-term advantage. KeyBanc also flagged Amazon’s grocery segment as a serious threat to smaller food retailers, specifically with its plans to roll out same-day perishable delivery in over 2,300 U.S. cities, up from just 1,000 today. The expansion is scheduled to wrap up by the end of 2025. The bank sees this as a smart way to steal market share from less tech-savvy grocers, using its existing delivery and logistics muscle to dominate perishable goods too. AWS outage wrecks thousands of apps and sites Few days before the note, Cryptopolitan reported that Amazon Web Services had suffered a major outage that disrupted over 2,000 companies, including apps like Robinhood, Coinbase, Venmo, Fidelity, Signal, Snapchat, Duolingo, Roblox, and even Ring smart doorbells. According to AWS, the issue started with a “latent defect” in its automated DNS management system, which handles domain name records for DynamoDB, the company’s cloud-native NoSQL database service. Both the DynamoDB DNS planner and enactor have now been disabled globally, while engineering teams work on long-term fixes and new safeguards. The bug triggered a chain reaction in AWS’s US-East-1 datacenter region in Virginia, where an empty DNS record failed to update. The automation system didn’t catch it, didn’t fix it, and manual intervention was needed to patch the problem. At its peak, the incident generated more than 8.1 million outage reports, according to Downdetector. Banking apps, gaming platforms, and streaming services were all hit, once again raising questions around AWS’s reliability, especially as it seeks to scale AI infrastructure.

With the United States now routinely confiscating cryptocurrencies tied to criminal investigations, every new figure, especially those involving major assets like XRP , attracts both investor curiosity and public scrutiny. The Viral Claim and Its Origin The latest conversation was sparked by a post shared by Abdullah Nassif, host of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, who referenced data first published by BankXRP on X. According to the post, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recently seized $54.7 million worth of digital assets, including $27.9 million in Bitcoin (BTC), $16.5 million in Ethereum (ETH), and $7.8 million in XRP. Nassif highlighted the XRP portion of the seizure, pointing out that this figure effectively represents the amount of XRP currently held by the U.S. government following the DEA’s enforcement action. His post quickly gained traction among XRP supporters, fueling discussions about how seized crypto assets are stored, managed, and eventually disposed of by federal agencies. U.S. Government Is Holding $7.8 Million $XRP … https://t.co/Xvnw31Lwrg — Good Evening Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) October 23, 2025 Tracing the Source of the Seizure While the exact details of this latest action have not yet been officially published by the DEA or the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the numbers align with the scale of several recent crypto forfeiture cases tied to narcotics and money-laundering investigations. In late 2023, for example, the DOJ announced a civil forfeiture filing in New Jersey involving over $54 million in cryptocurrencies recovered from a darknet narcotics scheme. Although that case focused largely on Ethereum holdings, it demonstrates the magnitude of ongoing federal seizures and the agencies’ growing capacity to trace and secure digital assets. These actions form part of a broader U.S. strategy to tighten control over illicit crypto activity and enhance asset recovery mechanisms through the U.S. Marshals Service, which handles the safekeeping and eventual auction of confiscated tokens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the $7.8 Million XRP Means If accurate, the figure cited by Abdullah Nassif and BankXRP means that roughly $7.8 million in XRP has entered federal custody through DEA operations. That amount, while relatively small compared to the billions in circulation, is significant as it underscores XRP’s presence in enforcement-linked portfolios, a reminder that its adoption spans both legitimate and illicit uses, like most major cryptocurrencies. However, it’s worth noting that social media breakdowns sometimes conflate separate seizures or attribute holdings across agencies. Until an official DEA or DOJ filing confirms the precise composition of this particular seizure, the XRP figure should be regarded as credible but preliminary information. The Bigger Picture Abdullah Nassif’s spotlight on this data reflects a growing awareness of how government-held crypto assets could subtly influence market narratives. While most seized digital currencies are eventually auctioned or liquidated, the timing and method of those disposals can temporarily affect sentiment and liquidity. For now, all available evidence suggests that the U.S. government does indeed hold XRP valued at around $7.8 million, pending formal confirmation. As federal agencies continue to ramp up digital asset enforcement, similar revelations are likely to emerge — and the crypto community will be watching closely.
