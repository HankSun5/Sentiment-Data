53553924,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87353,1761257119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Investors: $5 is the First Move of Many on the Next Impulse,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-5-is-the-first-move-of-many-on-the-next-impulse/,"A quiet but powerful sentiment is spreading across the XRP community, one that suggests the digital asset may be preparing for its next major rally. After months of sideways movement and fading momentum, analysts are beginning to see signs of life returning to XRP’s long-term structure. Among them is respected market analyst ChartNerd, who believes XRP could be on the brink of a significant bullish impulse, with $5 serving as just the opening move. Technical Structure: A Channel That Holds the Key On the weekly timeframe, XRP’s price has been oscillating within an ascending parallel channel, a formation that typically precedes extended bullish runs once resistance is decisively broken. Each test of the lower boundary has seen buyers defend key levels, while the upper trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance. This consistent price symmetry has created a well-defined roadmap: a sustained rebound from current support zones could set the stage for a breakout toward higher highs. At present, XRP trades near the lower region of this structure, around $2.40, hinting at a potential pivot point. The channel’s upper boundary, near $4.50 to $5.00, aligns perfectly with the analyst’s projected short-term target. $XRP is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the horizon. Channel support awaits below, with HLs on the weekly MACD, and SRSI levels in oversold territory. $5 is the first move of many on the next impulse. I believe XRP will front-run within the bluechips category – #NFA pic.twitter.com/uCtPmOb2wz — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 23, 2025 Momentum Shifts: Weekly MACD and Stochastic RSI Align Beyond the visible channel, momentum indicators are flashing encouraging signals. The weekly MACD histogram, which tracks trend strength, has been printing a series of higher lows, a classic bullish divergence that often precedes upward reversals. This suggests that bearish momentum is weakening, even as prices hover near support. Supporting this outlook, the Stochastic RSI (SRSI) has entered deeply oversold territory, an area that typically marks exhaustion among sellers. When both the MACD and SRSI align in this manner, it strengthens the case for a medium- to long-term reversal, precisely the foundation of ChartNerd’s bullish thesis. Market Context: The “Blue-Chip” Advantage XRP’s position among top-tier digital assets gives it an advantage as broader market cycles turn. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue leading the market’s next macro leg, XRP, often categorized as a blue-chip altcoin, could front-run its peers in performance, benefiting from renewed liquidity and investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This possibility becomes even more compelling when coupled with Ripple’s ongoing real-world integrations and adoption of RLUSD, the company’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. These developments strengthen the network’s utility narrative, giving technical setups stronger fundamental backing. The $5 Target: A Launchpad, Not a Ceiling ChartNerd’s analysis underscores that $5 is not the destination but the beginning of a broader impulsive wave. The move, if validated by volume and confirmed breakout patterns, could reestablish XRP as a leading performer in the digital asset market. Still, traders must remain cautious: while technical signals are aligning, execution depends on market sentiment, regulatory stability, and macroeconomic conditions. Technicals Hint, Market Confirms The convergence of technical and momentum factors paints a promising picture for XRP. With channel support intact, momentum indicators turning upward, and broader market structure improving, the stage appears set for a potential rally. As ChartNerd’s analysis suggests, $5 could be only the first step, an opening act in what might become a defining move for XRP in the next market cycle. In a space driven by sentiment and structure alike, XRP’s chart is quietly sending a message: the next impulse might be closer than it seems .

53554188,https://cryptonews.com/?p=442805,1761257767,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53554188.jpeg,China Is Third-Largest Contributor To Global Bitcoin Mining: Why It Matters,https://cryptonews.com/news/china-is-third-largest-contributor-to-global-bitcoin-mining-why-it-matters/,"China was once the undisputed center for Bitcoin mining. Known for its cheap power and access to leading hardware manufacturers, all of this positioned China as a leader in global Bitcoin mining. However, this changed when mining was banned by the Chinese government in 2021 . In late September 2021, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) further banned all cryptocurrency transactions. The PBOC cited the role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating financial crime as well as posing a growing risk to China’s financial system. Fast-forward to today—despite the government’s strong efforts to weed out all crypto miners, many have found ways to continue operations . According to the Q4 2025 update of Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map , China currently accounts for 14.05% of Bitcoin’s total compute power, or roughly 145 exahashes per second (EH/s). This is a modest rise from 13.8% in Q3. Source: Luxor China Leads in Global Bitcoin Mining Kaan Farahani, research associate at Luxor, told Cryptonews that Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map estimates the geographic distribution of Bitcoin mining activity across the world. “The map provides weighted hashrate concentration across regions by incorporating mining pool data, ASIC trading flows, and firmware adoption trends,” Farahani said. Based on the recent data, China is the third-largest contributor globally to Bitcoin mining , just behind the U.S. and Russia. Luxor’s findings do not show where specifically the hashrate resides. According to Miner Weekly , multiple sources across the ASIC supply chain have pointed to one possible destination, which is Xinjiang. The region’s relative isolation and abundant energy resources have made it a longtime hub for Bitcoin mining before China’s ban in 2021. China Reveals Underground Bitcoin Mining Operations While China’s continuation of Bitcoin mining may not come as a complete shock, this illustrates the murky, underground nature of the mining industry. Kent Halliburton, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin mining platform Sazmining, told Cryptonews that he is not surprised to see mining still occurring in China. “This is one of the beauties of Bitcoin mining. It’s a cypherpunk way to generate Bitcoin, meaning that as long as you have electricity and hardware, you can generate Bitcoin for yourself. It’s tough to shut down mining on the outskirts, and that is why I believe the hashrate we see in China continues to exist,” Halliburton said. Other regions where Bitcoin mining is considered illegal are also showing signs of growth. For example, Farahani noted that Luxor’s Hashrate Map gives insight into Iran, estimating that around 8 EH/s of hashrate is operational in the region as of Q4-2025. This represents 0.75% of global market share. According to Halliburton, Iran is another good example of where Bitcoin mining has been occurring, but has largely been illegal . Iran initially banned Bitcoin mining in May of 2021 for four months. The region’s second ban took place in December 2021. Prior to this, Iran’s bitcoin mining was estimated to make up between 4% and 8% of the global BTC network. “Essentially, any country with stringent controls on capital outflows is likely to restrict or attempt to ban Bitcoin mining,” Halliburton said. “But if you have power, you can generate Bitcoin as long as you have the right hardware to harness it. That means that if you’re trying to stem the flow of capital from leaving your country, you have a way to do that with Bitcoin mining.” China’s Concerning Mining Infrastructure Empire In addition to mining, recent findings from Bitcoin solutions manufacturer Auradine found that over 95% of Bitcoin ASIC mining equipment is manufactured by Chinese firms like Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan. Auradine’s report notes that Chinese equipment manufacturing poses a major threat to U.S. national security and key infrastructure. Sanjay Gupta, chief strategy officer at Auradine, told Cryptonews that China’s mining infrastructure operations are concerning for a number of reasons. For instance, he mentioned that there are over a million Chinese-based Bitcoin mining machines with foreign firmware connected to the U.S. electrical grid. “This poses a potential serious cybersecurity risk to the electrical grid across multiple states,” Gupta said. “If there is embedded software in these Chinese miners that is triggered for a coordinated cyber attack to drive a large number of miners to simultaneously go in rapid over- or underdrive, this could cause a catastrophic failure of the U.S. electrical grid.” And they would have gotten away with it too, if not for President Xi and President Putin. China, Russia and co-operative nations within BRICS have enough control over BTC mining repositories to bring Bitcoin to ZERO. The U.S. will not get away with this. pic.twitter.com/Ylx81nBFw0 — Inevitable China (@InevitableChina) September 8, 2025 Gupta added that the BTC mining hardware supply being highly concentrated poses a major risk of a potential 51% takeover of the bitcoin protocol in a hostile geopolitical situation. This has become even more of a threat with the recent tariffs imposed on China by President Trump, which could rise to 155% in the coming weeks . “This could cause a dramatic impact on the value of BTC and ripple effect in financial markets,” Gupta remarked. Is China A Threat To Bitcoin Miners? It’s clear that Bitcoin mining and manufacturing continue to take place in China despite bans. So what does this mean for miners based in regions where BTC mining is considered legal? According to Farahani, Luxor is unaware of challenges or threats based on China’s mining operations. On the other hand, Gupta believes that Chinese firms supplying mining equipment will create complexities for other regions. “To combat this, we need to enable strong U.S.-based Bitcoin mining suppliers that can drive continuous innovation and performance for mining operations,” he said. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China are having a significant and costly impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. According to a new report from The Miner Mag, rising tariffs on mining equipment have exposed American companies to substantial financial liabilities.… — Dr Martin Hiesboeck (@MHiesboeck) August 21, 2025 Gupta added that moving forward, Bitcoin miners should have technology that allows energy demand response with the ability to rapidly increase or decrease power consumption based on the needs of a state or region’s electrical grid. In the meantime, the architecture and legacy of mining in China will likely continue to loom over the global network. In crypto’s ever‑shifting world, China isn’t gone—but rather simply operating in the margins.

Polymarket Bettors Place Bets On CZ’s Potential Binance Return In a poll on Polymarket’s website labeled “Will CZ return to Binance by December 31,” odds that Zhao would return to the crypto exchange shot up to 82%.

However, by Friday evening, the poll showed Zhao’s odds of returning to the crypto organization stabilizing around 36%. Donald Trump Pardons CZ, Former Binance CEO Teases Book Reports emerged on Thursday morning that Trump had decided to pardon Zhao after the former Binance CEO pled guilty to money laundering violations at the crypto exchange back in 2023. As part of the resolution , Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines. “President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she added. Following the news, Zhao took to X on Thursday morning to share his gratitude for receiving clemency and thank his supporters for “congratulatory messages.” Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.

This year’s “Uptober” rally came to an abrupt end after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a decision that sent shockwaves through global markets and triggered one of the steepest single-day declines in the crypto sector in months. As the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting draws closer, traders are adopting a wait-and-see approach, seeking clues about potential monetary easing that could help revive risk-friendly investors. Crypto believers, however, interpret the current correction as a healthy reset. Historically, deep market pullbacks eliminate excessive leverage and speculative positions, creating the foundation for more sustainable long-term rallies. World Liberty Financial (WLFI): ChatGPT Predicts the President’s Crypto Could Rise to Match his Favourite Fiat Currency World Liberty Financial ($WLFI) is President Trump’s crypto play, and it seeks to demonstrate what decentralized finance can achieve by merging innovation, governance, and freedom in a single ecosystem. Source: ChatGPT With Presidential backing and bold ambitions, WLFI empowers users to participate in a transparent, community-driven financial network designed for real-world impact. Built on Ethereum using the Aave protocol, details of the project are closely guarded, but we know that it is likely to facilitate lending to institutions and everyday users while likely aiming to play a big part in stablecoins should the technology take off, as it’s widely expected to do. WLFI hasn’t been out long enough to have lots of data about its trends, but it’s currently the 41st biggest crypto on the market with a capitalization of $3.8 billion. WLFI is interesting because it is a demonstration of how Trump’s business interests align with crypto. This could act as a positive catalyst in spurring legislation to arrive quicker, as US crypto companies still await needed clarity on how they should act. Should that happen, then WLFI could conceivably rise to the cost of $1, maybe not in the one week left of the month, but by Christmas. Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Powerhouse Could Double in a Week, Predicts ChatGPT Aave ($AAVE) remains a powerhouse in decentralized finance, offering users the ability to lend, borrow, and earn passive income through an intuitive and secure protocol. Its trailblazing feature suite includes flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain support, all of which have made AAVE a cornerstone of the DeFi revolution. With continual innovation, strong community governance, and growing institutional adoption, Aave isn’t just keeping pace with the future of finance; it’s one of the early builders. ChatGPT sees the price of Aave could leap from $227 to $500. Given the short notice, only a seriously big announcement could make Aave rise that high. However, Aave has entered a technical setup that looks like an expanding triangle. If this triangle is confirmed by continued upward movement (Aave rose 4% in the last 24 hours), then Aave could easily hit the $500 stretch target any time between here and the New Year. Sui Network: Can This Altcoin Surpass Ethereum and Cardano? Sui Network ($SUI) continues to attract attention as one of the more promising altcoins, presenting itself as a blockchain that surpasses Ethereum’s performance. Although claims of being an “Ethereum killer” often depend on perspective and use case, Sui’s biggest edge lies in its speed. The network reportedly processes up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), dwarfing Ethereum’s average throughput of around 15 TPS. Over the past 24 hours, Sui has climbed 3%, reaching $2.50. According to ChatGPT’s projections, the coin could maintain steady momentum with a measured target of $5 by the New Year. This growth outlook is thanks to Sui’s advanced smart contract framework, impressive scalability, and focus on cross-chain interoperability. Should the broader market re-enter a bull phase, as many anticipate, Sui could realistically achieve the $10 mark by Christmas. Technical indicators reinforce this view, with the token breaking out of a bullish flag pattern that formed between January and late March, typically a sign of sustained upward potential. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI) Finally, A fresh contender in the meme coin scene Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is already gaining serious traction despite not hitting exchanges yet. Its presale phase has attracted over $3.7 million in early investments from traders looking to catch the next viral crypto phenomenon. Dogecoin’s risk-mainlining cousin, Maxi Doge, offers community-driven degeneracy with a narrative that is captivating meme coin volatility surfers. Launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, MAXI promises faster, more affordable, and environmentally conscious transactions than Dogecoin. It promotes itself through lively Telegram and Discord communities, delivering trading contests and influencer partnerships to build early momentum. Out of its total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” which will finance marketing efforts, ecosystem expansion, and future collaborations. Staking is already available, offering returns as high as 82% APY, though this yield will gradually decrease as more participants join. Currently priced at $0.0002645 in the presale, MAXI’s value is set to rise incrementally with each funding round. You can purchase tokens using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Within days, markets crashed hard after President Trump declared a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting investors to adopt a risk-off stance ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Even so, several analysts interpret this retracement as a healthy consolidation phase, flushing out excess leverage and weak hands before a more sustained climb. Here are three standout altcoins showing significant upside potential. Hyperliquid: The DEX Creating a New Class of Crypto Millionaires Introduced late last year, Hyperliquid and its native $HYPE token have rapidly emerged as a top contender in the decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. Operating on its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid prioritizes transparency and transaction efficiency. Unlike centralized exchanges, it allows users to maintain full custody of their assets, a feature that has gained prominence since the collapse of CEX giants such as FTX. With minimal trading fees, lightning-fast order execution, and advanced features like perpetual derivatives, Hyperliquid successfully blends the convenience of centralized platforms with the trustless nature of DEXs. Price action since launch shows robust bullish trends. Two bullish flag formations appeared between late winter and early spring, patterns often preceding substantial price rallies. Between early April and May 26, HYPE’s price skyrocketed from roughly $10 to $40, a fourfold increase. The chart also displays multiple cup-and-handle formations, indicating persistent accumulation from major investors. Now HYPE’s support and resistance lines since then have entered an expanding channel, which gives HYPE plenty of potential for a rapid bounce. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Strongest Competitor and This Week’s Top Performer Solana ($SOL) continues to solidify its standing as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. With a market capitalization surpassing $104 billion and over $11 billion locked across its DeFi protocols, Solana’s ecosystem expansion remains impressive. Market participants are closely monitoring prospects for U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional capital inflows similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF effects. After bottoming near $100 in April, SOL now trades close to $191. Growing regulatory clarity has boosted confidence, while technical readings, including an RSI of 44, a 4% gain in 24 hours, and moving to converge with its 30-day moving average, indicate that SOL may be undervalued at current prices and is likely to rise going into the weekend. Key support lies around $150, with heavy resistance at $250. A decisive breakout above this resistance could propel SOL toward its all-time high of $293.31, or even above $500 if a full-scale bull market develops. Ripple (XRP): The 2025 Leader in Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , serves as the foundation of a payment network known for ultra-fast transactions and minimal fees, offering a modern alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Supported by the UN Capital Development Fund and linked with several major U.S. financial institutions, XRP has climbed to become the third-largest crypto asset by market value, standing at approximately $144.3 billion. Ripple’s introduction of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, highlights its intention to capture a portion of the expanding stablecoin market. Over the past year, XRP has surged 357%, reaching a seven-year peak of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% gain over the same timeframe. With an RSI around 39 and trading below its 30-day moving average, XRP appears primed for another move upward. Technical indicators also show two bullish flag formations during the summer months, pointing to further growth potential if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto legislation could push XRP toward the $5–$10 range. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The 2025 Meme Coin Revolutionizing Bitcoin’s Potential Finally, one that’s too early-stage to be listed on exchanges: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has rapidly become one of the most discussed presales of 2025. Designed to amplify Bitcoin’s scalability and speed through a Layer-2 infrastructure, it delivers lightning-fast and cost-efficient transfers, packaged in a meme coin format. The project incorporates decentralized governance through a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and exceptional transaction throughput on its custom-built Layer-2 framework. With over $24.6 million raised in presale funding, analysts project potential 10x or higher returns after launch. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s network features a streamlined Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, full dApp compatibility, and built-in meme coin integrations. Additionally, a recent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels essential ecosystem functions, including staking, governance, and transaction processing, rewarding early participants with staking yields reaching 48% APY.

53555289,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=843839,1761259588,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53555289.jpeg,Luxury automaker Porsche reverses EV strategy amid weak China demand,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/luxury-automaker-porsche-changes-ev-strategy/,"Porsche is pulling back from its electric vehicle plans, thanks to weak demand in China amid a frenzy in a crowded market that has erased almost two-thirds of its stock value since May 2023. The luxury carmaker is cutting investment in battery-powered models and redirecting funds toward petrol and hybrid engines, according to the Financial Times . The change will be led by Michael Leiters, who takes over as Porsche’s new chief executive in January. Leiters has never been shy about his doubts over electric cars. “The technology isn’t ready,” he told the Financial Times last year while still running McLaren. He argued that EVs don’t offer the emotional thrill of traditional engines and lose value much faster. Leiters began his career at Porsche two decades ago as an assistant to a former CEO before moving to Ferrari as chief technology officer and then to McLaren as its top executive. Now he’s returning to the company that trained him, with the task of undoing years of overly ambitious electric planning. Leiters takes charge as Porsche faces pressure in China and the U.S. Leiters replaces Oliver Blume, who managed Porsche while also running Volkswagen. That dual role looked efficient when profits were strong, but after a series of warnings this year, it’s clear the brand needs a full-time leader. Automotive analyst Stephen Reitman from Bernstein said Porsche cut its 2025 operating margin forecast from 14 percent to just 0–2 percent. The company still targets 10–15 percent in the midterm, but Reitman warned it will “take some time before we even get to that.” The brand’s biggest problem is China. Sales there, once a key growth engine, have plunged nearly 40 percent since 2022 as local carmakers flooded the luxury EV segment. The U.S. market hasn’t been kinder. New tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump will now hit every Porsche vehicle imported from Europe, since the company has no American factories. That extra cost threatens to squeeze profits even further, worsening its dependence on Europe and shrinking global margins. Inside its factories, the pain is already visible. Porsche confirmed earlier this year that it will cut 3,900 jobs — about 9 percent of its workforce — by 2029. Talks with labor unions are ongoing as it seeks more cost reductions. On the technology side, Sajjad Khan, board member for IT and software, said the company is fixing persistent EV delays caused by software problems. “We have to work hard to execute perfectly,” Khan said, adding that improvements in quality and reliability should arrive by 2026 or 2027. Porsche cancels new SUV and revives gas engines amid restructuring As part of the overhaul, Porsche has canceled its upcoming all-electric SUV and booked an impairment charge of €1.8 billion for related development costs. It’s also reversing a previous decision to stop building petrol or hybrid versions of its top sellers, the Macan and Cayman. Analysts see this as an admission that the EV rollout under Blume went too far. Metzler Research analyst Pal Skirta said Porsche had been “too bullish” on electrification after the Dieselgate scandal and is now paying for it. Even with sales accounting for just 3.6 percent of Volkswagen’s total deliveries over the past three years, Porsche generated nearly 30 percent of the parent group’s operating profit. That made it one of VW’s most valuable divisions. But the collapse in demand, combined with software delays and China losses, has damaged that reputation. Leiters now faces the hard job of keeping Porsche’s high-end status intact while boosting output.His old company, Ferrari, thrives on limited production and exclusivity, a model Porsche can’t easily copy while chasing growth. And while this renewed focus on fuel engines might help short-term profits, it risks putting the company behind in the electric race again. Skirta warned that “they will focus again too much on combustion engine vehicles, and then we’ll lose the EV race in the long run.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|Porsche,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 22:46:28

Dogecoin has spent the past few days trading within a tight range between $0.18 and $0.20, showing a slight increase in trading activity compared to last week. Although the price action has been mostly subdued, a new technical analysis suggests that a significant reversal could soon be underway, one that may send the Dogecoin price surging to at least $0.5 once momentum returns to the market. Dogecoin In The Lower Band Of Its Long-Term Channel Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s macro price chart shows the king of meme coins is now trading at a historical bullish momentum low. This analysis, which was posted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst EtherNasyonaL, looks at Dogecoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Surge, But Buy DOGE Under These Levels The analysis shows that Dogecoin is currently trading within a well-defined ascending channel that goes as far back as when it was created. As it stands, Dogecoin is now trading around the lower boundary of this channel. The flash crash earlier in the month created a downward wick that bounced off a confluence of supports right on this trendline. This long-term structure reveals a consistent pattern of Dogecoin bouncing back each time it reaches this lower band, with previous reversals leading to exponential rallies. The current setup mirrors the same early stages of recovery seen before the 2021 breakout that sent the Dogecoin price from below $0.1 to above $0.70. EtherNasyonaL explained that Dogecoin’s momentum has now reached “historical lows,” with the Stochastic RSI confirming a bottoming phase similar to those seen before previous bull runs. Furthermore, the analyst described this period as a phase of “quiet, calm, yet determined recovery,” meaning that the market is gradually regaining strength beneath the surface. Historical Bottom Means Price Bounce The momentum oscillator displayed in EtherNasyonaL’s chart supports this outlook. The Stochastic RSI, which tracks the rate of change in momentum, is at its lowest level, even lower than before Dogecoin’s rally in 2021. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could be entering the same type of accumulation phase that set the stage for its 2020/2021 rally. Related Reading: What Happens To The Dogecoin Price If The Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $65,000? This view is further supported by the positioning of the price within the ascending channel. With Dogecoin currently trading around the lower range, it effectively sets a technical foundation for another upward leg. Should Dogecoin follow its established pattern, a rebound toward the midline of the channel would place its price at least at $0.5. A continued move upward would see Dogecoin break into new all-time highs above $0.9 and $1 in conservative projections. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1945, having increased by 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

53555403,612386,1761260403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53555403.jpeg,Ethereum Netflow Turns Positive: Binance May Be Leading the Selling Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-netflow-turns-positive-binance-selling/,"Ethereum is once again under pressure, struggling to find the strength to reclaim the $4,000 level amid growing uncertainty across the crypto market. Investor sentiment has turned increasingly cautious, with mixed opinions emerging among analysts — some warning that a bear market may be taking shape, while others believe this correction could precede a massive rally in the coming weeks. According to CryptoQuant insights, the latest on-chain data reveals a notable shift in Ethereum’s exchange activity that could shape short-term price dynamics. Despite the recent decline in ETH’s price, the 7-day moving average of Exchange Netflow (Total) has transitioned from heavy outflows to inflows — climbing from approximately -57,000 ETH on October 16th to +7,000 ETH recently. This shift suggests that more ETH is now moving onto exchanges, potentially signaling rising selling pressure as traders prepare to offload assets amid volatility. Historically, such inflow spikes have often preceded short-term pullbacks, especially when accompanied by negative market sentiment. However, some analysts caution that this could also reflect whale repositioning or liquidity management, not outright distribution. Ethereum Exchange Inflows Spike as Binance Activity Signals Caution According to CryptoOnchain’s latest analysis on CryptoQuant, Binance appears to be playing a major role in Ethereum’s recent exchange flow dynamics. Data shows that Binance’s 7-day netflow has shifted dramatically — moving from approximately -31,000 ETH on October 15th to +3,000 ETH in recent days. This single exchange accounts for nearly 50% of the total shift observed across all major trading platforms, underscoring its significant influence on Ethereum’s short-term liquidity landscape. This sudden and pronounced rise in ETH deposits onto exchanges — particularly during a period of price weakness — is typically seen as a bearish short-term signal. When traders or institutional holders transfer coins from private wallets to exchanges, it often suggests a readiness to sell or reposition in anticipation of further downside. As a result, the increased on-exchange supply could add selling liquidity, making it easier for large sell orders to impact price action more sharply. However, analysts also caution against interpreting this move too narrowly. While exchange inflows often precede selling pressure, they can also reflect strategic hedging, collateral deposits for derivatives trading, or liquidity management during periods of market stress. Still, when combined with the broader macro uncertainty and Ethereum’s struggle to stay above key technical levels, this data reinforces the cautious tone prevailing across the market. If inflows persist and Ethereum fails to defend support near $3,800–$3,700, downside risk could intensify. Conversely, a quick reversal back to outflows would signal renewed investor confidence and potentially set the stage for a stronger recovery. ETH Holding Key Support Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is currently trading around $3,880, holding slightly above a key short-term support zone near $3,700–$3,750, as shown in the 3-day chart. The recent retracement has brought ETH back toward the 50-day moving average, which now acts as an important line of defense for bulls. After failing to break and hold above the $4,400 level earlier this month, Ethereum entered a corrective phase that mirrors the broader weakness in the altcoin market. Price structure shows lower highs forming since the local top, indicating fading momentum. However, as long as ETH stays above the 100-day moving average near $3,400, the broader uptrend remains technically intact. If the current support holds, Ethereum could attempt another recovery toward $4,000–$4,200, where heavy resistance and previous liquidity clusters are located. A confirmed close above this zone would signal renewed strength and potentially mark the end of this correction phase. On the downside, a decisive breakdown below $3,700 could expose ETH to deeper losses, targeting $3,400 and possibly $3,000, where stronger historical demand lies. For now, Ethereum’s price action remains at a pivotal point — balancing between short-term weakness and the potential for a mid-term recovery.

On Tuesday, the fund recorded almost $477 million in net gains with a big improvement in sentiment from institutional investors. This rebound comes as optimism mounts for a general market recovery before year-end. Analysts believe the slowdown in ETF redemptions signals the early stages of a new Q4 rotation, where capital will move from Bitcoin into high-performing altcoins. As Bitcoin is nearing $113,000, attention is shifting towards DOGE, TRON, and LINK, as they are now ranked among the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next rally . Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting the attention of investors who are seeking strong returns and utility-backed growth before the major uptrend starting in 2025. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Ease as Market Stabilizes Fresh data from SoSoValue shows that nine of twelve U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows on Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT was the largest investor with $210 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $162 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $34 million. These inflows were a clear reversal after more than $1 billion in outflows the previous week. October’s total net inflows have now exceeded $4 billion and have already surpassed the performance of September. Analysts note that this turnaround is due to increasing confidence from institutional and retail investors. Historically, such rebounds are often followed by powerful rotations to altcoins as the liquidity trickles down the market. With the volatility subsiding, traders are now looking at the fourth quarter as a window to find the best crypto to buy before the prices soar again. DOGE Gains Retail Momentum Again Dogecoin (DOGE) is still gaining ground as more companies seek to integrate it with mainstream services. Thumzup Media announced plans for DOGE for micro-payments in its advertising reward platform, and reduced transaction fees and enhanced accessibility globally. Separately, the House of Doge recently took majority ownership in Italian football club U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918, in what was one of the first major crossovers between cryptocurrency and professional sports. These developments are leading to renewed excitement in DOGE’s global community. Analysts believe DOGE’s visibility and growing real-world use will enhance its cause as one of the best crypto to buy before the Q4 rotation picks up steam. TRON Shows Network Strength and Expanding Reach TRON (TRX) continues to strengthen its dominance in the blockchain space with new integrations and records on-chain. The collaboration with Avail enables the network to provide direct interoperability with over ten blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. TRON processes more than $23 billion in daily USDT transfers, with a total supply of more than $77 billion. Its market capitalization climbed 19% in the third quarter to $31.6 billion, with network revenue growing 30% to hit a record $1.2 billion, according to Messar i. Speculation regarding a Coinbase listing has had a further positive impact. Analysts claim that TRON’s robust fundamentals and expanding revenue base make it one of the top cryptos to buy in the face of the Q4 rotation. Source: Messari LINK Attracts Institutional Interest as Whales Accumulate Chainlink (LINK) is displaying renewed confidence from big investors after experiencing a volatile month. Wallets that hold between 100,000 and one million tokens added over 12 million LINK just in recent days. This sharp increase in holdings is a signal of growing trust in the potential of Chainlink in the long term. Source: Santiment With its Oracle services powering a great deal of the DeFi ecosystem, LINK has become a cornerstone of on-chain data reliability. The increase in the long positions also indicates greater conviction from the institutional traders. As capital rotation builds, LINK continues to be one of the best crypto to buy for those aiming for mid-cycle recoveries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Smart-Money Attention As ETF momentum cools, smart money is quietly rotating into high-return projects that have real value in the long term. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged at the center of this movement, bringing a rare combination of good fundamentals and high growth potential to investors. Analysts are predicting MAGACOIN FINANCE will provide up to 1,500% ROI before the end of 2025 – one of the most aggressive predictions of this cycle. This optimism is based on the project’s emphasis on utility and an explicit development roadmap that goes beyond short-term hype. Its planned implementation and clear token model have attracted disciplined investors seeking sustainability and growth. The growing ecosystem in the project and rising participation by investors indicate that early entrants may have a significant upside as the next bull phase approaches. Unlike most speculative tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is laying a foundation that is appealing for retail buyers seeking a replacement for institutional-grade exposure to a credible blockchain. With the market now in accumulation mode, it now stands as one of the best crypto to buy before large-scale capital returns to the altcoin sector. Final Outlook The slowdown in outflows of Bitcoin ETFs has brought optimism to the entire market, which signals that some confidence will be returning among institutional players. Historically, this stability has come ahead of major Q4 rotations, in which capital moves out of Bitcoin and into undervalued altcoins. This time, DOGE, TRON, and LINK are at the forefront of the established assets with accumulating momentum, with MAGACOIN FINANCE as the new wave of high ROI opportunities built on transparency and strong fundamentals. For investors positioning early, this could be the perfect window to place your exposure to the best crypto to buy , before the next explosive leg upwards for the market.

In a recent statement, he outlined new insights into how institutions could be preparing for indirect exposure to the digital asset, even as direct adoption faces several regulatory and operational obstacles. Van Code emphasized that while institutional interest in XRP continues to rise, the process of gaining exposure remains complex. He noted that large organizations cannot simply acquire XRP and store it in personal wallets due to compliance, audit, and security demands. According to him, such entities must maintain regulated custody frameworks, implement stringent auditing processes, and comply with regional financial standards, costing as much as $300,000 annually to maintain. What I am realizing with the bew @evernorthxrp announcement and stagnant XRP price is that it might be harder than we think for institutions to buy and hold XRP. Large companies aren't going to simply setup a Ledger or Xaman wallet and drop $100M in there. They want custody,… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 21, 2025 Institutional Access Through ETFs and Equity Investments Given these challenges, Van Code argued that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and publicly traded companies holding XRP may serve as the most efficient paths for institutions to enter the ecosystem. These structured financial products, he explained, allow for exposure to XRP’s price movement without the need for direct token management. This viewpoint reinforces the growing discussion around the potential introduction of XRP-backed ETFs . Multiple applications for such funds have already been submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), though progress remains stalled due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. The eventual approval of these ETFs could provide a framework for traditional investors to access XRP through regulated financial instruments. At the same time, several firms are announcing plans to establish XRP-based treasuries. Among these, Evernorth’s initiative has drawn the most attention for its scale and institutional backing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evernorth’s Expanding Institutional Role Evernorth, a financial venture closely associated with Ripple, has announced plans to build the largest XRP treasury to date. The company intends to acquire approximately $1 billion worth of XRP, supported by more than $1.1 billion in committed funding from participants, including Ripple and Japan’s SBI Holdings. Once fully operational, the project will launch with an initial pool of over 560 million XRP. According to Van Code, developments like Evernorth illustrate how institutional infrastructure is forming around XRP in ways that could influence long-term adoption. Although these activities have yet to drive immediate price increases, he emphasized that their significance lies in creating a foundation for future liquidity and regulated access. Van Code stated that he is now more bullish than ever on XRP’s institutional trajectory. He placed particular importance on the alignment between initiatives such as Evernorth and the potential introduction of XRP ETFs, noting that both approaches serve to integrate XRP into the broader financial system. Evernorth’s upcoming merger, expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2026, is projected to trigger the next round of XRP acquisitions within ten days of completion. Analysts suggest that this could mark a major step forward in the token’s institutional adoption strategy. As Ripple continues to advance infrastructure development and partnerships through ventures like Evernorth, combined with the future possibility of XRP ETFs, industry observers anticipate a more structured environment for institutional participation. This growing landscape could allow major investors to gain exposure to XRP through secure and compliant channels, representing a significant shift in how the asset is accessed and utilized.

On Wednesday, nearly 40% of total options volume came from a small cluster of stocks with no real business momentum, just heavy internet hype and sky-high short interest, according to data from CNBC. The tickers leading the charge are Beyond Meat’s BYND and Krispy Kreme’s DNUT, names that Reddit traders can’t stop gambling on, despite both companies being in the red revenue-wise. Traders target BYND and DNUT with high-risk options On Wednesday, options traders went ballistic as BYND traded more than 3.3 million contracts, roughly 9.4 times its average 20-day volume.DNUT went even crazier, with contracts trading at 38 times its typical options activity. Both names are under $5 per share, which makes them too cheap for most margin accounts. So retail traders are turning to options, where a few bucks can control hundreds of shares, for the same high-stakes action. The most traded BYND contract was the October 24 weekly $3 put, with 147,000 contracts changing hands at an average of $0.415 per contract.To break even, the stock would need to fall $1, about 28%, within two trading days. Meanwhile, 104,000 contracts were traded on the weekly $4 calls, priced around $1.455. That’s a bet the stock will climb to $5.455, more than 52% higher, before Friday’s close. That’s two moonshots in opposite directions. And at least one will be worthless by 4 p.m. Friday. There’s a reason this happens.These stocks are impossible to borrow, making it difficult for hedge funds to short them directly. But if a stock is loaded with short interest and retail traders push prices up, those funds may be forced to cover, buying shares at higher prices, which makes the rally worse. That’s the game. And it’s why meme traders aren’t tagging along with institutions. They’re betting against them. They want to be David against Goliath. This has nothing to do with earnings. DNUT and BYND both operate real businesses, but neither is profitable. BYND keeps reporting losses. DNUT has weak margins and debt problems. None of that matters. What matters is the story online, the tweets, the TikToks, the posts that spark a frenzy. That’s what sets the price, not revenue or market share projections. Back in 2021, traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum turned stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) into weapons.

Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

The RSI and MACD indicate fading bearish momentum, but a confirmed reversal has not yet occurred. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of October 23, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000727, showing a +2.6% daily gain. The coin’s price sits between the mid-Bollinger line at $0.0000795 and the lower band at $0.0000518, indicating it’s still within a weak recovery phase after prior selling. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD line has crossed slightly above the signal line, indicating a potential re-entry of buyers, but momentum has not yet completely shifted positive. The RSI at 38.9 indicates partial recovery from oversold conditions but remains below the neutral level. To regain strength, FLOKI must close above $0.0000795, opening a path toward $0.000090–$0.00010, while support rests at $0.000052–$0.000060. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour frame, FLOKI trades tightly near $0.0000728, as the Alligator lines flatten, showing consolidation after recent volatility. The MACD bars are fading red, indicating weakening bearish momentum, although buyers haven’t yet reclaimed dominance. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A clear breakout above $0.0000735–$0.0000740 could trigger a short-term rally toward $0.000078–$0.000080, while failure to hold $0.000070 risks another dip toward $0.000066.

Until then, traders can expect tight sideways action with mild upside potential. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Such a consolidation phase could be the calm before a major breakout, as chart patterns hint at a possible pre-rally formation that might propel ETH toward new all-time highs. Potential Right Shoulder Formation Signals Structural Strength Crypto analyst MarketMaestro delivered a detailed technical update on ETH, noting that the asset recently suffered a key rejection at its neckline resistance. Following this failure, the price is now positioned in a crucial retest phase at a red diagonal resistance line that it had previously surpassed. ETH’s market’s success in holding this diagonal is essential to avoid completely losing the bullish momentum built up in the prior moves. Related Reading: Ethereum Slides Gradually — Buyers Losing Control As Market Turns Cautious The analyst further noted that the current price movement suggests ETH could be forming a right shoulder in this region. This structural development is highly significant because the right shoulder simultaneously works to complete two major, highly bullish chart patterns. It is the final component needed to create the handle for the Cup and Handle pattern, while forming a larger Inverse Head and Shoulders (Inverse H&S) pattern. The simultaneous formation of both the Inverse H&S and the Cup and Handle in the same area is extremely rare and powerful, indicating that the market is setting the stage for highly bullish formations for the next quarter. Considering this powerful confluence of classic reversal and continuation patterns, along with the behavior of the broader market index, MarketMaestro views this entire consolidation phase not as weakness but as a logical pre-rally setup. He concludes with a high degree of confidence that the “pain threshold” or the maximum expected downside risk will likely not be very high. Bullish Bias Intact As Long As Support Remains Firm In a recent update, analyst Crypto Candy noted that the ETH scenario remains largely unchanged, despite recent market movements. A key takeaway from the analysis is that the asset is demonstrating significant resilience by strongly holding the crucial support zone between $3,600 and $3,800. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Ethereum Price If Bullish Momentum Holds The analyst reiterated the importance of this specific range, emphasizing that as long as the $3,600–$3,800 zone successfully sustains, the medium-term bullish outlook remains firmly in place. This suggests that buyers are aggressively defending this level, preventing a deeper correction from continuing. Given the strength shown at this support level, Crypto Candy maintains a strong price forecast: the market is expected to target $4,700, with the potential to reach a new ATH. This bullish bias, the analyst concludes, remains valid until the $3,600–$3,800 support zone is breached.

His outlook arrives at a time when the token is under heavy selling pressure, alongside widespread weakness across the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite the current bearish environment, Rector maintains that the ongoing correction forms part of a broader accumulation phase that could lead to a significant uptrend heading into 2025. Rector’s Final 2025 XRP Timeline In a recent post on X, Rector presented a timeline that outlines how XRP might transition from its current downtrend to potentially reach a price between $5 and $12 by December 2025. His projection is based on historical price behavior, particularly XRP’s performance during previous election cycles. Final 2025 XRP Timeline XRP November Pump Coming $5-$12 XRP by first part of December — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) October 22, 2025 The analyst recalled XRP’s trajectory in late 2024, noting that the asset experienced substantial declines before a sharp rebound. Specifically, XRP fell from $0.6540 on Oct. 1, 2024, to $0.4860 by Oct. 25, marking a 25% decline amid broader market uncertainty. At the time, sentiment turned largely negative, with some analysts dismissing the possibility of a major rally. Veteran investor Raoul Pal notably advised traders to shift focus to other assets, labeling projects like XRP and Cardano (ADA) as unlikely to recover meaningfully. However, XRP later invalidated those bearish calls, rebounding dramatically after the U.S. elections in November 2024. From a price of $0.50 on Nov. 4, it climbed to $3.40 by January 2025, gaining over 580% in just two months. XRP Poised for Another Run Toward $5–$12 According to Rector, XRP’s recent movement mirrors the same setup that preceded its 2024 surge. This October, XRP has declined by nearly 49%, forming a structure similar to the 60% retracement observed in early 2017 before the start of XRP’s historic 61,000% rally to $3.31 during the 2017–2018 cycle. Rector applied this historical pattern to XRP’s current logarithmic chart, noting that if the pattern remains consistent, the asset could experience a substantial rise between November and December 2025. He identified November 5, 2025, as a potential turning point for the next major rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst also argued that historical price cycles tend to repeat due to the market’s psychological and structural patterns, with similar setups often preceding significant bullish moves. While he did not provide an exact figure, his range of $5 to $12 aligns with other prominent forecasts within the XRP community. Broader Market Consensus Rector’s outlook adds to growing expectations among analysts that XRP could record significant gains within the next market cycle. Analyst, EGRAG Crypto introduced the “Valhalla Gate” model, suggesting that XRP could rally as high as $12 under favorable conditions. Earlier, in December 2024, the same analyst identified intermediate targets between $6 and $8 as possible milestones before a move toward double-digit prices. While these projections remain speculative, they highlight growing confidence among long-term supporters that XRP’s market structure remains intact despite recent declines. Analysts emphasize that sustained network adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and institutional entry could strengthen the case for renewed growth. If these factors align, XRP could once again defy bearish expectations, with many investors closely watching the final months of 2025 for confirmation of the next major trend.

53557084,612506,1761264034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53557084.jpeg,"Bitcoin Poised To Top $1.5 Million, Says Ex-PayPal President",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-top-1-5-million-ex-paypal-president/,"In a wide-ranging Coin Stories interview published October 21, David Marcus—co-founder and CEO of Lightspark, former president of PayPal and co-creator of Diem, the cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook—laid out a thesis that Bitcoin will ultimately surpass gold in value and evolve from a purely “store-of-value” asset into the invisible, neutral settlement layer of the internet for money. How Bitcoin Could Reach $1.5 Million “I think Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold,” Marcus told host Natalie Brunell. “At today’s gold price, it’s, you know, $1.3 million a bitcoin that [it] will have a higher market cap than gold.” He emphasized he is “decent at directional predictions” but “terrible at timing,” framing the trajectory as inevitable over a five-to-ten-year horizon rather than a near-dated call. The implication of outgrowing gold’s market capitalization places Bitcoin’s potential value well north of $1.3 million per coin and, at Gold’s recent ATH at $4,381.58/oz, above $1.53 million. Marcus’s price view is inseparable from his broader contention that BTC must progress beyond a narrow “digital gold” narrative. Echoing a line from analyst Matt Pines that Brunell cited—“if Bitcoin is only a store of value, it has failed”—Marcus agreed “fully,” but added a critical caveat: the savings-asset phase was a necessary precondition for utility. “We believe that the store-of-value phase is absolutely essential for us to be able to actually build a utility phase of Bitcoin on top of it,” he said, arguing that institutional adoption, ETFs and nation-state accumulation conferred enough legitimacy to begin scaling real-world payments. “Now that every institution… whether it’s BlackRock, Fidelity or others, are actually supporting Bitcoin… we can actually really start building payment utility on top of it.” That utility vision hinges on using Bitcoin more like TCP/IP—an invisible settlement substrate—than as a volatile unit of account for everyday spending. Marcus was blunt about behavioral and economic constraints: “People don’t want to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases because it’s volatile and people want to actually benefit from appreciation… they don’t want to be the Bitcoin pizza guy .” Lightspark’s approach is to move fiat end-to-end while using BTC in the middle. “You can send dollars from a US bank account to someone in Mexico receiving Mexican peso… the settlement asset is Bitcoin in between. So you have dollars, Bitcoin, Mexican peso and it’s invisible to people using it.” Technically, Lightspark is pushing beyond Lightning’s channel model while remaining backward-compatible. Marcus lauded Lightning’s trust model and speed, but highlighted its liquidity and self-custody frictions when scaled to “billions of endpoints.” The company’s newly launched “Spark” is described as a Lightning-compatible, non-channel payment system that enables spinning up “billions of wallets” with “minimal new trust assumptions.” Crucially, he said, it preserves safety valves: “It’s not as trustless as Lightning, but we believe it’s trustless enough and has unilateral exits to Layer 1… you can pull a rip cord and no one can prevent you from recovering your funds on L1.” Stablecoins And Adoption Marcus also argued that stablecoins—despite their centralized issuer model—are an unavoidable component of global payments, and that anchoring them to BTC’s settlement layer enhances resilience. He described a personal “schizophrenic journey” with stablecoins, disliking the “single throat to choke,” yet accepting their ubiquity and attempting to minimize trust by avoiding separate gas tokens and preserving unilateral exits to Bitcoin L1. On adoption, Marcus pointed to shifting institutional sentiment. Recounting a panel in New York “put together by Citadel Securities,” he said a “majority” of a roughly 450-person room of large traditional-finance investors indicated they own BTC, versus far fewer holding ETH , stablecoins, or any token. “This is a room that traditionally would have been very resistant to Bitcoin… now the times have changed so profoundly.” Yet he still framed retail penetration as early, estimating “low hundreds of millions” of unique holders globally and significant headroom from there. Overall, Marcus’ thesis returns to first principles: BTC as neutral, scarce, programmable collateral and a credibly decentralized settlement layer. Dismissing critiques that it lacks “intrinsic value,” he argued, “Underlying scarcity of Bitcoin secured by code is the intrinsic value… this is the only thing that’s deflationary by nature.” That, he contends, is why Bitcoin should outcompete gold over time: “When the first gold ETFs were launched, they started mining more gold.

According to a Reuters article, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against the US tech giant after a mass lawsuit which was brought forward on behalf of iPhone and iPad users in the UK. The case has been valued at an estimated £1.5 billion or $2 billion by the plaintiffs. Apple abused its dominance for five years to shut out competition The Tribunal concluded that Apple abused its dominance from October until the end of 2020 as it shut out competition in the app distribution market and levied “excessive and unfair prices,” as commission from developers. Apple has faced severe regulatory pressure in the US and Europe over its fees and has indicated it will appeal the ruling. It said the ruling “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy”. The lawsuit was led by British academic Dr Rachael Kent, who said that Apple made “exorbitant profits” by excluding all competition for app distribution and in-app purchases. Her lawyers maintained that during the January trial Apple’s “100% monopoly position” allowed it to impose excessive commissions. Dr Kent called the decision a “landmark victory, not only for App Store users, but for anyone who has ever felt powerless against a global tech giant”. In a statement, Dr Kent said that the ruling shows that Britain’s collective action regime is working. “Today’s ruling sends a clear message: no company, however wealthy or powerful, is above the law.” Dr Kent. The CAT’s ruling specified that developers were overcharged by the difference between a 17.5% commission and the commission that the tech giant actually charged, which, according to Dr Kent’s lawyers was typically 30%. The tribunal also concluded that developers passed on the 50% of this overcharge to consumers. Apple wants to appeal Apple said it strongly disagreed and indicated it would appeal. “This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments,” an Apple spokesperson said. “The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections,” added the spokesperson. According to reports, a hearing is now scheduled for next month to define how the damages will be calculated and to hear Apple’s application for permission to appeal. This case represents a significant victory for the UK’s “class action” style legal regime. It also marks the first mass lawsuit against a major tech company to go to trial under the system, which has reached its 10 th anniversary this year. It has seen multi-billion-pound cases certified for trial but limited success for consumers so far. According to Reuters, there are many other cases waiting in the wings, including one against Google over the commission it charges app developers for access to its Play Store. This case is expected to begin in October next year and will be heard alongside a similar claim by Epic Games, which is engaged in parallel litigation with Apple in the US. Other tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft are also facing sizeable claims at the CAT. The ruling also comes at a time after Apple was hit with a complaint to European antitrust regulators over the terms and conditions of its App Store under rules aimed at reining in Big Tech.

With markets recalibrating after months of volatility, investors are zeroing in on projects that balance innovation with strong fundamentals. The surge of interest in the best crypto presales to join now shows how the market is shifting from hype to utility. Stellar’s blockchain efficiency, Toncoin’s Web3 integration, and BullZilla’s explosive presale growth each tell a different story of momentum, but one stands out as the next major player for 2025. Among the three, BullZilla ($BZIL) is capturing the spotlight with its rapid fundraising, growing community, and ROI potential that dwarfs even early-stage Ethereum or Shiba Inu levels. Its structured presale, governed by scarcity and transparent growth stages, is redefining how investors perceive early crypto opportunities. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Titan of Presales and the Best Crypto Presale to Join Now Introducing BullZilla, the project rewriting the playbook for the best crypto presales to join now and early-stage investing. Currently in Stage 7D (Bag Signal Activated), the token is priced at $0.00018573, having already raised over $960K from 3,100+ holders and sold 31 billion tokens. This staggering momentum reflects a community-driven surge and strong investor belief in its mechanics. The Mechanics Behind the Bull Run BullZilla’s structure is built on three revolutionary systems: the Progressive Price Engine, which automatically raises prices every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours; a 24-stage burn mechanism ensuring long-term scarcity; and staking tiers offering up to 70% APY in the HODL Furnace. These elements create sustained upward pressure on token value and reward long-term holders, distinguishing BullZilla from short-lived hype coins. $4,000 Today, a Roaring Future Tomorrow: BullZilla’s ROI Projection An investment of $4,000 at the current price of $0.00018573 would secure approximately 21.5 million BZIL tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.00527, this would equate to $113,305, a 2,738.21% ROI, or 3,130.08% for the earliest investors. With the next price hike of +3.59% approaching as Stage 8 begins, the clock is ticking for new investors aiming to capitalize before the next tier activates. BullZilla’s presale isn’t just about speculation; it’s about strategy. By linking growth to verifiable metrics and blockchain transparency, it builds investor confidence while fueling excitement for its eventual exchange debut. How to Join the BullZilla Presale Getting started with BullZilla is simple. Set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, then purchase ETH or USDT via a trusted exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Visit the official BullZilla presale website, connect your wallet, and swap your ETH or USDT for $BZIL tokens. The tokens lock automatically during the presale, ensuring security and transparency, and can be claimed after the sale ends. Vesting and reward details are fully visible on the dashboard, maintaining a fair ecosystem for every participant. Stellar (XLM): Resilient in Volatility Stellar (XLM) is trading near $0.3095 after a 1.51% daily dip, yet its fundamentals remain strong. With a market cap of $9.9 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $15.47 billion, Stellar holds its rank as the 14th-largest crypto globally. A 13.01% surge in daily trading volume to $218.46 million signals sustained investor participation despite mild market pullbacks. While prices sit far below the 2018 all-time high of $0.9381, XLM has gained 25,123% since its 2014 low, an astonishing return that underscores long-term potential. Stellar continues to drive cross-border payment innovation and asset tokenization, cementing its reputation as one of the most stable blockchain ecosystems. Analysts expect that as traditional finance integrates tokenized assets, Stellar’s network could benefit significantly from new liquidity inflows and institutional adoption. Toncoin (TON): Web3 Connectivity on the Rise Toncoin (TON) has slipped 1.53% in the past 24 hours to $2.12, extending a brief correction amid rising trading activity. With a market cap of $5.34 billion and $155.17 million in daily volume, it remains a top-25 crypto powerhouse. The fully diluted valuation of $10.9 billion highlights Toncoin’s growing appeal across both consumer and developer segments. Despite being well below its June 2024 high of $8.24, Toncoin is still up 442.58% from its 2021 low of $0.3906, proving resilience amid wider market turbulence. Analysts attribute the dip to short-term profit-taking as traders rebalance portfolios. However, Toncoin’s deep integration with Telegram and its expanding Web3 ecosystem provide it with unique leverage. Its mission to bridge messaging, decentralized finance, and NFT applications positions Toncoin as one of the most versatile blockchain projects of this decade. Conclusion: Why BullZilla Is the Top Choice Among the Best Crypto Presales to Join Now Stellar’s resilience and Toncoin’s technological integration prove that strong fundamentals matter, but in this cycle, innovation tied to investor participation is driving momentum. BullZilla stands at the intersection of transparency, utility, and timing, giving investors a clear entry into one of the best crypto presales to join now before its next price surge. As the crypto market eyes 2025’s potential rebound, BullZilla’s momentum-driven mechanics and ROI trajectory make it impossible to ignore. Those who recognize its structure today may find themselves in the same position early Ethereum or Dogecoin holders once did, watching a bold idea transform into a market leader.

As volatility decreases, and Bitcoin holding major levels, altcoins already exhibit initial recovery patterns. Cardano is one of them, where its long-form symmetrical triangle pattern is narrowing down to a possible breakout in Q4. ADA would also soar up to 70% in case the support at $0.62 is met. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE keeps drawing presale investors who are eager to get the next boom in the crypto sphere. ADA Technical Outlook: Symmetrical Triangle Nears Q4 Breakout Most recently, Cardano is trading at approximately $0.64, and it is barely above the major support of $0.62, which has been supporting the structure of ADA over the past few months. This area coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and forms the foundation of a one-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Analyst Ali Charts believes a holding above $0.62 will maintain the bullish structure, and a possible rally to $1.90 can follow. ADAUSD 12-Hour Chart | Source: X The apex of the formation is in late Q4 2025, meaning that a decisive move is coming soon. When ADA crosses the downward trendline at approximately $0.70, the following levels of resistance will be at $0.95, $1.28, and $1.86 according to Fibonacci projections. Both are zones of historical reactions at which Cardano has been stalling or backtracking on rallies earlier. Momentum indicators also justify a pending change. The MACD line is slightly lower than the signal line, however, the close margin and the disappearing red bars indicate that force of selling is decreasing. The RSI reading of 40 points suggests a market is still recovering and still has room to grow, should buyers regain control. Taken together, the structure indicates that as Q4 continues, Cardano is gearing towards volatility growth. Market Sentiment and Open Interest Reflect Caution Derivatives data indicate that traders remain cautious. According to Coinglass , ADA’s futures open interest has declined sharply from $1.8 billion in mid-September to $648.56 million, a 64% drop. The decrease shows a lower demand for speculative exposure, signaling more conservative positioning across the market. Historically, such phases of reduced open interest have preceded large directional moves once new volume returns. On-chain data shows steady accumulation as non-exchange wallets continue to grow, while developers advance scalability upgrades such as Hydra and Mithril . Institutional inflows since Q3 further reflect growing confidence ahead of potential network expansions. Bitcoin Steadies Above $108K Ahead of Key Market Shift Bitcoin has been trading at $108,000 following a rebound from early-October lows of close to $103,000. The recovery indicates decreasing pressure after volatility spike last month. The biggest crypto in terms of market cap added 0.8% today, trading in a tight range amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Although momentum was muted, the steady level of Bitcoin above the $108K price offers a reference point to the overall market sentiment. Traditionally, ADA and other significant altcoins are known to track the mid-cycle recoveries of Bitcoin, especially when volatility is compressed. According to analysts, the current consolidation phase of BTC can become a boost off the ground into a larger Q4 recovery should the volume of purchases rise. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks With traders keeping an eye on the next move by ADA, presale investors are moving to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new Ethereum-based project that is gaining momentum among investors. The token has received attention due to its transparent tokenomics, anti-whale design, and verified Hashex audit . All these factors support its credibility among early-stage projects. In addition, the current PATRIOT50X bonus program is creating a booming presale, giving early investors additional tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised millions, and analysts have listed it as one of their top Q4 picks since it has a growing community and a practical utility plan. The social traction the project has experienced makes it a unique project in a market that seeks reliable opportunities in the face of volatility. Conclusion The symmetrical triangle formation of Cardano indicates a breakout is imminent, as the support of $0.62 is still the pivotal point. A successful defense would cause a rally to $1.90, which coincides with Bitcoin holding steadily above $108K and improving mood on the crypto markets. Meanwhile, presale investors are making use of new opportunities beyond traditional assets. Having good fundamentals, an engaged community, and an active incentive program called PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains among the best altcoins to buy today before being listed on exchanges.

Meanwhile, Oracle’s new dual chief executives recently defended the firm’s massive new investmen t in data centers, stating that it will provide computing firepower and a suite of bundled services that will make artificial intelligence more useful for businesses. “We’re really in a unique situation to deliver what we call applied AI,” said Mike Sicilia, the former president of Oracle Industries, who was appointed as the CEO of the company last month. That includes infrastructure, analytics, and applications, he said in an interview. Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s former president of cloud infrastructure, was also named a chief executive. They arrive just as fears of an A.I. bubble are metastasizing rapidly. Oracle shares spiked by over 40% last month after the cloud firm said that it had added $317 billion in future contract revenue as part of its latest quarter that ended on Aug. 31. A lot of that new revenue originated from a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Investors and tech analysts have raised questions over the past month about how much the new build-out depends on OpenAI, which won’t beco me profitable until 2029, according to Sam Altman, the chief executive of the ChatGPT maker. Credit ratings firm Moody’s last month indicated risks to Oracle’s balance sheet due to the extent to which its future AI data centers rely on OpenAI. At the beginning of October, Oracle shares fell as much as 7.1%—though they quickly recovered—after a report suggesting that its margins on renting specialized Nvidia chips were razor-thin. Investor demand for AI debt surges as Vantage and Meta deals set new benchmarks Investors across the spectrum have been eager to gain early exposure to AI, with banks and private credit firms vying to lead vast debt packages that finance the boom. Meta Platforms Inc. recently chose Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. to arrange a $29 billion debt and equity deal for the company’s data-center expansion in rural Louisiana. The Vantage debt comes about a week after other bonds issued to facilitate the Meta deal began trading in secondary markets, jumping as much as 10 cents on the dollar and yielding Pimco paper profits of approximately $2 billion. Both Vantage facilities are due to mature in four years, with two one-year extension options, and priced at around 2.5 percentage points over the benchmark, the people said. Like the project and commercial real estate financings, the loans are to be structured as interest-only during construction but amortize once operations begin, according to the people. The managers finalized the second round of underwriting early this week, at which the debt was allotted to other banks and institutional investors, they said. Don’t just read crypto news.

According to the Cupertino-based tech company, these servers play a crucial role in their pledge to invest approximately $600 billion in the US, particularly in advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives. Following this move, US President Donald Trump expressed his pleasure with Apple’s decision, urging the tech giant and other tech firms to expand their production within the United States. Apple pledges to make significant investments in the US Apple began implementing its plan to produce AI servers at its factory in Houston, Texas, earlier this year. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant first shared its intention to create US servers in February this year before making significant moves later. Regarding the tech company’s triumph in the AI ecosystem, Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan commented that these servers will support the firm’s Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services, which are scheduled to be announced this week. Currently, Apple is utilizing its own silicon technology in its Apple Intelligence servers, Khan said. The Chief Operating Officer’s remarks came after he acknowledged, “Our teams have done an excellent job accelerating the work to get the new Houston factory operating ahead of schedule, and we plan to keep expanding the facility to enhance production next year.” Meanwhile, when Apple was implementing its plan, the tech giant viewed the Houston factory as an opportunity for several individuals to secure jobs. According to the tech company, the factory was set to create thousands of jobs. Notably, Apple servers were previously made overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook took the initiative to meet with Trump in August to demonstrate the company’s commitment to further invest in the US. At this time, Cook promised the president that the tech giant would invest particularly in semiconductor firms via a program known as the American Manufacturing Program. Apart from the pledge, the CEO also presented Trump with a gift from Corning Glass, produced in the US. Interestingly, the Corning glass is used in iPhones and Apple Watches. Additionally, the tech firm introduced a manufacturing academy in partnership with Michigan State in July. Industry experts weighed in on the discussion, pointing out that although Trump has recently praised Cook and acknowledged Apple for its commitment to invest in the US, the president has often called on the tech giant to produce its iPhones in the country. Therefore, according to them, this shift will likely take years and be expensive. Apple admits to strongly supporting the US manufacturing sector The Trump administration had earlier requested tariffs that could affect Apple’s operations. However, after several considerations, they decided to cancel them. In response to this action, Apple revealed that it would import computers and phones from China, India, and Vietnam to the United States. This was confirmed after Cook stated that Apple strongly supports the US’s manufacturing sector by partnering with domestic semiconductor suppliers. He further explained that Apple’s investment and expertise play a role in developing chips entirely made and packaged in the country. “You can add a lot by making it global and then connecting the entire supply chain for semiconductors,” Cook added. Afterwards, the CEO acknowledged that he could not emphasize enough the crucial role the US semiconductor sector plays in their operation and the significant contribution it will make to their efforts. Despite managing to keep Trump’s tariffs off its back, Apple is still facing high costs , and this time it’s landing directly on customers. As per the briefing document obtained, CEO Tim Cook offered President Donald Trump a $100 billion sweetener to protect Apple’s supply chain. In exchange, Trump spared Apple from semiconductor tariffs that could have doubled the price of chips. Last month, Tim Cook presented Trump with a gold-and-glass plaque before reporters, thanking him for “putting American innovation and jobs front and center.” The gesture marked Apple’s expanded $600 billion US investment pledge over a five-year period. Yet behind the show of goodwill, the company is quietly preparing to raise iPhone prices — and it’s no coincidence. Get seen where it counts.

Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price – Bullish Momentum Soon? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Ethereum is trading above its Realized Price at approximately $2,300. Dubbing the price level a “fundamental support zone,” the analyst said that historically, any dips below this level have marked a capitulation phase. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Ethereum Price If Bullish Momentum Holds For the uninitiated, Realized Price represents the average cost basis of all ETH holders, calculated by dividing the total value of all ETH at the time they last moved on-chain by the current circulating supply. Realized Price effectively shows the “true” average price investors paid, serving as a key indicator of whether the market is in profit or loss. As long as ETH trades above Realized Price, the market structure is likely to remain bullish. The analyst also highlighted Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. Notably, ETH holders are currently, on average, at 67% profit relative to their cost basis. This metric gives two major hints about the current market. First, it shows that although the market is profitable, it is still far from “overheated” levels. Second, it indicates that market participants are confident about the market’s upward momentum, but not quite euphoric. To explain, the MVRV ratio compares the market value of an asset to its realized value. A higher MVRV indicates holders are sitting on larger unrealized profits – often signaling potential overvaluation – while a lower MVRV suggests undervaluation or market fear. Further, TeddyVision noted Ethereum’s reaction from the Upper Realized Price Band, which is currently located around $5,300. The analyst remarked: Price pulled back before reaching the “Overheating Zone. This isn’t a reversal – it’s a consolidation phase after distribution, a healthy cooldown without structural damage. Finally, spot inflows of ETH to crypto exchanges are also slowing down, hinting that the next leg up for the digital asset will likely depend on fresh liquidity, and not leverage. To sum it up, Ethereum is slowly moving from the distribution phase to the consolidation phase. Is It A Good Time To Buy ETH? While providing reliable future predictions in the crypto market remains a challenging task, fresh on-chain and exchange data point toward ETH regaining its bullish momentum. For instance, Binance funding rates recently hinted that ETH could surge to $6,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For Breakout? SOPR Trend Hints At $5,000 Upside Similarly, ETH reserves on exchanges continue to fall at a rapid pace. Earlier this month, ETH supply on exchanges hit a multi-year low, increasing the probability of a potential “supply crunch” that can dramatically increase ETH’s price. That said, crypto analyst Nik Patel recently cautioned that ETH’s price correction may not yet be fully over. At press time, ETH trades at $3,849, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours.
