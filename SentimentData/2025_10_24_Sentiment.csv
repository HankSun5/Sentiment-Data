53553924,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87353,1761257119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Investors: $5 is the First Move of Many on the Next Impulse,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-investors-5-is-the-first-move-of-many-on-the-next-impulse/,"A quiet but powerful sentiment is spreading across the XRP community, one that suggests the digital asset may be preparing for its next major rally. After months of sideways movement and fading momentum, analysts are beginning to see signs of life returning to XRP’s long-term structure. Among them is respected market analyst ChartNerd, who believes XRP could be on the brink of a significant bullish impulse, with $5 serving as just the opening move. Technical Structure: A Channel That Holds the Key On the weekly timeframe, XRP’s price has been oscillating within an ascending parallel channel, a formation that typically precedes extended bullish runs once resistance is decisively broken. Each test of the lower boundary has seen buyers defend key levels, while the upper trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance. This consistent price symmetry has created a well-defined roadmap: a sustained rebound from current support zones could set the stage for a breakout toward higher highs. At present, XRP trades near the lower region of this structure, around $2.40, hinting at a potential pivot point. The channel’s upper boundary, near $4.50 to $5.00, aligns perfectly with the analyst’s projected short-term target. $XRP is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the horizon. Channel support awaits below, with HLs on the weekly MACD, and SRSI levels in oversold territory. $5 is the first move of many on the next impulse. I believe XRP will front-run within the bluechips category – #NFA pic.twitter.com/uCtPmOb2wz — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 23, 2025 Momentum Shifts: Weekly MACD and Stochastic RSI Align Beyond the visible channel, momentum indicators are flashing encouraging signals. The weekly MACD histogram, which tracks trend strength, has been printing a series of higher lows, a classic bullish divergence that often precedes upward reversals. This suggests that bearish momentum is weakening, even as prices hover near support. Supporting this outlook, the Stochastic RSI (SRSI) has entered deeply oversold territory, an area that typically marks exhaustion among sellers. When both the MACD and SRSI align in this manner, it strengthens the case for a medium- to long-term reversal, precisely the foundation of ChartNerd’s bullish thesis. Market Context: The “Blue-Chip” Advantage XRP’s position among top-tier digital assets gives it an advantage as broader market cycles turn. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue leading the market’s next macro leg, XRP, often categorized as a blue-chip altcoin, could front-run its peers in performance, benefiting from renewed liquidity and investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This possibility becomes even more compelling when coupled with Ripple’s ongoing real-world integrations and adoption of RLUSD, the company’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. These developments strengthen the network’s utility narrative, giving technical setups stronger fundamental backing. The $5 Target: A Launchpad, Not a Ceiling ChartNerd’s analysis underscores that $5 is not the destination but the beginning of a broader impulsive wave. The move, if validated by volume and confirmed breakout patterns, could reestablish XRP as a leading performer in the digital asset market. Still, traders must remain cautious: while technical signals are aligning, execution depends on market sentiment, regulatory stability, and macroeconomic conditions. Technicals Hint, Market Confirms The convergence of technical and momentum factors paints a promising picture for XRP. With channel support intact, momentum indicators turning upward, and broader market structure improving, the stage appears set for a potential rally. As ChartNerd’s analysis suggests, $5 could be only the first step, an opening act in what might become a defining move for XRP in the next market cycle. In a space driven by sentiment and structure alike, XRP’s chart is quietly sending a message: the next impulse might be closer than it seems .

53554188,https://cryptonews.com/?p=442805,1761257767,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53554188.jpeg,China Is Third-Largest Contributor To Global Bitcoin Mining: Why It Matters,https://cryptonews.com/news/china-is-third-largest-contributor-to-global-bitcoin-mining-why-it-matters/,"China was once the undisputed center for Bitcoin mining. Known for its cheap power and access to leading hardware manufacturers, all of this positioned China as a leader in global Bitcoin mining. However, this changed when mining was banned by the Chinese government in 2021 . In late September 2021, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) further banned all cryptocurrency transactions. The PBOC cited the role of cryptocurrencies in facilitating financial crime as well as posing a growing risk to China’s financial system. Fast-forward to today—despite the government’s strong efforts to weed out all crypto miners, many have found ways to continue operations . According to the Q4 2025 update of Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map , China currently accounts for 14.05% of Bitcoin’s total compute power, or roughly 145 exahashes per second (EH/s). This is a modest rise from 13.8% in Q3. Source: Luxor China Leads in Global Bitcoin Mining Kaan Farahani, research associate at Luxor, told Cryptonews that Luxor’s Global Hashrate Map estimates the geographic distribution of Bitcoin mining activity across the world. “The map provides weighted hashrate concentration across regions by incorporating mining pool data, ASIC trading flows, and firmware adoption trends,” Farahani said. Based on the recent data, China is the third-largest contributor globally to Bitcoin mining , just behind the U.S. and Russia. Luxor’s findings do not show where specifically the hashrate resides. According to Miner Weekly , multiple sources across the ASIC supply chain have pointed to one possible destination, which is Xinjiang. The region’s relative isolation and abundant energy resources have made it a longtime hub for Bitcoin mining before China’s ban in 2021. China Reveals Underground Bitcoin Mining Operations While China’s continuation of Bitcoin mining may not come as a complete shock, this illustrates the murky, underground nature of the mining industry. Kent Halliburton, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin mining platform Sazmining, told Cryptonews that he is not surprised to see mining still occurring in China. “This is one of the beauties of Bitcoin mining. It’s a cypherpunk way to generate Bitcoin, meaning that as long as you have electricity and hardware, you can generate Bitcoin for yourself. It’s tough to shut down mining on the outskirts, and that is why I believe the hashrate we see in China continues to exist,” Halliburton said. Other regions where Bitcoin mining is considered illegal are also showing signs of growth. For example, Farahani noted that Luxor’s Hashrate Map gives insight into Iran, estimating that around 8 EH/s of hashrate is operational in the region as of Q4-2025. This represents 0.75% of global market share. According to Halliburton, Iran is another good example of where Bitcoin mining has been occurring, but has largely been illegal . Iran initially banned Bitcoin mining in May of 2021 for four months. The region’s second ban took place in December 2021. Prior to this, Iran’s bitcoin mining was estimated to make up between 4% and 8% of the global BTC network. “Essentially, any country with stringent controls on capital outflows is likely to restrict or attempt to ban Bitcoin mining,” Halliburton said. “But if you have power, you can generate Bitcoin as long as you have the right hardware to harness it. That means that if you’re trying to stem the flow of capital from leaving your country, you have a way to do that with Bitcoin mining.” China’s Concerning Mining Infrastructure Empire In addition to mining, recent findings from Bitcoin solutions manufacturer Auradine found that over 95% of Bitcoin ASIC mining equipment is manufactured by Chinese firms like Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan. Auradine’s report notes that Chinese equipment manufacturing poses a major threat to U.S. national security and key infrastructure. Sanjay Gupta, chief strategy officer at Auradine, told Cryptonews that China’s mining infrastructure operations are concerning for a number of reasons. For instance, he mentioned that there are over a million Chinese-based Bitcoin mining machines with foreign firmware connected to the U.S. electrical grid. “This poses a potential serious cybersecurity risk to the electrical grid across multiple states,” Gupta said. “If there is embedded software in these Chinese miners that is triggered for a coordinated cyber attack to drive a large number of miners to simultaneously go in rapid over- or underdrive, this could cause a catastrophic failure of the U.S. electrical grid.” And they would have gotten away with it too, if not for President Xi and President Putin. China, Russia and co-operative nations within BRICS have enough control over BTC mining repositories to bring Bitcoin to ZERO. The U.S. will not get away with this. pic.twitter.com/Ylx81nBFw0 — Inevitable China (@InevitableChina) September 8, 2025 Gupta added that the BTC mining hardware supply being highly concentrated poses a major risk of a potential 51% takeover of the bitcoin protocol in a hostile geopolitical situation. This has become even more of a threat with the recent tariffs imposed on China by President Trump, which could rise to 155% in the coming weeks . “This could cause a dramatic impact on the value of BTC and ripple effect in financial markets,” Gupta remarked. Is China A Threat To Bitcoin Miners? It’s clear that Bitcoin mining and manufacturing continue to take place in China despite bans. So what does this mean for miners based in regions where BTC mining is considered legal? According to Farahani, Luxor is unaware of challenges or threats based on China’s mining operations. On the other hand, Gupta believes that Chinese firms supplying mining equipment will create complexities for other regions. “To combat this, we need to enable strong U.S.-based Bitcoin mining suppliers that can drive continuous innovation and performance for mining operations,” he said. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China are having a significant and costly impact on the Bitcoin mining industry. According to a new report from The Miner Mag, rising tariffs on mining equipment have exposed American companies to substantial financial liabilities.… — Dr Martin Hiesboeck (@MHiesboeck) August 21, 2025 Gupta added that moving forward, Bitcoin miners should have technology that allows energy demand response with the ability to rapidly increase or decrease power consumption based on the needs of a state or region’s electrical grid. In the meantime, the architecture and legacy of mining in China will likely continue to loom over the global network. In crypto’s ever‑shifting world, China isn’t gone—but rather simply operating in the margins.

Polymarket Bettors Place Bets On CZ’s Potential Binance Return In a poll on Polymarket’s website labeled “Will CZ return to Binance by December 31,” odds that Zhao would return to the crypto exchange shot up to 82%.

However, by Friday evening, the poll showed Zhao’s odds of returning to the crypto organization stabilizing around 36%. Donald Trump Pardons CZ, Former Binance CEO Teases Book Reports emerged on Thursday morning that Trump had decided to pardon Zhao after the former Binance CEO pled guilty to money laundering violations at the crypto exchange back in 2023. As part of the resolution , Binance agreed to pay over $4 billion in forfeiture while Zhao was ordered to pay $50 million in fines. “President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she added. Following the news, Zhao took to X on Thursday morning to share his gratitude for receiving clemency and thank his supporters for “congratulatory messages.” Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice.

This year’s “Uptober” rally came to an abrupt end after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a decision that sent shockwaves through global markets and triggered one of the steepest single-day declines in the crypto sector in months. As the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting draws closer, traders are adopting a wait-and-see approach, seeking clues about potential monetary easing that could help revive risk-friendly investors. Crypto believers, however, interpret the current correction as a healthy reset. Historically, deep market pullbacks eliminate excessive leverage and speculative positions, creating the foundation for more sustainable long-term rallies. World Liberty Financial (WLFI): ChatGPT Predicts the President’s Crypto Could Rise to Match his Favourite Fiat Currency World Liberty Financial ($WLFI) is President Trump’s crypto play, and it seeks to demonstrate what decentralized finance can achieve by merging innovation, governance, and freedom in a single ecosystem. Source: ChatGPT With Presidential backing and bold ambitions, WLFI empowers users to participate in a transparent, community-driven financial network designed for real-world impact. Built on Ethereum using the Aave protocol, details of the project are closely guarded, but we know that it is likely to facilitate lending to institutions and everyday users while likely aiming to play a big part in stablecoins should the technology take off, as it’s widely expected to do. WLFI hasn’t been out long enough to have lots of data about its trends, but it’s currently the 41st biggest crypto on the market with a capitalization of $3.8 billion. WLFI is interesting because it is a demonstration of how Trump’s business interests align with crypto. This could act as a positive catalyst in spurring legislation to arrive quicker, as US crypto companies still await needed clarity on how they should act. Should that happen, then WLFI could conceivably rise to the cost of $1, maybe not in the one week left of the month, but by Christmas. Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Powerhouse Could Double in a Week, Predicts ChatGPT Aave ($AAVE) remains a powerhouse in decentralized finance, offering users the ability to lend, borrow, and earn passive income through an intuitive and secure protocol. Its trailblazing feature suite includes flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain support, all of which have made AAVE a cornerstone of the DeFi revolution. With continual innovation, strong community governance, and growing institutional adoption, Aave isn’t just keeping pace with the future of finance; it’s one of the early builders. ChatGPT sees the price of Aave could leap from $227 to $500. Given the short notice, only a seriously big announcement could make Aave rise that high. However, Aave has entered a technical setup that looks like an expanding triangle. If this triangle is confirmed by continued upward movement (Aave rose 4% in the last 24 hours), then Aave could easily hit the $500 stretch target any time between here and the New Year. Sui Network: Can This Altcoin Surpass Ethereum and Cardano? Sui Network ($SUI) continues to attract attention as one of the more promising altcoins, presenting itself as a blockchain that surpasses Ethereum’s performance. Although claims of being an “Ethereum killer” often depend on perspective and use case, Sui’s biggest edge lies in its speed. The network reportedly processes up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), dwarfing Ethereum’s average throughput of around 15 TPS. Over the past 24 hours, Sui has climbed 3%, reaching $2.50. According to ChatGPT’s projections, the coin could maintain steady momentum with a measured target of $5 by the New Year. This growth outlook is thanks to Sui’s advanced smart contract framework, impressive scalability, and focus on cross-chain interoperability. Should the broader market re-enter a bull phase, as many anticipate, Sui could realistically achieve the $10 mark by Christmas. Technical indicators reinforce this view, with the token breaking out of a bullish flag pattern that formed between January and late March, typically a sign of sustained upward potential. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI) Finally, A fresh contender in the meme coin scene Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is already gaining serious traction despite not hitting exchanges yet. Its presale phase has attracted over $3.7 million in early investments from traders looking to catch the next viral crypto phenomenon. Dogecoin’s risk-mainlining cousin, Maxi Doge, offers community-driven degeneracy with a narrative that is captivating meme coin volatility surfers. Launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, MAXI promises faster, more affordable, and environmentally conscious transactions than Dogecoin. It promotes itself through lively Telegram and Discord communities, delivering trading contests and influencer partnerships to build early momentum. Out of its total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” which will finance marketing efforts, ecosystem expansion, and future collaborations. Staking is already available, offering returns as high as 82% APY, though this yield will gradually decrease as more participants join. Currently priced at $0.0002645 in the presale, MAXI’s value is set to rise incrementally with each funding round. You can purchase tokens using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Within days, markets crashed hard after President Trump declared a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting investors to adopt a risk-off stance ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting. Even so, several analysts interpret this retracement as a healthy consolidation phase, flushing out excess leverage and weak hands before a more sustained climb. Here are three standout altcoins showing significant upside potential. Hyperliquid: The DEX Creating a New Class of Crypto Millionaires Introduced late last year, Hyperliquid and its native $HYPE token have rapidly emerged as a top contender in the decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. Operating on its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid prioritizes transparency and transaction efficiency. Unlike centralized exchanges, it allows users to maintain full custody of their assets, a feature that has gained prominence since the collapse of CEX giants such as FTX. With minimal trading fees, lightning-fast order execution, and advanced features like perpetual derivatives, Hyperliquid successfully blends the convenience of centralized platforms with the trustless nature of DEXs. Price action since launch shows robust bullish trends. Two bullish flag formations appeared between late winter and early spring, patterns often preceding substantial price rallies. Between early April and May 26, HYPE’s price skyrocketed from roughly $10 to $40, a fourfold increase. The chart also displays multiple cup-and-handle formations, indicating persistent accumulation from major investors. Now HYPE’s support and resistance lines since then have entered an expanding channel, which gives HYPE plenty of potential for a rapid bounce. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Strongest Competitor and This Week’s Top Performer Solana ($SOL) continues to solidify its standing as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. With a market capitalization surpassing $104 billion and over $11 billion locked across its DeFi protocols, Solana’s ecosystem expansion remains impressive. Market participants are closely monitoring prospects for U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional capital inflows similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF effects. After bottoming near $100 in April, SOL now trades close to $191. Growing regulatory clarity has boosted confidence, while technical readings, including an RSI of 44, a 4% gain in 24 hours, and moving to converge with its 30-day moving average, indicate that SOL may be undervalued at current prices and is likely to rise going into the weekend. Key support lies around $150, with heavy resistance at $250. A decisive breakout above this resistance could propel SOL toward its all-time high of $293.31, or even above $500 if a full-scale bull market develops. Ripple (XRP): The 2025 Leader in Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , serves as the foundation of a payment network known for ultra-fast transactions and minimal fees, offering a modern alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Supported by the UN Capital Development Fund and linked with several major U.S. financial institutions, XRP has climbed to become the third-largest crypto asset by market value, standing at approximately $144.3 billion. Ripple’s introduction of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, highlights its intention to capture a portion of the expanding stablecoin market. Over the past year, XRP has surged 357%, reaching a seven-year peak of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% gain over the same timeframe. With an RSI around 39 and trading below its 30-day moving average, XRP appears primed for another move upward. Technical indicators also show two bullish flag formations during the summer months, pointing to further growth potential if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto legislation could push XRP toward the $5–$10 range. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The 2025 Meme Coin Revolutionizing Bitcoin’s Potential Finally, one that’s too early-stage to be listed on exchanges: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has rapidly become one of the most discussed presales of 2025. Designed to amplify Bitcoin’s scalability and speed through a Layer-2 infrastructure, it delivers lightning-fast and cost-efficient transfers, packaged in a meme coin format. The project incorporates decentralized governance through a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and exceptional transaction throughput on its custom-built Layer-2 framework. With over $24.6 million raised in presale funding, analysts project potential 10x or higher returns after launch. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s network features a streamlined Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, full dApp compatibility, and built-in meme coin integrations. Additionally, a recent Coinsult audit reported zero vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. The HYPER token fuels essential ecosystem functions, including staking, governance, and transaction processing, rewarding early participants with staking yields reaching 48% APY.

53555289,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=843839,1761259588,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53555289.jpeg,Luxury automaker Porsche reverses EV strategy amid weak China demand,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/luxury-automaker-porsche-changes-ev-strategy/,"Porsche is pulling back from its electric vehicle plans, thanks to weak demand in China amid a frenzy in a crowded market that has erased almost two-thirds of its stock value since May 2023. The luxury carmaker is cutting investment in battery-powered models and redirecting funds toward petrol and hybrid engines, according to the Financial Times . The change will be led by Michael Leiters, who takes over as Porsche’s new chief executive in January. Leiters has never been shy about his doubts over electric cars. “The technology isn’t ready,” he told the Financial Times last year while still running McLaren. He argued that EVs don’t offer the emotional thrill of traditional engines and lose value much faster. Leiters began his career at Porsche two decades ago as an assistant to a former CEO before moving to Ferrari as chief technology officer and then to McLaren as its top executive. Now he’s returning to the company that trained him, with the task of undoing years of overly ambitious electric planning. Leiters takes charge as Porsche faces pressure in China and the U.S. Leiters replaces Oliver Blume, who managed Porsche while also running Volkswagen. That dual role looked efficient when profits were strong, but after a series of warnings this year, it’s clear the brand needs a full-time leader. Automotive analyst Stephen Reitman from Bernstein said Porsche cut its 2025 operating margin forecast from 14 percent to just 0–2 percent. The company still targets 10–15 percent in the midterm, but Reitman warned it will “take some time before we even get to that.” The brand’s biggest problem is China. Sales there, once a key growth engine, have plunged nearly 40 percent since 2022 as local carmakers flooded the luxury EV segment. The U.S. market hasn’t been kinder. New tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump will now hit every Porsche vehicle imported from Europe, since the company has no American factories. That extra cost threatens to squeeze profits even further, worsening its dependence on Europe and shrinking global margins. Inside its factories, the pain is already visible. Porsche confirmed earlier this year that it will cut 3,900 jobs — about 9 percent of its workforce — by 2029. Talks with labor unions are ongoing as it seeks more cost reductions. On the technology side, Sajjad Khan, board member for IT and software, said the company is fixing persistent EV delays caused by software problems. “We have to work hard to execute perfectly,” Khan said, adding that improvements in quality and reliability should arrive by 2026 or 2027. Porsche cancels new SUV and revives gas engines amid restructuring As part of the overhaul, Porsche has canceled its upcoming all-electric SUV and booked an impairment charge of €1.8 billion for related development costs. It’s also reversing a previous decision to stop building petrol or hybrid versions of its top sellers, the Macan and Cayman. Analysts see this as an admission that the EV rollout under Blume went too far. Metzler Research analyst Pal Skirta said Porsche had been “too bullish” on electrification after the Dieselgate scandal and is now paying for it. Even with sales accounting for just 3.6 percent of Volkswagen’s total deliveries over the past three years, Porsche generated nearly 30 percent of the parent group’s operating profit. That made it one of VW’s most valuable divisions. But the collapse in demand, combined with software delays and China losses, has damaged that reputation. Leiters now faces the hard job of keeping Porsche’s high-end status intact while boosting output.His old company, Ferrari, thrives on limited production and exclusivity, a model Porsche can’t easily copy while chasing growth. And while this renewed focus on fuel engines might help short-term profits, it risks putting the company behind in the electric race again. Skirta warned that “they will focus again too much on combustion engine vehicles, and then we’ll lose the EV race in the long run.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|Porsche,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 22:46:28

Dogecoin has spent the past few days trading within a tight range between $0.18 and $0.20, showing a slight increase in trading activity compared to last week. Although the price action has been mostly subdued, a new technical analysis suggests that a significant reversal could soon be underway, one that may send the Dogecoin price surging to at least $0.5 once momentum returns to the market. Dogecoin In The Lower Band Of Its Long-Term Channel Technical analysis of Dogecoin’s macro price chart shows the king of meme coins is now trading at a historical bullish momentum low. This analysis, which was posted on the social media platform X by crypto analyst EtherNasyonaL, looks at Dogecoin’s price action on the 3-month candlestick timeframe chart. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Surge, But Buy DOGE Under These Levels The analysis shows that Dogecoin is currently trading within a well-defined ascending channel that goes as far back as when it was created. As it stands, Dogecoin is now trading around the lower boundary of this channel. The flash crash earlier in the month created a downward wick that bounced off a confluence of supports right on this trendline. This long-term structure reveals a consistent pattern of Dogecoin bouncing back each time it reaches this lower band, with previous reversals leading to exponential rallies. The current setup mirrors the same early stages of recovery seen before the 2021 breakout that sent the Dogecoin price from below $0.1 to above $0.70. EtherNasyonaL explained that Dogecoin’s momentum has now reached “historical lows,” with the Stochastic RSI confirming a bottoming phase similar to those seen before previous bull runs. Furthermore, the analyst described this period as a phase of “quiet, calm, yet determined recovery,” meaning that the market is gradually regaining strength beneath the surface. Historical Bottom Means Price Bounce The momentum oscillator displayed in EtherNasyonaL’s chart supports this outlook. The Stochastic RSI, which tracks the rate of change in momentum, is at its lowest level, even lower than before Dogecoin’s rally in 2021. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could be entering the same type of accumulation phase that set the stage for its 2020/2021 rally. Related Reading: What Happens To The Dogecoin Price If The Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $65,000? This view is further supported by the positioning of the price within the ascending channel. With Dogecoin currently trading around the lower range, it effectively sets a technical foundation for another upward leg. Should Dogecoin follow its established pattern, a rebound toward the midline of the channel would place its price at least at $0.5. A continued move upward would see Dogecoin break into new all-time highs above $0.9 and $1 in conservative projections. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1945, having increased by 1.9% in the past 24 hours.

53555403,612386,1761260403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53555403.jpeg,Ethereum Netflow Turns Positive: Binance May Be Leading the Selling Pressure,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-netflow-turns-positive-binance-selling/,"Ethereum is once again under pressure, struggling to find the strength to reclaim the $4,000 level amid growing uncertainty across the crypto market. Investor sentiment has turned increasingly cautious, with mixed opinions emerging among analysts — some warning that a bear market may be taking shape, while others believe this correction could precede a massive rally in the coming weeks. According to CryptoQuant insights, the latest on-chain data reveals a notable shift in Ethereum’s exchange activity that could shape short-term price dynamics. Despite the recent decline in ETH’s price, the 7-day moving average of Exchange Netflow (Total) has transitioned from heavy outflows to inflows — climbing from approximately -57,000 ETH on October 16th to +7,000 ETH recently. This shift suggests that more ETH is now moving onto exchanges, potentially signaling rising selling pressure as traders prepare to offload assets amid volatility. Historically, such inflow spikes have often preceded short-term pullbacks, especially when accompanied by negative market sentiment. However, some analysts caution that this could also reflect whale repositioning or liquidity management, not outright distribution. Ethereum Exchange Inflows Spike as Binance Activity Signals Caution According to CryptoOnchain’s latest analysis on CryptoQuant, Binance appears to be playing a major role in Ethereum’s recent exchange flow dynamics. Data shows that Binance’s 7-day netflow has shifted dramatically — moving from approximately -31,000 ETH on October 15th to +3,000 ETH in recent days. This single exchange accounts for nearly 50% of the total shift observed across all major trading platforms, underscoring its significant influence on Ethereum’s short-term liquidity landscape. This sudden and pronounced rise in ETH deposits onto exchanges — particularly during a period of price weakness — is typically seen as a bearish short-term signal. When traders or institutional holders transfer coins from private wallets to exchanges, it often suggests a readiness to sell or reposition in anticipation of further downside. As a result, the increased on-exchange supply could add selling liquidity, making it easier for large sell orders to impact price action more sharply. However, analysts also caution against interpreting this move too narrowly. While exchange inflows often precede selling pressure, they can also reflect strategic hedging, collateral deposits for derivatives trading, or liquidity management during periods of market stress. Still, when combined with the broader macro uncertainty and Ethereum’s struggle to stay above key technical levels, this data reinforces the cautious tone prevailing across the market. If inflows persist and Ethereum fails to defend support near $3,800–$3,700, downside risk could intensify. Conversely, a quick reversal back to outflows would signal renewed investor confidence and potentially set the stage for a stronger recovery. ETH Holding Key Support Amid Uncertainty Ethereum is currently trading around $3,880, holding slightly above a key short-term support zone near $3,700–$3,750, as shown in the 3-day chart. The recent retracement has brought ETH back toward the 50-day moving average, which now acts as an important line of defense for bulls. After failing to break and hold above the $4,400 level earlier this month, Ethereum entered a corrective phase that mirrors the broader weakness in the altcoin market. Price structure shows lower highs forming since the local top, indicating fading momentum. However, as long as ETH stays above the 100-day moving average near $3,400, the broader uptrend remains technically intact. If the current support holds, Ethereum could attempt another recovery toward $4,000–$4,200, where heavy resistance and previous liquidity clusters are located. A confirmed close above this zone would signal renewed strength and potentially mark the end of this correction phase. On the downside, a decisive breakdown below $3,700 could expose ETH to deeper losses, targeting $3,400 and possibly $3,000, where stronger historical demand lies. For now, Ethereum’s price action remains at a pivotal point — balancing between short-term weakness and the potential for a mid-term recovery.

On Tuesday, the fund recorded almost $477 million in net gains with a big improvement in sentiment from institutional investors. This rebound comes as optimism mounts for a general market recovery before year-end. Analysts believe the slowdown in ETF redemptions signals the early stages of a new Q4 rotation, where capital will move from Bitcoin into high-performing altcoins. As Bitcoin is nearing $113,000, attention is shifting towards DOGE, TRON, and LINK, as they are now ranked among the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next rally . Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting the attention of investors who are seeking strong returns and utility-backed growth before the major uptrend starting in 2025. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Ease as Market Stabilizes Fresh data from SoSoValue shows that nine of twelve U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows on Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT was the largest investor with $210 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $162 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $34 million. These inflows were a clear reversal after more than $1 billion in outflows the previous week. October’s total net inflows have now exceeded $4 billion and have already surpassed the performance of September. Analysts note that this turnaround is due to increasing confidence from institutional and retail investors. Historically, such rebounds are often followed by powerful rotations to altcoins as the liquidity trickles down the market. With the volatility subsiding, traders are now looking at the fourth quarter as a window to find the best crypto to buy before the prices soar again. DOGE Gains Retail Momentum Again Dogecoin (DOGE) is still gaining ground as more companies seek to integrate it with mainstream services. Thumzup Media announced plans for DOGE for micro-payments in its advertising reward platform, and reduced transaction fees and enhanced accessibility globally. Separately, the House of Doge recently took majority ownership in Italian football club U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918, in what was one of the first major crossovers between cryptocurrency and professional sports. These developments are leading to renewed excitement in DOGE’s global community. Analysts believe DOGE’s visibility and growing real-world use will enhance its cause as one of the best crypto to buy before the Q4 rotation picks up steam. TRON Shows Network Strength and Expanding Reach TRON (TRX) continues to strengthen its dominance in the blockchain space with new integrations and records on-chain. The collaboration with Avail enables the network to provide direct interoperability with over ten blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. TRON processes more than $23 billion in daily USDT transfers, with a total supply of more than $77 billion. Its market capitalization climbed 19% in the third quarter to $31.6 billion, with network revenue growing 30% to hit a record $1.2 billion, according to Messar i. Speculation regarding a Coinbase listing has had a further positive impact. Analysts claim that TRON’s robust fundamentals and expanding revenue base make it one of the top cryptos to buy in the face of the Q4 rotation. Source: Messari LINK Attracts Institutional Interest as Whales Accumulate Chainlink (LINK) is displaying renewed confidence from big investors after experiencing a volatile month. Wallets that hold between 100,000 and one million tokens added over 12 million LINK just in recent days. This sharp increase in holdings is a signal of growing trust in the potential of Chainlink in the long term. Source: Santiment With its Oracle services powering a great deal of the DeFi ecosystem, LINK has become a cornerstone of on-chain data reliability. The increase in the long positions also indicates greater conviction from the institutional traders. As capital rotation builds, LINK continues to be one of the best crypto to buy for those aiming for mid-cycle recoveries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Smart-Money Attention As ETF momentum cools, smart money is quietly rotating into high-return projects that have real value in the long term. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged at the center of this movement, bringing a rare combination of good fundamentals and high growth potential to investors. Analysts are predicting MAGACOIN FINANCE will provide up to 1,500% ROI before the end of 2025 – one of the most aggressive predictions of this cycle. This optimism is based on the project’s emphasis on utility and an explicit development roadmap that goes beyond short-term hype. Its planned implementation and clear token model have attracted disciplined investors seeking sustainability and growth. The growing ecosystem in the project and rising participation by investors indicate that early entrants may have a significant upside as the next bull phase approaches. Unlike most speculative tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is laying a foundation that is appealing for retail buyers seeking a replacement for institutional-grade exposure to a credible blockchain. With the market now in accumulation mode, it now stands as one of the best crypto to buy before large-scale capital returns to the altcoin sector. Final Outlook The slowdown in outflows of Bitcoin ETFs has brought optimism to the entire market, which signals that some confidence will be returning among institutional players. Historically, this stability has come ahead of major Q4 rotations, in which capital moves out of Bitcoin and into undervalued altcoins. This time, DOGE, TRON, and LINK are at the forefront of the established assets with accumulating momentum, with MAGACOIN FINANCE as the new wave of high ROI opportunities built on transparency and strong fundamentals. For investors positioning early, this could be the perfect window to place your exposure to the best crypto to buy , before the next explosive leg upwards for the market.

In a recent statement, he outlined new insights into how institutions could be preparing for indirect exposure to the digital asset, even as direct adoption faces several regulatory and operational obstacles. Van Code emphasized that while institutional interest in XRP continues to rise, the process of gaining exposure remains complex. He noted that large organizations cannot simply acquire XRP and store it in personal wallets due to compliance, audit, and security demands. According to him, such entities must maintain regulated custody frameworks, implement stringent auditing processes, and comply with regional financial standards, costing as much as $300,000 annually to maintain. What I am realizing with the bew @evernorthxrp announcement and stagnant XRP price is that it might be harder than we think for institutions to buy and hold XRP. Large companies aren't going to simply setup a Ledger or Xaman wallet and drop $100M in there. They want custody,… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 21, 2025 Institutional Access Through ETFs and Equity Investments Given these challenges, Van Code argued that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and publicly traded companies holding XRP may serve as the most efficient paths for institutions to enter the ecosystem. These structured financial products, he explained, allow for exposure to XRP’s price movement without the need for direct token management. This viewpoint reinforces the growing discussion around the potential introduction of XRP-backed ETFs . Multiple applications for such funds have already been submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), though progress remains stalled due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. The eventual approval of these ETFs could provide a framework for traditional investors to access XRP through regulated financial instruments. At the same time, several firms are announcing plans to establish XRP-based treasuries. Among these, Evernorth’s initiative has drawn the most attention for its scale and institutional backing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evernorth’s Expanding Institutional Role Evernorth, a financial venture closely associated with Ripple, has announced plans to build the largest XRP treasury to date. The company intends to acquire approximately $1 billion worth of XRP, supported by more than $1.1 billion in committed funding from participants, including Ripple and Japan’s SBI Holdings. Once fully operational, the project will launch with an initial pool of over 560 million XRP. According to Van Code, developments like Evernorth illustrate how institutional infrastructure is forming around XRP in ways that could influence long-term adoption. Although these activities have yet to drive immediate price increases, he emphasized that their significance lies in creating a foundation for future liquidity and regulated access. Van Code stated that he is now more bullish than ever on XRP’s institutional trajectory. He placed particular importance on the alignment between initiatives such as Evernorth and the potential introduction of XRP ETFs, noting that both approaches serve to integrate XRP into the broader financial system. Evernorth’s upcoming merger, expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2026, is projected to trigger the next round of XRP acquisitions within ten days of completion. Analysts suggest that this could mark a major step forward in the token’s institutional adoption strategy. As Ripple continues to advance infrastructure development and partnerships through ventures like Evernorth, combined with the future possibility of XRP ETFs, industry observers anticipate a more structured environment for institutional participation. This growing landscape could allow major investors to gain exposure to XRP through secure and compliant channels, representing a significant shift in how the asset is accessed and utilized.

On Wednesday, nearly 40% of total options volume came from a small cluster of stocks with no real business momentum, just heavy internet hype and sky-high short interest, according to data from CNBC. The tickers leading the charge are Beyond Meat’s BYND and Krispy Kreme’s DNUT, names that Reddit traders can’t stop gambling on, despite both companies being in the red revenue-wise. Traders target BYND and DNUT with high-risk options On Wednesday, options traders went ballistic as BYND traded more than 3.3 million contracts, roughly 9.4 times its average 20-day volume.DNUT went even crazier, with contracts trading at 38 times its typical options activity. Both names are under $5 per share, which makes them too cheap for most margin accounts. So retail traders are turning to options, where a few bucks can control hundreds of shares, for the same high-stakes action. The most traded BYND contract was the October 24 weekly $3 put, with 147,000 contracts changing hands at an average of $0.415 per contract.To break even, the stock would need to fall $1, about 28%, within two trading days. Meanwhile, 104,000 contracts were traded on the weekly $4 calls, priced around $1.455. That’s a bet the stock will climb to $5.455, more than 52% higher, before Friday’s close. That’s two moonshots in opposite directions. And at least one will be worthless by 4 p.m. Friday. There’s a reason this happens.These stocks are impossible to borrow, making it difficult for hedge funds to short them directly. But if a stock is loaded with short interest and retail traders push prices up, those funds may be forced to cover, buying shares at higher prices, which makes the rally worse. That’s the game. And it’s why meme traders aren’t tagging along with institutions. They’re betting against them. They want to be David against Goliath. This has nothing to do with earnings. DNUT and BYND both operate real businesses, but neither is profitable. BYND keeps reporting losses. DNUT has weak margins and debt problems. None of that matters. What matters is the story online, the tweets, the TikToks, the posts that spark a frenzy. That’s what sets the price, not revenue or market share projections. Back in 2021, traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum turned stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) into weapons.

Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use.

The RSI and MACD indicate fading bearish momentum, but a confirmed reversal has not yet occurred. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of October 23, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000727, showing a +2.6% daily gain. The coin’s price sits between the mid-Bollinger line at $0.0000795 and the lower band at $0.0000518, indicating it’s still within a weak recovery phase after prior selling. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD line has crossed slightly above the signal line, indicating a potential re-entry of buyers, but momentum has not yet completely shifted positive. The RSI at 38.9 indicates partial recovery from oversold conditions but remains below the neutral level. To regain strength, FLOKI must close above $0.0000795, opening a path toward $0.000090–$0.00010, while support rests at $0.000052–$0.000060. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour frame, FLOKI trades tightly near $0.0000728, as the Alligator lines flatten, showing consolidation after recent volatility. The MACD bars are fading red, indicating weakening bearish momentum, although buyers haven’t yet reclaimed dominance. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A clear breakout above $0.0000735–$0.0000740 could trigger a short-term rally toward $0.000078–$0.000080, while failure to hold $0.000070 risks another dip toward $0.000066.

Until then, traders can expect tight sideways action with mild upside potential. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Such a consolidation phase could be the calm before a major breakout, as chart patterns hint at a possible pre-rally formation that might propel ETH toward new all-time highs. Potential Right Shoulder Formation Signals Structural Strength Crypto analyst MarketMaestro delivered a detailed technical update on ETH, noting that the asset recently suffered a key rejection at its neckline resistance. Following this failure, the price is now positioned in a crucial retest phase at a red diagonal resistance line that it had previously surpassed. ETH’s market’s success in holding this diagonal is essential to avoid completely losing the bullish momentum built up in the prior moves. Related Reading: Ethereum Slides Gradually — Buyers Losing Control As Market Turns Cautious The analyst further noted that the current price movement suggests ETH could be forming a right shoulder in this region. This structural development is highly significant because the right shoulder simultaneously works to complete two major, highly bullish chart patterns. It is the final component needed to create the handle for the Cup and Handle pattern, while forming a larger Inverse Head and Shoulders (Inverse H&S) pattern. The simultaneous formation of both the Inverse H&S and the Cup and Handle in the same area is extremely rare and powerful, indicating that the market is setting the stage for highly bullish formations for the next quarter. Considering this powerful confluence of classic reversal and continuation patterns, along with the behavior of the broader market index, MarketMaestro views this entire consolidation phase not as weakness but as a logical pre-rally setup. He concludes with a high degree of confidence that the “pain threshold” or the maximum expected downside risk will likely not be very high. Bullish Bias Intact As Long As Support Remains Firm In a recent update, analyst Crypto Candy noted that the ETH scenario remains largely unchanged, despite recent market movements. A key takeaway from the analysis is that the asset is demonstrating significant resilience by strongly holding the crucial support zone between $3,600 and $3,800. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Ethereum Price If Bullish Momentum Holds The analyst reiterated the importance of this specific range, emphasizing that as long as the $3,600–$3,800 zone successfully sustains, the medium-term bullish outlook remains firmly in place. This suggests that buyers are aggressively defending this level, preventing a deeper correction from continuing. Given the strength shown at this support level, Crypto Candy maintains a strong price forecast: the market is expected to target $4,700, with the potential to reach a new ATH. This bullish bias, the analyst concludes, remains valid until the $3,600–$3,800 support zone is breached.

His outlook arrives at a time when the token is under heavy selling pressure, alongside widespread weakness across the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite the current bearish environment, Rector maintains that the ongoing correction forms part of a broader accumulation phase that could lead to a significant uptrend heading into 2025. Rector’s Final 2025 XRP Timeline In a recent post on X, Rector presented a timeline that outlines how XRP might transition from its current downtrend to potentially reach a price between $5 and $12 by December 2025. His projection is based on historical price behavior, particularly XRP’s performance during previous election cycles. Final 2025 XRP Timeline XRP November Pump Coming $5-$12 XRP by first part of December — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) October 22, 2025 The analyst recalled XRP’s trajectory in late 2024, noting that the asset experienced substantial declines before a sharp rebound. Specifically, XRP fell from $0.6540 on Oct. 1, 2024, to $0.4860 by Oct. 25, marking a 25% decline amid broader market uncertainty. At the time, sentiment turned largely negative, with some analysts dismissing the possibility of a major rally. Veteran investor Raoul Pal notably advised traders to shift focus to other assets, labeling projects like XRP and Cardano (ADA) as unlikely to recover meaningfully. However, XRP later invalidated those bearish calls, rebounding dramatically after the U.S. elections in November 2024. From a price of $0.50 on Nov. 4, it climbed to $3.40 by January 2025, gaining over 580% in just two months. XRP Poised for Another Run Toward $5–$12 According to Rector, XRP’s recent movement mirrors the same setup that preceded its 2024 surge. This October, XRP has declined by nearly 49%, forming a structure similar to the 60% retracement observed in early 2017 before the start of XRP’s historic 61,000% rally to $3.31 during the 2017–2018 cycle. Rector applied this historical pattern to XRP’s current logarithmic chart, noting that if the pattern remains consistent, the asset could experience a substantial rise between November and December 2025. He identified November 5, 2025, as a potential turning point for the next major rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analyst also argued that historical price cycles tend to repeat due to the market’s psychological and structural patterns, with similar setups often preceding significant bullish moves. While he did not provide an exact figure, his range of $5 to $12 aligns with other prominent forecasts within the XRP community. Broader Market Consensus Rector’s outlook adds to growing expectations among analysts that XRP could record significant gains within the next market cycle. Analyst, EGRAG Crypto introduced the “Valhalla Gate” model, suggesting that XRP could rally as high as $12 under favorable conditions. Earlier, in December 2024, the same analyst identified intermediate targets between $6 and $8 as possible milestones before a move toward double-digit prices. While these projections remain speculative, they highlight growing confidence among long-term supporters that XRP’s market structure remains intact despite recent declines. Analysts emphasize that sustained network adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and institutional entry could strengthen the case for renewed growth. If these factors align, XRP could once again defy bearish expectations, with many investors closely watching the final months of 2025 for confirmation of the next major trend.

53557084,612506,1761264034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53557084.jpeg,"Bitcoin Poised To Top $1.5 Million, Says Ex-PayPal President",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-top-1-5-million-ex-paypal-president/,"In a wide-ranging Coin Stories interview published October 21, David Marcus—co-founder and CEO of Lightspark, former president of PayPal and co-creator of Diem, the cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook—laid out a thesis that Bitcoin will ultimately surpass gold in value and evolve from a purely “store-of-value” asset into the invisible, neutral settlement layer of the internet for money. How Bitcoin Could Reach $1.5 Million “I think Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold,” Marcus told host Natalie Brunell. “At today’s gold price, it’s, you know, $1.3 million a bitcoin that [it] will have a higher market cap than gold.” He emphasized he is “decent at directional predictions” but “terrible at timing,” framing the trajectory as inevitable over a five-to-ten-year horizon rather than a near-dated call. The implication of outgrowing gold’s market capitalization places Bitcoin’s potential value well north of $1.3 million per coin and, at Gold’s recent ATH at $4,381.58/oz, above $1.53 million. Marcus’s price view is inseparable from his broader contention that BTC must progress beyond a narrow “digital gold” narrative. Echoing a line from analyst Matt Pines that Brunell cited—“if Bitcoin is only a store of value, it has failed”—Marcus agreed “fully,” but added a critical caveat: the savings-asset phase was a necessary precondition for utility. “We believe that the store-of-value phase is absolutely essential for us to be able to actually build a utility phase of Bitcoin on top of it,” he said, arguing that institutional adoption, ETFs and nation-state accumulation conferred enough legitimacy to begin scaling real-world payments. “Now that every institution… whether it’s BlackRock, Fidelity or others, are actually supporting Bitcoin… we can actually really start building payment utility on top of it.” That utility vision hinges on using Bitcoin more like TCP/IP—an invisible settlement substrate—than as a volatile unit of account for everyday spending. Marcus was blunt about behavioral and economic constraints: “People don’t want to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases because it’s volatile and people want to actually benefit from appreciation… they don’t want to be the Bitcoin pizza guy .” Lightspark’s approach is to move fiat end-to-end while using BTC in the middle. “You can send dollars from a US bank account to someone in Mexico receiving Mexican peso… the settlement asset is Bitcoin in between. So you have dollars, Bitcoin, Mexican peso and it’s invisible to people using it.” Technically, Lightspark is pushing beyond Lightning’s channel model while remaining backward-compatible. Marcus lauded Lightning’s trust model and speed, but highlighted its liquidity and self-custody frictions when scaled to “billions of endpoints.” The company’s newly launched “Spark” is described as a Lightning-compatible, non-channel payment system that enables spinning up “billions of wallets” with “minimal new trust assumptions.” Crucially, he said, it preserves safety valves: “It’s not as trustless as Lightning, but we believe it’s trustless enough and has unilateral exits to Layer 1… you can pull a rip cord and no one can prevent you from recovering your funds on L1.” Stablecoins And Adoption Marcus also argued that stablecoins—despite their centralized issuer model—are an unavoidable component of global payments, and that anchoring them to BTC’s settlement layer enhances resilience. He described a personal “schizophrenic journey” with stablecoins, disliking the “single throat to choke,” yet accepting their ubiquity and attempting to minimize trust by avoiding separate gas tokens and preserving unilateral exits to Bitcoin L1. On adoption, Marcus pointed to shifting institutional sentiment. Recounting a panel in New York “put together by Citadel Securities,” he said a “majority” of a roughly 450-person room of large traditional-finance investors indicated they own BTC, versus far fewer holding ETH , stablecoins, or any token. “This is a room that traditionally would have been very resistant to Bitcoin… now the times have changed so profoundly.” Yet he still framed retail penetration as early, estimating “low hundreds of millions” of unique holders globally and significant headroom from there. Overall, Marcus’ thesis returns to first principles: BTC as neutral, scarce, programmable collateral and a credibly decentralized settlement layer. Dismissing critiques that it lacks “intrinsic value,” he argued, “Underlying scarcity of Bitcoin secured by code is the intrinsic value… this is the only thing that’s deflationary by nature.” That, he contends, is why Bitcoin should outcompete gold over time: “When the first gold ETFs were launched, they started mining more gold.

According to a Reuters article, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against the US tech giant after a mass lawsuit which was brought forward on behalf of iPhone and iPad users in the UK. The case has been valued at an estimated £1.5 billion or $2 billion by the plaintiffs. Apple abused its dominance for five years to shut out competition The Tribunal concluded that Apple abused its dominance from October until the end of 2020 as it shut out competition in the app distribution market and levied “excessive and unfair prices,” as commission from developers. Apple has faced severe regulatory pressure in the US and Europe over its fees and has indicated it will appeal the ruling. It said the ruling “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy”. The lawsuit was led by British academic Dr Rachael Kent, who said that Apple made “exorbitant profits” by excluding all competition for app distribution and in-app purchases. Her lawyers maintained that during the January trial Apple’s “100% monopoly position” allowed it to impose excessive commissions. Dr Kent called the decision a “landmark victory, not only for App Store users, but for anyone who has ever felt powerless against a global tech giant”. In a statement, Dr Kent said that the ruling shows that Britain’s collective action regime is working. “Today’s ruling sends a clear message: no company, however wealthy or powerful, is above the law.” Dr Kent. The CAT’s ruling specified that developers were overcharged by the difference between a 17.5% commission and the commission that the tech giant actually charged, which, according to Dr Kent’s lawyers was typically 30%. The tribunal also concluded that developers passed on the 50% of this overcharge to consumers. Apple wants to appeal Apple said it strongly disagreed and indicated it would appeal. “This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments,” an Apple spokesperson said. “The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections,” added the spokesperson. According to reports, a hearing is now scheduled for next month to define how the damages will be calculated and to hear Apple’s application for permission to appeal. This case represents a significant victory for the UK’s “class action” style legal regime. It also marks the first mass lawsuit against a major tech company to go to trial under the system, which has reached its 10 th anniversary this year. It has seen multi-billion-pound cases certified for trial but limited success for consumers so far. According to Reuters, there are many other cases waiting in the wings, including one against Google over the commission it charges app developers for access to its Play Store. This case is expected to begin in October next year and will be heard alongside a similar claim by Epic Games, which is engaged in parallel litigation with Apple in the US. Other tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft are also facing sizeable claims at the CAT. The ruling also comes at a time after Apple was hit with a complaint to European antitrust regulators over the terms and conditions of its App Store under rules aimed at reining in Big Tech.

With markets recalibrating after months of volatility, investors are zeroing in on projects that balance innovation with strong fundamentals. The surge of interest in the best crypto presales to join now shows how the market is shifting from hype to utility. Stellar’s blockchain efficiency, Toncoin’s Web3 integration, and BullZilla’s explosive presale growth each tell a different story of momentum, but one stands out as the next major player for 2025. Among the three, BullZilla ($BZIL) is capturing the spotlight with its rapid fundraising, growing community, and ROI potential that dwarfs even early-stage Ethereum or Shiba Inu levels. Its structured presale, governed by scarcity and transparent growth stages, is redefining how investors perceive early crypto opportunities. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Titan of Presales and the Best Crypto Presale to Join Now Introducing BullZilla, the project rewriting the playbook for the best crypto presales to join now and early-stage investing. Currently in Stage 7D (Bag Signal Activated), the token is priced at $0.00018573, having already raised over $960K from 3,100+ holders and sold 31 billion tokens. This staggering momentum reflects a community-driven surge and strong investor belief in its mechanics. The Mechanics Behind the Bull Run BullZilla’s structure is built on three revolutionary systems: the Progressive Price Engine, which automatically raises prices every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours; a 24-stage burn mechanism ensuring long-term scarcity; and staking tiers offering up to 70% APY in the HODL Furnace. These elements create sustained upward pressure on token value and reward long-term holders, distinguishing BullZilla from short-lived hype coins. $4,000 Today, a Roaring Future Tomorrow: BullZilla’s ROI Projection An investment of $4,000 at the current price of $0.00018573 would secure approximately 21.5 million BZIL tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.00527, this would equate to $113,305, a 2,738.21% ROI, or 3,130.08% for the earliest investors. With the next price hike of +3.59% approaching as Stage 8 begins, the clock is ticking for new investors aiming to capitalize before the next tier activates. BullZilla’s presale isn’t just about speculation; it’s about strategy. By linking growth to verifiable metrics and blockchain transparency, it builds investor confidence while fueling excitement for its eventual exchange debut. How to Join the BullZilla Presale Getting started with BullZilla is simple. Set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, then purchase ETH or USDT via a trusted exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Visit the official BullZilla presale website, connect your wallet, and swap your ETH or USDT for $BZIL tokens. The tokens lock automatically during the presale, ensuring security and transparency, and can be claimed after the sale ends. Vesting and reward details are fully visible on the dashboard, maintaining a fair ecosystem for every participant. Stellar (XLM): Resilient in Volatility Stellar (XLM) is trading near $0.3095 after a 1.51% daily dip, yet its fundamentals remain strong. With a market cap of $9.9 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $15.47 billion, Stellar holds its rank as the 14th-largest crypto globally. A 13.01% surge in daily trading volume to $218.46 million signals sustained investor participation despite mild market pullbacks. While prices sit far below the 2018 all-time high of $0.9381, XLM has gained 25,123% since its 2014 low, an astonishing return that underscores long-term potential. Stellar continues to drive cross-border payment innovation and asset tokenization, cementing its reputation as one of the most stable blockchain ecosystems. Analysts expect that as traditional finance integrates tokenized assets, Stellar’s network could benefit significantly from new liquidity inflows and institutional adoption. Toncoin (TON): Web3 Connectivity on the Rise Toncoin (TON) has slipped 1.53% in the past 24 hours to $2.12, extending a brief correction amid rising trading activity. With a market cap of $5.34 billion and $155.17 million in daily volume, it remains a top-25 crypto powerhouse. The fully diluted valuation of $10.9 billion highlights Toncoin’s growing appeal across both consumer and developer segments. Despite being well below its June 2024 high of $8.24, Toncoin is still up 442.58% from its 2021 low of $0.3906, proving resilience amid wider market turbulence. Analysts attribute the dip to short-term profit-taking as traders rebalance portfolios. However, Toncoin’s deep integration with Telegram and its expanding Web3 ecosystem provide it with unique leverage. Its mission to bridge messaging, decentralized finance, and NFT applications positions Toncoin as one of the most versatile blockchain projects of this decade. Conclusion: Why BullZilla Is the Top Choice Among the Best Crypto Presales to Join Now Stellar’s resilience and Toncoin’s technological integration prove that strong fundamentals matter, but in this cycle, innovation tied to investor participation is driving momentum. BullZilla stands at the intersection of transparency, utility, and timing, giving investors a clear entry into one of the best crypto presales to join now before its next price surge. As the crypto market eyes 2025’s potential rebound, BullZilla’s momentum-driven mechanics and ROI trajectory make it impossible to ignore. Those who recognize its structure today may find themselves in the same position early Ethereum or Dogecoin holders once did, watching a bold idea transform into a market leader.

As volatility decreases, and Bitcoin holding major levels, altcoins already exhibit initial recovery patterns. Cardano is one of them, where its long-form symmetrical triangle pattern is narrowing down to a possible breakout in Q4. ADA would also soar up to 70% in case the support at $0.62 is met. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE keeps drawing presale investors who are eager to get the next boom in the crypto sphere. ADA Technical Outlook: Symmetrical Triangle Nears Q4 Breakout Most recently, Cardano is trading at approximately $0.64, and it is barely above the major support of $0.62, which has been supporting the structure of ADA over the past few months. This area coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and forms the foundation of a one-year symmetrical triangle pattern. Analyst Ali Charts believes a holding above $0.62 will maintain the bullish structure, and a possible rally to $1.90 can follow. ADAUSD 12-Hour Chart | Source: X The apex of the formation is in late Q4 2025, meaning that a decisive move is coming soon. When ADA crosses the downward trendline at approximately $0.70, the following levels of resistance will be at $0.95, $1.28, and $1.86 according to Fibonacci projections. Both are zones of historical reactions at which Cardano has been stalling or backtracking on rallies earlier. Momentum indicators also justify a pending change. The MACD line is slightly lower than the signal line, however, the close margin and the disappearing red bars indicate that force of selling is decreasing. The RSI reading of 40 points suggests a market is still recovering and still has room to grow, should buyers regain control. Taken together, the structure indicates that as Q4 continues, Cardano is gearing towards volatility growth. Market Sentiment and Open Interest Reflect Caution Derivatives data indicate that traders remain cautious. According to Coinglass , ADA’s futures open interest has declined sharply from $1.8 billion in mid-September to $648.56 million, a 64% drop. The decrease shows a lower demand for speculative exposure, signaling more conservative positioning across the market. Historically, such phases of reduced open interest have preceded large directional moves once new volume returns. On-chain data shows steady accumulation as non-exchange wallets continue to grow, while developers advance scalability upgrades such as Hydra and Mithril . Institutional inflows since Q3 further reflect growing confidence ahead of potential network expansions. Bitcoin Steadies Above $108K Ahead of Key Market Shift Bitcoin has been trading at $108,000 following a rebound from early-October lows of close to $103,000. The recovery indicates decreasing pressure after volatility spike last month. The biggest crypto in terms of market cap added 0.8% today, trading in a tight range amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Although momentum was muted, the steady level of Bitcoin above the $108K price offers a reference point to the overall market sentiment. Traditionally, ADA and other significant altcoins are known to track the mid-cycle recoveries of Bitcoin, especially when volatility is compressed. According to analysts, the current consolidation phase of BTC can become a boost off the ground into a larger Q4 recovery should the volume of purchases rise. MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops Analyst Picks With traders keeping an eye on the next move by ADA, presale investors are moving to MAGACOIN FINANCE , a new Ethereum-based project that is gaining momentum among investors. The token has received attention due to its transparent tokenomics, anti-whale design, and verified Hashex audit . All these factors support its credibility among early-stage projects. In addition, the current PATRIOT50X bonus program is creating a booming presale, giving early investors additional tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised millions, and analysts have listed it as one of their top Q4 picks since it has a growing community and a practical utility plan. The social traction the project has experienced makes it a unique project in a market that seeks reliable opportunities in the face of volatility. Conclusion The symmetrical triangle formation of Cardano indicates a breakout is imminent, as the support of $0.62 is still the pivotal point. A successful defense would cause a rally to $1.90, which coincides with Bitcoin holding steadily above $108K and improving mood on the crypto markets. Meanwhile, presale investors are making use of new opportunities beyond traditional assets. Having good fundamentals, an engaged community, and an active incentive program called PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains among the best altcoins to buy today before being listed on exchanges.

Banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, are leading the deal, which is divided into two distinct senior secured credit facilities, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. One $23.25 billion package will be used to help finance a data center in Texas, and another $14.75 billion facility will help fund a project in Wisconsin, according to the people. Vantage Data Centers is building the two data centers, which Oracle will ultimately use to host OpenAI, Bloomberg News has reported. The projects are part of Oracle’s larger goal to invest $500 billion into AI infrastructure alongside OpenAI in a project that it calls Stargate. Oracle’s $500B ‘Stargate’ Vision drives massive data center expansion Others, including Wells Fargo & Co., BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Societe Generale SA, have been designated portions of the financing package after the first round of selecting underwriters, the people said. Spokespeople for JPMorgan, MUFG SMBC, and OpenAI declined to comment. Contacted for comment, Oracle, Vantage, and the rest of the banks did not immediately respond. Meanwhile, Oracle’s new dual chief executives recently defended the firm’s massive new investmen t in data centers, stating that it will provide computing firepower and a suite of bundled services that will make artificial intelligence more useful for businesses. “We’re really in a unique situation to deliver what we call applied AI,” said Mike Sicilia, the former president of Oracle Industries, who was appointed as the CEO of the company last month. That includes infrastructure, analytics, and applications, he said in an interview. Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s former president of cloud infrastructure, was also named a chief executive. They arrive just as fears of an A.I. bubble are metastasizing rapidly. Oracle shares spiked by over 40% last month after the cloud firm said that it had added $317 billion in future contract revenue as part of its latest quarter that ended on Aug. 31. A lot of that new revenue originated from a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Investors and tech analysts have raised questions over the past month about how much the new build-out depends on OpenAI, which won’t beco me profitable until 2029, according to Sam Altman, the chief executive of the ChatGPT maker. Credit ratings firm Moody’s last month indicated risks to Oracle’s balance sheet due to the extent to which its future AI data centers rely on OpenAI. At the beginning of October, Oracle shares fell as much as 7.1%—though they quickly recovered—after a report suggesting that its margins on renting specialized Nvidia chips were razor-thin. Investor demand for AI debt surges as Vantage and Meta deals set new benchmarks Investors across the spectrum have been eager to gain early exposure to AI, with banks and private credit firms vying to lead vast debt packages that finance the boom. Meta Platforms Inc. recently chose Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. to arrange a $29 billion debt and equity deal for the company’s data-center expansion in rural Louisiana. The Vantage debt comes about a week after other bonds issued to facilitate the Meta deal began trading in secondary markets, jumping as much as 10 cents on the dollar and yielding Pimco paper profits of approximately $2 billion. Both Vantage facilities are due to mature in four years, with two one-year extension options, and priced at around 2.5 percentage points over the benchmark, the people said. Like the project and commercial real estate financings, the loans are to be structured as interest-only during construction but amortize once operations begin, according to the people. The managers finalized the second round of underwriting early this week, at which the debt was allotted to other banks and institutional investors, they said.

According to the Cupertino-based tech company, these servers play a crucial role in their pledge to invest approximately $600 billion in the US, particularly in advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives. Following this move, US President Donald Trump expressed his pleasure with Apple’s decision, urging the tech giant and other tech firms to expand their production within the United States. Apple pledges to make significant investments in the US Apple began implementing its plan to produce AI servers at its factory in Houston, Texas, earlier this year. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant first shared its intention to create US servers in February this year before making significant moves later. Regarding the tech company’s triumph in the AI ecosystem, Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan commented that these servers will support the firm’s Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services, which are scheduled to be announced this week. Currently, Apple is utilizing its own silicon technology in its Apple Intelligence servers, Khan said. The Chief Operating Officer’s remarks came after he acknowledged, “Our teams have done an excellent job accelerating the work to get the new Houston factory operating ahead of schedule, and we plan to keep expanding the facility to enhance production next year.” Meanwhile, when Apple was implementing its plan, the tech giant viewed the Houston factory as an opportunity for several individuals to secure jobs. According to the tech company, the factory was set to create thousands of jobs. Notably, Apple servers were previously made overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook took the initiative to meet with Trump in August to demonstrate the company’s commitment to further invest in the US. At this time, Cook promised the president that the tech giant would invest particularly in semiconductor firms via a program known as the American Manufacturing Program. Apart from the pledge, the CEO also presented Trump with a gift from Corning Glass, produced in the US. Interestingly, the Corning glass is used in iPhones and Apple Watches. Additionally, the tech firm introduced a manufacturing academy in partnership with Michigan State in July. Industry experts weighed in on the discussion, pointing out that although Trump has recently praised Cook and acknowledged Apple for its commitment to invest in the US, the president has often called on the tech giant to produce its iPhones in the country. Therefore, according to them, this shift will likely take years and be expensive. Apple admits to strongly supporting the US manufacturing sector The Trump administration had earlier requested tariffs that could affect Apple’s operations. However, after several considerations, they decided to cancel them. In response to this action, Apple revealed that it would import computers and phones from China, India, and Vietnam to the United States. This was confirmed after Cook stated that Apple strongly supports the US’s manufacturing sector by partnering with domestic semiconductor suppliers. He further explained that Apple’s investment and expertise play a role in developing chips entirely made and packaged in the country. “You can add a lot by making it global and then connecting the entire supply chain for semiconductors,” Cook added. Afterwards, the CEO acknowledged that he could not emphasize enough the crucial role the US semiconductor sector plays in their operation and the significant contribution it will make to their efforts. Despite managing to keep Trump’s tariffs off its back, Apple is still facing high costs , and this time it’s landing directly on customers. As per the briefing document obtained, CEO Tim Cook offered President Donald Trump a $100 billion sweetener to protect Apple’s supply chain. In exchange, Trump spared Apple from semiconductor tariffs that could have doubled the price of chips. Last month, Tim Cook presented Trump with a gold-and-glass plaque before reporters, thanking him for “putting American innovation and jobs front and center.” The gesture marked Apple’s expanded $600 billion US investment pledge over a five-year period. Yet behind the show of goodwill, the company is quietly preparing to raise iPhone prices — and it’s no coincidence. Get seen where it counts.

But while XRP hogs the limelight, investors looking for new horizons are putting more and more focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a completely new crypto coin that’s rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in this week. Already exchanging hands at $0.035 in Stage 6 of its presale with over 70% already sold, Mutuum Finance has garnered over $17.75 million due to its revolutionary dual-lending DeFi protocol. Built to merge Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems, Mutuum Finance is providing unparalleled capital efficiency and utility. While XRP is targeting a breakout to $3, MUTM is setting itself up as the next monster mover in the DeFi space, one that may hallmark the next phase of crypto innovation. XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Target $3 as Retail Fear Peaks XRP has mounted a defiant comeback, reclaiming over $2.50 only days after falling below $1.90 and bouncing off $2.20. Market data indicates retail traders were selling at a loss on the move, spreading mass FUD, a classic situation where prices naturally move in opposition to herd mentality. This contrarian indicator, along with fresh whale building and hopes of an eventual XRP ETF, is a prelude that the bulls will push the price to the $3.00 resistance level in the near term. While investors are occupied trying to find the breakout level of XRP, others are waiting with bated breath for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been rising up in the DeFi space as the best new crypto coin of 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Spike Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is red hot in the cryptocurrency world as investor demand runs wild in its Phase 6 presale. Its token currently sits at $0.035, 16.17% up from Phase 5, the all-time lowest that MUTM will ever trade at. It will go up to $0.04 in Phase 7, so early birds have a great chance to snag it at low today, making it the best crypto to buy this year. Thus far, over 17,370 investors have pledged, investing over $17.75 million. Over 70% sold during Phase 6, the presale reflects confidence on the part of early adopters in the next milestone: the debut of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol, rendering it one of the best crypto to buy opportunities in DeFi and an excellent new crypto coin for early investors. Infrastructure and Price Discovery To the ends of facilitating timely and accurate price information, Mutuum Finance makes use of Chainlink oracles cross-referencing token prices against broadly traded assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, aggregator feeds, and on-chain data are made use of throughout the platform to the ends of providing real-time and accurate price information. These protocols are the collateral pricing, risk, and liquidation process backbone, thus allowing the protocol to be efficient and stable irrespective of the changing market conditions. As XRP steals the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains quietly. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, with over 70% sold and $17.75M collected by 17,370+ investors, MUTM offers early entry into a dual-lending DeFi platform. Its P2C/P2P architecture, Chainlink oracles, and $50K CertiK bug bounty guarantee its security and scalability, and therefore it is the best crypto to buy today and a new crypto coin with long-term potential. Investors can invest in presale now before Phase 7 at $0.04 and set themselves up for potential returns towards its $1 target.

53559732,612555,1761267602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53559732.jpeg,Analyst Who Called The Gold Surge To ATH And The S&P Rally Has Turned To Bitcoin – Here’s What He Said,https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-has-turned-to-bitcoin/,"A crypto market analyst who correctly predicted gold’s price surge to new all-time highs and explosive rallies in the S&P 500 is now turning his focus toward Bitcoin (BTC). The analyst has officially declared Bitcoin the next bull run opportunity . His bold call and history of accuracy have left the crypto community eager to see where the cryptocurrency’s price heads next. Bitcoin Now In Focus After Analyst Nails Gold And S&P Predictions In a post on X earlier this week, financial services veteran Mel Mattison announced that investors should start buying Bitcoin. The analyst believes BTC is entering a potentially bullish phase , suggesting that the pioneering cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a “massive run.” Interestingly, this is not the first time Mattison has made such a bold call. Earlier this year, his predictions on gold and equities proved surprisingly accurate. In April, he had made a striking prediction about the S&P 500 , urging investors to “buy now” and forecasting that the index would hit 7,000 within a year and 15,000 before the end of US President Donald Trump’s term . Since then, the S&P 500 has surged, validating Mattison’s aggressive bullish outlook. Months later, in August, the financial service veteran encouraged investors to accumulate gold while its price was down and still consolidating, labeling it a rare long-term opportunity. He also detailed his moves by adding to January 2026 GLD call options at the 330 and 350 strike levels, explaining that the setup was ideal for a 6-12 month rally. Remarkably, his timing aligned perfectly with gold’s subsequent rally, which saw the precious metal break to new all-time highs. With his focus now on Bitcoin, Martian appears to be positioning the digital asset alongside gold and equities as the next major play in a global risk-on environment. His bullish calls align with other analysts who believe BTC could advance toward a new ATH this Q4 . BTC Price Chart Mirrors Gold’s Legendary 1980s Surge Sharing similar bullish sentiments, crypto market expert Merlijn the Trader has presented a striking technical comparison between Bitcoin’s current weekly chart and gold’s historical price action in the late 1970s. The analysis highlights a near-identical ascending channel formation, with BTC’s price action from 2023 to 2025 closely mirroring gold’s structure from 1976 to 1979. In the accompanying chart, Merlijn indicated that Bitcoin’s trajectory shows a clear consolidation within the same upward channel that preceded gold’s dramatic breakout to new all-time highs above $760 in 1980. The analyst explained that the cryptocurrency has accurately traced the rhythm, structure, and squeeze of this distinct bullish setup. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is situated at the upper end of the ascending channel , suggesting that a breakout could lead to a significant upward move that could mirror gold’s historic surge. While the analyst has not shared a specific price target for his bullish outlook, he remains confident that BTC is primed for a “legendary move” to new highs.",Bitcoin News|Ascending Channel|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|Mel Mattison|Merlijn|S&P 500,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-24 01:00:02

Ethereum Stays Above Realized Price – Bullish Momentum Soon? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Ethereum is trading above its Realized Price at approximately $2,300. Dubbing the price level a “fundamental support zone,” the analyst said that historically, any dips below this level have marked a capitulation phase. Related Reading: Here’s What Happens To The Ethereum Price If Bullish Momentum Holds For the uninitiated, Realized Price represents the average cost basis of all ETH holders, calculated by dividing the total value of all ETH at the time they last moved on-chain by the current circulating supply. Realized Price effectively shows the “true” average price investors paid, serving as a key indicator of whether the market is in profit or loss. As long as ETH trades above Realized Price, the market structure is likely to remain bullish. The analyst also highlighted Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. Notably, ETH holders are currently, on average, at 67% profit relative to their cost basis. This metric gives two major hints about the current market. First, it shows that although the market is profitable, it is still far from “overheated” levels. Second, it indicates that market participants are confident about the market’s upward momentum, but not quite euphoric. To explain, the MVRV ratio compares the market value of an asset to its realized value. A higher MVRV indicates holders are sitting on larger unrealized profits – often signaling potential overvaluation – while a lower MVRV suggests undervaluation or market fear. Further, TeddyVision noted Ethereum’s reaction from the Upper Realized Price Band, which is currently located around $5,300. The analyst remarked: Price pulled back before reaching the “Overheating Zone. This isn’t a reversal – it’s a consolidation phase after distribution, a healthy cooldown without structural damage. Finally, spot inflows of ETH to crypto exchanges are also slowing down, hinting that the next leg up for the digital asset will likely depend on fresh liquidity, and not leverage. To sum it up, Ethereum is slowly moving from the distribution phase to the consolidation phase. Is It A Good Time To Buy ETH? While providing reliable future predictions in the crypto market remains a challenging task, fresh on-chain and exchange data point toward ETH regaining its bullish momentum. For instance, Binance funding rates recently hinted that ETH could surge to $6,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For Breakout? SOPR Trend Hints At $5,000 Upside Similarly, ETH reserves on exchanges continue to fall at a rapid pace. Earlier this month, ETH supply on exchanges hit a multi-year low, increasing the probability of a potential “supply crunch” that can dramatically increase ETH’s price. That said, crypto analyst Nik Patel recently cautioned that ETH’s price correction may not yet be fully over. At press time, ETH trades at $3,849, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

In a pair of candid letters made public on Thursday by Senator Chuck Grassley, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judges Henry T. Wingate of Mississippi and Julien Xavier Neals of New Jersey said that AI tools were used in the preparation of court orders that were later found to be riddled with factual mistakes and legal missteps. Both decisions have since been retracted. Grassley, who had demanded explanations, said, “Each federal judge, and the judiciary as an institution, has an obligation to ensure the use of generative AI does not violate litigants’ rights or prevent fair treatment under the law.” Staff missteps expose limits of AI in the courtroom In his letter , Judge Neals of the District of New Jersey said that a draft ruling in a securities lawsuit had been released “in error — human error” after a law school intern used OpenAI’s ChatGPT for research without authorization or disclosure. The decision was promptly withdrawn once the mistake was discovered. To prevent a recurrence, Neals said his chambers had since created a written AI policy and enhanced its review process. Judge Wingate, who serves in the Southern District of Mississippi, said a law clerk used the AI tool Perplexity “as a foundational drafting assistant to synthesize publicly available information on the docket.” That draft order, issued in a civil rights case, was later replaced after he identified errors. Wingate stated that the event “was a lapse in human oversight,” adding that he has since tightened review procedures within his chambers. Criticism of AI usage in legal work The episode adds to a growing list of controversies involving AI-generated legal material. Lawyers in several US jurisdictions have faced sanctions in recent years for submitting filings drafted by chatbots that included fabricated case citations and misapplied precedents. Earlier this month, the New York state court system put out a new policy that restricts judges and staff from entering confidential, privileged, or non-public case information into public generative AI tools. While the legal profession has been quick to explore AI’s potential to improve efficiency, the incidents have exposed the technology’s limitations, particularly its tendency to hallucinate, or generate plausible but false information . For courts, where the integrity, accuracy of rulings and the burden of proof are paramount, such lapses risk undermining public confidence in the justice system. Grassley, who commended Wingate and Neals for owning up to the mistakes, also urged the judiciary to put in place stronger AI guidelines. The Administrative Office of the US Courts has not released comprehensive guidance on AI use, though several circuit courts are reportedly exploring frameworks for limited, supervised deployment. Legal scholars, on the other hand, are reportedly proposing a disclosure rule, which will require judges to publicly note any use of AI in their opinions or orders, in a manner similar to citation requirements for external research. The incidents come as federal agencies and professional bodies continue to grapple with questions about AI accountability. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Analysten sehen darin keinen Verkauf, sondern eine technische Neuorganisation der Bestände. Trotz der symbolischen Bedeutung bleibt der Einfluss auf den Markt gering und vor allem psychologischer Natur. Ein Relikt aus den Anfängen von Bitcoin ist plötzlich wieder aufgetaucht. Eine Adresse, die noch aus der mysteriösen Satoshi-Ära stammt, hat nach über 14 Jahren Ruhe 150 BTC bewegt. Der unerwartete Transfer weckt alte Spekulationen über verschollene Miner, vergessene Schlüssel und mögliche Marktreaktionen. Doch wie gefährlich ist dieses Erwachen wirklich für den Kryptomarkt? Ein Stück Bitcoin-Geschichte erwacht Ein Bitcoin-Wallet aus dem Jahr 2009 hat nach über 14 Jahren erstmals wieder Aktivität gezeigt. Die Adresse, die in den Anfangstagen der Kryptowährung rund 4.000 BTC gemint haben soll, übertrug in dieser Woche 150 BTC im Wert von rund 16 Millionen US-Dollar. Das ist die erste Bewegung seit Juni 2011 – eine Zeit, in der Bitcoin noch kaum bekannt war und nur wenige Enthusiasten an seine Zukunft glaubten. Die damals verdienten Coins hatten beim letzten Zugriff einen Wert von nur knapp 68.000 Dollar. Heute steht die Summe für ein kleines Vermögen. Der Vorgang zeigt, wie rasant sich der Wert von Bitcoin seit den Anfängen entwickelt hat und wie viele frühe Miner durch Geduld oder Vergessen zu Multimillionären wurden. Seltene Aktivität aus der Satoshi-Ära Solche Bewegungen aus der sogenannten Satoshi-Ära sind extrem selten. Laut Daten des Analyseunternehmens Glassnode werden nur wenige Wallets aus der Zeit vor 2011 überhaupt noch aktiv. Das weckt regelmäßig großes Interesse, da diese Coins geschürft wurden, als Bitcoin-Erfinder Satoshi Nakamoto selbst noch online diskutierte und Beiträge in Foren veröffentlichte. Jede Bewegung alter Coins löst Spekulationen aus – könnten es Satoshi selbst sein oder frühe Mitstreiter? Historisch betrachtet führen diese Ereignisse oft zu kurzfristiger Unruhe an den Märkten, da Anleger Verkäufe befürchten. Doch bisher hat sich fast immer gezeigt: Die meisten dieser Transfers dienen rein technischen oder organisatorischen Zwecken. Psychologische Wirkung statt Marktschock Der Zeitpunkt des Transfers ist bemerkenswert. BTC handelt derzeit um die Marke von 110.000 Dollar, nachdem die Kryptowährung Anfang des Monats von einem Rekordhoch über 126.000 Dollar gefallen war. Der Markt hat jüngst den größten Liquidationsschock seiner Geschichte erlebt, mit fast 19 Milliarden Dollar an aufgelösten Positionen. In einem so sensiblen Umfeld wirken Bewegungen großer, alter Bestände wie ein psychologischer Auslöser. Doch rein faktisch spielt die Transaktion kaum eine Rolle. Die 150 BTC entsprechen einem winzigen Bruchteil des täglichen Handelsvolumens von mehr als 20 Milliarden Dollar. Der Effekt liegt also nicht in der Marktmechanik, sondern in der Wahrnehmung. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Warum die Coins jetzt bewegt wurden Analysten nennen mehrere mögliche Gründe für den Schritt. Der Inhaber könnte seine Bitcoins in eine moderne, besser gesicherte Wallet übertragen haben, um sie vor Verlusten oder technischen Risiken zu schützen. Ebenso denkbar sind Erbschaftsregelungen oder einfache Funktionstests alter Wallets. Bislang gibt es keine Hinweise darauf, dass die Coins an Börsen gesendet wurden, was auf einen geplanten Verkauf hindeuten würde. Auch frühere Fälle, etwa in den Jahren 2021 und 2023, führten zu keiner nachhaltigen Preisbewegung. Stattdessen stellte sich meist heraus, dass die Besitzer lediglich ihre Guthaben restrukturierten. Ein Blick auf den aktuellen Markt Die allgemeine Stimmung am Kryptomarkt bleibt vorsichtig. Nach dem starken Preisrückgang Anfang des Monats schwankt BTC nun in einer engen Spanne zwischen 108.000 und 111.000 Dollar. Viele Anleger warten auf neue Impulse, während Analysten über mögliche Korrekturen diskutieren. In dieser Phase werden On-Chain-Daten besonders aufmerksam verfolgt. Bewegungen alter Wallets dienen dabei als Erinnerung an die Ursprünge des Netzwerks – und an das enorme, bislang unberührte Vermögen früher Miner. Es zeigt, dass ein großer Teil des Gesamtbestands von BTC noch immer in den Händen einer kleinen, historischen Gruppe liegt. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Mehr Symbolik als Substanz Letztlich dürfte das Erwachen dieses 14 Jahre alten Wallets keine fundamentale Auswirkung auf den Markt haben. Der Vorgang ist eher ein Symbol für die Beständigkeit und Geschichte der Kryptowährung als ein Signal für bevorstehende Verkäufe. Für viele Investoren ist es ein faszinierender Einblick in die frühen Tage von Bitcoin – eine Erinnerung daran, dass digitale Werte auch über Jahrzehnte hinweg Bestand haben können. Solange die Coins nicht auf Börsen auftauchen, bleibt die Bewegung reine Statistik und kein Grund zur Panik. So zeigt diese Geschichte doch auch besonders eines: Wie lange es schon BTC gibt und wie weit Bitcoin als Projekt gekommen ist. Das bedeutet auch, dass neue Projekte, die sich an Bitcoin orientieren und dessen Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit benutzen, durchaus auch noch zukünftig Potenzial haben, so wie Bitcoin Hyper. $Hyper: Eng verbunden mit der Stärke von Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper baut direkt auf dem BTC-Netzwerk auf und erbt damit dessen Sicherheit und Vertrauen. Es erweitert Bitcoin um das, was bisher fehlte – Geschwindigkeit, niedrige Gebühren und Smart Contracts. Wenn Bitcoin stark performt, profitiert auch $Hyper, denn sein Fundament ist untrennbar mit BTC verbunden. Steigt das Interesse an Bitcoin, wächst auch die Nachfrage nach Lösungen wie Bitcoin Hyper, die echte Nutzung ermöglichen. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Der Token, der mit BTC wächst $HYPER ist der Treibstoff desHyper-Ökosystems – sicher durch Bitcoin, effizient durch Solana. Wenn BTC langfristig zulegt und stärker in den Alltag und institutionelle Nutzung rückt, dürfte auch $HYPER profitieren. Denn wo BTC die Basis ist, bietet Bitcoin Hyper die Anwendung – und beide stärken sich gegenseitig.

This decline occurs as the central bank prepares to decide on the future of its balance sheet in its upcoming meeting. According to reliable sources, data shared on Thursday highlighted a decrease of approximately $59 billion in US bank reserves, bringing the total to $2.93 trillion for the week ending October 22. This marks the lowest level reached since January 1. Fed’s upcoming meeting raises predictions among individuals The US bank reserves dropped as the Treasury borrowed more funds to restore its cash balance after raising the debt limit in July. Following this move, analysts have raised concerns that the action may remove liquidity from other areas of the Fed’s balance sheet, such as its overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and bank reserves. Their remarks followed research that revealed a decrease in the amount of money commercial banks hold in reserves at the Fed as the RRP nears depletion. These cash adjustments have significantly impacted daily operations within the financial system, as the Fed continues to lower its balance sheet through a process widely known as quantitative tightening, or QT. In the meantime, sources familiar with the situation, which wished to remain anonymous, pointed out that since QT can worsen liquidity-related problems and cause market instability, the Fed decided to lower the number of bonds that can mature each month earlier this year. In their upcoming meeting next week in Washington, federal officials are expected to discuss the future of the balance sheet as individuals share predictions about the situation. According to these predictions, many have expressed the likelihood of a policy rate cut between 3.75% and 4%. However, Wall Street highlighted concerns about the uncertainty surrounding when the Fed will end quantitative tightening, another method for controlling interest rates. Another example of these predictions is the forecasts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp analysts. They predicted that the Fed will stop reducing its balance sheet, which is approximately $6.6 trillion, this month. This would conclude a process aimed at removing money from financial markets, a perspective shared by TD Securities and Wrightson ICAP. Analysts raise concerns about the persistently elevated rates on repos and fluctuations Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the balance sheet shrinkage will cease when bank reserves reach a level higher than what policymakers consider necessary for “ample” levels, which are sufficient to prevent market disruptions. Powell noted that early government data, before the recent shutdown, indicated the US economy was running hotter than policymakers had anticipated, warning that growth remains firm even as the central bank inches toward ending its balance-sheet reductions and considers further rate cuts. Speaking in Philadelphia at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell noted that the Fed is close to its target for “ample” bank reserves and hinted that the tightening cycle could soon pause. This development came as investors weighed how far the Fed can go before risking job losses while maintaining a stable inflation rate. “Our long-stated plan is to stop balance-sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,” Powell said. “We may approach that point in the coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.” He noted that the central bank hasn’t set a date, but liquidity measures suggest that the end of balance-sheet reduction is close. Still, money market rates have remained elevated this week despite an influx of cash. This occurs as Government-sponsored enterprises hold their monthly principal and interest payments in repurchase agreements (repos) before releasing them to holders of mortgage-backed securities around the 25th of every month. To analysts, the persistently elevated rates on repos and fluctuations suggest that reserves are no longer abundant and the financial system is at risk of running short.

The market now stands at a critical crossroads — one that could define whether the next phase brings a deep correction or sets the stage for a massive recovery. According to top analyst Axel Adler, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 remain in what he calls the late bull phase. The S&P 500’s 52-week return currently sits at +13%, reflecting that global markets remain in a risk-on environment, with investors still willing to take exposure to growth-oriented assets. Adler notes that the BTC–S&P correlation currently stands at 0.26, meaning Bitcoin tends to move in the same direction as equities, though not entirely in lockstep. This moderate correlation suggests that while macro factors like earnings and monetary policy still influence Bitcoin, its internal dynamics — such as liquidity shifts and derivatives positioning — remain key. However, Adler warns that the S&P 500’s sensitivity to macro and political narratives could quickly spill over into the crypto market. Any cooling in equities or broader risk sentiment could pressure Bitcoin and define its next major move. Bitcoin Mirrors Late-Cycle Market Behavior as Q4 Earnings Take Center Stage According to Axel Adler, the final quarter of 2025 marks a crucial transition point for both traditional and crypto markets. After nearly two years of steady yield growth and tight monetary policy, the macro focus is shifting from expectations to real corporate performance. The Q3 earnings season is now in full swing, and early results have been surprisingly strong — out of 58 companies that have reported so far, all have beaten estimates by an average of 571 basis points (bps). Moreover, expected earnings growth for the quarter has climbed from 7% to 8%, reinforcing the idea that markets are still in the final phase of a bull cycle. This late-cycle behavior typically reflects investor optimism, even as underlying risks — such as stretched valuations, declining liquidity, and macro uncertainty — begin to surface. Adler notes that such conditions often coincide with high volatility across risk assets, including Bitcoin, which tends to track broader shifts in investor sentiment. For crypto markets, this context is particularly relevant. Bitcoin’s muted reaction to strong earnings data suggests that institutional flows remain cautious, waiting for confirmation of macro stability before re-entering risk positions. Historically, when equity markets approach the peak of their bull cycle, Bitcoin can either decouple and surge amid renewed liquidity or follow equities downward during a correction phase. Adler concludes that the current setup aligns with a late-bull, pre-cooling environment — a moment defined by strong short-term optimism but fragile long-term balance. The coming weeks, driven by the remaining earnings reports and central bank commentary, will determine whether this momentum fuels another Bitcoin rally or marks the beginning of a broader market cooldown. Bulls Defend Key Support, Market Awaits Breakout Confirmation Bitcoin is currently trading around $109,300, showing modest recovery momentum after finding support near the 100-day moving average (green line). The 3-day chart reveals that BTC remains in a consolidation structure, oscillating between $106,000 and $117,500, the latter acting as a significant resistance level since mid-September. The $117,500 zone continues to mark the upper boundary of the current range, aligning with the previous high-volume node from the August–September period. This level represents the Point of Control for the recent trading structure and is critical for defining short-term direction. A successful breakout above it would likely trigger momentum toward $123,000, where large liquidity clusters and short liquidations are positioned. On the downside, the 50-day moving average (blue line) sits near $111,000, overlapping with the mid-range level, while the 200-day moving average (red line) near $90,000 remains a longer-term support base. Bitcoin’s trend remains neutral-to-bullish, but confidence is fragile. A strong close above $111,000–$112,000 could signal renewed strength, while a rejection here would likely confirm extended consolidation or even a deeper correction toward $105,000. The next few sessions will determine whether BTC can regain momentum or face renewed selling pressure.

Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore are pioneering Ethereum-linked investment products that are experiencing significant demand from mainstream funds and retail investors. This growth represents a significant trend in confidence in digital assets after months of mixed sentiment. According to analysts, the new wave of institutional demand is spilling over into the best-performing altcoins. Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK) are picking up speed as traders seek assets with genuine market activity. Joining the list of the best altcoins to buy this week is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project that is rapidly emerging and gaining the attention of early investors due to its consistent growth and clear direction. Ethereum ETF Expansion Sparks Market Optimism A formidable alliance of Asian crypto leaders is launching a digital asset treasury company with a billion dollars to fund Ethereum-based projects. The group consists of Huobi founder Li Lin, Fenbushi Capital’s Shen Bo, HashKey Group CEO Xiao Feng, and Meitu founder Cai Wensheng. Bloomberg reported that the team is raising hundreds of millions already and says that it’s planning to wrap the project up in the purchase of a Nasdaq-listed firm. Li Lin’s Avenir Capital has invested $200 million, and Shen Bo’s Fenbushi Capital has extensive experience in the field of blockchain. Cai Wensheng’s participation lends even more credibility. His firm, Meitu, was one of the earliest publicly traded companies to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2021. This increasing financial support in Asia strengthens market positivity for ETH ETF funds. Solana’s Hong Kong ETF Approval Adds Fuel The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has authorized ChinaAMC’s spot Solana ETF (3460) for launch on Monday. The product is the first Solana ETF approved in Asia, which highlights institutional demand for fast blockchain asset classes. According to ChinaAMC, the ETF will be denominated in HKD, CNY, and USD, and will have a management fee of 0.99%. OSL Digital Securities will carry out the trading and custody services. This comes at a time when investors expect potential approvals of Solana’s ETFs in the US later this year. With a strong performance, speed, and a strong presence across the globe, Solana has been one of the best altcoins to buy this week due to its official backing and increasing accessibility. Polkadot Boosts Utility With Asset Hub Integration Polkadot continues to build its network utility with the Asset Hub adding support for stablecoin transactions for USDT and USDC. The upgrade, which has been made possible by Crypto.com, enables direct transfers of stablecoins and other assets across the Polkadot ecosystem. Asset Hub is transforming interchain transfer and improving DeFi compatibility, making Polkadot a pioneer in blockchain interoperability. The competition is also part of Binance’s recent support for the network’s migration to enhance its liquidity and developer accessibility. These developments make DOT one of the top altcoins to invest in this week among investors looking for scalability, stablecoin integration, and multi-chain demand growth. Chainlink Whale Accumulation Signals Rising Confidence Chainlink’s on-chain activity indicates strong buying activity from large investors around the $18 range. The 30-day MVRV liquidation ratio dipped below 5% on October 17, which is a signal that has been commonly associated with heavy accumulation. Binance wallets recorded more than 400,000 LINK in large transactions as buying increased. Source: Coinglass This phase is thought to be indicative of a renewed long-term confidence in Chainlink as it continues to underpin critical blockchain infrastructure. The oracle technology of this project is still crucial in the DeFi, tokenized assets, and integration of real-world data. With the return of whales, LINK is one of the strongest utility and stability tokens during significant market fluctuations. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Stability Amid the ETF Buzz With the ETF buzz in Asia, MAGACOIN FINANCE quietly emerges as a presale space standout. It has raised over $16.5 million and demonstrates exceptional traction in a sector where many early projects wither following their launch. With its steady growth, transparent roadmap, and longer-term value proposition in contrast to short-lived presales, it stands out. In a volatile environment, investors are moving towards value-storing assets that can also help maintain trust in the community. It is quite evident that whales are already looking ahead long-term at MAGACOIN FINANCE – an altcoin that is considered by insiders to be one of the best altcoins to buy this week for investors looking for stability beyond hype. Conclusion Ethereum ETF activity in Asia has rekindled global crypto excitement. Institutional Participation is on the rise, and investor sentiment is moving in a positive direction across the market. The trust is renewed by Solana, Polkadot, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. This steady growth, adoption, and market activity are why they are considered to be one of the best altcoins to buy this week by analysts. As liquidity increases and innovation speeds up, these coins may characterize the next iteration of crypto growth.

Bitcoin Is At Risk Of Losing The 0.85 Quantile Level In its latest weekly report, analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is currently looking from the perspective of the Supply Quantiles Cost Basis model. This model maps price levels according to the amount of BTC supply that would be lost if the cryptocurrency were to trade at its current price today. There are three supply “quantiles” involved in the indicator: 0.95, 0.85, and 0.75, corresponding to levels where 5%, 15%, and 25% of the supply would be held at a loss, respectively. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Rebound? This Metric Says More Pain Needed First Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the different Bitcoin supply quantiles over the last few years. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin surged above the 0.95 quantile during its price rally earlier in the month, as the supply in profit approached the 100% mark during the new all-time high (ATH). With the recent bearish action, however, the cryptocurrency has fallen below the line and is now trading around the 0.85 quantile situated at $108,600. Thus, it would appear that about 15% of the BTC supply is in the red at the moment. Bitcoin has already faced dips below this mark, so it’s possible that the coin may be at risk of losing the line. “Historically, failure to hold this threshold has signalled structural market weakness and often preceded deeper corrections toward the 0.75 quantile,” explained the analytics firm. BTC last saw such a decline to the 0.75 quantile during the consolidation period in mid-2024. Currently, this level is equivalent to $97,500. It now remains to be seen whether the asset can maintain above the 0.85 quantile, and if not, whether a retest of the 0.75 quantile will take place. The 0.95 quantile isn’t the only level that Bitcoin has lost during the recent drawdown; its price has also dropped below the average cost basis of the short-term holders (STHs) located at $113,100. STHs here refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This group is considered to represent the fragile side of the market, prone to making panic moves during times of volatility. With BTC dropping below the cost basis of the cohort, its members are now underwater. “Historically, this structure often precedes the onset of a mid-term bearish phase, as weaker hands begin to capitulate,” noted Glassnode.

Warren Slams Trump’s CZ Pardon Decision, While Supporters Rally Behind Binance Founder",https://cryptonews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-slamps-president-trump-decision-to-pardon-changpeng-zhao/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Thursday sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon Binance founder Changpeng Zhao , calling it an example of political corruption that Congress must address. Her comments followed reports that Zhao, known widely as CZ, had sought closer ties with Trump’s circle in recent months. According to the Wall Street Journal, Zhao and his associates had backed initiatives related to the Trump family’s crypto ventures, which drew scrutiny from US lawmakers. Trump’s Inner Circle Viewed CZ Case as Weak, Warren Fires Back Trump reportedly told advisers he believed prosecutors targeted Zhao unfairly. Several insiders claimed that Trump viewed the fraud case against Zhao as weak and undeserving of a felony charge or prison sentence. In a post on X, Warren wrote: “CZ pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison. But then he financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon.” “If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption, it owns it,” she added. CZ pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison. But then he financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon. Today, he got it. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption, it owns it. pic.twitter.com/NsWeaJcVeK — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) October 23, 2025 Zhao Rejects Claims of Involvement in Trump Family’s USD1 Token Zhao has denied direct involvement in financing Trump’s stablecoin project, USD1, which is issued by World Liberty Financial, a company linked to the former president’s family. However, Bloomberg reported that Binance provided technical code for the token’s underlying smart contract, which governed its creation and transfer. The token was later used in a $2b transaction when a UAE-based firm purchased a stake in Binance . Zhao publicly rejected the report, calling it “another hit piece,” and claimed it was “sponsored by a competitor.” He accused the publication of spreading fear and misinformation in the crypto community. Warren Accused of Misrepresenting CZ’s Case as Debate Over Trump’s Pardon Deepens Warren’s remarks reignited debate over Zhao’s legal past. Critics argued that Warren misrepresented his conviction, noting that Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to implement adequate anti-money laundering controls rather than committing money laundering himself. Respectfully, the only corruption here is the corruption of the truth in your words. CZ did not please guilty to money laundering. Also, he's the only first-time offender in U.S. history to serve prison time for a single, non-fraud BSA charge This pardon addresses an injustice — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) October 23, 2025 Zhao’s 2023 plea deal resolved one of the largest enforcement actions in US crypto history. He admitted that Binance did not establish sufficient know-your-customer and compliance procedures, allowing illicit transactions on the exchange. As part of the settlement, Binance paid a $4.3b fine , and Zhao personally paid $50m before stepping down as CEO. He served a four-month prison sentence in 2024. CZ Thanks Trump, Vows to Help Make America the Capital of Crypto After receiving Trump’s pardon, Zhao said he was “deeply grateful” and pledged that Binance would support US leadership in digital assets. “Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide,” he said. Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide. (Still in flight, more posts to come.)… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 23, 2025 The decision to pardon Zhao has split political opinion. While Warren and several Democratic lawmakers condemned the move as a setback for accountability, many crypto advocates see it as a turning point for fairer treatment of the industry. The controversy arrives at a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation in the US. Trump’s administration has backed legislation to clarify oversight of exchanges and stablecoins, while Warren continues to push for tighter restrictions on crypto platforms. The post Sen.

Rowe Price, the US asset manager with $1.8 trillion in assets, has filed to launch its first crypto exchange-traded fund, according to regulatory filings and market reports. The filing seeks registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an actively managed product that would give investors exposure to a basket of digital tokens rather than a single coin. Active Fund Aims For Multiple Coins Based on reports, the proposed vehicle — referred to as the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF — would normally hold five to 15 different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are expected to be on the eligible list, along with other top tokens such as Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC). The filing describes an active approach: managers would select and weigh assets using valuation, momentum and fundamental analysis rather than simply tracking a passive benchmark. A Different Kind Of Crypto ETF Most recent US filings on Wall Street have focused on single-asset ETFs or passive funds that mirror an index. This product , by contrast, is framed as an actively managed, multi-asset fund. That distinction matters because active management gives the team flexibility to shift allocations over time, but it also introduces manager risk and typically higher fees. The filing notes the intent to seek returns that beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index, though it stops short of promising any particular outcome. Wall Street: Regulatory Hurdles Remain According to the filings, the request is now subject to the SEC’s review process. Approval is not guaranteed. Issues such as custody of digital assets, daily valuation, trading rules and operational safeguards are likely to be scrutinized by regulators before any listing is permitted. What This Could Mean For Markets Wall Street watchers say the move is significant because it signals that a large, long-standing manager is willing to offer regulated crypto exposure to mainstream clients. If the SEC approves the product, it could open another door for institutional and retail flows into a broader set of tokens, not just Bitcoin and Ethereum. That said, the active structure could lead to different performance patterns compared with passive crypto ETFs, and investors would need to weigh the potential benefits against added costs and manager decisions.

On one hand, major bank Standard Chartered PLC has flagged the potential for Bitcoin to dip below $100,000 in the near term. Related Reading: 16,000 Ancient Bitcoins Just Moved—And It’s Costing Whales Billions On the other hand, significant growth in global M2 money supply strengthens the backdrop for a longer-term upside. Short-Term Correction Predicted as Trade & Liquidity Risks Mount According to head of digital asset research Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered, Bitcoin could briefly fall under the $100,000 mark amid intensifying global risks, particularly the escalating U.S.–China trade tensions. BTC's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Although he deems the drop as temporary, Kendrick frames it as a “buying opportunity,” asserting this may be “the last time Bitcoin is EVER below” $100,000. He further points to shifts in capital flows, notably from gold into Bitcoin, as signs of rotation and deeper structural appeal. Technical indicators such as the 50-week moving average are cited as meaningful support zones, adding credence to his view that the correction may be short-lived. Bullish Macro Backdrop: M2 Growth & Institutional Flows Intact Despite the caution in the short run, the macro landscape offers supportive themes. Analysts note that global M2 money supply growth accounts for a significant portion of Bitcoin’s historical price variance, highlighting the asset’s evolving role beyond speculative crypto. As central banks continue to inject liquidity, Bitcoin’s correlation with broader money-supply trends reinforces its potential as a hedge or portfolio diversifier rather than purely a speculative vehicle. Furthermore, institutional interest and on-chain activity remain elevated, underscoring that this pull-back could be a healthy mid-cycle reset rather than a structural reversal. What This Means for Bitcoin (BTC) Investors In practical terms, investors should brace for potential near-term downside around or below $100,000 while keeping an eye on key support levels and macro catalysts. Kend­rick maintains his bullish target of $200,000 by year-end and even $500,000 by 2028, suggesting that the current dip could represent a long-term entry point. Related Reading: Last-Ever Bitcoin Dip Below $100,000 Looms This Week, Standard Chartered Warns At the same time, the market remains exposed to trade-war developments, Fed policy surprises, and liquidity shocks, factors that could trigger more substantial movement.

Source: X Every pullback received a consistent buying interest from large owners, and based on Merlijn the Trader, Ethereum is tracking the identical trail of Gold before its rocket launch. This comparison has elicited optimism within social media with traders seeking confirmation candles beyond the downward channel. Provided that the support level of $3,800 is not broken, Ethereum is capable of starting a breakout phase that will see it go beyond $4,100 in a matter of days. The failure to sustain the zone may however, result in a retest to short-term around $3,400 before another higher low is established. In any case, the sentiment is biased towards a continued bullish trend in the next sessions. HYPE and Cardano Show Early Recovery Signs Traders note that HYPE is hovering near the $34.5 mark, maintaining a slight edge above its $34 support. Past trading sessions show the MVN region often sparks price rebounds, and several analysts suggest this zone could attract new buyers. If momentum continues, a climb toward $37.8 and possibly $40.7 remains within reach. Market watchers also point to the $36.2 range as an area where stronger movement could confirm the next bullish phase. However, Cardano price is resistant to recent volatility. The token has observed its higher low set up and has stood firm around the $0.63 region. Analyst Ali Charts pointed out that “a breakout structure was still valid, which supported the bullish outlook of Cardano over the long term. As long as ADA can maintain this structure, its next upward leg might revisit the range of $0.80-$1.00 and then extend to $1.30. Source: X Across both assets, traders are showing renewed confidence, suggesting that capital rotation is already underway from older large-cap coins toward smaller, higher-upside opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Surges as Investors Rush In The increased buzz on the early-stage projects has made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the fastest-expanding presales in 2025. CoinMarketCap tracking data shows the project has already collected over $16.5 million and attracted over 16,000 investors within a relatively short period of time. Over 89% of the presale tokens in circulation are already sold, and there is little time to get other buyers before the next stage. There is growing institutional interest as traders anticipate the next token exchange listings, which would open the global market to more people. With early participation, there is a rapid expectancy of price discovery as the listing processes proceed, which causes valuations to grow with an increase in liquidity. Analysts refer to this stage as the“final opportunity” to achieve early-stage access before larger availability leads to demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE marked its recent milestone with a 50% bonus under the PATRIOT50X code, a move aimed at rewarding early supporters. The incentive has drawn noticeable attention, with the presale continuing to attract steady participation as pricing steps advance. Consequently, analysts have flagged the crypto presale as the best altcoin to buy before listings in 2025 Q4. Final Take Across the market, participants appear to be building positions in select assets rather than chasing volatility. As networks such as Ethereum, Cardano, and HYPE refine their ecosystems, interest is gradually shifting toward presales that combine timing, scarcity, and tangible use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits within that narrative, supported by an active base of holders, early traction in its rollout, and a defined roadmap that extends toward its liquidity phase. To individuals who are scanning the market for the best crypto to buy before the 2025 rally, MAGACOIN FINANCE is providing a limited time slot to join the presale before it ends. Its robust momentum, future exchange access, and growing base of investors keep making it the best crypto to buy at present as anticipation runs throughout the market.

While the price remains within a defined range, recent signals from several market watchers suggest a possible shift in direction. However, the likelihood of a correction appears firmer at the moment. Technical Setup Suggests Room for Upside XRP continues to move within an ascending channel that has held since late 2024. According to ChartNerd, the asset is currently testing support at the lower end of that channel, near $2.40. On the weekly chart, the MACD histogram shows a series of higher lows, even as the price trends sideways—often read as a sign of building momentum. $XRP is showing signs of a bullish reversal on the horizon. Channel support awaits below, with HLs on the weekly MACD, and SRSI levels in oversold territory. $5 is the first move of many on the next impulse. I believe XRP will front-run within the bluechips category – #NFA pic.twitter.com/uCtPmOb2wz — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 23, 2025 The Stochastic RSI has dropped into oversold territory, printing a level of 6.24. Previous setups like this have preceded upward moves, though confirmation is still needed. ChartNerd said the first upside target in this scenario sits around $5, in line with the channel’s top range. Near-Term Pressure Still in Play While long-term signals look constructive, short-term charts show continued weakness. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a bearish view, noting that XRP has broken below a key support at $2.60. The current setup shows lower highs and lower lows, which supports a possible retest of $2.00. “$XRP continues to slide. Next key target sits at $2,” Ali posted. Unless the price reclaims the $2.60 level, the short-term structure leans bearish. This range is also consistent with levels where buying interest returned earlier this year. Source: Ali Martinez/X Moreover, traders are monitoring two main zones. CryptoWZRD pointed to $2.30 as a support level that could attract buyers if retested. A move above $2.55 would mark the next resistance and may set up a stronger recovery. XRP closed the previous daily candle with a slight loss, while XRPBTC also moved lower. WZRD noted, “XRP will follow XRPBTC and Bitcoin’s overall price action tomorrow.” A move toward $2.75 remains in play if the broader market turns. Large Holders Trim Positions According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, wallets holding over 1 billion XRP have offloaded approximately 1.09 billion tokens since October 16. This $2.63 billion shift marks one of the larger whale moves in recent weeks. Mid-size wallets also saw declines, though at a slower pace. Even with these movements, the price held steady between $2.33 and $2.44. Analysts described this range as an accumulation zone rather than a breakdown. Institutions appear to be rotating within the range ahead of possible catalysts. Ripple-backed firm Evernorth announced plans to list on Nasdaq via a merger, as previously reported . The company will focus on building services around XRP, adding to market interest in the asset’s long-term outlook.

The press release is France’s leadership attempting to address concerns about the EU’s aggressive EV targets amid economic challenges. France is still committed to decarbonization efforts The press release begins by reaffirming France’s commitment to supporting the competitiveness of the French automotive sector, a competitiveness it says is based on the “ability to innovate, invest in future technologies and guarantee fair conditions in the face of international competition.” It then goes on to talk about France’s priority, which is to produce in France and in Europe the vehicles sold on the continent, so as to strengthen strategic autonomy, preserve jobs and make the automotive industry a pillar of the European ecological transition. “The Minister for Ecological Transition, Biodiversity and International Negotiations on Climate and Nature, Monique Barbut, the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industrial, Energy and Digital Sovereignty, Roland Lescure, and the Minister Delegate for Industry, Sébastien Martin, hope that the European regulation on CO2 emissions from new vehicles will above all serve automobile production in Europe and introduce a real incentive for European preference in the automobile industry to increase investments and industrial establishments in France and on the continent, particularly in electric vehicles,” the press release states. It goes on further to state how France wishes to pursue the electrification of vehicles and will defend flexibilities in terms of technological neutrality, but only if they are paired with very clear measures to encourage European preference that support industrial jobs in Europe. “It is in this spirit that France has already defended and obtained the smoothing of manufacturers’ objectives between 2025 and 2027,” it says. “This means producing vehicles sold within the Union in Europe, using European components. Vehicles that benefit European equipment manufacturers and help maintain and create industrial jobs in Europe must be supported.” The document also mentioned batteries and electric motors, as well as some of the most sensitive electronic components, and how they need to be produced in Europe because its “sovereignty over a strategic technology for the future of mobility depends on it.” The document concluded by reiterating France’s plan to prioritize responsibility and pragmatism, without compromising on the ambition or commitments that were made to the French people and to Europe. EU drafts measures to control prices in its new carbon market The official joint statement from France’s Ministries of Ecological Transition and Economy comes after news revealed the European Union is drafting measures to control prices in its new carbon market, a direct response to governments’ concerns that the emissions-cutting scheme could increase fuel bills. The policy is designed to impose a price from 2027 on planet-heating emissions produced by heating and transport fuels, pushing more consumers to shift to electric vehicles and cleaner home heating systems. Revenue generated from the scheme will reportedly be spent on helping people pay bills, subsidize electric cars and energy-saving home renovations. The big issue is that some governments are worried the measure will stoke opposition to climate change policies from citizens, especially if they feel like it is raising their bills. So far this year, a group of 19 countries, including the Czech Republic, France and Germany have asked Brussels to introduce stricter price controls to address this. “I understand the concerns regarding uncertainties on future price levels and price volatility in ETS2 (the upcoming carbon market) and share those to a large extent,” EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said, in a letter addressing the demands. Hoekstra has also said the Commission will propose doubling the number of permits released in this scenario to potentially reach up to 80 million per year in 2027, 2028 and 2029 which will more decisively address unwarranted price rises and improve market confidence, both crucial factors that influence decarbonization investments. In 2026, the Commission will also propose launching carbon permit auctions to ensure governments have the funds to kick-start investments that will help people make the shift more easily.

The metal that once symbolized stability is now showing cracks, while BTC, the asset branded as volatile, has remained remarkably resilient. What It Means For Bitcoin Next Market Cycle For decades, gold has been hailed as the ultimate safe-haven, and it has been rock-solid. However, a seasoned financial analyst, Tom Tucker, has revealed on X that Gold, the world’s oldest store of value, has lost $2.5 trillion in market value, which is more than the entire Bitcoin market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supercycle? Jeff Park Says Gold’s $1 Trillion Gains Could Spark It Meanwhile, the crypto Fear and Greed Index is flashing extreme fear, signaling that sentiment across digital assets is near panic levels. Tom Tucker warns that traders should stay cautious, as BTC could follow the gold path. CryptoMichNL, the CIO and Founder of MNFund and MNCapital, has observed that gold has printed a harsh move, as it corrected by more than 8% in a single day. At the same time, Bitcoin moved up massively, but later gave back most of its gains. According to CryptoMichNL, this turbulence in gold is not a lasting trend. The volatility of gold is extremely high, which is a direct consequence of its status as a massive outlier with an incredible parabolic run over recent months. If gold has indeed topped out, that would open the door for capital rotation towards other assets. However, a soft Consumer Price Index (CPI) print on the horizon should trigger the potential rate cuts and the end of the US government shutdown. Otherwise, BTC’s consolidation might start running as risk-on appetite. Why Bitcoin Will Extend Above Its Recent Consolidation Historically, Gold has seen sharp drawdowns. Senior Analyst at CoinDesk and Advisor at Coinsilium Group and ForzaBitcoin, James Van Straten, explained that the last significant gold correction took place in August 2020. On August 6, gold hit an all-time high of $2,035, only to drop 5% on August 11, and then enter a 20% correction that lasted roughly seven months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Taken Gold’s Role In Today’s World, Eric Trump Says During that same period, Bitcoin was consolidating below $10,000 before surging to new highs that year, a move largely fueled by COVID-19-era stimulus, which acted as a powerful accelerant. Fast forward to today, James Van Straten believes that as BTC’s current phase is consolidating above $100,000, it may extend mid-cycle. This is due to strong parallels that gold has once again entered a significant correction, crypto liquidation events, the specter of a US government shutdown, looming rate cuts, and AI-driven capex expenditure, which continues to shape market sentiment and liquidity dynamics.

Here’s the full schedule. WazirX Trading Restart Will Begin Rolling Out This Friday As announced in a new blogpost , WazirX is finally gearing up to restart trading. The crypto platform has been inoperational since July 2024, when it fell prey to a massive $235 million hack . User funds have remained stuck with WazirX in this period, but with the exchange now rolling out a restart, creditors should at last be able to get their digital assets back. According to the blog post, the platform will enable trading in phases over four days, starting October 24th and reaching full activation by October 27th. Each day, around 25% of all tokens will go on listing. During this initial rollout, all tokens will be available for trading in the USDT market, but INR trading pairs outside of USDT/INR will be gradually enabled later. WazirX explained: This phased rollout will help restore liquidity safely, confirm technical stability, and ensure a gradual and reliable return to normal trading across all market pairs. The Indian exchange is also set to offer zero trading fees for the first 30 days of the restart, with a potential extension depending on how the community responds to it. The trading restart announcement comes a day after WazirX reopened both INR and crypto deposits. Although the blog post contained no clarification about when withdrawals will start, the platform’s founder and CEO, Nischal Shetty, has shared the relevant info in an X post . Shetty has noted that INR withdrawals are already live on the exchange, with crypto withdrawals beginning alongside the trading restart on Friday. “We will continue to add more tokens to the trading and withdrawal list,” said the WazirX CEO. WazirX’s reopening arrives after several months of proceedings in Singapore’s High Court, where the platform’s parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd, a Singaporean entity, had to obtain the green light for a restructuring scheme. The High Court finally approved the scheme earlier this month, and WazirX made it active on October 15th. The exchange had promised a restart within 10 business days, and with the plan to restart on October 24th, it appears to be right on schedule. In July of this year, CoinDCX , another major Indian crypto exchange, also suffered a breach. Hackers stole around $44 million in digital assets, but in this case, the tokens came from the exchange’s own internal treasury, not user funds. The timing of the hack was eerie, as it occurred exactly one year and one day after the WazirX incident. The WazirX hack has been linked with the North Korean Lazarus Group, and CoinDCX’s event is also suspected to involve the same or a similar entity.

The Company also revealed it would be staking its SOL holdings directly from custody at Anchorage Digital Bank. On-chain data showed that Solana Company currently has over 2.2 million SOL in its treasury, worth around $396 million, which it will use for its staking initiatives. According to the Company, the collaboration aims to earn the firm more staking rewards, enable it to participate in governance, and also boost support for the Solana network. HSDT seeks to earn more staking rewards Can’t get rid of us that easily 🙃 We’re back and now staking with @Heliuslabs and other top Solana validators @TwinStake_IO and @Anchorage to strengthen our $SOL treasury. Earning onchain yield in a secure and compliant way while continuing to support the Solana ecosystem 🫡 pic.twitter.com/FziozHCRvj — Solana Company $HSDT (@Solana_Company) October 23, 2025 Helius and Twinstake ( both Providers) have already established non-custodial staking and restaking solutions that allow the Company’s users to delegate, stake, and restake their digital assets to earn rewards. According to the announcement, the firms agreed that the Providers will provide the Company with certain services, including staking, voting with staked tokens, and reporting on the staked tokens. Joseph Chee, executive chairman of HSDT and chairman of Summer Capital, acknowledged that staking with industry giants like Helius and Twinstake allows firms to strengthen the operations of their SOL holdings while contributing to the Solana network. He also noted that both Providers rank among the top 25 validators on the Solana ecosystem by total SOL staked, arguing that they have an established track record and strong confidence within the community. Cosmo Jiang, board observer at HSDT, explained that the firm sees staking as a core part of its return generation strategy and a show of its commitment to Solana’s long-term growth. He added that such partnerships position HSDT to maximize on-chain yield in a secure, compliant, and scalable manner. Jiang also acknowledged that collaborating with top-tier validators such as Helius reinforces the firm’s focus on institutional-grade execution and network alignment. At the time of publication, Helius has over 13 million SOL staked on its platform. The leading Solana validator also offers institutional-grade staking services and operates SOC 2 Type II-compliant infrastructure, which it said ensures uptime, performance, and security. The Company revealed that Twinstake and Anchorage Digital’s regulated and enterprise-level staking expands the firm’s exposure to the broader Solana validator ecosystem. “Crypto is connecting the internet of value. Solana today is the only blockchain network with the scale to onboard all of the world’s capital markets, microtransactions, and AI payments. Together with the Solana Company, we’re accelerating institutional adoption of Solana, and building the future of the world’s trading terminal.” – Mert Mumtaz , Co-Founder and CEO of Helius. The Company noted that Solana has historically been the fastest-growing blockchain in transaction volume, processing more than 3,500 transactions per second. Solana’s adoption has also surged, with an average of approximately 3.7 million daily active wallets, and it has surpassed 23 billion transactions year-to-date. Solana Company also cited SOL as a financially productive blockchain, which offers a ~7% native staking yield compared to other assets like BTC, which are non-yield-bearing. HSDT seeks to support tokenized networks by providing SOL holding services HSDT revealed that its mission as an independent treasury company is to support the growth and security of tokenized networks by providing long-term SOL holding services. The firm, formerly Helius Medical Technologies, added that it continues to develop its neurotech and medical device operations. HSDT previously developed medical devices, but has since transitioned to a Solana-focused treasury company, which offers regulated market exposure to the Solana network. The firm diversified into SOL treasury operations as it sought to stabilize its finances after its stock collapsed from $182.75 in June to $9.76 a month later. The Company started its treasury operations on September 15, but has yet to onboard investors. At the time of publication, HSDT shares are currently trading at $6.63, up more than 6.55% after the partnership announcement. The firm’s stock price has also plummeted by nearly 60% in the past 30 days, according to Google Finance data. Chee argued that volatility created opportunity, and conviction is tested in such initiatives. He also affirmed that HSDT is not running from market pressure, but rather leaning into it.

In a recent analysis shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO unveiled what he described as XRP’s worst-case scenario before a potential major rally . His chart, showing what he called the “biggest liquidation candle in history,” sent shockwaves through the community and reignited discussion on how far XRP could fall, or soar, next. The Shockwave: A Record-Breaking Liquidation Event Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency market was rocked by one of the largest liquidation events ever recorded . More than $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out in a matter of hours, sparking panic across exchanges. XRP was among the hardest hit, plunging sharply before staging a swift recovery that caught many traders off guard. Are you mentally prepared for this possible #XRP scenario? pic.twitter.com/JiLl1l0xhL — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 22, 2025 On the Bitstamp 2-hour chart, Steph identified a massive liquidation wick that marked a key turning point. The candle, which he referred to as the biggest in history, represented the moment when over-leveraged traders were flushed out of the market. Such capitulation events, while brutal, often serve as a cleansing reset that clears excess leverage and paves the way for a stronger, more sustainable uptrend. Technical Breakdown: When Pain Becomes Opportunity From a technical perspective, the chart shows XRP collapsing into a deep liquidity zone before rebounding with force—a classic market reset. As stop-losses triggered and margin calls cascaded, XRP’s price fell into oversold territory. Within hours, institutional buy orders stepped in, triggering a dramatic reversal. Steph explained that this move may have defined XRP’s lowest boundary for the current cycle—a point of maximum pain that could precede significant upside momentum. By wiping out weak hands and overextended positions, the market effectively leveled the playing field, creating the conditions for a more stable recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This pattern is not unique to XRP; similar liquidations have historically marked the end of bearish phases in other major cryptocurrencies, often followed by explosive rallies once market confidence returns. Market Psychology: Fear Before the Breakout Despite the initial panic, market sentiment has begun to shift. Trading volume has rebounded, open interest has normalized, and long-term holders appear to be accumulating again. These are often the early signals of a recovery phase, suggesting that the worst may be behind. However, Steph cautioned that volatility will remain elevated. The market could continue to test investor resolve before confirming a sustained uptrend. In his view, success in this environment depends less on predicting every price move and more on maintaining emotional discipline through uncertainty. The Mental Game: Surviving the Storm XRP’s recent price action wasn’t just a technical event—it was a psychological test. The “biggest liquidation candle in history” exposed the emotional extremes that drive the crypto market: fear, panic, and disbelief. Yet, as Steph emphasized, those moments of capitulation often precede transformation. If his analysis proves correct, XRP may have already faced its harshest downside scenario. What lies ahead could be the beginning of the long-awaited rally— but only for those mentally prepared to withstand the volatility that comes before it.

The price is now struggling to clear $2.420 and might decline if it trades below the $2.350 support. XRP price is attempting to recover above the $2.350 zone. The price is now trading above $2.350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.420 resistance. XRP Price Attempts Recovery XRP price formed a base above $2.30 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price surpassed the $2.3750 and $2.380 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5320 swing high to the $2.3275 low. However, the bears are currently active near the $2.420 zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a contracting triangle forming with resistance at $2.420 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.420 level. It is also close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.5320 swing high to the $2.3275 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.480 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.380 level. The next major support is near the $2.350 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.350 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.250 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.20. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.350 and $2.320.

The expansion spans Fidelity Crypto, Fidelity Crypto for IRAs, Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers and Fidelity Digital Assets, which caters to institutional clients. The move signals the continued mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. It also comes as Solana cements its position as one of the most traded digital assets globally, supported by its growing developer base and expanding institutional footprint. Nick Ducoff, head of institutional growth at the Solana Foundation, confirmed the rollout on X, sharing screenshots that showed Solana listed as a tradable asset on Fidelity’s platform. Retail investors in U.S. can now purchase SOL in their @Fidelity brokerage account Some screenshots from my account NFA pic.twitter.com/gDqOdSpp6C — Nick Ducoff (@nickducoff) October 23, 2025 Fidelity Highlights Solana’s Cost Efficiency And Scalability Fidelity published an explainer on Solana on Thursday, describing it as a blockchain that processes about 60,000 transactions per minute on average, compared with roughly 250 for Bitcoin and 800 for Ethereum. The company noted that Solana’s transaction fees are typically just fractions of a cent, while Bitcoin and Ethereum often cost at least 50 cents per transaction. Solana, like Ethereum, allows third-party developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts on its network. Its speed and low costs have made it popular for payments, trading, and new blockchain-based projects. Frequent Network Outages Raise Questions About Solana’s Long-Term Stability However, Solana’s rise has not been without setbacks. The network has faced reliability challenges in the past, with several major outages that raised concerns about its stability. The most recent incident occurred in Feb. 2024, when the blockchain went offline for five hours . The outage was its first in over a year, signaling some improvement in network performance, though critics still question whether Solana can maintain consistent uptime under heavy demand. Earlier this year, in March 2025, congestion issues resurfaced when a memecoin frenzy briefly crippled the network. The surge in activity made Solana nearly unusable for several hours, prompting renewed scrutiny of its scalability claims. Institutional Access Expands as Solana ETFs Gain Traction Across Major Markets Despite these hurdles, Solana’s market momentum continues to grow. The 21Shares Solana Spot ETF in the US recently received approval following the SEC’s clearance of its Form 8-A filing, enabling it to trade on a major American exchange. The product gives investors direct exposure to Solana’s spot price, a milestone that could further boost institutional participation. In Asia, Hong Kong’s securities regulator also approved its first Solana spot ETF this week. The move makes Solana the third cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, to gain such approval in the city and strengthens Hong Kong’s bid to become a leading hub for regulated digital assets. Fidelity’s addition of Solana rounds out a significant month for the blockchain, which has seen growing adoption from both Wall Street and global regulators. The listing offers investors a new entry point into one of the industry’s fastest-growing ecosystems, signaling that digital assets are becoming a permanent fixture in the financial mainstream.
