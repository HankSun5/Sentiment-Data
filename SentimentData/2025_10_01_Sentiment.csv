Poland’s New Crypto Law Faces Pushback,https://bitcoinist.com/too-tough-polands-new-crypto-law-faces-pushback/,"Poland’s lower house has approved a wide-ranging crypto bill that would put the country’s entire virtual asset market under stricter state control. Based on reports, the measure — known as Bill 1424 — passed the lower house of Poland’s national parliament, or Sejm , with 230 votes in favor and 196 opposed. The law would give the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, KNF, sweeping powers over exchanges, issuers and custodians operating in or serving customers in Poland. What The Law Requires According to coverage, the draft compels all Crypto Asset Service Providers to obtain a KNF license to operate in the market. It would set detailed rules on capital, internal controls, anti-money-laundering safeguards and risk management. Penalties are heavy: operating without a permit could draw fines up to 10 million złoty (about US$2.8 million) and, in some versions, criminal liability including up to two years in prison for serious breaches. Existing firms would get a six-month window to apply for authorization once the law takes effect. Sejm głosami ekspertów takich jak pani Skowrońska przyjął ustawę o zniszczeniu blackchaina i stabletcoinów w Polsce. Teraz senat, potem konieczne weto @NawrockiKn i można składać projekt ustawy rozwijający a nie zwijający rynek krypto aktywów w Polsce. pic.twitter.com/LgeSdNB4aD — Tomasz Mentzen (@TomaszMentzen) September 26, 2025 Supporters Say It Brings Clarity Backers argue the move will align Poland with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets rules and give clearer rules to investors and businesses. Clarity is meant to reduce scams and make large players feel safer about doing business in Poland. Some observers say stronger oversight could attract institutional money that has been wary of unclear local rules. Concerns From Industry And Lawmakers But many in Poland’s crypto community warn the bill goes further than EU minimums and could burden smaller players. Reports point to concerns about high costs and heavy paperwork that might push startups to move operations abroad. There is also worry the KNF’s review process could be slow; some sources claim decisions might take as long as 30 months, creating an uncertain climate for firms that need speed to survive. Artists, small issuers and hobbyist projects fear that strict rules will squeeze out low-budget activity. Transparency And Blocking Powers The draft would also require more disclosures from issuers and service providers. Regulators could maintain a register of unpermitted domains and use tools to block access. Supporters say this helps fight fraud. Critics say it risks overreach and could limit legitimate users’ access to services. Based on reports, after clearing the Sejm the text is moving to the Senate for review. President Karol Nawrocki has been reported to consider a veto unless certain provisions are softened, particularly those that introduce criminal penalties and broad supervisory powers. Lawmakers and industry groups are pressing for amendments that would narrow the scope of some requirements and ease costs for smaller operators.

The announcement marks a major milestone, as $MET is expected to serve as a governance and utility token, enabling voting on protocol decisions, staking for rewards, fee discounts, and participation in liquidity incentives. $MET 23.10.2025 The ignition point of our manifesto has arrived.

See you then. pic.twitter.com/xEjFn2bnX8 — Meteora (@MeteoraAG) September 30, 2025 When is the upcoming TGE for the $MET token? The vibes in the Solana ecosystem got a shot in the arm earlier today after Meteora’s announcement about its upcoming airdrop, which will target users who farmed points in Seasons 1 and 2 via liquidity provision and trading on the platform. The announcement post included a date — 23.10.2025 — presumed to be the exact day the TGE will happen. “The ignition point of our manifesto has arrived,” the post caption read. “We’re onboarding the next wave of the LP Army and powering token launches. $MET will fuel opportunity, innovation, and community. See you then.” Several days before the announcement on September 10, Meteora shared a five-part update that outlined the road to launch. It revealed how aggressively the team has been building in the background, which has led to the release of DBC and DAMM V2, which have been powering major launchpads like Believe, Bags, and DAOs.fun. The airdrop allocation is to be determined by a points allocation that the community has been accumulating over the past year. At the time that the team shared the update, it revealed its infrastructure is being scaled by up to 10x to handle user demand. As for the claim process, Meteora said in its September 10 post that users will be able to claim $MET (and potentially future airdrops) seamlessly via the Meteora interface. It has even been confirmed that eligible participants will enjoy a few of such drops prior to the official mMeteora token launch, so there is even more to look forward to in the coming days. The team has also outlined “Met-ober” updates, including TGE goals, Jupiter staker integrations (with extra rewards), and launch pool strategies to power new token launches on the platform. Other DeFi airdrops to watch out for The $MET TGE and airdrop is only one of the DeFi-focused drops slated to drop in the fourth quarter of this year. Other similar projects that Degens are staking include the Abstract Chain, Pump.fun, Kamino Finance, Solayer, LayerZero, Backpack and Hyperliquid, to name a few. Among these projects, some like LayerZero, Hyperliquid , and Kamino Finance, have already launched previous airdrop campaigns and are just rewarding users for another season of engagement. However, the likes of Solayer, Abstract Chain, Pump.fun, and Backpack are airdropping tokens to eligible users for the first time. All the projects listed above are expected to airdrop this Q4, except for Backpack, which reportedly has plans to launch in the first quarter of 2026. Between the $MET token and the remaining drops for the year, observers claim up to $500M+ could get injected into the crypto industry.

This is coming at a time when criticisms of him and his company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy have gone up a few decibels. In a recent conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Saylor compared Bitcoin to historic breakthroughs such as fire, electricity, and oil, calling it property, capital and energy in cyberspace. Saylor’s trillion-dollar Bitcoin endgame Saylor envisions Strategy building its Bitcoin treasury to $1 trillion and moving far beyond that. Strategy has already become the most prominent corporate Bitcoin holder since it pivoted in 2020 from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. Strategy now holds 640,031 BTC , purchased through a mix of cash reserves, convertible debt, and repeated equity issuance. It announced the acquisition of 196 Bitcoins for $22.1 million when the token dipped below $110,000, as Cryptopolitan reported on Monday. Saylor insists the model is only beginning to take hold. He notes that while only a handful of listed firms held Bitcoin in 2020 when Strategy went all in on the cryptocurrency, more than 180 do today. He predicts this will grow to thousands as companies shift their balance sheets toward digital assets. Saylor also believes that tech giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft will eventually embed Bitcoin into their operating systems and hardware. For Saylor, the stakes go beyond corporate profits. He frames Bitcoin as a foundation of economic integrity, decentralization, and energy efficiency, a financial system that can transfer value across time and space. Skeptics question the model Critics, however, remain unconvinced. There is also a very vocal group speaking about the “impending doom” that awaits Saylor’s Strategy and the people and institutions who have invested in them. In June this year, veteran short-seller Jim Chanos described parts of Saylor’s valuation logic as “ financial gibberish ,” questioning why Strategy trades at a premium to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Peter Schiff, chief economist and strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, also shared similar sentiments in an X post last week, calling Saylor’s business strategy “harebrained” and pointing out that Strategy (MSTR) has been “down 45%” since its November 2024 high. A recent report showed that Strategy’s stock, which for years traded well above the net asset value of its Bitcoin stash, has lost some of its luster. Saylor has brushed off the trend, saying he is unbothered. Analysts warn of dilution risk, since Strategy funds purchases largely by issuing stock or convertible notes. While the strategy boosts the Bitcoin treasury, it also leaves common shareholders with a smaller slice of the company. Saylor’s struggle to defend his vision is perennial Saylor dismisses such concerns, likening criticism of Bitcoin to historic resistance against electricity or nuclear power. Each new price milestone, he argues, brings a new wave of skeptics, yet adoption continues to expand. He also rejects the notion that corporate buying crowds out retail investors, pointing to the estimated $1.8 trillion in gains enjoyed by individuals since companies such as Strategy and BlackRock entered the market. The scale of his ambition, however, raises questions of feasibility. To reach a trillion-dollar Bitcoin reserve at current prices, Strategy would need to hold around 9 million BTC, close to half of the total supply that will ever exist. Even if Bitcoin rises sharply, the capital required would dwarf the company’s present means. However, the symbolic power of Saylor’s claim may be as important as its literal execution. In his telling, Bitcoin offers not just a speculative hedge but a chance to power a global system of trust. According to him, Strategy’s model will be remembered as a paradigm shift in corporate treasury management.

This makes it the first bank in Qatar to extend its network into blockchain for real-time USD settlements, eliminating the multi-day delays common in traditional systems. JPMorgan’s Expanding Network A Bloomberg report shows that the Kinexys system allows corporate clients to execute transactions in minutes, even on weekends or outside business hours. Kamel Moris, QNB’s Executive Vice President for Global Transaction Banking, described this as “a treasurer’s dream,” noting that transaction timeframes can be reduced to just two minutes, a major advantage for companies operating with tight liquidity. It also eliminates many of the inefficiencies in conventional payment networks by directly programming deposit accounts onto blockchain rails. These rails reportedly process $3 billion in daily payments across connected banks, making it easier for treasury teams to automate liquidity flows. JPMorgan has been steadily scaling Kinexys across the Middle East. The platform builds on the bank’s earlier blockchain initiatives, including the Onyx division and projects tied to Quorum, its enterprise blockchain. For the financial institution, QNB’s entry adds to a growing list of regional adopters. Companies such as Emirates NBD and Saudi National Bank have already joined the network, showing how Gulf lenders are prioritizing speed, transparency, and always-on settlement options. What This Means for the Banking Industry Studies show that local corporate payments depend on correspondent banks, with the structure causing delays due to time zone variance, business-hour restrictions, and other manual checks. Kinexys, on the other hand, allows payments to move directly on blockchain rails, which bypasses these traditional frictions. Large financial institutions worldwide are accelerating their use of distributed ledger technology, viewing it as a tool to simplify complex back-office processes. While banks have tested these systems for over a decade, few have been able to scale or achieve commercial viability. Earlier this year, Reuters also announced a partnership between India’s Axis Bank and JPMorgan to extend Axis clients’ access to 24/7 dollar transfers. This collaboration allowed the firm to streamline its liquidity management and unlocked advanced treasury capabilities such as multi-bank cash concentration. The technology provides more than just speed, offering lower costs and greater transparency. Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys, said in an interview that opening the network to such firms allows it to reach companies that are not direct clients of the bank. “This is institutional-grade scale,” he said.

The SEC's Division of Investment Management issued a so-called no-action letter on Tuesday , a document that assures that the regulator doesn't intend to pursue any enforcement actions by those engaging in the specific activity — in this case, that SEC-registered advisers and funds can park digital assets in state trusts. Such qualified-custodian questions had represented a policy battleground during the tenure of former SEC chairs Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, the former having led the agency to introduce a later-abandoned proposal that would have constrained what kinds of companies could handle the crypto of regulated investment advisers. Gensler made it clear he specifically meant to muscle out exchanges such as Coinbase. But the SEC's new management — most notably Chairman Paul Atkins — is pursuing a crypto-forward campaign, with Atkins saying earlier this week that establishing industry policies is the agency's top priority (as assigned by pro-crypto President Donald Trump). While Tuesday's no-action letter isn't a formal agency rule, it carries enough weight to free firms from short-term compliance worries. Specifically, the document said the SEC ""would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under the custody provisions against a registered adviser or regulated fund for treating a state trust company as a 'bank' with respect to the placement and maintenance of crypto assets."" The earlier argument from Gensler was that crypto firms weren't safe and sufficiently regulated to qualify as risk-free enough for registered investment advisers to keep their customers' assets. ""Even though it was never adopted, the proposal has created problems for investment advisers through its assertion that most crypto assets are likely to be funds or crypto asset securities covered by the current rule, and thus must be maintained with a qualified custodian,"" Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech in Singapore on Tuesday. She argued that the agency ""should consider updating the rules governing permissible custodians for registered investment advisers and investment companies,"" adding that maybe technologically adept companies should be permitted to custody assets themselves. But Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who was allied with Gensler on this point two years ago, issued a statement opposing the no-action treatment , saying the SEC is effectively treating crypto as something apart from the rest of the financial sector. And it's ignoring the efforts of firms pursuing federal chartering from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ""Rather than create a level playing field, we leave investors and the markets to gamble in an unnecessary game of 50-state regulatory roulette – just to accommodate crypto,"" she said. ""Executing a shift of this magnitude via no-action relief without public comment and without any economic analysis is ill-advised for many reasons, not least of which because it likely violates the Administrative Procedure Act, though this has become commonplace by this commission."" The SEC has been pursuing a number of crypto policies under Atkin's recent Project Crypto, and the chairman has set an agenda to issue formal crypto rules in the coming months. Meanwhile, Congress has made extensive progress on legislation to more completely regulate the U.S. digital assets markets.",Policy|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Hester Peirce|Paul Atkins|Regulations|Custody|Trusts|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-30 22:18:16

The $2 trillion market leader Bitcoin is just 9% down from its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 and is likely to set a new high watermark through the historically strong month of “Uptober”. US Policymakers are also accelerating a potential bull run. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first nationwide U.S. legislation focused on stablecoins, mandating full reserve requirements. Shortly after, the SEC announced Project Crypto , a framework aimed at modernizing securities laws to better fit the digital asset era. With stronger regulatory oversight, the next altcoin rally will eclipse the 2021 boom, fueled by regulatory clarity. If Claude AI’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Cardano, and Ethereum could be the leaders of this surge. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Sees Potential Gains of 700%+ Toward $24 Claude AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $24 by late 2025, a jump of more than 739% from its current price near $2.85. Source: Claude AI XRP has already shown resilience this cycle. On July 18, it hit $3.65, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40, before pulling back roughly 22% amid macro headwinds. Ripple’s payment network continues to expand globally and has received notable endorsements. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as an affordable remittance tool for emerging markets. Its years-long dispute with the SEC was resolved in early 2025 when the agency dropped its lawsuit, following a 2023 ruling confirming XRP’s retail sales do not meet the definition of securities. Claude AI suggests that a sustained move back above the July high could open the door to $4–$5, with a more aggressive bullish scenario placing upside potential anywhere between $7 and $24. Technical indicators have flagged three bullish formations across support and resistance zones in the past year, hinting at a possible rapid breakout in Q4. While markets largely shrugged at recent Fed cuts and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF, the SEC’s decisions on additional ETF applications expected next month, along with new federal crypto laws, could be major catalysts. Over the past year, XRP has surged 346%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 77.5% gains and delivering six times Ethereum’s 58% performance. Cardano ($ADA): Claude Predicts 8X Gains for the Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) has been regaining traction, in part due to growing political visibility. Most notably, U.S. President Trump recently floated the idea of including ADA in a federal crypto reserve, sourced entirely through enforcement seizures instead of market purchases. Created by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Cardano is unique for its academic, peer-reviewed development model and its strong focus on sustainability and scalability. With a market cap of over $28.8 billion, Cardano is steadily competing with Ethereum and closing the adoption gap with Solana. Claude forecasts ADA could hit $6.10 by year-end, a nearly 8X gain from its current level of $0.7934. From a technical perspective, ADA has been trading in a descending wedge since late 2024, facing resistance near $1.10. A strong Uptober push it to $2 by late Q4, but a bull run is likely the only thing that could drive it higher. Claude’s $6.10 target implies ADA would need to more than double its 2021 ATH of $3.09, a feat achievable only with the onset of rapid adoption, something that US regulators would need to cultivate with a framework. Ethereum ($ETH): Claude AI Predicts a Strong Push Higher for the Leading Smart Contract Network Ethereum ($ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized applications and DeFi, boasting a market capitalization above $502.4 billion. With more than $87.75 billion in total value locked (TVL), ETH’s role in smart contracts ensures its long-term relevance and adoption. Claude projects Ethereum could reach $6,925 by year’s end, a 66% increase from its current price of $4,169. Continuous improvements, whether from the Ethereum Foundation or Layer-2 scaling projects, reinforce ETH’s outlook. The introduction of spot ETFs has also brought in substantial and sustained institutional investment, as TradFi piggybacks off the price rises with regulated exposure to ETH. Additional upside could materialize if President Trump advances comprehensive crypto reforms, offering the regulatory certainty needed to spark further gains. Chart signals align with this view. After consolidating in a falling wedge, ETH rebounded from $1,800 to $2,412 in May, showing renewed whale accumulation. Coming into October, a bullish expanding triangle pattern lines the way to a potential run-up to $6,000 or beyond. If markets struggle to hold $4,000, ETH still has strong support around $3,500–$3,700. A recovery rally could see $5,000 as soon as mid-October, with $6,900 being the Christmas target. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New High Volatility Degen Play for Risk-Tolerant Meme Coin Heads For those chasing higher-risk meme coin plays beyond Claude AI’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) markets itself as Dogecoin’s wild gym bro cousin, leaning into high-volatility plays and degen meme culture as part of its brand identity. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream token, Maxi Doge embraces the satirical community-driven ethos of Dogecoin’s yesteryear. Its presale has already raised more than $2.6 million in just two months. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes grassroots community growth through Telegram and Discord activity, trading competitions, and cross-project partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion minted tokens, about 25% are set aside for the “Maxi Fund” to finance marketing and collaborations. Staking is available with yields currently around 129% APY, though rates will taper as more holders participate. The presale price sits at $0.00026, with incremental increases locked in as the presale advances through funding stages.

52491826,https://cryptonews.com/?p=430385,1759271400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52491826.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 30 September – XRP, Solana, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-30-september-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Markets are on the upswing today, and traders eyeing the explosive $4 trillion industry are asking the big question: which crypto projects are the best to buy right now? Bitcoin still trades roughly 10% below its record high (ATH) of $124,128 reached last month. Meanwhile, its market share is slipping, as enthusiasm shifts toward top-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have posted ATHs in the past year. The spark for this resurgence can be traced to two pivotal policy moves in Washington. First, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. framework specifically regulating stablecoins. Shortly after, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a modernization effort to adapt securities laws to the digital asset era. With confidence rebounding, the spotlight is on XRP, Solana, and Pepe as prime candidates for dip-buying ahead of what could be the next bullish cycle. Ripple ($XRP): The Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse and 2025’s Leading Altcoin Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) jumped to an all-time peak of $3.65 on July 18, coinciding with the passage of the GENIUS Act and eclipsing its previous 2018 record of $3.40. It has since eased back to around $2.85, roughly 22% off that high. XRP’s strength lies in its role as a low-cost, high-speed solution for global money transfers, positioning it as a modern challenger to systems like SWIFT. Its credibility has been bolstered by recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund and growing acceptance in the U.S. financial sector. Ripple’s regulatory influence was highlighted earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse took part in a White House crypto policy discussion. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, underscores its ambition to secure a piece of the fast-expanding stablecoin market. Momentum also picked up after a landmark 2023 ruling confirmed that XRP’s retail sales were not securities, a turning point in its long-running legal fight with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has rocketed 346%, leaving Bitcoin trailing with a still notable 77.5% gain over the same period. After rallying in July, it found support near $3 before a seasonal dip in September drove prices lower. Currently, XRP’s RSI sits near 45 and uptrending, hinting at the potential for more near-term price growth. Although rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF failed to trigger a breakout, likely due to being priced in, the appearance of three bullish flag patterns on its price chart, along with a swathe of pending ETF decisions due in mid-October, could quickly drive XRP above $6 or higher. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Rival and This Month’s Standout Large-Cap Performer Solana ($SOL) continues to prove itself as one of the fastest and cheapest blockchain platforms. Its market cap now exceeds $112 billion, with over $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama, showcasing its strength in decentralized finance. Excitement is growing around the possibility of Solana spot ETFs gaining approval in the U.S. next month, potentially unlocking institutional capital, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs did. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has surged back to $207. Chart watchers saw cup-and-handle formations throughout August and early September, reflecting recent bullish sentiment. Its 6% decline over the past week looks more like a healthy pullback than a cause for concern. With regulators moving to shape clearer rules for digital assets, Solana could stand to benefit significantly. It maintains a cool RSI at 45, signaling that the correction has given investors a solid entry point. Key support is around $150, with very sticky resistance near $250, although breaching it could provide bulls with the impetus for a breakout. A retest of its ATH of $293.31, or even a climb up to $400, appears well within reach before the end of 2025. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Phenomenon Still Packed With Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly became one of the top meme tokens by market cap, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s iconic frog character. Its rapid rise triggered a flood of copycats, though none matched its success. With a valuation near $4 billion, Pepe has captured global attention; Elon Musk even used its logo as his profile picture on X briefly. Currently priced at about $0.000009192, PEPE is down 67% from its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, as broader macroeconomic concerns weigh on crypto market sentiment. Still, October has historically been a strong month for crypto, and if the “Uptober” pattern holds, Pepe could be testing new highs as early as November, potentially even granting 3.5x gains by 2026. At present, its RSI sits at 38 and continues trending lower, suggesting further short-term declines before the weekend may open attractive entry points. Backers argue that a more favorable macro climate and growing optimism could propel PEPE into uncharted territory later this year. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): How a Bitcoin Layer 2 Became One of the Best Crypto Presales This Year Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the most promising presales heading into 2025, aiming to merge Bitcoin’s security with Layer-2 scalability while riding the momentum of meme culture and community governance. The project’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s functionality with faster payments, smart contract capabilities, and decentralized decision-making. To date, its presale has raised more than $19.3 million, with analysts forecasting potential gains of 10× or more after launch. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers ultra-low-cost smart contracts and supports a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers, as well as dApps, meme tokens, and payments. A recent audit by Coinsult reported no vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token powers the ecosystem via staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early investors can currently earn staking rewards of up to 61% APY while gaining voting privileges once governance goes live.

While these three tokens have actually taken hits today, the combination of their oversold technicals and the market’s recovering momentum should prime them for big rallies soon. We predict their future paths in this article, unpacking their indicators while also explaining why their fundamentals set them up nicely for some big gains in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Altcoin Ready to Break ATH on Back of Strong Fundamentals XRP has suffered a 1% decline in the past 24 hours, with its drop to $2.86 also marking a 5% decline in the last 14 days. Despite these dips, XRP remains in a very strong position, having risen by 340% in the past year. And if we look at its chart, we see that it may have bottomed out after two months of stop-start declines. Its relative strength index (yellow) has risen close to 50 again after dropping below 40 a few days ago, and this indicator has remained in a weak position for too long now. Source: TradingView We could say something similar about XRP’s MACD (orange, blue), which is still in a negative position, and which therefore should be coming up – along with the coin’s price – soon. More fundamentally, there’s every reason to be bullish about XRP, which could enjoy a massive boost in the next few weeks, as upwards of ten XRP ETFs begin launching . At the same time, Ripple itself is growing aggressively, having signed numerous partnerships , made acquisitions, and expanded into new territories . This expansion will increase adoption of and demand for XRP, which could set a new ATH (currently $3.65) by November or December. Crypto Price Prediction: Aster ($ASTER) – High-Momentum DEX Token Preparing for Another Breakout One of the newest coins in the top 100, ASTER has plunged by 7% in the past 24 hours, to $1.79. This price represents a 25.5% decline in relation to its ATH of $2.41, which it set last week. However, ASTER is also up by 1,700% over its lowest-recorded price (by CoinGecko) of $0.09971, underlining its credentials as one of the most exciting new alts in the market. It’s the native token of decentralized exchange Aster, which runs on BNB Chain and which already has a total value locked of $2.26 billion . Its fall today is arguably a necessary correction en route to longer-term gains, with its indicators moving in oversold positions that will eventually demand a rebound. Source: TradingView Also bullish is the fact that Aster’s price has been forming a pennant ever since reaching an all-time high earlier in September. As such, it’s getting very close to a big move, which its recent history of falls should mean will be a big rally. It could potentially reach $2 in the next few weeks, before climbing above $3 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Grayscale ETF Now Has ‘100% Chance of Approval’ ADA has fallen to $0.7878 today, marking a 4.5% drop in a week and a 9.5% decline in the past fortnight. Cardano is also down by 4.5% in the last 30 days, yet as with the other tokens in this article its falls mean that it’s now overdue a significant rebound. There are also fundamental reasons to expect ADA to do well very soon, with Grayscale still waiting on the potential approval of its ADA ETF. Bloomberg analysts have now given this and other altcoin ETFs a 100% chance of approval , and if it does go live, it will result in a big influx of money into ADA. Such an influx is also likely to boost the growth of Cardano’s ecosystem, which remains in the top 20 in terms of TVL . It continues to undergo development and expansion, yet institutional money could help it grow exponentially, in turn boosting the crypto price prediction for ADA. Source: TradingView The coin’s indicators remain in an oversold position, while also showing that the token could be very close to bottoming out. Its MACD has flattened out after falling into a negative position over the past few days, while it also seems the RSI has halted a recent decline. As such, we may be close to a big rally for ADA, which could rise above $1 before October is done, and then pass $3 in December. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Raises $1.5 Million in Presale: Could It 100x? Assuming that most altcoin ETFs do gain approval, the end of 2025 could bring a substantial bull market, pushing prices higher across the board. But it won’t be only major coins that benefit, with small-cap tokens having the potential to post exponential gains, given that they start from low bases. This is especially the case with presale coins, with one of the most interesting presale tokens right now being PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 crypto that recently opened its ICO. Your nodes are everything. Upgrade them, flex them, earn with them pic.twitter.com/LFohrFWmf7 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 26, 2025 It has already raised just over $1.5 million in this sale, with the project quickly winning over new investors and supporters. Its appeal lies in the fact that it’s the market’s first-ever ‘mine-to-earn’ token, enabling its holders to develop and earn from building their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy virtual mining nodes, users can earn greater rewards, which will be paid out in established coins such as Pepe and FARTCOIN. This mechanism means that PEPENODE could experience huge demand, while holders of the token can also stake it for a passive income. Investors can join PEPENODE’s sale by going to the project’s official website , where it currently costs $0.0010788. This price will rise later today and will continue to rise throughout the sale, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

At first glance, the move spooked market watchers. But beneath the surface, this sudden shift may be part of a much bigger play – one that could fast-track approvals and open the door to a wave of new crypto ETFs. And if that’s the case, SOL could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Who's ready for Cointober? Spot crypto ETF Deadlines start this week! Litecoin and Solana up first. Should be a wild month.. @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/K2m5pNBCbU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert from Bloomberg, emphasized that October could become ‘Cointober’ – a month when most of these pending applications will finally get the green light from the SEC. The agency has recently approved spot ETFs linked to top altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH). Thus far, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana have already gotten their first spot vehicles listed, while Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) could be next in line. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes Surge to $450 as Institutional Interest Grows Solana (SOL) has formed a similar structure to Ethereum (ETH) a few weeks ago, before it broke above the $4,000 resistance. In this case, the key level to watch is $270 . The token has been respecting its trend line support lately and could be about to make a strong move above this mark if positive momentum gains traction. The approval of new spot ETFs will likely draw more and more interest from institutional players. Paired with the launch of corporate treasuries, the stage could be set for SOL to reach a new all-time high like ETH did recently. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gains this cycle may come from early-stage presales like SUBBD ($SUBBD), which is already generating serious buzz. Investor demand has been strong, with over $1.2 million raised in a matter of weeks, signaling that this project could be one of the breakout stars of 2025. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Presale Merges AI + Web3 for Content Creation SUBBD ($SUBBD) aims to give creators a smarter, faster, and more flexible way to get their content out there. Instead of juggling multiple apps to produce AI-generated pieces, editing, and uploading, SUBBD puts everything into one platform. Creators can design videos with AI, polish them, and share them directly on its platform. At the core of this project is the $SUBBD token. The native asset of the SUBBD ecosystem, powering subscriptions, staking, and giving users access to exclusive purchases. Holding the token will also give them access early features, lower subscription fees, and direct input on how the platform evolves via decentralized voting. The presale offers a way to step in early while before the project explodes in popularity. With move than 2,500 creators already onboard, SUBBD could be the next project to make the headlines. To buy $SUBBD, head to the official SUBBD presale website and connect a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap crypto for this token or use a bank card to invest.

According to the announcement, Thumzup is supporting DogeHash Technologies in expanding its fleet of crypto miners by 500 ASIC mining rigs. This addition will bump DogeHash’s fleet to 4,000 crypto mining rigs by the end of this year. Thumbzup stock jump by 3.80% Thumzup Media’s stock, with the ticker TZUP, has jumped by 3.80% based on data from Yahoo Finance. The stock closed trading today at US$5.19 and has a year-to-date (YTD) return of 45.77%. TZUP began trading on the Nasdaq exchange after a successful public offering in October of last year. The Trump backed company raised US$8.2 million, pricing its shares at $5 at the time. The CEO of Thumzup, Robert Steele, said , “We are enthusiastic about all the recent developments in the Dogecoin ecosystem and are looking forward to working with DogeHash to build a premier Doge mining company together.” Earlier in September, Cryptopolitan reported that Thumzup Media had purchased about US $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC), and expressed intentions to expand its holdings in ETH, DOGE, XRP, SOL, LTC, and USDC. Thumzup also announced its plans to acquire DogeHash Technologies and operate its miners. On September 24, Thumzup approved a US$10 million stock buyback plan, which will run until the end of next year. The digital ads company announced a similar buyback plan before, but with a US$1 million budget. It has bought back 212,432 shares of its common stock at an average price of $4.71 per share. Currently, Thumzup holds 19.106 Bitcoins and around 7.5 million Dogecoin worth a total of ~ US$4 million. The digital ads company is authorized by its board to hold cryptocurrencies worth US$250 million. Dogecoin trades sideways Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at US$0.27. The memecoin has seen better days during the last bull run in 2021, thanks to Elon Musk’s push. At that time, DOGE, which was trading in cents, jumped to an all-time high of US$0.7316, almost touching the US$1 point . Elon Musk continues to endorse Dogecoin. He created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with the blessings of his buddy Donald Trump. However, this move did not propel Dogecoin to reach USD$1. At the time of writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) is down by 68.2% from its all-time high. The memecoin has a market cap of US$35.19 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of US$1.97 billion based on aggregated data from CoinGecko. This crypto market cycle is powered by institutional money and ETFs. Around fourteen days ago, Rex-Osprey announced the listing of the first US based Dogecoin ETF, with ticker symbol DOJE, on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Other Dogecoin ETF applications from Grayscale and Bitwise are still pending. Analysts believe that Dogecoin ETFs will propel the memecoin to new highs, but the truth is that markets are unpredictable.

The exchange, which followed Swift’s announcement at Sibos that it will launch a blockchain-based ledger, quickly crystallized two very different theories of “value capture” in crypto: a native asset securing and settling an L1 network versus a utility token powering oracle middleware. Weisberger set the stage with a direct challenge to the XRP community: “Can someone from the XRP army (@xrpmickle) explain how XRP is more than TEN times LINK’s value, when LINK has a REAL partnership with SWIFT, AND a clear path to revenue to be shared with Token holders…” The prompt referenced Chainlink’s post congratulating Swift on adopting “blockchains and oracle networks as a key next step,” and emphasizing that Chainlink and Swift “have collaborated across numerous initiatives” to connect financial institutions to blockchains using existing infrastructure and standards. Why Is XRP 10x More ‘Valuable’ Than LINK What followed was equal parts token-economics debate and culture clash. Weisberger, who later clarified “To be clear, I hold both,” added that he thinks “XRP bulls are delusional in their calls,” while conceding that such delusion does not preclude outperformance versus traditional assets. His framing invited two lines of reply: the “volume and adoption” argument and the “different problem, different TAM” argument. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Support as Institutions Accumulate and ETF Filing Sparks Debate On the data front, one respondent, @baggins_cc, asserted that “The XRP token has a $172B market cap, while LINK has $14B (1/10th). And when looking at the last 24h, by volume, XRPL has processed $4.9B in revenue, compared to LINK, which only has processed $641M. Marketcap is absolute when it comes to ranking, and Volume is empirical & objectively a fact, when it comes to real world adoption.” Weisberger pushed back with a counterexample intended to decouple throughput from token value: “What is the value of XRPL to XRP when TRX processes more than 500 TIMES USDT by value and is 1/5th the market cap?” The thrust: raw settlement or messaging volume does not automatically translate into superior price performance or capitalization for a token. The second, more structural line of response came from former Ripple engineer Matt Hamilton. In a succinct distinction, he wrote: “Trying to compare their value is sort of meaningless. Link is a protocol, the XRP Ledger is an actual network. XRP is the native asset of that entire network. Link is just the token used within the link protocol.” In other words, the two assets occupy different positions in the technology stack: XRP is the base-layer currency of an L1 that provides security, fee payment, and liquidity for its ledger; LINK is the work token for an oracle protocol that sits above execution layers to deliver data and cross-chain services. That stack-positioning argument was amplified by the XRP army member “Ripple Bull Winkle,” who reframed the comparison in terms of addressable markets: “Because XRP isn’t competing with LINK — it’s solving a different problem on a much larger scale. LINK = middleware for data feeds. XRP = bridge asset for global settlement. One secures oracles, the other settles value between banks, CBDCs, tokenized treasuries, & stablecoins. The TAM for cross-border payments dwarfs oracle revenue. And by the way — Ripple has been partnered with SWIFT participants for years. This isn’t XRP vs LINK, it’s XRP in the heart of the plumbing that moves the actual money. That’s why the market values it 10x higher.” Related Reading: Everyone’s Wrong About XRP: Here’s Why, Says Top Analyst Other replies took aim at investor narratives themselves. When a commenter criticized Weisberger’s “lazy ask,” he volleyed back with a reminder that many were “talked into XRP based on SWIFT, despite no clear token economics and no definitive use case,” nodding to years of marketing-driven expectations that official banking rails would one day require XRP. In the end, the thread does not “prove” why XRP is worth ten times LINK or vice versa; instead, it exposes a fundamental split in crypto investing frameworks. One camp prioritizes native-asset economics of base layers and their role as neutral settlement media; the other prioritizes revenue-bearing middleware whose services are indispensable to a tokenized financial system. As the Swift news resets expectations about how legacy rails will interface with blockchains, the core question for markets remains unchanged: which designs actually trap value, and how verifiably do those mechanics funnel real-world usage into persistent demand for the token itself? On that score, the debate is far from settled. At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

The analysis points to two possible short-term outcomes , yet both lead to the same bullish conclusion in the long run. Bullish Technical Analysis For XRP XRP has spent the past week moving around $2.80, with repeated tests of both higher levels at $2.88 and lower levels at $2.71 failing to deliver a decisive breakout. The most recent three-day candlestick chart shows how XRP has created three consecutive bearish candlestick while support has held close to $2.72. This period of consolidation comes after months of volatility that saw the token retrace back below $3 in September. Against this backdrop, a new technical analysis posted on the social media platform X shows two possible short-term scenarios for XRP, both of which point to the same long-term bullish outcome. The analyst noted that the altcoin closed just over $2.80 in the latest three-day candlestick session, and this coincided with the appearance of hidden bullish divergence on the chart’s relative strength index (RSI). This divergence is a signal of underlying strength in spite of the most recent price downtrend. According to the analyst, this setup is consistent with its behavior ever since it broke away from the $0.50 price zone. As it stands, the altcoin is now forming a structure that precedes a strong bullish move, although the next move depends on the weekly close. Two Possible Paths In The Short Term Looking at the candles and support zones drawn on the chart above, the analysis outlines two different bullish possibilities. The first is what the analyst calls an April 7th moment. On April 7th earlier this year, XRP experienced a sharp dip that saw it lose the stable $2 support level back then before finally settling at $1.79. This sharp dip brought the price down to retest its ascending support line before bouncing strongly higher in the weeks that followed. A similar move now would see the asset retreat toward the trend line. This time, the price target is around $2.40, which is highlighted with the pink circle in the chart above. This will effectively reset momentum before launching into the next leg of the rally. The second outcome, however, would play out without the need for that deeper correction. If the $2.72 support zone continues to hold, XRP could turn higher from its current price and begin reclaiming levels above $2.90 and $3.00 much sooner. This scenario would represent a more direct continuation of the bullish trend, with buyers stepping in aggressively to defend current support. Both outcomes differ in their immediate impact on price action, but each route ultimately leads to the same destination: higher levels for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.88.",XRP|relative strength index|ripple|RSI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-30 23:00:53

That expectation took a significant hit this week after SWIFT revealed plans to implement its own blockchain ledger, making it clear that the organization intends to modernize its infrastructure without relying on XRP. SWIFT Introduces a Blockchain-Based Ledger At its annual conference in Frankfurt, SWIFT announced the development of a blockchain-powered shared ledger designed to enhance cross-border payments. The initiative has gained backing from over 30 major global financial institutions, including JPMorgan, HSBC, Santander, and Deutsche Bank. The prototype, developed in collaboration with Consensys, will function as a continuous, real-time record of international transactions. By integrating smart contracts, the system aims to automate settlement rules and ensure consistent validation of payments across networks. The project also emphasizes interoperability, seeking to connect existing fiat payment systems with emerging digital asset ecosystems. SWIFT CEO Javier Pérez-Tasso described the effort as an important step toward providing financial institutions with a more efficient and future-ready payments infrastructure. Ripple’s Competing Vision Ripple has long positioned XRP and the XRP Ledger as faster and more cost-effective alternatives to SWIFT’s traditional messaging framework. The company’s executives have repeatedly argued that XRP could handle a significant share of global settlement activity. Earlier this year, Ripple’s Senior Vice President, Eric van Miltenburg, described the company’s technology as a ‘SWIFT-like update. Also, CEO Brad Garlinghouse projected that the XRP Ledger could capture a large portion of SWIFT’s market share within five years. This new announcement from SWIFT, however, makes such claims increasingly difficult to sustain. By building its own blockchain ledger, SWIFT clearly indicates its intentions to remain central to the global payments ecosystem while retaining control over its infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry and Community Response The development sparked strong reactions within the cryptocurrency community. Members of the Chainlink ecosystem, which already collaborates with SWIFT, highlighted the implications for XRP holders. Chainlink community representative Zach Rynes argued that the announcement undermines the narrative that XRP would serve as the primary settlement layer for banks and other institutions. Other commentators pointed out that XRP supporters have long believed large financial institutions would adopt external blockchains like XRPL. Critics argued that these expectations overlooked the possibility that established institutions would instead develop their own solutions or collaborate with others, thereby maintaining control over market infrastructure. SWIFT’s decision to pursue a blockchain-enabled ledger marks a key moment in the evolution of cross-border payments. Instead of using external networks like XRPL, global banks seem to be focusing on upgrading their current systems to make them compatible with digital assets. This development poses a significant challenge to XRP’s long-held narrative that it would replace or complement SWIFT.

Trump tapped Quintenz shortly after retaking office. Quintenz joined venture firm Andresseen Horowitz's global head of policy, and has been an adviser to firms like prediction marketplace Kalshi since leaving the CFTC following his term as commissioner. In a statement to CoinDesk, Quintenz said, ""Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I [am] looking forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country."" Politico and Punchbowl News earlier reported that the White House had withdrawn Quintenz's nomination. Quintenz has made statements in favor of the crypto industry since his first term as commissioner, including floating the idea of a self-regulatory organization for the industry similar to securities markets' Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Despite this, crypto exchange Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — both of whom support Trump — opposed his nomination in late July, with Tyler telling CoinDesk that he did not believe Quintenz's views on developers and his work with Kalshi qualified him for the role. However, Quintenz released messages he had exchanged with the Winklevoss brothers earlier this month, suggesting that they really opposed his nomination because he would not commit to a public view on a CFTC enforcement action against Gemini. In his messages, Quintenz said that it would be better for a ""fully confirmed chair"" to review the CFTC's actions. Crypto lobbyist organizations and companies wrote a public letter supporting his nomination in a late August bid to put his nomination back on track. Still, the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to postpone a vote on Quintenz's nomination a few times in July. Last week, Semafor reported that it had begun vetting new candidates to run the agency, which at present is helmed by Acting Chairman Caroline Pham. All of the other commissioners at the agency at the start of 2025 have since left, and Pham has indicated her intention to depart as well at some point, CoinDesk previously reported. The CFTC's potential lack of a permanent chair comes as Congress considers legislation that would give the agency a more prominent role in regulating crypto spot markets, though the legislative process is likely to be delayed by a pending government shutdown.

BWT Alpine, with its decades of Formula 1® excellence under the Renault Group, is synonymous with mechanical precision, team discipline, and global prestige. BlockDAG (BDAG) , on the other hand, is not content to follow precedent. It is rethinking how a Layer-1 blockchain should function, prioritizing real utility, transparency, and scale. As the BWT Alpine F1® team and BlockDAG unite under a multi-year global sponsorship, what unfolds is a chapter where heritage meets future. Buyers watching closely will recognize that among the best crypto coins of this era, BlockDAG isn’t just competing, it’s making history. BWT Alpine F1’s Legacy: From the Circuit to Cultural Icon The BWT Alpine F1® name carries weight far beyond the racetrack. As a cornerstone of Renault’s high-performance division, BWT Alpine F1® has spent decades perfecting the art of speed, resilience, and engineering mastery. Formula 1® isn’t just a sport; it’s a statement of national pride, global reach, and generational fandom. Through this lens, BWT Alpine F1 doesn’t just represent a team on the grid; it represents a legacy of excellence measured in tenths of seconds, years of strategy, and billions of broadcast impressions. When a brand like BWT Alpine F1 chooses to align with a Web3 platform, it’s not a casual endorsement. It is a calculated decision to partner with a blockchain brand that respects legacy while pushing boundaries. This makes BlockDAG’s entry into the Formula 1® world through BWT Alpine F1 not just strategic; it’s symbolic. For buyers evaluating the best crypto coins available before global deployment, BlockDAG is positioning itself not on trend, but within a timeline that stretches years into the future. BlockDAG’s Disruption: Real Adoption, Not Just Ambition While other crypto projects often center around speculative hype or theoretical whitepapers, BlockDAG has focused on real-world progress. With over 26.5 billion coins sold, nearly $415 million raised, and a current ROI of 2,900% since batch 1, it has built trust the old-fashioned way by delivering. Today, the presale sits at batch 30 with a listed price of $0.03, yet buyers can still lock in their position at $0.0013. This limited-time price lock signals a clear “before and after” moment, just ahead of BlockDAG’s deployment on Coinstore and its global event in Singapore. Beyond the numbers, the strategy is layered: 312,000+ holders, 3 million daily miners on the X1 app, and already 20,000 mining units are being shipped, with scaling set at 2,000 per week. This is no small feat. Most presales in crypto history have struggled to deliver on a single product or utility before listing. BlockDAG has done both, building software (X1 app) and hardware (X10/X30/X100 miner series) simultaneously. A Roadmap for Relevance The BWT Alpine F1® x BlockDAG partnership isn’t just about logos on race cars. It represents a roadmap built for relevance. The partnership will unfold across Alpine’s RISE+ app, global fan activations, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, and integrated Web3 engagement, including NFT drops, mining access, and co-branded merchandise. This is not a short-term alignment. It’s a multi-year sponsorship designed to grow with both platforms, culminating in a shared journey that connects one of the best crypto coins to one of the most historic names in motorsport. The value here is not in fleeting attention but in sustained brand co-evolution. While BWT Alpine F1® continues its pursuit of the podium, BlockDAG races toward becoming a household name in blockchain infrastructure. This alignment gives buyers and early adopters more than just speculative upside. It offers front-row access to a project tying its token utility and hardware infrastructure to a global entertainment engine watched by billions. That’s not marketing; that’s ecosystem integration at scale. Final Thoughts In every era, there are moments that become reference points. The collaboration between BWT Alpine and BlockDAG marks one of them. This is more than a sponsorship, it is a deliberate fusion of a timeless racing heritage with a blockchain project poised to reshape how utility, mining, and community engagement co-exist. As the locked price of $0.0013 edges closer to expiration, this is not just another buying opportunity. It is a historic inflection point. Among the best crypto coins in 2025, BlockDAG stands out not simply because of its technology, but because of the story it’s building. A story where speed, structure, and ambition meet on and off the track. And buyers have the chance to be written into it.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trader-losses-over-3-6m-heres-what-happened/,"Well-known crypto trader Qwatio has once again faced major losses after a leveraged short bet against XRP went against him. Data from Lookonchain shows that his cumulative losses on XRP and Bitcoin trades have now surpassed $3.6 million, following the most recent liquidation of part of his XRP position. Qwatio originally entered a short trade involving 6.17 million XRP, valued at around $17.6 million, with 20x leverage. His entry price was $2.8519, and the position was set to be liquidated if XRP reached $2.9155. He was essentially wagering on a decline in XRP’s price below his entry point. Instead, XRP climbed to $2.92 during the previous trading session, surpassing its liquidation threshold. This move partially closed his position at $2.9154, resulting in a realized loss of approximately $83,223. Remaining Exposure and Unrealized Losses Although part of his position was liquidated, Qwatio still holds a significant exposure of about 4.98 million XRP, worth $14.34 million at current prices. The open position has a liquidation level at $2.932 and is already showing an unrealized loss of roughly $145,000. If XRP approaches this liquidation price, the trader could face much larger losses. This setback is not an isolated event. Before this liquidation, Qwatio had already accumulated more than $3.4 million in losses from earlier short trades on XRP and Bitcoin. Adding the new $83,223 realized loss brings his total losses across these trades to over $3.6 million. XRP Price Action and Market Impact At the time of writing, XRP has retreated slightly from its recent peak of $2.92, trading near $2.82 . The token has declined 0.42% over the last 24 hours but remains modestly higher on a weekly and monthly basis, up 0.35% and 1.51%, respectively. Leveraged trading activity around XRP has been significant. In the past day alone, more than $7 million in positions have been liquidated. Of this amount, $5.3 million came from long traders, while $2.02 million came from shorts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Liquidation Scenarios Market data suggests that XRP approaching $2.93 , the same level tied to Qwatio’s liquidation threshold, could trigger an additional $41.39 million in short liquidations across the market. On the other hand, if the price retraces to $2.80, an estimated $86 million in long positions could be wiped out. Compared to the overall crypto market, XRP’s $7.2 million in daily liquidations represents a smaller share. Across the broader market, liquidations have totaled approximately $338 million in the past 24 hours, with $158.46 million from long positions and $179 million from shorts. Qwatio’s situation highlights the risks of highly leveraged trading in volatile assets such as XRP. With nearly $15 million still tied up in an active short and the token trading close to his liquidation point, the trader’s exposure remains significant. The broader market also shows elevated liquidation levels, underscoring the hazards faced by both long and short participants during periods of sharp price fluctuations.

Because of this, these holders can have some degree of influence in the market. As such, what they are doing on the network can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may reveal the sentiment among them. Usually, though, the anonymous nature of the blockchain means it can be hard to comment on the motive behind a particular transaction. In the case of the current Cardano whale transfer, however, one side of the move involves a wallet that’s already known. Below are the address details related to the transaction. As is visible, the sending address for this Cardano whale transaction was a wallet attached to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Meanwhile, the receiver was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was likely the investor’s self-custodial address. Transfers of this type, where coins flow out of the custody of a centralized exchange, are known as exchange outflows. Generally, investors make exchange outflows when they plan to hold their tokens in the long term, as self-custody tends to be a safer option for them. The latest large Coinbase withdrawal has come as Cardano is significantly down compared to its peak from earlier in September. As such, it’s possible that the move could be an indication of the whale betting on the asset at the current post-dip prices. It only remains to be seen whether the gamble will pay off for the investor. Related Reading: XRP Bounce Incoming? Analyst Targets $3–$3.15 After Support Holds Another altcoin, XRP, has also just witnessed a large transaction, as Whale Alert has pointed out in another X post. Unlike ADA’s transfer, however, this whale move has been an Exchange Inflow. In total, the XRP whale has shifted 18 million tokens of the cryptocurrency (worth around $51.4 million) to Coinbase with the transaction. Holders use exchanges for trading purposes, so it’s possible that the large investor may be looking to exit. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.79, down almost 4% over the last seven days.

52494931,593045,1759276832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52494931.jpeg,Bitcoin Core Vs Knots Is Old News — Satoshi Fought The Same War 15 Years Ago,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-core-vs-knots-satoshi-fought-the-same-war/,"A fresh round of sparring between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots over “arbitrary data” and policy defaults is ricocheting across X, but the argument’s bones are older than many remember. As Bitcoin developer Peter Todd put it on Sunday, “Good read. tl;dr: everything that has been said about Core vs Knots has already been said almost 15 years ago.” The 2010 Fight Over Bitcoin’s Soul That Never Ended The historical through-line runs straight back to December 2010, when Satoshi Nakamoto shipped Bitcoin version 0.3.18. That release quietly introduced an “IsStandard()” relay and mining policy to “only include known transaction types,” a defensive move designed to reduce attack surface from exotic scripts. Satoshi’s own release note summarized the change tersely: “IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks.” The first debate about arbitrary data in the blockchain happened in December 2010 and Satoshi was involved On 8th December 2010, Satoshi released Bitcoin version 0.3.18, which included a standardness check, to only include known transaction types pic.twitter.com/J95ax5Cgte — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) September 29, 2025 The check ignited what many participants described as Bitcoin’s first real governance dispute. Within hours, forum users split over whether restricting non-standard transactions would neuter legitimate experiments like BitDNS or simply protect the young network. The thread, preserved by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, captures the core fault lines that have resurfaced in 2025. On the permissive side, user “da2ce7” argued that fees would rationalize everything: “Transaction fees will pay for the generation of the chain in the future… if [others] want to include carefully crafted transactions… they must include the appropriate compensation.” Jeff Garzik fired back that such a stance “will disadvantage people who use bitcoins… as cash as intended,” because non-currency uses would bid up fees and crowd out payments. Theymos, then pushing for minimal relay restrictions, argued miners’ incentives would bulldoze any client-level gatekeeping: “all miners have an interest in including any and all fee-carrying transactions… The restriction on relaying these transactions should be removed, at the very least.” Garzik warned that if “data spam increases TX fees to annoying levels,” currency users would decamp—and that the presence of “law-enforcement-objectionable data” would raise different, sharper risks. Crucially, Satoshi and Gavin Andresen converged on the whitelist approach as a pragmatic security default, while leaving the door ajar for purpose-built data uses. Gavin explained that whitelisting known-safe templates was “the right thing to do,” drawing an analogy to web security’s failure modes when blacklisting is relied upon.In a follow-up, Satoshi wrote: “I came to agree with Gavin about whitelisting when I realized how quickly new transaction types can be added,” and endorsed a path for small data commitments: “I also support a third transaction type for timestamp hash sized arbitrary data.” If today’s back-and-forth feels like déjà vu, BitMEX Research’s weekend recap is the missing Rosetta stone. Their thread traces the debate’s timeline—RHorning’s early pushback against 0.3.18’s new standardness rules; Theymos’s insistence that miner incentives would trump relay defaults; Garzik’s resistance to “non-currency data” pricing out money use; and community unease about what happens when immutable ledgers meet illegal content. The researchers note that Theymos even released a patch client removing restrictions at the time, underscoring how client defaults and miner policy have always been a contested, malleable layer. There are two enduring takeaways from the 2010 record. First, the “policy vs protocol” distinction—what Bitcoin can do versus what the reference implementation should relay or mine by default—has long been a pressure valve for innovation and a magnet for controversy. Satoshi’s 0.3.18 email makes plain that IsStandard() lived in this gray zone of incentives and norms, not consensus rules. Second, nearly every argument now deployed in Core-versus-Knots skirmishes had an ancestor in that first “coming-of-age” fight: fee-market neutrality versus application-layer bloat; the right to pay for block space versus the social cost of permanent data; and whether tightening defaults protects Bitcoin’s monetary function or stifles its utility for timestamping and proofs. The archive shows the spectrum clearly, from Theymos’s “remove the restrictions” stance to Garzik’s warning that generalized data “has the distinct probability of degrading service for digital cash.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,071.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Core|Bitcoin Knots|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 00:00:32

Politico reported on Tuesday, citing two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement. “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life,” Quintenz said. “I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The development follows recent reports that the White House is considering additional candidates to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as the confirmation process for Brian Quintenz to lead the regulator had not made significant progress. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Quintenz has encountered a roadblock to his nomination due to political pressure and lobbying from high-profile crypto executives, led by the Winklevoss brothers. The withdrawal ends a remarkable series of developments for a nominee who was once considered all but certain to be confirmed. The former CFTC commissioner, with experience at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the prediction market startup Kalshi, had enjoyed strong backing from both the cryptocurrency sector and traditional finance. CFTC leadership race heats up as crypto policy stakes rise The CFTC plays a crucial role in regulating cryptocurrency markets . The Senate Agriculture Committee oversees nominations for the agency, including oversight of digital asset market developments. The agency, which is responsible for overseeing trillions of dollars in swaps trading, is poised to gain more influence over digital assets under legislation being considered in Congress. Quintenz’s nomination, announced at the beginning of the year, was initially praised by sections of the crypto industry as he already works actively in the industry, being the head of policy at a16z crypto . The agency, which was designed to be a five-person, bipartisan commission, has been reduced after a string of resignations to just the acting Chairman, Caroline Pham, a Republican whom former President Joe Biden appointed to the commission. The other top US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has had Paul Atkins as its permanent chairman since April. Crypto heavyweights and new contenders shake up CFTC chair race In a July call, crypto billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss urged President Donald Trump to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination to lead the influential Wall Street regulator overseeing the $4 trillion market. The brothers informed Trump that Quintenz was disconnected from the president’s agenda, Soon after the call, the White House asked the Senate Ag Committee to postpone a scheduled meeting where lawmakers would have likely advanced Quintenz’s nomination to a full-floor vote At the beginning of September, Quintenz took to social media to suggest that the president “might have been misled” by the twins. He posted screenshots of private messages he claimed to have exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss in late July, before his confirmation hearing was put on hold. An additional slate of potential candidates to lead the CFTC has emerged, with discussions intensifying in recent weeks. The possible contenders include government officials with a focus on crypto policy. Earlier reports indicate that Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force, is among the additional candidates discussed for CFTC chair. Initially, he was a partner in Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s asset management practice. Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital asset policy, is also considered a candidate for the role. He joined the Treasury from Galaxy Digital, a digital assets investment firm. Josh Sterling, a former CFTC official who is now a partner at the law firm Milbank, and former CFTC Commissioner Jill Sommers are also potential candidates to lead the CFTC.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the most impressive. At $0.035 currently, MUTM has already reached more than $16.55 million in presale and has had more than 16,660 holders, providing higher exposure to the market. Mutuum Finance offers a working DeFi platform with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, staking rewards flexibility, and a rapidly expanding global community. Unlike meme-based coins, Mutuum Finance offers actual financial utility, engaging retail and whale investors, and turning into an upside altcoin to track in 2025. Dogecoin Whale Sell-Off Sparks Market Buzz, What Investors Should Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the news over the last 24 hours following sales of more than 40 million tokens by whale wallets that are creating speculation over short-term price movements. Such large token sales do suggest market stress, but not all whale activity is bearish, analysts say, and some may be profit-taking or shifting into a different asset class as part of larger market trends. Historic trends would suggest DOGE bounces back after such corrections, but traders are keenly observing exchange inflows and trading volumes to take a cue on the next direction. While investors seek to decipher this heightened volatility in DOGE, several others are observing alternative cryptocurrencies with strong utility and growth prospects like upstart DeFi platforms with more stable financial opportunities. Mutuum Finance Records Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to make strong gains in Phase 6 of its presale, onboarded over 16,660 investors, and achieved a high of more than $16.55 million. Increasing entry is an indication of increasing faith in the long-term potential and vision of the project for the future of decentralized finance. In yet another example of its security and transparency culture, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Through the program, security engineers and developers can hunt for platform vulnerabilities in four severity levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The program is just one of the numerous steps Mutuum is taking to be even more secure in its infrastructure and to earn the trust of its increasing community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Maximum Efficiency At the center of the Mutuum Finance protocol is an algorithmic real-time floating interest rate system that is adjusted according to liquidity levels. During high liquidity, borrowing cost reduces, thereby promoting lending and incoming capital. During low liquidity, borrowing cost goes up to prompt new deposits and loan repayment. Self-balancing ensures natural equilibrium, which discourages over-leveraging risks and overall ecosystem health. Efficiency also results from collateral optimization, particularly where co-related assets are collateralized. Collateralized holdings carried in a proper manner enjoy higher borrowing ability with improved Loan-to-Value (LTV) terms, and reserve factors act as cushions when there is market uncertainty. Asset volatility is subject to increased reserve requirements to minimize uncertainty, but stable low-volatility assets can have higher borrowing with lower liquidation risk. LTV ratios and liquidation points are dynamically scaled to fit each of the tokens it lists’ distinctive volatility profiles, spreading risk evenly throughout the platform. With success in presale, sophisticated risk management technology, and unwavering dedication to transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a wholesome and viable network for long-term adoption, growth, and success in the DeFi network. Join the Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it to the list of the most viable utility-based altcoins of 2025, raising over $16.55 million from more than 16,660 investors and selling more than 50% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per coin. With the whales of Dogecoin causing market uncertainty by dumping 40 million tokens, investors are now on their way to making a shift towards projects with real-world utility and strong fundamentals. With its innovative DeFi lending platform, dynamic interest model, and security-focused ecosystem, MUTM is a top contender with high growth potential. Reserve your spot before presale expires.

Visa Direct Will Utilize Stablecoins For The First Time Payments giant Visa has announced a new pilot program for Visa Direct, the firm’s real-time global payments platform. According to the announcement, which occurred at Sibos 2025, businesses will be able to prefund cross-border payments with stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency. Until now, Visa Direct users could only prefund their international payments using fiat. Such transactions were slow, sometimes taking days, forcing businesses to park their capital in advance. With the use of stablecoins, however, settlement can occur in minutes. Chris Newkirk, President, Commercial & Money Movement Solutions at the company, said: Cross-border payments have been stuck in outdated systems for far too long. Visa Direct’s new stablecoins integration lays the groundwork for money to move instantly across the world, giving businesses more choice in how they pay. Pre-funding with these fiat-tied currencies works just like with fiat: Visa treats the tokens as “money in the bank.” Recipients, however, aren’t forced to get paid in stables; they can choose to receive in their local currency instead. With the new pilot, businesses will have the advantage of having better access to capital, as they won’t have to park it up in advance for as long as with the current fiat system. As for who can use the Visa Direct pilot right now, the payment card services company has noted that it’s only open to select partners that meet the criteria. The firm expects the pilot to move into limited availability by April 2026. Visa said in the press release: By combining the scale and trust of Visa’s global network with the programmability of blockchain and by partnering with leading payment providers on prefunding use cases, Visa is helping modernize cross-border payments for businesses, financial institutions and consumers worldwide. Visa isn’t the only financial institution that has made a move toward modernizing cross-border payments during Frankfurt’s Sibos 2025. Payments messaging platform SWIFT has also announced a shared ledger developed with 30+ major global banks based on the blockchain, the technology that powers digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins. Bitcoin Has Retraced Some Of Its Recovery Over The Past Day Bitcoin exceeded the $114,700 mark on Monday in what looked like the return of bullish momentum, but the rally seems to have already run out of steam as the cryptocurrency has returned to the $112,800 level. The chart below shows how the coin’s recent performance has looked: One warning sign that may have already been there could be the sharp surge in the Open Interest that accompanied the price surge, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn pointed out in an X post .

XRP, in particular, has been hit hard, falling below the $3 threshold and sparking concerns among investors. Despite the current downturn, market analyst Jay has issued an optimistic forecast, suggesting that XRP could still achieve double-digit prices within the ongoing cycle. Recent XRP Performance As of report time, XRP trades at approximately $2.82, a level that reflects its retreat from the $3 range and highlights broader market weakness. Jay maintains that XRP has the potential to stage a strong recovery, with the possibility of reaching $10 before the current market cycle concludes in December 2025. Achieving this target would require an increase of around 256% from present levels, raising XRP’s market capitalization to an estimated $598 billion. His projection mirrors the outlook of Jake Claver , CEO of Digital Ascension Group, who also expects XRP to reach new all-time highs before the cycle ends. Tops this cycle: * Bitcoin – $4690k * Ethereum – $25k * Solana – $1000 * Hyperliquid – $300 * XRP – $10 Thoughts? — jay (@0xjaypeg) August 14, 2025 Predictions for Other Major Assets Alongside his XRP forecast, Jay outlined ambitious targets for several leading cryptocurrencies. His estimates include a peak of $469,000 for Bitcoin, $25,000 for Ethereum, $1,000 for Solana, and $300 for Hyperliquid. These price levels represent potential gains of 328% for BTC, 528% for ETH, 395% for SOL, and 570% for HYPE. Compared to these figures, XRP’s projected 256% increase appears less aggressive, though still significant in scale. Possible Catalysts for XRP’s Growth Although Jay did not provide specific reasons behind his projections, several recent developments may support optimism for XRP. Foremost among them is the anticipation of additional spot-backed XRP exchange-traded funds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved the first spot XRP ETF, and market observers expect other proposals to be approved in the near future. Such investment products could attract substantial institutional inflows, boosting liquidity and demand for XRP. Institutional interest is already beginning to surface. Trident Digital Tech Holdings recently allocated $500 million toward establishing an XRP-based treasury, signaling growing corporate confidence in the asset. Retail participation is also increasing, particularly as decentralized finance platforms such as Axelar , Flare Network, and Uphold launch programs that allow XRP holders to earn yields of up to 10% annually. These initiatives enhance XRP’s utility and create new avenues for adoption. While XRP’s price remains under pressure in the short term, long-term forecasts such as Jay’s suggest that a sharp recovery could be possible if broader market conditions improve. A climb to $10 would represent a significant milestone for the asset, though it depends heavily on institutional adoption, ETF-driven demand, and integration into the DeFi ecosystem. The ambitious projections for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Hyperliquid further highlight expectations for the cycle, but whether XRP can match its bold $10 target remains uncertain.

These fundamentals, combined with institutional filings and improved macro narratives for regulated crypto products, keep HBAR on watch lists despite short-term volatility. Price Action: HBAR Key Levels Into “Uptober” Technically, HBAR’s structure shows a recovery from a two-month low near $0.21, with the price still coiling inside a descending wedge, a setup that often precedes upside moves when broader sentiment turns positive. Immediate support lies between $0.212 and $0.205; losing that range could lead to a slide toward $0.198. On the upside, $0.226–$0.230 remains the first barrier; a clear break above could target $0.235 and the mid-September highs near $0.245, with $0.285 as the October stretch level if buying momentum accelerates. HBAR's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Momentum indicators are mixed but stabilizing. RSI has rebounded from oversold (28) into the mid-40s, while Chaikin Money Flow trends higher, suggesting net inflows. The near-term warns of a narrowing golden cross between the 50- and 200-day EMAs that could turn into a death cross if bulls fail to defend the support levels. For swing traders, the strategy is simple: respect downside risk below $0.205, but look for confirmation above $0.230 to push toward $0.245–$0.285. Enterprise Adoption Gains Momentum, With Risks HBAR’s story is supported by enterprise integrations (payments, identity, and tokenization) and consistently very low fees (<$0.0001), making it appealing for high-frequency settlement. On-chain, active addresses and staking participation have increased, and sentiment is bullish going into Q4, driven by ETF hopes and public-sector pilots.

With its name now plastered across Grand Prix tracks, F1 simulators, and global media coverage, BlockDAG is positioning itself beyond code, into real-world credibility. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), despite holding firm near the $0.80 support line and making headlines through Grayscale’s multi-asset ETF, is struggling to convert technical merit into mainstream momentum. For those assessing what crypto to invest in this quarter, the contrast is becoming harder to ignore. BlockDAG’s Real-World Presence: More Than Just Tech With over 26.5 billion coins sold and a presale that continues to accelerate through batch 30 at a current price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is stepping into a league of its own. The partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team is not just a sponsorship; it is a calculated move to connect blockchain engineering with a global stage that values speed, precision, and consistency. The BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team deal was unveiled at Raffles Hotel in Singapore, setting the tone for BlockDAG’s expansion through fan engagement zones, driver appearances, simulators, and hackathons. Traction in crypto means more than GitHub commits or TPS benchmarks. It’s about showing up where attention already lives: sports arenas, digital media, developer showcases, and institutional boardrooms. BlockDAG’s technology is built on a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, designed to deliver higher throughput and near-instant finality. But now, it is doing the harder part, making people care. The F1® partnership achieves that by placing the BlockDAG brand where audiences are already emotionally invested, thus building trust and recognition beyond whitepapers or tech claims. Cardano’s Slower Climb: Institutional Nod, Retail Hesitation Cardano (ADA), often hailed for its academic rigour and peer-reviewed development model, is currently trading around the $0.80 range . Analysts from crypto.news suggests it may bounce toward $1.14 if bullish conditions take hold. This optimism is partly driven by Cardano’s inclusion in Grayscale’s multi-asset ETF, which lends it institutional validation. However, visibility in institutional funds doesn’t always translate to retail conviction or cultural relevance. ADA’s roadmap remains robust, with updates on smart contract scalability, interoperability, and governance. But the project continues to struggle with engagement outside the crypto-native crowd. Cardano lacks the type of narrative activation BlockDAG has recently achieved, something that could become a critical differentiator in the Layer 1 wars of 2025. As users ask what crypto to invest in, projects that can command both technical and emotional loyalty may win out. BlockDAG, through its traction playbook, is building both. Traction as a Growth Multiplier The importance of traction is often underestimated in crypto. Many Layer 1 projects assume the merits of their consensus algorithms or TPS benchmarks will eventually be recognised. But BlockDAG’s recent moves show otherwise. Traction requires exposure, activation, and repeat touchpoints. The presence at Grand Prix events, simulators that connect fans directly with the protocol’s branding, and developer integrations via hackathons turn BlockDAG into a living brand, not just a whitepaper. This traction also helps with partner onboarding. As media coverage of the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team partnership expands, institutional players who may not yet understand DAG-based consensus will still recognise the significance of a blockchain project being affiliated with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® team. In turn, developers who once saw the Layer 1 space as saturated may start building on BlockDAG simply because it’s visible, accessible, and socially validated. This is why traction matters, and why it can be a tipping point toward top-tier Layer 1 status. Cardano’s Stiff Challenge To be clear, Cardano isn’t faltering; it’s holding ground. But the pace of growth feels slower. The recent price support is fragile, and ADA continues to be a coin that’s held rather than used. Unlike BlockDAG, which is integrating interactive fan and developer experiences into its rollout, Cardano’s ecosystem remains somewhat abstract to the average user. The contrast between institutional relevance and cultural relevance becomes stark when you consider where each project is being talked about. As buyers and traders search for what crypto to invest in, this gap may become decisive. Even with smart contract upgrades, Cardano must still translate its capabilities into mainstream relevance, something BlockDAG is rapidly achieving through its sports partnerships and on-ground events. Why BlockDAG’s Model Could Shift Layer 1 Rankings What sets BlockDAG apart isn’t just its technology stack. It’s the ability to convert that stack into traction, and traction into adoption. With nearly $415 million raised, over 26.5 billion coins sold, and a massive ROI since batch 1 (now at $0.0013), BlockDAG is not operating on hype but on a clear business strategy: connect brand, community, and technology through real-world channels. And it’s working. The protocol is appearing where people aren’t expecting a blockchain, Formula 1® simulators, BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team fan activations, digital track overlays, and developer summits. This signals that BlockDAG is not simply trying to disrupt crypto spaces but to expand into sectors like sports tech, digital entertainment, and enterprise tools. The high-profile BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team deal is the launchpad for that vision. Final Thoughts For those seriously evaluating what crypto to invest in, the data points toward a shift. It is no longer enough to have a strong protocol. What matters is traction, being seen, understood, and engaged with. Cardano (ADA) may continue to hold value through ETF inclusion and price rebounds, but its lack of cultural and mainstream momentum could limit its upside. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing how to scale visibility into adoption. The BWT Alpine Formula 1® team partnership gives it credibility on a global stage and serves as a signal to developers, investors, and partners that this Layer 1 is not just technically sound; it is socially validated. With momentum from both fundraising and real-world activations, BlockDAG offers more than a speculative token. It offers presence, growth, and trust, three things that define what crypto to invest in going forward.

XRP ETF approval in October could unlock large institutional inflows and lift price quickly. Market analysts and probability markets assign a high chance to approvals, creating bullish sentiment. Sistine Research and other forecasters project target ranges of $37–$50 for XRP if ETFs attract major institutional capital (estimates vary). Meta description: XRP ETF approval drives market optimism — front-loaded with primary keyword. Read the latest analysis and prepare for potential institutional inflows. XRP’s price could surge if the SEC approves multiple ETF filings in October, driven by institutional interest and Ripple’s legal victory. XRP’s recent price consolidation is expected to end with an SEC decision on spot XRP ETFs, potentially driving a significant price surge. Experts predict a 95% chance of ETF approval, which could pave the way for institutional adoption and a historic rally in XRP’s price. Sistine Research forecasts XRP could reach $37 to $50 following ETF approvals, marking a potential 10x increase from its current price. XRP’s three-month consolidation phase may soon be over, as all eyes are on the SEC’s upcoming decision on spot XRP ETFs in October. After reaching a record high of $3.66 in July, the cryptocurrency has been in a holding pattern, with the market waiting for a fresh catalyst. The looming XRP ETF approval decision could be the catalyst that reignites momentum and attracts institutional capital. What is the likely market impact of an XRP ETF approval? XRP ETF approval is likely to increase liquidity and broaden investor access, encouraging institutional participation. If the SEC approves multiple spot XRP ETFs, market makers and asset managers would channel significant capital into XRP, potentially driving rapid price appreciation and narrower bid-ask spreads. How confident are analysts about ETF approval? Industry commentators and ETF analysts have expressed high confidence in approvals. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have publicly cited strong odds, while PolyMarket pricing reflects elevated probabilities. These market-implied signals are driving optimistic positioning among institutional and retail traders. Why does Ripple’s legal victory matter for ETF chances? Ripple’s court outcomes removed regulatory ambiguity that previously hindered institutional adoption. That legal clarity is a core rationale cited by analysts when assessing spot XRP ETF prospects. With litigation risk reduced, asset managers face fewer legal hurdles to offering XRP exposure to clients. What price targets are being discussed if ETFs are approved? Forecasts vary: some research groups present conservative upside while others — such as Sistine Research — outline aggressive scenarios with range targets between $37 and $50. These estimates assume sizable institutional inflows and a multiple expansion from present valuations. Comparative price scenarios for XRP after ETF approval Scenario Assumptions Price range Moderate inflows Selective asset manager adoption $5–$15 Broad institutional adoption Multiple spot ETFs + market makers $20–$37 Full institutional wave Large capital inflows, ETF-led retail pickup $37–$50 How should investors prepare for a potential ETF decision? Investors should assess risk tolerance, position sizing, and liquidity needs before reacting to regulatory outcomes. Consider staged exposure and set stop-loss or profit-taking rules to manage volatility around the SEC decision window. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to prepare for a potential XRP ETF approval"", ""description"": ""Actionable steps to manage portfolio exposure ahead of an SEC decision on spot XRP ETFs."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/xrp-etf.jpg"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess your risk tolerance"", ""text"": ""Review your portfolio allocation and determine the percentage you can allocate to high-volatility crypto assets."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Set entry and exit rules"", ""text"": ""Define buy ranges, stop-loss levels, and profit targets to manage downside while participating in upside moves."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor regulatory updates"", ""text"": ""Follow official SEC notices and reputable market commentary to respond promptly to rulings and statements."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""XRP ETF Approval Could Trigger Institutional Inflows and Price Surge"", ""description"": ""XRP ETF approval drives market optimism and could attract institutional capital, with some forecasts projecting significant upside."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-etf-approval-analysis"" }, ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/xrp-etf.jpg""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will SEC approval of spot XRP ETFs cause an immediate price spike?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""An SEC approval is likely to trigger increased liquidity and institutional flows, which often cause rapid price appreciation; the magnitude depends on asset manager participation and capital inflows."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How likely is approval of multiple spot XRP ETFs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Market analysts and probability markets have placed high odds on approval, citing Ripple’s legal clarity as a key factor, but final decisions rest with the SEC."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What price targets are analysts giving for XRP after ETF approval?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Estimates vary: conservative scenarios range from $5–$20, while some research groups cite potential ranges of $37–$50 under strong institutional inflows."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions What happens to XRP’s liquidity if ETFs are approved? ETF approval typically increases liquidity as institutional investors and market makers provide volume. For XRP, that would mean tighter spreads and higher daily traded volumes, improving execution for large orders. How quickly could price reactions occur after approval? Price reactions can be immediate—within hours—or unfold over weeks as assets are allocated to ETFs. The speed depends on the number of approved funds and their initial capital commitments. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity matters : Ripple’s legal outcomes underpin the improved ETF approval odds. Institutional demand is the catalyst : Spot XRP ETFs would create a regulated channel for large capital inflows. Risk management is essential : Prepare for volatility with position sizing, entry/exit rules, and monitoring of official SEC announcements. Conclusion With strong market signals and legal clarity behind Ripple, XRP ETF approval in October could be the next major catalyst for price discovery. Investors should weigh potential upside against volatility and plan positions accordingly.
