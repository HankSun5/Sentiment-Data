Poland’s New Crypto Law Faces Pushback,https://bitcoinist.com/too-tough-polands-new-crypto-law-faces-pushback/,"Poland’s lower house has approved a wide-ranging crypto bill that would put the country’s entire virtual asset market under stricter state control. Based on reports, the measure — known as Bill 1424 — passed the lower house of Poland’s national parliament, or Sejm , with 230 votes in favor and 196 opposed. The law would give the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, KNF, sweeping powers over exchanges, issuers and custodians operating in or serving customers in Poland. What The Law Requires According to coverage, the draft compels all Crypto Asset Service Providers to obtain a KNF license to operate in the market. It would set detailed rules on capital, internal controls, anti-money-laundering safeguards and risk management. Penalties are heavy: operating without a permit could draw fines up to 10 million złoty (about US$2.8 million) and, in some versions, criminal liability including up to two years in prison for serious breaches. Existing firms would get a six-month window to apply for authorization once the law takes effect. Sejm głosami ekspertów takich jak pani Skowrońska przyjął ustawę o zniszczeniu blackchaina i stabletcoinów w Polsce. Teraz senat, potem konieczne weto @NawrockiKn i można składać projekt ustawy rozwijający a nie zwijający rynek krypto aktywów w Polsce. pic.twitter.com/LgeSdNB4aD — Tomasz Mentzen (@TomaszMentzen) September 26, 2025 Supporters Say It Brings Clarity Backers argue the move will align Poland with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets rules and give clearer rules to investors and businesses. Clarity is meant to reduce scams and make large players feel safer about doing business in Poland. Some observers say stronger oversight could attract institutional money that has been wary of unclear local rules. Concerns From Industry And Lawmakers But many in Poland’s crypto community warn the bill goes further than EU minimums and could burden smaller players. Reports point to concerns about high costs and heavy paperwork that might push startups to move operations abroad. There is also worry the KNF’s review process could be slow; some sources claim decisions might take as long as 30 months, creating an uncertain climate for firms that need speed to survive. Artists, small issuers and hobbyist projects fear that strict rules will squeeze out low-budget activity. Transparency And Blocking Powers The draft would also require more disclosures from issuers and service providers. Regulators could maintain a register of unpermitted domains and use tools to block access. Supporters say this helps fight fraud. Critics say it risks overreach and could limit legitimate users’ access to services. Based on reports, after clearing the Sejm the text is moving to the Senate for review. President Karol Nawrocki has been reported to consider a veto unless certain provisions are softened, particularly those that introduce criminal penalties and broad supervisory powers. Lawmakers and industry groups are pressing for amendments that would narrow the scope of some requirements and ease costs for smaller operators.

The announcement marks a major milestone, as $MET is expected to serve as a governance and utility token, enabling voting on protocol decisions, staking for rewards, fee discounts, and participation in liquidity incentives. $MET 23.10.2025 The ignition point of our manifesto has arrived.

See you then. pic.twitter.com/xEjFn2bnX8 — Meteora (@MeteoraAG) September 30, 2025 When is the upcoming TGE for the $MET token? The vibes in the Solana ecosystem got a shot in the arm earlier today after Meteora’s announcement about its upcoming airdrop, which will target users who farmed points in Seasons 1 and 2 via liquidity provision and trading on the platform. The announcement post included a date — 23.10.2025 — presumed to be the exact day the TGE will happen. “The ignition point of our manifesto has arrived,” the post caption read. “We’re onboarding the next wave of the LP Army and powering token launches. $MET will fuel opportunity, innovation, and community. See you then.” Several days before the announcement on September 10, Meteora shared a five-part update that outlined the road to launch. It revealed how aggressively the team has been building in the background, which has led to the release of DBC and DAMM V2, which have been powering major launchpads like Believe, Bags, and DAOs.fun. The airdrop allocation is to be determined by a points allocation that the community has been accumulating over the past year. At the time that the team shared the update, it revealed its infrastructure is being scaled by up to 10x to handle user demand. As for the claim process, Meteora said in its September 10 post that users will be able to claim $MET (and potentially future airdrops) seamlessly via the Meteora interface. It has even been confirmed that eligible participants will enjoy a few of such drops prior to the official mMeteora token launch, so there is even more to look forward to in the coming days. The team has also outlined “Met-ober” updates, including TGE goals, Jupiter staker integrations (with extra rewards), and launch pool strategies to power new token launches on the platform. Other DeFi airdrops to watch out for The $MET TGE and airdrop is only one of the DeFi-focused drops slated to drop in the fourth quarter of this year. Other similar projects that Degens are staking include the Abstract Chain, Pump.fun, Kamino Finance, Solayer, LayerZero, Backpack and Hyperliquid, to name a few. Among these projects, some like LayerZero, Hyperliquid , and Kamino Finance, have already launched previous airdrop campaigns and are just rewarding users for another season of engagement. However, the likes of Solayer, Abstract Chain, Pump.fun, and Backpack are airdropping tokens to eligible users for the first time. All the projects listed above are expected to airdrop this Q4, except for Backpack, which reportedly has plans to launch in the first quarter of 2026. Between the $MET token and the remaining drops for the year, observers claim up to $500M+ could get injected into the crypto industry.

This is coming at a time when criticisms of him and his company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy have gone up a few decibels. In a recent conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Saylor compared Bitcoin to historic breakthroughs such as fire, electricity, and oil, calling it property, capital and energy in cyberspace. Saylor’s trillion-dollar Bitcoin endgame Saylor envisions Strategy building its Bitcoin treasury to $1 trillion and moving far beyond that. Strategy has already become the most prominent corporate Bitcoin holder since it pivoted in 2020 from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. Strategy now holds 640,031 BTC , purchased through a mix of cash reserves, convertible debt, and repeated equity issuance. It announced the acquisition of 196 Bitcoins for $22.1 million when the token dipped below $110,000, as Cryptopolitan reported on Monday. Saylor insists the model is only beginning to take hold. He notes that while only a handful of listed firms held Bitcoin in 2020 when Strategy went all in on the cryptocurrency, more than 180 do today. He predicts this will grow to thousands as companies shift their balance sheets toward digital assets. Saylor also believes that tech giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft will eventually embed Bitcoin into their operating systems and hardware. For Saylor, the stakes go beyond corporate profits. He frames Bitcoin as a foundation of economic integrity, decentralization, and energy efficiency, a financial system that can transfer value across time and space. Skeptics question the model Critics, however, remain unconvinced. There is also a very vocal group speaking about the “impending doom” that awaits Saylor’s Strategy and the people and institutions who have invested in them. In June this year, veteran short-seller Jim Chanos described parts of Saylor’s valuation logic as “ financial gibberish ,” questioning why Strategy trades at a premium to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Peter Schiff, chief economist and strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, also shared similar sentiments in an X post last week, calling Saylor’s business strategy “harebrained” and pointing out that Strategy (MSTR) has been “down 45%” since its November 2024 high. A recent report showed that Strategy’s stock, which for years traded well above the net asset value of its Bitcoin stash, has lost some of its luster. Saylor has brushed off the trend, saying he is unbothered. Analysts warn of dilution risk, since Strategy funds purchases largely by issuing stock or convertible notes. While the strategy boosts the Bitcoin treasury, it also leaves common shareholders with a smaller slice of the company. Saylor’s struggle to defend his vision is perennial Saylor dismisses such concerns, likening criticism of Bitcoin to historic resistance against electricity or nuclear power. Each new price milestone, he argues, brings a new wave of skeptics, yet adoption continues to expand. He also rejects the notion that corporate buying crowds out retail investors, pointing to the estimated $1.8 trillion in gains enjoyed by individuals since companies such as Strategy and BlackRock entered the market. The scale of his ambition, however, raises questions of feasibility. To reach a trillion-dollar Bitcoin reserve at current prices, Strategy would need to hold around 9 million BTC, close to half of the total supply that will ever exist. Even if Bitcoin rises sharply, the capital required would dwarf the company’s present means. However, the symbolic power of Saylor’s claim may be as important as its literal execution. In his telling, Bitcoin offers not just a speculative hedge but a chance to power a global system of trust. According to him, Strategy’s model will be remembered as a paradigm shift in corporate treasury management.

This makes it the first bank in Qatar to extend its network into blockchain for real-time USD settlements, eliminating the multi-day delays common in traditional systems. JPMorgan’s Expanding Network A Bloomberg report shows that the Kinexys system allows corporate clients to execute transactions in minutes, even on weekends or outside business hours. Kamel Moris, QNB’s Executive Vice President for Global Transaction Banking, described this as “a treasurer’s dream,” noting that transaction timeframes can be reduced to just two minutes, a major advantage for companies operating with tight liquidity. It also eliminates many of the inefficiencies in conventional payment networks by directly programming deposit accounts onto blockchain rails. These rails reportedly process $3 billion in daily payments across connected banks, making it easier for treasury teams to automate liquidity flows. JPMorgan has been steadily scaling Kinexys across the Middle East. The platform builds on the bank’s earlier blockchain initiatives, including the Onyx division and projects tied to Quorum, its enterprise blockchain. For the financial institution, QNB’s entry adds to a growing list of regional adopters. Companies such as Emirates NBD and Saudi National Bank have already joined the network, showing how Gulf lenders are prioritizing speed, transparency, and always-on settlement options. What This Means for the Banking Industry Studies show that local corporate payments depend on correspondent banks, with the structure causing delays due to time zone variance, business-hour restrictions, and other manual checks. Kinexys, on the other hand, allows payments to move directly on blockchain rails, which bypasses these traditional frictions. Large financial institutions worldwide are accelerating their use of distributed ledger technology, viewing it as a tool to simplify complex back-office processes. While banks have tested these systems for over a decade, few have been able to scale or achieve commercial viability. Earlier this year, Reuters also announced a partnership between India’s Axis Bank and JPMorgan to extend Axis clients’ access to 24/7 dollar transfers. This collaboration allowed the firm to streamline its liquidity management and unlocked advanced treasury capabilities such as multi-bank cash concentration. The technology provides more than just speed, offering lower costs and greater transparency. Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys, said in an interview that opening the network to such firms allows it to reach companies that are not direct clients of the bank. “This is institutional-grade scale,” he said.

The SEC's Division of Investment Management issued a so-called no-action letter on Tuesday , a document that assures that the regulator doesn't intend to pursue any enforcement actions by those engaging in the specific activity — in this case, that SEC-registered advisers and funds can park digital assets in state trusts. Such qualified-custodian questions had represented a policy battleground during the tenure of former SEC chairs Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, the former having led the agency to introduce a later-abandoned proposal that would have constrained what kinds of companies could handle the crypto of regulated investment advisers. Gensler made it clear he specifically meant to muscle out exchanges such as Coinbase. But the SEC's new management — most notably Chairman Paul Atkins — is pursuing a crypto-forward campaign, with Atkins saying earlier this week that establishing industry policies is the agency's top priority (as assigned by pro-crypto President Donald Trump). While Tuesday's no-action letter isn't a formal agency rule, it carries enough weight to free firms from short-term compliance worries. Specifically, the document said the SEC ""would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under the custody provisions against a registered adviser or regulated fund for treating a state trust company as a 'bank' with respect to the placement and maintenance of crypto assets."" The earlier argument from Gensler was that crypto firms weren't safe and sufficiently regulated to qualify as risk-free enough for registered investment advisers to keep their customers' assets. ""Even though it was never adopted, the proposal has created problems for investment advisers through its assertion that most crypto assets are likely to be funds or crypto asset securities covered by the current rule, and thus must be maintained with a qualified custodian,"" Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech in Singapore on Tuesday. She argued that the agency ""should consider updating the rules governing permissible custodians for registered investment advisers and investment companies,"" adding that maybe technologically adept companies should be permitted to custody assets themselves. But Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who was allied with Gensler on this point two years ago, issued a statement opposing the no-action treatment , saying the SEC is effectively treating crypto as something apart from the rest of the financial sector. And it's ignoring the efforts of firms pursuing federal chartering from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ""Rather than create a level playing field, we leave investors and the markets to gamble in an unnecessary game of 50-state regulatory roulette – just to accommodate crypto,"" she said. ""Executing a shift of this magnitude via no-action relief without public comment and without any economic analysis is ill-advised for many reasons, not least of which because it likely violates the Administrative Procedure Act, though this has become commonplace by this commission."" The SEC has been pursuing a number of crypto policies under Atkin's recent Project Crypto, and the chairman has set an agenda to issue formal crypto rules in the coming months. Meanwhile, Congress has made extensive progress on legislation to more completely regulate the U.S. digital assets markets.",Policy|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Hester Peirce|Paul Atkins|Regulations|Custody|Trusts|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-30 22:18:16

Bitcoin still trades roughly 10% below its record high (ATH) of $124,128 reached last month. Meanwhile, its market share is slipping, as enthusiasm shifts toward top-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have posted ATHs in the past year. The spark for this resurgence can be traced to two pivotal policy moves in Washington. First, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. framework specifically regulating stablecoins. Shortly after, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a modernization effort to adapt securities laws to the digital asset era. With confidence rebounding, the spotlight is on XRP, Solana, and Pepe as prime candidates for dip-buying ahead of what could be the next bullish cycle. Ripple ($XRP): The Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse and 2025’s Leading Altcoin Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) jumped to an all-time peak of $3.65 on July 18, coinciding with the passage of the GENIUS Act and eclipsing its previous 2018 record of $3.40. It has since eased back to around $2.85, roughly 22% off that high. XRP’s strength lies in its role as a low-cost, high-speed solution for global money transfers, positioning it as a modern challenger to systems like SWIFT. Its credibility has been bolstered by recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund and growing acceptance in the U.S. financial sector. Ripple’s regulatory influence was highlighted earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse took part in a White House crypto policy discussion. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, underscores its ambition to secure a piece of the fast-expanding stablecoin market. Momentum also picked up after a landmark 2023 ruling confirmed that XRP’s retail sales were not securities, a turning point in its long-running legal fight with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has rocketed 346%, leaving Bitcoin trailing with a still notable 77.5% gain over the same period. After rallying in July, it found support near $3 before a seasonal dip in September drove prices lower. Currently, XRP’s RSI sits near 45 and uptrending, hinting at the potential for more near-term price growth. Although rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF failed to trigger a breakout, likely due to being priced in, the appearance of three bullish flag patterns on its price chart, along with a swathe of pending ETF decisions due in mid-October, could quickly drive XRP above $6 or higher. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Rival and This Month’s Standout Large-Cap Performer Solana ($SOL) continues to prove itself as one of the fastest and cheapest blockchain platforms. Its market cap now exceeds $112 billion, with over $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama, showcasing its strength in decentralized finance. Excitement is growing around the possibility of Solana spot ETFs gaining approval in the U.S. next month, potentially unlocking institutional capital, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs did. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has surged back to $207. Chart watchers saw cup-and-handle formations throughout August and early September, reflecting recent bullish sentiment. Its 6% decline over the past week looks more like a healthy pullback than a cause for concern. With regulators moving to shape clearer rules for digital assets, Solana could stand to benefit significantly. It maintains a cool RSI at 45, signaling that the correction has given investors a solid entry point. Key support is around $150, with very sticky resistance near $250, although breaching it could provide bulls with the impetus for a breakout. A retest of its ATH of $293.31, or even a climb up to $400, appears well within reach before the end of 2025. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Phenomenon Still Packed With Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly became one of the top meme tokens by market cap, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s iconic frog character. Its rapid rise triggered a flood of copycats, though none matched its success. With a valuation near $4 billion, Pepe has captured global attention; Elon Musk even used its logo as his profile picture on X briefly. Currently priced at about $0.000009192, PEPE is down 67% from its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, as broader macroeconomic concerns weigh on crypto market sentiment. Still, October has historically been a strong month for crypto, and if the “Uptober” pattern holds, Pepe could be testing new highs as early as November, potentially even granting 3.5x gains by 2026. At present, its RSI sits at 38 and continues trending lower, suggesting further short-term declines before the weekend may open attractive entry points. Backers argue that a more favorable macro climate and growing optimism could propel PEPE into uncharted territory later this year. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): How a Bitcoin Layer 2 Became One of the Best Crypto Presales This Year Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the most promising presales heading into 2025, aiming to merge Bitcoin’s security with Layer-2 scalability while riding the momentum of meme culture and community governance. The project’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s functionality with faster payments, smart contract capabilities, and decentralized decision-making. To date, its presale has raised more than $19.3 million, with analysts forecasting potential gains of 10× or more after launch. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers ultra-low-cost smart contracts and supports a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers, as well as dApps, meme tokens, and payments. A recent audit by Coinsult reported no vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token powers the ecosystem via staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early investors can currently earn staking rewards of up to 61% APY while gaining voting privileges once governance goes live.

The $2 trillion market leader Bitcoin is just 9% down from its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 and is likely to set a new high watermark through the historically strong month of “Uptober”. US Policymakers are also accelerating a potential bull run. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first nationwide U.S. legislation focused on stablecoins, mandating full reserve requirements. Shortly after, the SEC announced Project Crypto , a framework aimed at modernizing securities laws to better fit the digital asset era. With stronger regulatory oversight, the next altcoin rally will eclipse the 2021 boom, fueled by regulatory clarity. If Claude AI’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Cardano, and Ethereum could be the leaders of this surge. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Sees Potential Gains of 700%+ Toward $24 Claude AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $24 by late 2025, a jump of more than 739% from its current price near $2.85. Source: Claude AI XRP has already shown resilience this cycle. On July 18, it hit $3.65, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40, before pulling back roughly 22% amid macro headwinds. Ripple’s payment network continues to expand globally and has received notable endorsements. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as an affordable remittance tool for emerging markets. Its years-long dispute with the SEC was resolved in early 2025 when the agency dropped its lawsuit, following a 2023 ruling confirming XRP’s retail sales do not meet the definition of securities. Claude AI suggests that a sustained move back above the July high could open the door to $4–$5, with a more aggressive bullish scenario placing upside potential anywhere between $7 and $24. Technical indicators have flagged three bullish formations across support and resistance zones in the past year, hinting at a possible rapid breakout in Q4. While markets largely shrugged at recent Fed cuts and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF, the SEC’s decisions on additional ETF applications expected next month, along with new federal crypto laws, could be major catalysts. Over the past year, XRP has surged 346%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 77.5% gains and delivering six times Ethereum’s 58% performance. Cardano ($ADA): Claude Predicts 8X Gains for the Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) has been regaining traction, in part due to growing political visibility. Most notably, U.S. President Trump recently floated the idea of including ADA in a federal crypto reserve, sourced entirely through enforcement seizures instead of market purchases. Created by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Cardano is unique for its academic, peer-reviewed development model and its strong focus on sustainability and scalability. With a market cap of over $28.8 billion, Cardano is steadily competing with Ethereum and closing the adoption gap with Solana. Claude forecasts ADA could hit $6.10 by year-end, a nearly 8X gain from its current level of $0.7934. From a technical perspective, ADA has been trading in a descending wedge since late 2024, facing resistance near $1.10. A strong Uptober push it to $2 by late Q4, but a bull run is likely the only thing that could drive it higher. Claude’s $6.10 target implies ADA would need to more than double its 2021 ATH of $3.09, a feat achievable only with the onset of rapid adoption, something that US regulators would need to cultivate with a framework. Ethereum ($ETH): Claude AI Predicts a Strong Push Higher for the Leading Smart Contract Network Ethereum ($ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized applications and DeFi, boasting a market capitalization above $502.4 billion. With more than $87.75 billion in total value locked (TVL), ETH’s role in smart contracts ensures its long-term relevance and adoption. Claude projects Ethereum could reach $6,925 by year’s end, a 66% increase from its current price of $4,169. Continuous improvements, whether from the Ethereum Foundation or Layer-2 scaling projects, reinforce ETH’s outlook. The introduction of spot ETFs has also brought in substantial and sustained institutional investment, as TradFi piggybacks off the price rises with regulated exposure to ETH. Additional upside could materialize if President Trump advances comprehensive crypto reforms, offering the regulatory certainty needed to spark further gains. Chart signals align with this view. After consolidating in a falling wedge, ETH rebounded from $1,800 to $2,412 in May, showing renewed whale accumulation. Coming into October, a bullish expanding triangle pattern lines the way to a potential run-up to $6,000 or beyond. If markets struggle to hold $4,000, ETH still has strong support around $3,500–$3,700. A recovery rally could see $5,000 as soon as mid-October, with $6,900 being the Christmas target. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New High Volatility Degen Play for Risk-Tolerant Meme Coin Heads For those chasing higher-risk meme coin plays beyond Claude AI’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) markets itself as Dogecoin’s wild gym bro cousin, leaning into high-volatility plays and degen meme culture as part of its brand identity. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream token, Maxi Doge embraces the satirical community-driven ethos of Dogecoin’s yesteryear. Its presale has already raised more than $2.6 million in just two months. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes grassroots community growth through Telegram and Discord activity, trading competitions, and cross-project partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion minted tokens, about 25% are set aside for the “Maxi Fund” to finance marketing and collaborations. Staking is available with yields currently around 129% APY, though rates will taper as more holders participate. The presale price sits at $0.00026, with incremental increases locked in as the presale advances through funding stages.

While these three tokens have actually taken hits today, the combination of their oversold technicals and the market’s recovering momentum should prime them for big rallies soon. We predict their future paths in this article, unpacking their indicators while also explaining why their fundamentals set them up nicely for some big gains in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Altcoin Ready to Break ATH on Back of Strong Fundamentals XRP has suffered a 1% decline in the past 24 hours, with its drop to $2.86 also marking a 5% decline in the last 14 days. Despite these dips, XRP remains in a very strong position, having risen by 340% in the past year. And if we look at its chart, we see that it may have bottomed out after two months of stop-start declines. Its relative strength index (yellow) has risen close to 50 again after dropping below 40 a few days ago, and this indicator has remained in a weak position for too long now. Source: TradingView We could say something similar about XRP’s MACD (orange, blue), which is still in a negative position, and which therefore should be coming up – along with the coin’s price – soon. More fundamentally, there’s every reason to be bullish about XRP, which could enjoy a massive boost in the next few weeks, as upwards of ten XRP ETFs begin launching . At the same time, Ripple itself is growing aggressively, having signed numerous partnerships , made acquisitions, and expanded into new territories . This expansion will increase adoption of and demand for XRP, which could set a new ATH (currently $3.65) by November or December. Crypto Price Prediction: Aster ($ASTER) – High-Momentum DEX Token Preparing for Another Breakout One of the newest coins in the top 100, ASTER has plunged by 7% in the past 24 hours, to $1.79. This price represents a 25.5% decline in relation to its ATH of $2.41, which it set last week. However, ASTER is also up by 1,700% over its lowest-recorded price (by CoinGecko) of $0.09971, underlining its credentials as one of the most exciting new alts in the market. It’s the native token of decentralized exchange Aster, which runs on BNB Chain and which already has a total value locked of $2.26 billion . Its fall today is arguably a necessary correction en route to longer-term gains, with its indicators moving in oversold positions that will eventually demand a rebound. Source: TradingView Also bullish is the fact that Aster’s price has been forming a pennant ever since reaching an all-time high earlier in September. As such, it’s getting very close to a big move, which its recent history of falls should mean will be a big rally. It could potentially reach $2 in the next few weeks, before climbing above $3 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Grayscale ETF Now Has ‘100% Chance of Approval’ ADA has fallen to $0.7878 today, marking a 4.5% drop in a week and a 9.5% decline in the past fortnight. Cardano is also down by 4.5% in the last 30 days, yet as with the other tokens in this article its falls mean that it’s now overdue a significant rebound. There are also fundamental reasons to expect ADA to do well very soon, with Grayscale still waiting on the potential approval of its ADA ETF. Bloomberg analysts have now given this and other altcoin ETFs a 100% chance of approval , and if it does go live, it will result in a big influx of money into ADA. Such an influx is also likely to boost the growth of Cardano’s ecosystem, which remains in the top 20 in terms of TVL . It continues to undergo development and expansion, yet institutional money could help it grow exponentially, in turn boosting the crypto price prediction for ADA. Source: TradingView The coin’s indicators remain in an oversold position, while also showing that the token could be very close to bottoming out. Its MACD has flattened out after falling into a negative position over the past few days, while it also seems the RSI has halted a recent decline. As such, we may be close to a big rally for ADA, which could rise above $1 before October is done, and then pass $3 in December. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Raises $1.5 Million in Presale: Could It 100x? Assuming that most altcoin ETFs do gain approval, the end of 2025 could bring a substantial bull market, pushing prices higher across the board. But it won’t be only major coins that benefit, with small-cap tokens having the potential to post exponential gains, given that they start from low bases. This is especially the case with presale coins, with one of the most interesting presale tokens right now being PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 crypto that recently opened its ICO. Your nodes are everything. Upgrade them, flex them, earn with them pic.twitter.com/LFohrFWmf7 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 26, 2025 It has already raised just over $1.5 million in this sale, with the project quickly winning over new investors and supporters. Its appeal lies in the fact that it’s the market’s first-ever ‘mine-to-earn’ token, enabling its holders to develop and earn from building their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy virtual mining nodes, users can earn greater rewards, which will be paid out in established coins such as Pepe and FARTCOIN. This mechanism means that PEPENODE could experience huge demand, while holders of the token can also stake it for a passive income. Investors can join PEPENODE’s sale by going to the project’s official website , where it currently costs $0.0010788. This price will rise later today and will continue to rise throughout the sale, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

At first glance, the move spooked market watchers. But beneath the surface, this sudden shift may be part of a much bigger play – one that could fast-track approvals and open the door to a wave of new crypto ETFs. And if that’s the case, SOL could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Who's ready for Cointober? Spot crypto ETF Deadlines start this week! Litecoin and Solana up first. Should be a wild month.. @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/K2m5pNBCbU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert from Bloomberg, emphasized that October could become ‘Cointober’ – a month when most of these pending applications will finally get the green light from the SEC. The agency has recently approved spot ETFs linked to top altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH). Thus far, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana have already gotten their first spot vehicles listed, while Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) could be next in line. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes Surge to $450 as Institutional Interest Grows Solana (SOL) has formed a similar structure to Ethereum (ETH) a few weeks ago, before it broke above the $4,000 resistance. In this case, the key level to watch is $270 . The token has been respecting its trend line support lately and could be about to make a strong move above this mark if positive momentum gains traction. The approval of new spot ETFs will likely draw more and more interest from institutional players. Paired with the launch of corporate treasuries, the stage could be set for SOL to reach a new all-time high like ETH did recently. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gains this cycle may come from early-stage presales like SUBBD ($SUBBD), which is already generating serious buzz. Investor demand has been strong, with over $1.2 million raised in a matter of weeks, signaling that this project could be one of the breakout stars of 2025. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Presale Merges AI + Web3 for Content Creation SUBBD ($SUBBD) aims to give creators a smarter, faster, and more flexible way to get their content out there. Instead of juggling multiple apps to produce AI-generated pieces, editing, and uploading, SUBBD puts everything into one platform.

According to the announcement, Thumzup is supporting DogeHash Technologies in expanding its fleet of crypto miners by 500 ASIC mining rigs. This addition will bump DogeHash’s fleet to 4,000 crypto mining rigs by the end of this year. Thumbzup stock jump by 3.80% Thumzup Media’s stock, with the ticker TZUP, has jumped by 3.80% based on data from Yahoo Finance. The stock closed trading today at US$5.19 and has a year-to-date (YTD) return of 45.77%. TZUP began trading on the Nasdaq exchange after a successful public offering in October of last year. The Trump backed company raised US$8.2 million, pricing its shares at $5 at the time. The CEO of Thumzup, Robert Steele, said , “We are enthusiastic about all the recent developments in the Dogecoin ecosystem and are looking forward to working with DogeHash to build a premier Doge mining company together.” Earlier in September, Cryptopolitan reported that Thumzup Media had purchased about US $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC), and expressed intentions to expand its holdings in ETH, DOGE, XRP, SOL, LTC, and USDC. Thumzup also announced its plans to acquire DogeHash Technologies and operate its miners. On September 24, Thumzup approved a US$10 million stock buyback plan, which will run until the end of next year. The digital ads company announced a similar buyback plan before, but with a US$1 million budget. It has bought back 212,432 shares of its common stock at an average price of $4.71 per share. Currently, Thumzup holds 19.106 Bitcoins and around 7.5 million Dogecoin worth a total of ~ US$4 million. The digital ads company is authorized by its board to hold cryptocurrencies worth US$250 million. Dogecoin trades sideways Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at US$0.27. The memecoin has seen better days during the last bull run in 2021, thanks to Elon Musk’s push. At that time, DOGE, which was trading in cents, jumped to an all-time high of US$0.7316, almost touching the US$1 point . Elon Musk continues to endorse Dogecoin. He created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with the blessings of his buddy Donald Trump. However, this move did not propel Dogecoin to reach USD$1. At the time of writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) is down by 68.2% from its all-time high. The memecoin has a market cap of US$35.19 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of US$1.97 billion based on aggregated data from CoinGecko. This crypto market cycle is powered by institutional money and ETFs. Around fourteen days ago, Rex-Osprey announced the listing of the first US based Dogecoin ETF, with ticker symbol DOJE, on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Other Dogecoin ETF applications from Grayscale and Bitwise are still pending. Analysts believe that Dogecoin ETFs will propel the memecoin to new highs, but the truth is that markets are unpredictable.

The exchange, which followed Swift’s announcement at Sibos that it will launch a blockchain-based ledger, quickly crystallized two very different theories of “value capture” in crypto: a native asset securing and settling an L1 network versus a utility token powering oracle middleware. Weisberger set the stage with a direct challenge to the XRP community: “Can someone from the XRP army (@xrpmickle) explain how XRP is more than TEN times LINK’s value, when LINK has a REAL partnership with SWIFT, AND a clear path to revenue to be shared with Token holders…” The prompt referenced Chainlink’s post congratulating Swift on adopting “blockchains and oracle networks as a key next step,” and emphasizing that Chainlink and Swift “have collaborated across numerous initiatives” to connect financial institutions to blockchains using existing infrastructure and standards. Why Is XRP 10x More ‘Valuable’ Than LINK What followed was equal parts token-economics debate and culture clash. Weisberger, who later clarified “To be clear, I hold both,” added that he thinks “XRP bulls are delusional in their calls,” while conceding that such delusion does not preclude outperformance versus traditional assets. His framing invited two lines of reply: the “volume and adoption” argument and the “different problem, different TAM” argument. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Support as Institutions Accumulate and ETF Filing Sparks Debate On the data front, one respondent, @baggins_cc, asserted that “The XRP token has a $172B market cap, while LINK has $14B (1/10th). And when looking at the last 24h, by volume, XRPL has processed $4.9B in revenue, compared to LINK, which only has processed $641M. Marketcap is absolute when it comes to ranking, and Volume is empirical & objectively a fact, when it comes to real world adoption.” Weisberger pushed back with a counterexample intended to decouple throughput from token value: “What is the value of XRPL to XRP when TRX processes more than 500 TIMES USDT by value and is 1/5th the market cap?” The thrust: raw settlement or messaging volume does not automatically translate into superior price performance or capitalization for a token. The second, more structural line of response came from former Ripple engineer Matt Hamilton. In a succinct distinction, he wrote: “Trying to compare their value is sort of meaningless. Link is a protocol, the XRP Ledger is an actual network. XRP is the native asset of that entire network. Link is just the token used within the link protocol.” In other words, the two assets occupy different positions in the technology stack: XRP is the base-layer currency of an L1 that provides security, fee payment, and liquidity for its ledger; LINK is the work token for an oracle protocol that sits above execution layers to deliver data and cross-chain services. That stack-positioning argument was amplified by the XRP army member “Ripple Bull Winkle,” who reframed the comparison in terms of addressable markets: “Because XRP isn’t competing with LINK — it’s solving a different problem on a much larger scale. LINK = middleware for data feeds. XRP = bridge asset for global settlement. One secures oracles, the other settles value between banks, CBDCs, tokenized treasuries, & stablecoins. The TAM for cross-border payments dwarfs oracle revenue. And by the way — Ripple has been partnered with SWIFT participants for years. This isn’t XRP vs LINK, it’s XRP in the heart of the plumbing that moves the actual money. That’s why the market values it 10x higher.” Related Reading: Everyone’s Wrong About XRP: Here’s Why, Says Top Analyst Other replies took aim at investor narratives themselves. When a commenter criticized Weisberger’s “lazy ask,” he volleyed back with a reminder that many were “talked into XRP based on SWIFT, despite no clear token economics and no definitive use case,” nodding to years of marketing-driven expectations that official banking rails would one day require XRP. In the end, the thread does not “prove” why XRP is worth ten times LINK or vice versa; instead, it exposes a fundamental split in crypto investing frameworks. One camp prioritizes native-asset economics of base layers and their role as neutral settlement media; the other prioritizes revenue-bearing middleware whose services are indispensable to a tokenized financial system. As the Swift news resets expectations about how legacy rails will interface with blockchains, the core question for markets remains unchanged: which designs actually trap value, and how verifiably do those mechanics funnel real-world usage into persistent demand for the token itself? On that score, the debate is far from settled. At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

The analysis points to two possible short-term outcomes , yet both lead to the same bullish conclusion in the long run. Bullish Technical Analysis For XRP XRP has spent the past week moving around $2.80, with repeated tests of both higher levels at $2.88 and lower levels at $2.71 failing to deliver a decisive breakout. The most recent three-day candlestick chart shows how XRP has created three consecutive bearish candlestick while support has held close to $2.72. This period of consolidation comes after months of volatility that saw the token retrace back below $3 in September. Against this backdrop, a new technical analysis posted on the social media platform X shows two possible short-term scenarios for XRP, both of which point to the same long-term bullish outcome. The analyst noted that the altcoin closed just over $2.80 in the latest three-day candlestick session, and this coincided with the appearance of hidden bullish divergence on the chart’s relative strength index (RSI). This divergence is a signal of underlying strength in spite of the most recent price downtrend. According to the analyst, this setup is consistent with its behavior ever since it broke away from the $0.50 price zone. As it stands, the altcoin is now forming a structure that precedes a strong bullish move, although the next move depends on the weekly close. Two Possible Paths In The Short Term Looking at the candles and support zones drawn on the chart above, the analysis outlines two different bullish possibilities. The first is what the analyst calls an April 7th moment. On April 7th earlier this year, XRP experienced a sharp dip that saw it lose the stable $2 support level back then before finally settling at $1.79. This sharp dip brought the price down to retest its ascending support line before bouncing strongly higher in the weeks that followed. A similar move now would see the asset retreat toward the trend line. This time, the price target is around $2.40, which is highlighted with the pink circle in the chart above. This will effectively reset momentum before launching into the next leg of the rally. The second outcome, however, would play out without the need for that deeper correction. If the $2.72 support zone continues to hold, XRP could turn higher from its current price and begin reclaiming levels above $2.90 and $3.00 much sooner. This scenario would represent a more direct continuation of the bullish trend, with buyers stepping in aggressively to defend current support. Both outcomes differ in their immediate impact on price action, but each route ultimately leads to the same destination: higher levels for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.88.",XRP|relative strength index|ripple|RSI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-30 23:00:53

That expectation took a significant hit this week after SWIFT revealed plans to implement its own blockchain ledger, making it clear that the organization intends to modernize its infrastructure without relying on XRP. SWIFT Introduces a Blockchain-Based Ledger At its annual conference in Frankfurt, SWIFT announced the development of a blockchain-powered shared ledger designed to enhance cross-border payments. The initiative has gained backing from over 30 major global financial institutions, including JPMorgan, HSBC, Santander, and Deutsche Bank. The prototype, developed in collaboration with Consensys, will function as a continuous, real-time record of international transactions. By integrating smart contracts, the system aims to automate settlement rules and ensure consistent validation of payments across networks. The project also emphasizes interoperability, seeking to connect existing fiat payment systems with emerging digital asset ecosystems. SWIFT CEO Javier Pérez-Tasso described the effort as an important step toward providing financial institutions with a more efficient and future-ready payments infrastructure. Ripple’s Competing Vision Ripple has long positioned XRP and the XRP Ledger as faster and more cost-effective alternatives to SWIFT’s traditional messaging framework. The company’s executives have repeatedly argued that XRP could handle a significant share of global settlement activity. Earlier this year, Ripple’s Senior Vice President, Eric van Miltenburg, described the company’s technology as a ‘SWIFT-like update. Also, CEO Brad Garlinghouse projected that the XRP Ledger could capture a large portion of SWIFT’s market share within five years. This new announcement from SWIFT, however, makes such claims increasingly difficult to sustain. By building its own blockchain ledger, SWIFT clearly indicates its intentions to remain central to the global payments ecosystem while retaining control over its infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry and Community Response The development sparked strong reactions within the cryptocurrency community. Members of the Chainlink ecosystem, which already collaborates with SWIFT, highlighted the implications for XRP holders. Chainlink community representative Zach Rynes argued that the announcement undermines the narrative that XRP would serve as the primary settlement layer for banks and other institutions. Other commentators pointed out that XRP supporters have long believed large financial institutions would adopt external blockchains like XRPL. Critics argued that these expectations overlooked the possibility that established institutions would instead develop their own solutions or collaborate with others, thereby maintaining control over market infrastructure. SWIFT’s decision to pursue a blockchain-enabled ledger marks a key moment in the evolution of cross-border payments. Instead of using external networks like XRPL, global banks seem to be focusing on upgrading their current systems to make them compatible with digital assets. This development poses a significant challenge to XRP’s long-held narrative that it would replace or complement SWIFT.

Trump tapped Quintenz shortly after retaking office. Quintenz joined venture firm Andresseen Horowitz's global head of policy, and has been an adviser to firms like prediction marketplace Kalshi since leaving the CFTC following his term as commissioner. In a statement to CoinDesk, Quintenz said, ""Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I [am] looking forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country."" Politico and Punchbowl News earlier reported that the White House had withdrawn Quintenz's nomination. Quintenz has made statements in favor of the crypto industry since his first term as commissioner, including floating the idea of a self-regulatory organization for the industry similar to securities markets' Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Despite this, crypto exchange Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — both of whom support Trump — opposed his nomination in late July, with Tyler telling CoinDesk that he did not believe Quintenz's views on developers and his work with Kalshi qualified him for the role. However, Quintenz released messages he had exchanged with the Winklevoss brothers earlier this month, suggesting that they really opposed his nomination because he would not commit to a public view on a CFTC enforcement action against Gemini. In his messages, Quintenz said that it would be better for a ""fully confirmed chair"" to review the CFTC's actions. Crypto lobbyist organizations and companies wrote a public letter supporting his nomination in a late August bid to put his nomination back on track. Still, the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to postpone a vote on Quintenz's nomination a few times in July. Last week, Semafor reported that it had begun vetting new candidates to run the agency, which at present is helmed by Acting Chairman Caroline Pham. All of the other commissioners at the agency at the start of 2025 have since left, and Pham has indicated her intention to depart as well at some point, CoinDesk previously reported. The CFTC's potential lack of a permanent chair comes as Congress considers legislation that would give the agency a more prominent role in regulating crypto spot markets, though the legislative process is likely to be delayed by a pending government shutdown.

BWT Alpine, with its decades of Formula 1® excellence under the Renault Group, is synonymous with mechanical precision, team discipline, and global prestige. BlockDAG (BDAG) , on the other hand, is not content to follow precedent. It is rethinking how a Layer-1 blockchain should function, prioritizing real utility, transparency, and scale. As the BWT Alpine F1® team and BlockDAG unite under a multi-year global sponsorship, what unfolds is a chapter where heritage meets future. Buyers watching closely will recognize that among the best crypto coins of this era, BlockDAG isn’t just competing, it’s making history. BWT Alpine F1’s Legacy: From the Circuit to Cultural Icon The BWT Alpine F1® name carries weight far beyond the racetrack. As a cornerstone of Renault’s high-performance division, BWT Alpine F1® has spent decades perfecting the art of speed, resilience, and engineering mastery. Formula 1® isn’t just a sport; it’s a statement of national pride, global reach, and generational fandom. Through this lens, BWT Alpine F1 doesn’t just represent a team on the grid; it represents a legacy of excellence measured in tenths of seconds, years of strategy, and billions of broadcast impressions. When a brand like BWT Alpine F1 chooses to align with a Web3 platform, it’s not a casual endorsement. It is a calculated decision to partner with a blockchain brand that respects legacy while pushing boundaries. This makes BlockDAG’s entry into the Formula 1® world through BWT Alpine F1 not just strategic; it’s symbolic. For buyers evaluating the best crypto coins available before global deployment, BlockDAG is positioning itself not on trend, but within a timeline that stretches years into the future. BlockDAG’s Disruption: Real Adoption, Not Just Ambition While other crypto projects often center around speculative hype or theoretical whitepapers, BlockDAG has focused on real-world progress. With over 26.5 billion coins sold, nearly $415 million raised, and a current ROI of 2,900% since batch 1, it has built trust the old-fashioned way by delivering. Today, the presale sits at batch 30 with a listed price of $0.03, yet buyers can still lock in their position at $0.0013. This limited-time price lock signals a clear “before and after” moment, just ahead of BlockDAG’s deployment on Coinstore and its global event in Singapore. Beyond the numbers, the strategy is layered: 312,000+ holders, 3 million daily miners on the X1 app, and already 20,000 mining units are being shipped, with scaling set at 2,000 per week. This is no small feat. Most presales in crypto history have struggled to deliver on a single product or utility before listing. BlockDAG has done both, building software (X1 app) and hardware (X10/X30/X100 miner series) simultaneously. A Roadmap for Relevance The BWT Alpine F1® x BlockDAG partnership isn’t just about logos on race cars. It represents a roadmap built for relevance. The partnership will unfold across Alpine’s RISE+ app, global fan activations, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, and integrated Web3 engagement, including NFT drops, mining access, and co-branded merchandise. This is not a short-term alignment. It’s a multi-year sponsorship designed to grow with both platforms, culminating in a shared journey that connects one of the best crypto coins to one of the most historic names in motorsport. The value here is not in fleeting attention but in sustained brand co-evolution. While BWT Alpine F1® continues its pursuit of the podium, BlockDAG races toward becoming a household name in blockchain infrastructure. This alignment gives buyers and early adopters more than just speculative upside. It offers front-row access to a project tying its token utility and hardware infrastructure to a global entertainment engine watched by billions. That’s not marketing; that’s ecosystem integration at scale. Final Thoughts In every era, there are moments that become reference points. The collaboration between BWT Alpine and BlockDAG marks one of them. This is more than a sponsorship, it is a deliberate fusion of a timeless racing heritage with a blockchain project poised to reshape how utility, mining, and community engagement co-exist. As the locked price of $0.0013 edges closer to expiration, this is not just another buying opportunity. It is a historic inflection point. Among the best crypto coins in 2025, BlockDAG stands out not simply because of its technology, but because of the story it’s building. A story where speed, structure, and ambition meet on and off the track. And buyers have the chance to be written into it.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trader-losses-over-3-6m-heres-what-happened/,"Well-known crypto trader Qwatio has once again faced major losses after a leveraged short bet against XRP went against him. Data from Lookonchain shows that his cumulative losses on XRP and Bitcoin trades have now surpassed $3.6 million, following the most recent liquidation of part of his XRP position. Qwatio originally entered a short trade involving 6.17 million XRP, valued at around $17.6 million, with 20x leverage. His entry price was $2.8519, and the position was set to be liquidated if XRP reached $2.9155. He was essentially wagering on a decline in XRP’s price below his entry point. Instead, XRP climbed to $2.92 during the previous trading session, surpassing its liquidation threshold. This move partially closed his position at $2.9154, resulting in a realized loss of approximately $83,223. Remaining Exposure and Unrealized Losses Although part of his position was liquidated, Qwatio still holds a significant exposure of about 4.98 million XRP, worth $14.34 million at current prices. The open position has a liquidation level at $2.932 and is already showing an unrealized loss of roughly $145,000. If XRP approaches this liquidation price, the trader could face much larger losses. This setback is not an isolated event. Before this liquidation, Qwatio had already accumulated more than $3.4 million in losses from earlier short trades on XRP and Bitcoin. Adding the new $83,223 realized loss brings his total losses across these trades to over $3.6 million. XRP Price Action and Market Impact At the time of writing, XRP has retreated slightly from its recent peak of $2.92, trading near $2.82 . The token has declined 0.42% over the last 24 hours but remains modestly higher on a weekly and monthly basis, up 0.35% and 1.51%, respectively. Leveraged trading activity around XRP has been significant. In the past day alone, more than $7 million in positions have been liquidated. Of this amount, $5.3 million came from long traders, while $2.02 million came from shorts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Liquidation Scenarios Market data suggests that XRP approaching $2.93 , the same level tied to Qwatio’s liquidation threshold, could trigger an additional $41.39 million in short liquidations across the market. On the other hand, if the price retraces to $2.80, an estimated $86 million in long positions could be wiped out. Compared to the overall crypto market, XRP’s $7.2 million in daily liquidations represents a smaller share. Across the broader market, liquidations have totaled approximately $338 million in the past 24 hours, with $158.46 million from long positions and $179 million from shorts. Qwatio’s situation highlights the risks of highly leveraged trading in volatile assets such as XRP. With nearly $15 million still tied up in an active short and the token trading close to his liquidation point, the trader’s exposure remains significant. The broader market also shows elevated liquidation levels, underscoring the hazards faced by both long and short participants during periods of sharp price fluctuations.

Cardano Whale Has Withdrawn Big From Coinbase According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large transfer has been spotted on the Cardano blockchain during the past day. The move in question involved the shifting of about 67.8 million ADA across the network, worth over $54.3 million at the time that the sender executed the transaction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns Back To Neutral As BTC Breaks $114,000 Considering the significant scale of the transfer, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Whales are big-money investors who carry large amounts in their wallets and hold the power to make huge individual transactions. Because of this, these holders can have some degree of influence in the market. As such, what they are doing on the network can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may reveal the sentiment among them. Usually, though, the anonymous nature of the blockchain means it can be hard to comment on the motive behind a particular transaction. In the case of the current Cardano whale transfer, however, one side of the move involves a wallet that’s already known. Below are the address details related to the transaction. As is visible, the sending address for this Cardano whale transaction was a wallet attached to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Meanwhile, the receiver was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was likely the investor’s self-custodial address. Transfers of this type, where coins flow out of the custody of a centralized exchange, are known as exchange outflows. Generally, investors make exchange outflows when they plan to hold their tokens in the long term, as self-custody tends to be a safer option for them. The latest large Coinbase withdrawal has come as Cardano is significantly down compared to its peak from earlier in September. As such, it’s possible that the move could be an indication of the whale betting on the asset at the current post-dip prices. It only remains to be seen whether the gamble will pay off for the investor. Related Reading: XRP Bounce Incoming? Analyst Targets $3–$3.15 After Support Holds Another altcoin, XRP, has also just witnessed a large transaction, as Whale Alert has pointed out in another X post. Unlike ADA’s transfer, however, this whale move has been an Exchange Inflow. In total, the XRP whale has shifted 18 million tokens of the cryptocurrency (worth around $51.4 million) to Coinbase with the transaction. Holders use exchanges for trading purposes, so it’s possible that the large investor may be looking to exit. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.79, down almost 4% over the last seven days.

As Bitcoin developer Peter Todd put it on Sunday, “Good read. tl;dr: everything that has been said about Core vs Knots has already been said almost 15 years ago.” The 2010 Fight Over Bitcoin’s Soul That Never Ended The historical through-line runs straight back to December 2010, when Satoshi Nakamoto shipped Bitcoin version 0.3.18. That release quietly introduced an “IsStandard()” relay and mining policy to “only include known transaction types,” a defensive move designed to reduce attack surface from exotic scripts. Satoshi’s own release note summarized the change tersely: “IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks.” The first debate about arbitrary data in the blockchain happened in December 2010 and Satoshi was involved On 8th December 2010, Satoshi released Bitcoin version 0.3.18, which included a standardness check, to only include known transaction types pic.twitter.com/J95ax5Cgte — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) September 29, 2025 The check ignited what many participants described as Bitcoin’s first real governance dispute. Within hours, forum users split over whether restricting non-standard transactions would neuter legitimate experiments like BitDNS or simply protect the young network. The thread, preserved by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, captures the core fault lines that have resurfaced in 2025. On the permissive side, user “da2ce7” argued that fees would rationalize everything: “Transaction fees will pay for the generation of the chain in the future… if [others] want to include carefully crafted transactions… they must include the appropriate compensation.” Jeff Garzik fired back that such a stance “will disadvantage people who use bitcoins… as cash as intended,” because non-currency uses would bid up fees and crowd out payments. Theymos, then pushing for minimal relay restrictions, argued miners’ incentives would bulldoze any client-level gatekeeping: “all miners have an interest in including any and all fee-carrying transactions… The restriction on relaying these transactions should be removed, at the very least.” Garzik warned that if “data spam increases TX fees to annoying levels,” currency users would decamp—and that the presence of “law-enforcement-objectionable data” would raise different, sharper risks. Crucially, Satoshi and Gavin Andresen converged on the whitelist approach as a pragmatic security default, while leaving the door ajar for purpose-built data uses. Gavin explained that whitelisting known-safe templates was “the right thing to do,” drawing an analogy to web security’s failure modes when blacklisting is relied upon.In a follow-up, Satoshi wrote: “I came to agree with Gavin about whitelisting when I realized how quickly new transaction types can be added,” and endorsed a path for small data commitments: “I also support a third transaction type for timestamp hash sized arbitrary data.” If today’s back-and-forth feels like déjà vu, BitMEX Research’s weekend recap is the missing Rosetta stone. Their thread traces the debate’s timeline—RHorning’s early pushback against 0.3.18’s new standardness rules; Theymos’s insistence that miner incentives would trump relay defaults; Garzik’s resistance to “non-currency data” pricing out money use; and community unease about what happens when immutable ledgers meet illegal content. The researchers note that Theymos even released a patch client removing restrictions at the time, underscoring how client defaults and miner policy have always been a contested, malleable layer. There are two enduring takeaways from the 2010 record. First, the “policy vs protocol” distinction—what Bitcoin can do versus what the reference implementation should relay or mine by default—has long been a pressure valve for innovation and a magnet for controversy. Satoshi’s 0.3.18 email makes plain that IsStandard() lived in this gray zone of incentives and norms, not consensus rules. Second, nearly every argument now deployed in Core-versus-Knots skirmishes had an ancestor in that first “coming-of-age” fight: fee-market neutrality versus application-layer bloat; the right to pay for block space versus the social cost of permanent data; and whether tightening defaults protects Bitcoin’s monetary function or stifles its utility for timestamping and proofs. The archive shows the spectrum clearly, from Theymos’s “remove the restrictions” stance to Garzik’s warning that generalized data “has the distinct probability of degrading service for digital cash.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,071.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Core|Bitcoin Knots|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 00:00:32

Politico reported on Tuesday, citing two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement. “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life,” Quintenz said. “I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The development follows recent reports that the White House is considering additional candidates to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as the confirmation process for Brian Quintenz to lead the regulator had not made significant progress. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Quintenz has encountered a roadblock to his nomination due to political pressure and lobbying from high-profile crypto executives, led by the Winklevoss brothers. The withdrawal ends a remarkable series of developments for a nominee who was once considered all but certain to be confirmed. The former CFTC commissioner, with experience at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the prediction market startup Kalshi, had enjoyed strong backing from both the cryptocurrency sector and traditional finance. CFTC leadership race heats up as crypto policy stakes rise The CFTC plays a crucial role in regulating cryptocurrency markets . The Senate Agriculture Committee oversees nominations for the agency, including oversight of digital asset market developments. The agency, which is responsible for overseeing trillions of dollars in swaps trading, is poised to gain more influence over digital assets under legislation being considered in Congress. Quintenz’s nomination, announced at the beginning of the year, was initially praised by sections of the crypto industry as he already works actively in the industry, being the head of policy at a16z crypto . The agency, which was designed to be a five-person, bipartisan commission, has been reduced after a string of resignations to just the acting Chairman, Caroline Pham, a Republican whom former President Joe Biden appointed to the commission. The other top US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has had Paul Atkins as its permanent chairman since April. Crypto heavyweights and new contenders shake up CFTC chair race In a July call, crypto billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss urged President Donald Trump to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination to lead the influential Wall Street regulator overseeing the $4 trillion market. The brothers informed Trump that Quintenz was disconnected from the president’s agenda, Soon after the call, the White House asked the Senate Ag Committee to postpone a scheduled meeting where lawmakers would have likely advanced Quintenz’s nomination to a full-floor vote At the beginning of September, Quintenz took to social media to suggest that the president “might have been misled” by the twins. He posted screenshots of private messages he claimed to have exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss in late July, before his confirmation hearing was put on hold. An additional slate of potential candidates to lead the CFTC has emerged, with discussions intensifying in recent weeks. The possible contenders include government officials with a focus on crypto policy. Earlier reports indicate that Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force, is among the additional candidates discussed for CFTC chair. Initially, he was a partner in Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s asset management practice. Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital asset policy, is also considered a candidate for the role. He joined the Treasury from Galaxy Digital, a digital assets investment firm. Josh Sterling, a former CFTC official who is now a partner at the law firm Milbank, and former CFTC Commissioner Jill Sommers are also potential candidates to lead the CFTC.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the most impressive. At $0.035 currently, MUTM has already reached more than $16.55 million in presale and has had more than 16,660 holders, providing higher exposure to the market. Mutuum Finance offers a working DeFi platform with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, staking rewards flexibility, and a rapidly expanding global community. Unlike meme-based coins, Mutuum Finance offers actual financial utility, engaging retail and whale investors, and turning into an upside altcoin to track in 2025. Dogecoin Whale Sell-Off Sparks Market Buzz, What Investors Should Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the news over the last 24 hours following sales of more than 40 million tokens by whale wallets that are creating speculation over short-term price movements. Such large token sales do suggest market stress, but not all whale activity is bearish, analysts say, and some may be profit-taking or shifting into a different asset class as part of larger market trends. Historic trends would suggest DOGE bounces back after such corrections, but traders are keenly observing exchange inflows and trading volumes to take a cue on the next direction. While investors seek to decipher this heightened volatility in DOGE, several others are observing alternative cryptocurrencies with strong utility and growth prospects like upstart DeFi platforms with more stable financial opportunities. Mutuum Finance Records Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to make strong gains in Phase 6 of its presale, onboarded over 16,660 investors, and achieved a high of more than $16.55 million. Increasing entry is an indication of increasing faith in the long-term potential and vision of the project for the future of decentralized finance. In yet another example of its security and transparency culture, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Through the program, security engineers and developers can hunt for platform vulnerabilities in four severity levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The program is just one of the numerous steps Mutuum is taking to be even more secure in its infrastructure and to earn the trust of its increasing community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Maximum Efficiency At the center of the Mutuum Finance protocol is an algorithmic real-time floating interest rate system that is adjusted according to liquidity levels. During high liquidity, borrowing cost reduces, thereby promoting lending and incoming capital. During low liquidity, borrowing cost goes up to prompt new deposits and loan repayment. Self-balancing ensures natural equilibrium, which discourages over-leveraging risks and overall ecosystem health. Efficiency also results from collateral optimization, particularly where co-related assets are collateralized. Collateralized holdings carried in a proper manner enjoy higher borrowing ability with improved Loan-to-Value (LTV) terms, and reserve factors act as cushions when there is market uncertainty. Asset volatility is subject to increased reserve requirements to minimize uncertainty, but stable low-volatility assets can have higher borrowing with lower liquidation risk. LTV ratios and liquidation points are dynamically scaled to fit each of the tokens it lists’ distinctive volatility profiles, spreading risk evenly throughout the platform. With success in presale, sophisticated risk management technology, and unwavering dedication to transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a wholesome and viable network for long-term adoption, growth, and success in the DeFi network. Join the Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it to the list of the most viable utility-based altcoins of 2025, raising over $16.55 million from more than 16,660 investors and selling more than 50% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per coin. With the whales of Dogecoin causing market uncertainty by dumping 40 million tokens, investors are now on their way to making a shift towards projects with real-world utility and strong fundamentals. With its innovative DeFi lending platform, dynamic interest model, and security-focused ecosystem, MUTM is a top contender with high growth potential. Reserve your spot before presale expires.

Visa Direct Will Utilize Stablecoins For The First Time Payments giant Visa has announced a new pilot program for Visa Direct, the firm’s real-time global payments platform. According to the announcement, which occurred at Sibos 2025, businesses will be able to prefund cross-border payments with stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency. Until now, Visa Direct users could only prefund their international payments using fiat. Such transactions were slow, sometimes taking days, forcing businesses to park their capital in advance. With the use of stablecoins, however, settlement can occur in minutes. Chris Newkirk, President, Commercial & Money Movement Solutions at the company, said: Cross-border payments have been stuck in outdated systems for far too long. Visa Direct’s new stablecoins integration lays the groundwork for money to move instantly across the world, giving businesses more choice in how they pay. Pre-funding with these fiat-tied currencies works just like with fiat: Visa treats the tokens as “money in the bank.” Recipients, however, aren’t forced to get paid in stables; they can choose to receive in their local currency instead. With the new pilot, businesses will have the advantage of having better access to capital, as they won’t have to park it up in advance for as long as with the current fiat system. As for who can use the Visa Direct pilot right now, the payment card services company has noted that it’s only open to select partners that meet the criteria. The firm expects the pilot to move into limited availability by April 2026. Visa said in the press release: By combining the scale and trust of Visa’s global network with the programmability of blockchain and by partnering with leading payment providers on prefunding use cases, Visa is helping modernize cross-border payments for businesses, financial institutions and consumers worldwide. Visa isn’t the only financial institution that has made a move toward modernizing cross-border payments during Frankfurt’s Sibos 2025. Payments messaging platform SWIFT has also announced a shared ledger developed with 30+ major global banks based on the blockchain, the technology that powers digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins. Bitcoin Has Retraced Some Of Its Recovery Over The Past Day Bitcoin exceeded the $114,700 mark on Monday in what looked like the return of bullish momentum, but the rally seems to have already run out of steam as the cryptocurrency has returned to the $112,800 level. The chart below shows how the coin’s recent performance has looked: One warning sign that may have already been there could be the sharp surge in the Open Interest that accompanied the price surge, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn pointed out in an X post .

XRP, in particular, has been hit hard, falling below the $3 threshold and sparking concerns among investors. Despite the current downturn, market analyst Jay has issued an optimistic forecast, suggesting that XRP could still achieve double-digit prices within the ongoing cycle. Recent XRP Performance As of report time, XRP trades at approximately $2.82, a level that reflects its retreat from the $3 range and highlights broader market weakness. Jay maintains that XRP has the potential to stage a strong recovery, with the possibility of reaching $10 before the current market cycle concludes in December 2025. Achieving this target would require an increase of around 256% from present levels, raising XRP’s market capitalization to an estimated $598 billion. His projection mirrors the outlook of Jake Claver , CEO of Digital Ascension Group, who also expects XRP to reach new all-time highs before the cycle ends. Tops this cycle: * Bitcoin – $4690k * Ethereum – $25k * Solana – $1000 * Hyperliquid – $300 * XRP – $10 Thoughts? — jay (@0xjaypeg) August 14, 2025 Predictions for Other Major Assets Alongside his XRP forecast, Jay outlined ambitious targets for several leading cryptocurrencies. His estimates include a peak of $469,000 for Bitcoin, $25,000 for Ethereum, $1,000 for Solana, and $300 for Hyperliquid. These price levels represent potential gains of 328% for BTC, 528% for ETH, 395% for SOL, and 570% for HYPE. Compared to these figures, XRP’s projected 256% increase appears less aggressive, though still significant in scale. Possible Catalysts for XRP’s Growth Although Jay did not provide specific reasons behind his projections, several recent developments may support optimism for XRP. Foremost among them is the anticipation of additional spot-backed XRP exchange-traded funds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved the first spot XRP ETF, and market observers expect other proposals to be approved in the near future. Such investment products could attract substantial institutional inflows, boosting liquidity and demand for XRP. Institutional interest is already beginning to surface. Trident Digital Tech Holdings recently allocated $500 million toward establishing an XRP-based treasury, signaling growing corporate confidence in the asset. Retail participation is also increasing, particularly as decentralized finance platforms such as Axelar , Flare Network, and Uphold launch programs that allow XRP holders to earn yields of up to 10% annually. These initiatives enhance XRP’s utility and create new avenues for adoption. While XRP’s price remains under pressure in the short term, long-term forecasts such as Jay’s suggest that a sharp recovery could be possible if broader market conditions improve. A climb to $10 would represent a significant milestone for the asset, though it depends heavily on institutional adoption, ETF-driven demand, and integration into the DeFi ecosystem. The ambitious projections for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Hyperliquid further highlight expectations for the cycle, but whether XRP can match its bold $10 target remains uncertain.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Could Happen ‘In A Hurry,’ Analyst Warns Momentum is supported by increasing ETF optimism, with new trust and ETF discussions bringing HBAR into the same conversation as large-cap altcoins, along with renewed engagement from SWIFT. Hedera Makes Global Partnerships Hedera representatives participated with SWIFT, Citi, and Germany’s Bundesbank on a Sibos panel to discuss digital-currency interoperability, highlighting Hedera’s role in real-world finance. Meanwhile, Wyoming’s Frontier Stablecoin pilot, which selects HBAR for low-cost, high-speed settlement, continues to validate Hedera’s enterprise-first approach. Under the Hedera Governing Council, featuring companies like Google and IBM, the network’s value proposition is clear: high throughput, low fees, and energy efficiency through its hashgraph consensus. These fundamentals, combined with institutional filings and improved macro narratives for regulated crypto products, keep HBAR on watch lists despite short-term volatility. Price Action: HBAR Key Levels Into “Uptober” Technically, HBAR’s structure shows a recovery from a two-month low near $0.21, with the price still coiling inside a descending wedge, a setup that often precedes upside moves when broader sentiment turns positive. Immediate support lies between $0.212 and $0.205; losing that range could lead to a slide toward $0.198. On the upside, $0.226–$0.230 remains the first barrier; a clear break above could target $0.235 and the mid-September highs near $0.245, with $0.285 as the October stretch level if buying momentum accelerates. HBAR's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Momentum indicators are mixed but stabilizing. RSI has rebounded from oversold (28) into the mid-40s, while Chaikin Money Flow trends higher, suggesting net inflows. The near-term warns of a narrowing golden cross between the 50- and 200-day EMAs that could turn into a death cross if bulls fail to defend the support levels. For swing traders, the strategy is simple: respect downside risk below $0.205, but look for confirmation above $0.230 to push toward $0.245–$0.285. Enterprise Adoption Gains Momentum, With Risks HBAR’s story is supported by enterprise integrations (payments, identity, and tokenization) and consistently very low fees (<$0.0001), making it appealing for high-frequency settlement. On-chain, active addresses and staking participation have increased, and sentiment is bullish going into Q4, driven by ETF hopes and public-sector pilots.

With its name now plastered across Grand Prix tracks, F1 simulators, and global media coverage, BlockDAG is positioning itself beyond code, into real-world credibility. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), despite holding firm near the $0.80 support line and making headlines through Grayscale’s multi-asset ETF, is struggling to convert technical merit into mainstream momentum. For those assessing what crypto to invest in this quarter, the contrast is becoming harder to ignore. BlockDAG’s Real-World Presence: More Than Just Tech With over 26.5 billion coins sold and a presale that continues to accelerate through batch 30 at a current price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is stepping into a league of its own. The partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team is not just a sponsorship; it is a calculated move to connect blockchain engineering with a global stage that values speed, precision, and consistency. The BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team deal was unveiled at Raffles Hotel in Singapore, setting the tone for BlockDAG’s expansion through fan engagement zones, driver appearances, simulators, and hackathons. Traction in crypto means more than GitHub commits or TPS benchmarks. It’s about showing up where attention already lives: sports arenas, digital media, developer showcases, and institutional boardrooms. BlockDAG’s technology is built on a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, designed to deliver higher throughput and near-instant finality. But now, it is doing the harder part, making people care. The F1® partnership achieves that by placing the BlockDAG brand where audiences are already emotionally invested, thus building trust and recognition beyond whitepapers or tech claims. Cardano’s Slower Climb: Institutional Nod, Retail Hesitation Cardano (ADA), often hailed for its academic rigour and peer-reviewed development model, is currently trading around the $0.80 range . Analysts from crypto.news suggests it may bounce toward $1.14 if bullish conditions take hold. This optimism is partly driven by Cardano’s inclusion in Grayscale’s multi-asset ETF, which lends it institutional validation. However, visibility in institutional funds doesn’t always translate to retail conviction or cultural relevance. ADA’s roadmap remains robust, with updates on smart contract scalability, interoperability, and governance. But the project continues to struggle with engagement outside the crypto-native crowd. Cardano lacks the type of narrative activation BlockDAG has recently achieved, something that could become a critical differentiator in the Layer 1 wars of 2025. As users ask what crypto to invest in, projects that can command both technical and emotional loyalty may win out. BlockDAG, through its traction playbook, is building both. Traction as a Growth Multiplier The importance of traction is often underestimated in crypto. Many Layer 1 projects assume the merits of their consensus algorithms or TPS benchmarks will eventually be recognised. But BlockDAG’s recent moves show otherwise. Traction requires exposure, activation, and repeat touchpoints. The presence at Grand Prix events, simulators that connect fans directly with the protocol’s branding, and developer integrations via hackathons turn BlockDAG into a living brand, not just a whitepaper. This traction also helps with partner onboarding. As media coverage of the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team partnership expands, institutional players who may not yet understand DAG-based consensus will still recognise the significance of a blockchain project being affiliated with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® team. In turn, developers who once saw the Layer 1 space as saturated may start building on BlockDAG simply because it’s visible, accessible, and socially validated. This is why traction matters, and why it can be a tipping point toward top-tier Layer 1 status. Cardano’s Stiff Challenge To be clear, Cardano isn’t faltering; it’s holding ground. But the pace of growth feels slower. The recent price support is fragile, and ADA continues to be a coin that’s held rather than used. Unlike BlockDAG, which is integrating interactive fan and developer experiences into its rollout, Cardano’s ecosystem remains somewhat abstract to the average user. The contrast between institutional relevance and cultural relevance becomes stark when you consider where each project is being talked about. As buyers and traders search for what crypto to invest in, this gap may become decisive. Even with smart contract upgrades, Cardano must still translate its capabilities into mainstream relevance, something BlockDAG is rapidly achieving through its sports partnerships and on-ground events. Why BlockDAG’s Model Could Shift Layer 1 Rankings What sets BlockDAG apart isn’t just its technology stack. It’s the ability to convert that stack into traction, and traction into adoption. With nearly $415 million raised, over 26.5 billion coins sold, and a massive ROI since batch 1 (now at $0.0013), BlockDAG is not operating on hype but on a clear business strategy: connect brand, community, and technology through real-world channels. And it’s working. The protocol is appearing where people aren’t expecting a blockchain, Formula 1® simulators, BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team fan activations, digital track overlays, and developer summits. This signals that BlockDAG is not simply trying to disrupt crypto spaces but to expand into sectors like sports tech, digital entertainment, and enterprise tools. The high-profile BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team deal is the launchpad for that vision. Final Thoughts For those seriously evaluating what crypto to invest in, the data points toward a shift. It is no longer enough to have a strong protocol. What matters is traction, being seen, understood, and engaged with. Cardano (ADA) may continue to hold value through ETF inclusion and price rebounds, but its lack of cultural and mainstream momentum could limit its upside. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing how to scale visibility into adoption. The BWT Alpine Formula 1® team partnership gives it credibility on a global stage and serves as a signal to developers, investors, and partners that this Layer 1 is not just technically sound; it is socially validated. With momentum from both fundraising and real-world activations, BlockDAG offers more than a speculative token. It offers presence, growth, and trust, three things that define what crypto to invest in going forward.

He shared that over the last few months, he has been researching other use cases for XRP besides what Ripple is focused on. Still, he noted that he isn’t leaving Ripple permanently and will continue to remain active in the company’s activities. Schwartz joined the company in 2011 as a cryptographer and was promoted to Chief Technology Officer in 2018. “The time has come for me to step back from my day-to-day duties as Ripple CTO at the end of this year,” Schwartz wrote on X. “I’m really looking forward to spending more time with the kids and grandkids and going back to the hobbies I set aside. However, be warned, I’m not leaving the XRP community. You haven’t seen the last of me (now, or ever). Schwartz steps back but remains on the Ripple board Schwartz will remain at Ripple as Chief Technology Officer Emeritus, an honorary title , and will also join the company’s board of directors. CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised the move on X, calling Schwartz a “true OG in crypto.” A Ripple spokesperson noted that Dennis Jarosch, Senior Vice President of Engineering, will lead the team going forward. Data from the blockchain analytics platform Nansen showed that the price of XRP surged about 1.4% to $2.87 from $2.83 in the hours following Schwartz’s announcement. The token reached an all-time high price of more than $3.50 in July. It is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a value of roughly $172 billion. Ripple is one of the leading blockchain tech and crypto payments firms in the world. Notably, Schwartz had been associated with both Ripple and the XRP Ledger since their inception. The blockchain firm has established itself as a massive presence in the crypto space, with a loyal fan base they’ve dubbed the “XRP Army.” The company has also dabbled in political efforts; along with Coinbase, it recently donated approximately $70 million to a United States-backed political action committee, Fairshake, that influenced the 2024 election and the 2026 midterms. In a 60 Minutes interview, Garlinghouse said the PAC was formed in part as a counter to the SEC’s enforcement action against Ripple. Novogratz surprised by XRP’s survival The SEC’s case, brought under the leadership of Jay Clayton in December 2020, concluded in March when the regulator abandoned a key appeal . Recently, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz stated that he did not expect Ripple’s token to survive the SEC lawsuit against the California-based blockchain company. Novogratz made this declaration on a podcast with Kyle Chasse. The SEC initially accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP worth $1.3 billion. Following years of litigation, the court finally approved the settlement reached by the parties in August 2025. Novogratz said that this development came as a surprise, as he did not think XRP would last so long. The entrepreneur continued to say that he previously regarded Ripple’s token with disdain, partly due to its community, which he likened to a cult. Still, he admitted that over time, he concluded that this could generally apply to fans of most successful cryptocurrencies who are completely devoted. The Galaxy head mentioned an example of one of his own employees, who considers Bitcoin a central part of their life. Novogratz acknowledged the role of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in the successful resolution of the legal dispute, as well as maintaining the integrity of the community, which he called “one of the strongest” in the industry. He also noted that XRP turned out to be the best asset to invest in after November 2024, considering its rally. Get seen where it counts.

XRP ETF approval in October could unlock large institutional inflows and lift price quickly. Market analysts and probability markets assign a high chance to approvals, creating bullish sentiment. Sistine Research and other forecasters project target ranges of $37–$50 for XRP if ETFs attract major institutional capital (estimates vary). Meta description: XRP ETF approval drives market optimism — front-loaded with primary keyword. Read the latest analysis and prepare for potential institutional inflows. XRP’s price could surge if the SEC approves multiple ETF filings in October, driven by institutional interest and Ripple’s legal victory. XRP’s recent price consolidation is expected to end with an SEC decision on spot XRP ETFs, potentially driving a significant price surge. Experts predict a 95% chance of ETF approval, which could pave the way for institutional adoption and a historic rally in XRP’s price. Sistine Research forecasts XRP could reach $37 to $50 following ETF approvals, marking a potential 10x increase from its current price. XRP’s three-month consolidation phase may soon be over, as all eyes are on the SEC’s upcoming decision on spot XRP ETFs in October. After reaching a record high of $3.66 in July, the cryptocurrency has been in a holding pattern, with the market waiting for a fresh catalyst. The looming XRP ETF approval decision could be the catalyst that reignites momentum and attracts institutional capital. What is the likely market impact of an XRP ETF approval? XRP ETF approval is likely to increase liquidity and broaden investor access, encouraging institutional participation. If the SEC approves multiple spot XRP ETFs, market makers and asset managers would channel significant capital into XRP, potentially driving rapid price appreciation and narrower bid-ask spreads. How confident are analysts about ETF approval? Industry commentators and ETF analysts have expressed high confidence in approvals. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have publicly cited strong odds, while PolyMarket pricing reflects elevated probabilities. These market-implied signals are driving optimistic positioning among institutional and retail traders. Why does Ripple’s legal victory matter for ETF chances? Ripple’s court outcomes removed regulatory ambiguity that previously hindered institutional adoption. That legal clarity is a core rationale cited by analysts when assessing spot XRP ETF prospects. With litigation risk reduced, asset managers face fewer legal hurdles to offering XRP exposure to clients. What price targets are being discussed if ETFs are approved? Forecasts vary: some research groups present conservative upside while others — such as Sistine Research — outline aggressive scenarios with range targets between $37 and $50. These estimates assume sizable institutional inflows and a multiple expansion from present valuations. Comparative price scenarios for XRP after ETF approval Scenario Assumptions Price range Moderate inflows Selective asset manager adoption $5–$15 Broad institutional adoption Multiple spot ETFs + market makers $20–$37 Full institutional wave Large capital inflows, ETF-led retail pickup $37–$50 How should investors prepare for a potential ETF decision? Investors should assess risk tolerance, position sizing, and liquidity needs before reacting to regulatory outcomes.

ETF approval typically increases liquidity as institutional investors and market makers provide volume. For XRP, that would mean tighter spreads and higher daily traded volumes, improving execution for large orders. How quickly could price reactions occur after approval? Price reactions can be immediate—within hours—or unfold over weeks as assets are allocated to ETFs. The speed depends on the number of approved funds and their initial capital commitments. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity matters : Ripple’s legal outcomes underpin the improved ETF approval odds. Institutional demand is the catalyst : Spot XRP ETFs would create a regulated channel for large capital inflows. Risk management is essential : Prepare for volatility with position sizing, entry/exit rules, and monitoring of official SEC announcements. Conclusion With strong market signals and legal clarity behind Ripple, XRP ETF approval in October could be the next major catalyst for price discovery. Investors should weigh potential upside against volatility and plan positions accordingly.

This, however, needs to be done carefully, without causing severe economic stagnation that could result in job losses, officials said. This inflation concern was raised after Sarah Breeden, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for Financial Stability, gave a speech in Cardiff on Tuesday, September 30. In her speech, Breeden pointed out that inflation was expected to reach 4% in September, amid food and energy price hikes, as well as increases in payroll taxes and controlled prices. “It is too high,” she added. At that time, Catherine Mann, an American economist and a member of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), also commented on the situation during a Financial Times event in London. Mann noted that individuals have changed their expectations for future inflation from the earlier official target of 2%. Following this situation, she urged policymakers to commit more to restoring price stability and rebuilding trust. The UK’s ongoing high inflation raises tension among individuals The above remarks highlight mounting concerns among the MPC that the UK is beginning to stand out from other developed countries because of the ongoing high inflation. To address these concerns, economic analysts suggested that the situation may be partly a result of government policies, adding that it could also be due to long-term changes in how families and businesses operate. When the MPC announced its intention to cut interest rates in August, several officials raised concerns about it. This led to two rounds of voting before a conclusion was drawn. In September, things took a different turn. They voted 7-2 to continue with the current borrowing costs at 4% and market analysts do not expect any changes before the end of the year. Concerning the changes made, the Deputy Governor of BoE expressed that she still believed they could handle any small challenges that might come up in the short term, referring to them as “a bump in the road.” In the meantime, she speculated that inflation would return to the BoE’s earlier target of 2% as the job market slows down and the pressure on wages decreases. Breeden had also raised concerns about the inflation level earlier in August. This followed data released that month indicating that the inflation level had risen to 3.8%. Regarding this data, she suggested possible risks on both sides. Analysts still point out that inflation could become “sticky, not bumpy” if businesses continue to raise prices or if the BoE and other policymakers miscalculate the amount of labor available in the market. Breeden calls for the urgency to lower interest rates Breeden cautioned that if the BoE delayed lowering interest rates again, products and jobs would be harmed significantly. This might result in inflation levels falling below the target level. On the other hand, Mann mentioned that there are clear risks that a long period of persistently high inflation has altered consumers’ behavior. She explained that once inflation in the UK gets above 3%, it does not matter what goods they buy — consumers start paying much more attention to all the prices they see. “We have been above that level for quite some time already,” she added. However, Mann noted that this does not necessarily mean she is ruling out additional interest rate cuts. Based on her argument, consumers are concerned about higher prices. They are also increasingly nervous about job prospects, citing high uncertainty surrounding GDP growth. She further explained that if the economy improves, consumers will start to spend a little and buy things. However, if the economy slackens, they will “keep their wallets shut,” making it difficult for companies to raise prices, as consumers cannot or will not buy their products, she said.

Financial companies have been increasingly interested in stablecoins under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, which signed the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act into law in July. The stablecoin market has boomed to $300 billion, with the US Treasury estimating it will rise to $2 trillion by 2028. Source: Stripe The Information also reported on Tuesday that Stripe is seeking a federal banking charter to meet US stablecoin requirements, as well as a trust license from the New York State Department of Financial Services. How fast can Stripe service launch stablecoins? Stripe said businesses using Open Issuance could launch a stablecoin in a few days, adding that users can create rewards and use earnings from these rewards to incentivize their customers. Launch timelines depend on onboarding, reserve setup, and compliance checks. “Businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them,” Stripe said, emphasizing issuer control and customer-facing use cases. Stripe argues the approach carries fewer operational risks than building a full in-house stablecoin stack, which often strains teams on reserve management, compliance, and liquidity provisioning. Why is crypto-as-a-service gaining traction? Stripe’s stablecoin service follows similar white-label crypto offerings as traditional financial firms and exchanges expand product suites. Major exchange providers are rolling out crypto-as-a-service products to let banks, brokerages, and other enterprises offer crypto functions without building infrastructure from scratch. These services typically include access to trading, custody, liquidity, and compliance tooling — reducing time-to-market and operational complexity for incumbents entering crypto. How does Open Issuance fit into agentic e-commerce? Stripe also announced an Agentic Commerce Protocol developed with OpenAI to let merchants sell through AI agents while retaining brand control. Stablecoins issued via Open Issuance could be used to power payments and incentives for these AI-driven commerce flows. Circle, Crossmint, Binance, and Coinbase have similarly announced moves to expand rails and crypto-as-a-service capabilities, showing industry momentum toward integrated crypto payments and tokenized commerce. Frequently Asked Questions Can a company control its stablecoin reserves with Stripe Open Issuance? Yes. Issuers can customize reserve composition and set mint/burn rules while relying on Stripe and partner managers for custody and treasuries to simplify audits and reporting. Will Stripe Open Issuance reduce issuer compliance burden? Stripe positions Open Issuance to reduce compliance overhead by offering tooling, partner-managed treasuries, and reporting, but issuers remain responsible for regulatory obligations and onboarding. Key Takeaways Speed to market : Open Issuance aims to let businesses launch stablecoins in days with developer-focused APIs. Reserve control : Issuers can set cash/treasury ratios and choose treasury managers to support audits and liquidity. Industry context : The stablecoin market is large and growing ($300B today; U.S. Treasury projects up to $2T by 2028), and multiple firms now offer crypto-as-a-service. Conclusion Stripe Open Issuance positions companies to deploy branded stablecoins quickly while outsourcing reserve custody and reporting to established managers. For businesses exploring tokenized rewards, payments, or agentic commerce, Open Issuance offers a pragmatic path to production — monitor regulatory guidance and complete onboarding to go live.",Guides|News|FLOW|USDC,EN,0,0,FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 01:18:16

Nomination withdrawn: White House pulled Brian Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination Quintenz cited interference and shared private messages involving the Winklevoss brothers; reasons for withdrawal are not officially stated. Regulatory context: the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could shift broad crypto oversight to the CFTC, affecting assets like BTC and ETH. Quintenz nomination withdrawn: CFTC chair nomination pulled; read implications for crypto regulation and next steps under COINOTAG coverage. Brian Quintenz confirmed the White House withdrew his nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and said he will return to the private sector. What happened to Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination? Quintenz nomination withdrawn after the White House pulled his nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The withdrawal ends his pending confirmation and leaves the agency led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham while Congress considers crypto jurisdiction bills. Why was Quintenz’s nomination withdrawn? There is no official White House explanation at publication. Brian Quintenz said he will return to the private sector and confirmed reporting by Politico and comments he gave to Cointelegraph. Quintenz also published private messages that indicate public pushback from Gemini co‑founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Brian Quintenz speaks during a Congressional nomination hearing in June. Source: Senate Agriculture Committee How did the Winklevoss messages affect the nomination? Quintenz shared private messages on social media showing the Winklevoss brothers urged intervention in his confirmation over CFTC handling of a civil matter involving Gemini. Those exchanges, Quintenz said, informed communications to the President and complicated his path to confirmation. How could CFTC authority change under upcoming legislation? The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, moving through Congress, seeks to define which agencies regulate specific crypto assets. If enacted, it would assign sufficiently decentralized assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as “digital commodities,” expanding the CFTC’s remit. The bill aims to resolve overlaps between the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Industry participants and lawmakers expect clearer enforcement boundaries, but the timeline and final text remain subject to Congressional approval. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/quintenz-cftc-nomination-withdrawn-2025-10-01"" }, ""headline"": ""Quintenz Nomination Withdrawn: White House Pulls CFTC Chair Pick"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/01999d19-6036-7101-8ef9-6be738e9f6ad"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Brian Quintenz confirmed the White House withdrew his nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will return to the private sector.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Was Brian Quintenz's nomination to be CFTC chair withdrawn?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Quintenz is a former CFTC commissioner and headed crypto policy at a16z. Politico reported the White House action, and Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal in comments to Cointelegraph. The White House has not released a formal explanation. What are the immediate regulatory implications for crypto firms? With the CFTC lacking a permanent chair, agency priorities may remain stable under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, but long‑term direction depends on future nominees and pending legislation like the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Key Takeaways Nomination status : The White House withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination for CFTC chair; Quintenz will return to the private sector. Industry friction : Private messages between Quintenz and the Winklevoss brothers highlight industry lobbying that may have influenced the process. Regulatory context : The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could expand the CFTC’s authority over BTC and ETH if enacted, making the agency’s leadership decision consequential. Conclusion The withdrawal of Brian Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination leaves the agency without a confirmed leader at a pivotal moment for crypto policy. With the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act advancing in Congress, the choice of a permanent chair will shape enforcement and market clarity.

SEC guidance on crypto custody states the Division of Investment Management will not recommend enforcement action against Registered Advisers or Regulated Funds that treat a state-chartered trust as a “bank” for placement and maintenance of crypto assets, provided the trust is authorized by banking authorities and maintains written policies for custody and private key management. How must advisers verify a state trust to use it as a qualified custodian? Advisers must confirm the state trust is authorized by the relevant banking regulator to provide crypto custody services.

The memorandum clarifies enforcement priorities but leaves the ultimate legal standards of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 intact. Why does this matter for crypto firms and custodians? Opening custody to state-chartered trusts could broaden the pool of qualified custodians beyond national banks. That potentially allows affiliates of crypto-native firms and specialized trust companies to custody assets for registered products when they meet oversight and policy requirements. What conditions did the SEC emphasize in the letter? The SEC emphasized that custodial agreements must ensure segregation of crypto assets, explicit limits on use of funds, documented private key controls, and that the adviser determines the trust arrangement serves client interests.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart praised the letter as added clarity for the digital asset space.

Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity : The SEC letter signals tolerance for state-chartered trust custody when safeguards are present. Adviser responsibility : Registered Advisers must verify authorization, policies, and contractual protections. Non-binding guidance : The letter is interpretive and does not change statutory legal obligations; due diligence remains essential.

The European Systemic Risk Board, tasked with guarding Europe’s financial system, last week passed a recommendation to ban so-called multi-issuance stablecoins, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified while discussing non-public information. While the ESRB’s guidance, approved by a board of central bank governors and EU officials, is not legally binding, it is expected to pressure authorities to either adopt the restrictions or justify how financial stability could be maintained without them. ECB moves to restrict multi-issuance stablecoins Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a specific asset, such as the US dollar, and are typically backed by a corresponding reserve of cash . In the case of the multi-issuance model, Licensed providers that issue tokens in the EU should have a local reserve established in at least one member state, and should also manage reserves for identical Tokens issued outside that member state. The ECB, headed by President Christine Lagarde, who chairs the ESRB’s general board, was a vocal proponent of the proposed ban and secured support from EU officials and regulators to proceed. The ESRB also identified possible alternative mechanisms to safeguard multi-issuance stablecoin arrangements in the EU, which were considered less effective.ESRB and ECB spokespersons declined to comment on the matter. The implications for stablecoin firms already licensed under the multi-issuance model, including Paxos and Circle , remain unclear. Finland’s markets authority, which oversees Paxos, and France’s L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, which oversees Circle, also declined to comment. Both companies operate primarily out of the United States, whose crypto-friendly regulatory environment has raised concerns among European regulators. The bulk of their reserves is invested in dollar-denominated cash and cash-equivalent assets, including short-term US government debt. Circle and Paxos spokespeople declined to comment, though some sources noted the European Commission’s prior support for the multi-issuance approach. ECB raises alarms over dollar-backed stablecoins The ECB has been exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC) tied to the euro since 2021, but awaits a legal framework to proceed. Officials have repeatedly expressed concerns that dollar-backed stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability and monetary sovereignty in the European Union. Lagarde previously warned that foreign holders of a stablecoin could pose “significant legal, operational, liquidity and financial stability risks at the EU level.” In a presentation in April, the ECB stated that reserves held by third-country issuers were likely invested outside the EU in dollar-denominated assets, which would undermine its agenda for a Savings and Investment Union. The Bank of Italy, earlier this month, urged the European Commission to define the legal status of cross-border stablecoins. The ECB doesn’t police the regulations that apply to these assets in the EU. The European Commission has so far avoided adopting an official position on the matter. Judith Arnal, board member at the Bank of Spain, wrote earlier this month that the debate over multi-issuance stablecoins “exposes a deeper challenge for MiCA’s credibility as a global benchmark.” She warned that a regulatory framework disputed between the ECB, the Commission, and the European Parliament “risks sending the wrong signal internationally, namely that MiCA is fragile and subject to diverging interpretations.” The European Commission, a member of the ESRB, did not respond to requests for comment.

Leadership change at Ripple announced Schwartz becomes CTO emeritus and joins the board; Dennis Jarosch will lead engineering. On-chain data showed a ~1.4% XRP price uptick after the announcement (Nansen data). David Schwartz Ripple CTO steps back — official update, XRP market reaction, and next steps; read the full leadership briefing. David Schwartz was one of the chief architects behind the XRP Ledger and is well known by many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. Who is David Schwartz and what did he announce? David Schwartz , a founding engineer of the XRP Ledger , announced he will scale back his day-to-day duties as Ripple CTO at the end of this year and transition to CTO emeritus while joining Ripple’s board of directors. What will change in Ripple’s leadership when David Schwartz steps back? Schwartz will retain an advisory and board role as CTO emeritus , providing institutional knowledge and technical guidance. Senior vice president of engineering Dennis Jarosch will take operational leadership of the engineering team going forward. How did markets react to the announcement? On-chain analytics from Nansen recorded an immediate market response: XRP price rose roughly 1.4% from $2.83 to $2.87 in the hours after the announcement. XRP’s market capitalization remains among the largest in crypto, reflecting steady community interest. Source: David Schwartz Schwartz joined Ripple in 2011 as a cryptographer and became chief technology officer in 2018. In a public post, he said he looks forward to more family time and resuming personal hobbies, while assuring the community he will remain engaged with XRP users and developers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised Schwartz’s contributions, calling him a “true OG in crypto.” The company confirmed internally that Dennis Jarosch will assume leadership of day-to-day engineering operations. Why does this matter for the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s product roadmap? Schwartz’s technical legacy includes core protocol design and long-term architecture work for the XRP Ledger . His move to an emeritus position preserves his influence while enabling new operational leadership to execute near-term engineering milestones. Will Ripple’s strategy or political activity change with this leadership shift? There is no immediate sign of strategic pivot. Ripple continues to participate in regulatory and market initiatives.

According to court records, she admitted two counts under the Proceeds of Crime Act for acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of bitcoin at Southwark Crown Court. Huge Seizure Found In A Hampstead Property Based on reports , police found devices holding about 61,000 BTC during a 2018 search of a hampstead home, a haul now valued at roughly £5 billion (about $6.7 billion). That cache has been described by investigators as one of the biggest single crypto seizures ever. Investigators say the case traces back to an investment scheme run in China between 2014 and 2017. Reports have disclosed that more than 128,000 people were cheated out of money that was later converted into bitcoin. It follows a seven-year ongoing investigation by the Met’s Economic Crime team into international money laundering, which today has seen the leading figure convicted for her crimes. Zhimin Qian, 45 (04.09.1978), of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court on… pic.twitter.com/DYaor97YLH — Politics UK (@PolitlcsUK) September 29, 2025 Qian is accused of moving those proceeds into crypto and then trying to hide them overseas. Company Claims And Alleged Promises According to court filings and reporting, Qian ran a company called Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology, which promised very high returns — figures as large as 300% were used in promotional material — and claimed involvement in mining and other crypto activities. Authorities say investors’ cash was routed into exchanges and swapped for bitcoin. Charges And Legal Steps Underway The Metropolitan Police say Qian was charged after a long, cross-border probe and has been remanded in custody ahead of sentencing and further recovery hearings. Civil recovery steps are also under way to try to return assets to victims. The police listed offences of acquiring and possessing criminal property in their statement about the case. Assistant Convicted And Overseas Links Reports note that an associate, “Jian Wen”, was earlier convicted in relation to parts of the scheme and received a prison term of almost seven years for laundering some of the proceeds. Authorities also say properties tied to the investigation were seized abroad, including in Dubai, as investigators followed funds around the world. What Comes Next Sentencing dates have not yet been set and Qian remains in custody. Court testimony and evidence presented in London are expected to include material from overseas agencies and witnesses, with victims in China due to give accounts remotely. The case is likely to be used as an example of how law enforcement can track and seize large crypto holdings across borders.

By enabling interoperability between two of the most influential payment ecosystems, Ripple is positioning XRP as a key player in the future of international money movement. Could XRP Become A Standard For Settlement? The strategy for mainstream adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its native asset, XRP, is intricately linked to the Interledger Protocol (ILP). As highlighted by researcher SMQKE on X, Ripple’s approach is to become an essential part of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network, providing an interoperable layer that seamlessly bridges the old and new financial worlds. Related Reading: Pundit Claims That Ripple Is Building The Banking System Right On The Blockchain Using XRP This Interledger Protocol is designed to synchronize separate ledgers without forming a new one, while acting as a connective tissue across financial systems. In many ways, it mirrors SWIFT’s own structure, where the successful processing of a payment message creates binding obligations to pay between nodes and intermediaries. However, ILP is Ripple’s core strategy for mainstream adoption of the XRP Ledger. By making ILP fully compatible with SWIFT, Ripple ensures that both XRP and its technology can plug into the world’s most dominant payment network. What’s important about this move is the fact that Ripple itself is now often described as evolving into the Interledger Protocol initiative. Ripple understood that the world would never standardize on a single ledger, which is why it built ILP to enable interoperability to bridge across multiple systems. Meanwhile, this approach is reinforced through the ISO 20022 adoption to ensure that the entire transaction is secure, seamless, and scalable, offering a superior settlement experience that coexists with the bank’s existing messaging connectivity across the global financial infrastructure. “The strategy is clear: one protocol (ILP), unlimited networks, and seamless XRP movement,” SMQKE noted. The Promise Of Financial Freedom With XRP As the crypto landscape expands, XRP has been hailed as an asset that could offer financial breakthroughs. The sentiment expressed by Traveler2236 points to a profound vision of global financial inclusion and the end of economic inequality enforced by legacy systems. His core claim is that there will come a day when XRP will unleash dreams beyond imagination. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors That This Is Happening Right Now – Time To Pay Attention? Also, there will be no denials because of a credit score, and no more doors closed because your income doesn’t match some arbitrary outcome. Traveler2236’s statement is not merely a prediction, but a declaration of certainty, bordering on a personal epiphany. “This isn’t a dream anymore, it’s happening right now,” the expert stated.

The new product aims to help businesses take advantage of artificial intelligence and stablecoins to grow their revenue. Open Issuance also empowers businesses to create, mint, and redeem their own stablecoins using a few lines of code and new solutions for agentic commerce. Stripe revealed that the updates were part of Stripe Tour New York, where it launched over 40 new products and features. Stripe focuses on channeling opportunities in AI Introducing Open Issuance from Bridge ( @stablecoin ). Launch and manage your own stablecoin—with just a few lines of code. https://t.co/lX1VYHmuER pic.twitter.com/87WNy8WXcU — Stripe (@stripe) September 30, 2025 Will Gaybrick, Stipe’s president of technology and business, said the company’s role in stablecoins and AI is to bring frontier technology out of the experimental and into the mainstream. He added that Stripe is focused on capitalizing on the numerous opportunities in AI and stablecoins, which have seen a 57% surge in total supply over the last 12 months. Stripe revealed that treasuries on the new platform are managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Superstate, while Lead Bank holds cash to provide liquidity. According to the announcement, all new tokens will be fully interoperable with any others issued via Open Issuance. The company added that Bridge’s orchestration API comes with low-cost conversions to virtually any other stablecoin. Stripe also acknowledged that businesses can generate rewards for stablecoins they create on their platform. Users can also use earnings from the rewards to incentivize their customers. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don’t build on top of someone else’s coin. With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” – Zach Abrams , Co-Founder and CEO of Bridge. Phantom has designed the first stablecoin issued via Open Issuance called CASH. Stripe also revealed that mUSD for MetaMask and USDH, built by Native Markets for Hyperliquid, will also be issued on top of the new platform. Stripe has announced that its Optimized Checkout Suite will now accept stablecoin payments by default, aiming to help businesses easily accept recurring stablecoin payments. Businesses can also hold stablecoin balances, convert between fiat currencies, spend stablecoin balances with a locally issued card, and send stablecoins to crypto wallets cross-border. Stripe integrates the Agentic Commerce Protocol https://t.co/n3bvdBBdEz — Stripe (@stripe) September 30, 2025 On September 29, Stripe also partnered with OpenAI and launched the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). The product already powers the new Instant Checkout in ChatGPT. ACP maintains a shared language between merchants and AI agents, allowing merchants to sell through AI agents with a single integration while retaining control over their business. Businesses that don’t process payments with Stripe can also adopt ACP due to its open standard feature, which allows it to work across AI agents. Stripe is currently testing ACP’s solutions in real-world settings with the help of Microsoft Copilot, Anthropix, Perplexity, Vercel, Lovable, Replit, and Manus to help businesses get ready for agentic commerce. Stripe also introduced Stripe Billing to help businesses run hybrid revenue models that combine subscriptions with usage-based pricing. The new product will feature a new API that enables businesses to connect with LLM providers and track inference cost changes in real-time. Stripe unveiled a new app-to-web payments flow to help businesses seamlessly redirect customers from their iOS app to a mobile checkout page powered by Stripe Checkout. The company also launched Link, a wallet that now supports Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services with Klarna. Stripe said it manages global taxes through Stripe Tax, which supports tax collection in 102 countries. The firm also revealed that it manages fraud prevention with Stripe Radar, which is expanding to block fraud types, such as the abuse of free trial periods.

Over $10B in ETH shorts at risk near $4,359 Whale buys (Bitmine ~234,846 ETH) and fading bearish indicators suggest weakening downtrend. Key technicals: RSI ~45 (neutral), DMI shows declining –DI; 20/50 EMAs act as immediate resistance. Ethereum short squeeze: ETH shorts >$10B near $4,359; monitor funding rates, whale flows, and key EMA breaks for a potential breakout — read now. Is Ethereum about to trigger a short squeeze? Ethereum short squeeze probability has increased as a large pool of leveraged short positions sits vulnerable near the $4,359 level. Reduced bearish momentum, negative funding rates and significant whale accumulation raise the odds of a cascade of liquidations if buyers sustain upward pressure. What evidence shows traders may be ignoring bullish signs? Funding rates stayed negative last week, indicating persistent short-side conviction. Meanwhile, on-chain monitoring platforms reported elevated whale purchases and large exchange outflows. Bitmine’s reported purchase of 234,846 ETH (approx. $963M) enlarged a top holder’s supply, signaling accumulation by smart money despite public pessimism. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/eth-short-squeeze-analysis-2025-09"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum Shorts Top $10B — Is a Short Squeeze Imminent?"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/M0C6k1Dj_58eb1cbaf69dc8df7004dc58f9cdf854d5108488efe29e619d494ed0f36217b5.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T06:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Ethereum short squeeze risk rises as more than $10 billion in ETH shorts face liquidation pressure near $4,359 amid whale accumulation and fading bearish indicators.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much in ETH shorts is at risk?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Over $10 billion in open ETH short positions are vulnerable to liquidation if price pushes toward the $4,359 zone, based on on-chain derivatives data and exchange open interest snapshots."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain signs indicate a potential squeeze?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key signs include large whale buys, exchange outflows, negative funding rates consistent with heavy shorting, and concentrated stop levels near $4,300–$4,400."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor a possible Ethereum short squeeze"", ""description"": ""Practical steps to track indicators that could trigger an ETH short squeeze."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track funding rates"", ""text"": ""Monitor perpetual swap funding rates for spikes from negative to less-negative or positive, which signal increasing buyer pressure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch whale flows"", ""text"": ""Follow large on-chain transfers and exchange outflows indicating accumulation by large holders."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor technical levels"", ""text"": ""Observe price reaction at the 20- and 50-day EMAs and key resistance around $4,300–$4,400 for potential liquidation cascades."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions What triggers a short squeeze in Ethereum? A short squeeze is triggered when price rises quickly, forcing leveraged short positions to cover (buy) to close losses. In ETH’s case, clustered stops and high open interest near $4,359 could create cascading liquidations and sharp upside moves. How should traders manage risk around a potential squeeze? Use defined position sizes, set protective stops below key support, avoid heavy leverage, and monitor funding rates and whale activity to reduce unexpected liquidation risk during volatile moves. Key Takeaways Large short exposure : Over $10B in ETH shorts creates vulnerability near $4,359. Smart money accumulation : Significant whale buys and exchange outflows suggest accumulation by large holders. Technical setup : RSI at neutral, fading –DI on DMI, and price near 20/50 EMAs — breakout depends on sustained buying pressure. Market snapshot and technical context At press time, Ethereum traded around $4,173 after a modest rebound. RSI sat near 45, indicating neutral momentum. The DMI showed declining bearish strength as the –DI began to flatten against the +DI. Price action remains capped by the 20 and 50-day EMAs, which now serve as critical decision points for bulls and bears. Funding rates remained negative through last week, reflecting a dominant short bias — a condition that historically precedes squeeze dynamics when buyers step in. On-chain analytics providers and derivatives aggregators (reported by CryptoQuant and exchange interest trackers) show concentrated leverage levels and clustered short positions in the $4,300–$4,400 band. Whale activity further supports the thesis. Bitmine’s reported purchase of roughly 234,846 ETH (reported value ~ $963M) increased top-holder balances, suggesting accumulation by entities prepared to hold through volatility. Source mentions: CryptoQuant, TradingView, X (all cited as plain text, no external links). Ethereum [ETH] might be on the edge of something big, and short sellers are sweating. Over $10 billion worth of ETH shorts are now hanging by a thread. If price breaks toward the $4,359 mark, it could spark a liquidation cascade that sends ETH flying. The recent downtrend looks like it’s losing steam, and bullish momentum is rising. Where do we go from here? Fear in the air, but ETH is unfazed Despite the gloom in the market, Ethereum’s starting to push higher, and that’s no coincidence. Funding Rates stayed negative throughout last week, meaning traders were paying to stay short. That kind of bearish sentiment often shows up right before a reversal. Source: Cryptoquant And it’s not just the charts, whales are moving too. Just yesterday, Bitmine bought a jaw-dropping 234,846 ETH (worth $963 million), bringing their total stash to over $10.8 billion. Source: X $10B in shorts and they’re on thin ice When a market is heavily shorted and whales begin to accumulate, open interest concentrated at clear levels becomes the fuel for a rapid squeeze. If ETH breaches the $4,300–$4,400 zone, stop-losses and liquidations could force short covering that exacerbates upside momentum. Waning bearish pressure Ethereum’s intraday price action hovered below the 20- and 50-day EMAs, which act as resistance and short-term trend gauges. A decisive close above these EMAs with increased volume would be a technical signal confirming buyers are taking control. Source: TradingView Conclusion Ethereum’s setup — concentrated short interest, negative funding rates, rising whale accumulation and weakening bearish momentum — increases the chance of a short squeeze if buyers sustain a march toward $4,359. Traders should monitor funding rates, exchange flows and EMA breaks for actionable confirmation.

Tether has increased its Bitcoin reserves to nearly $10 billion, marking a major investment move while expanding USDT’s supply to $175 billion. What happened to Tether’s Bitcoin reserves? Tether Bitcoin reserves rose after the company added roughly 8,889 BTC (~$1 billion), bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to about $9.79 billion. The purchase was recorded in a transfer from Bitfinex and is consistent with Tether’s pattern of quarter-end reserve top-ups ahead of attestations. How much Bitcoin did Tether add and why did it matter? Tether executed an 8,889 BTC transfer, valued near $1 billion at the time of the transaction. Arkham Intelligence flagged the move, which follows similar buys in September 2024, December 2024 and March 2025. Analysts say these buys strengthen liquidity and balance-sheet metrics before quarterly attestations. How is USDT supply changing and what does that indicate? USDT circulation increased by about 10.7% over three months to roughly $174.6 billion, according to market data providers. This rise highlights stronger demand for dollar-pegged liquidity across crypto trading and custody services and underscores USDT’s dominant market position among stablecoins. Did Tether sell BTC recently and what does that show? Tether previously sold $1.4 billion in Bitcoin to Twenty One Capital as part of separate treasury actions.

Author: COINOTAG What does Bitcoin’s taker buy volume decline mean? Bitcoin’s taker buy volume decline means frontline buyer activity is shrinking, indicating reduced market conviction and higher vulnerability to price drops. When taker buy volume falls while sell-side metrics rise, momentum often shifts from bullish to neutral or bearish within weeks. How significant is the recent taker buy volume drop? CryptoQuant data shows ten consecutive months of falling taker buy volume, reaching early‑2024 lows. This sustained decline is notable because it measures aggressive buy-side execution; prolonged weakness here historically precedes momentum shifts. Exchanges like Binance exhibited the sharpest declines, highlighting concentrated trader caution. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin taker buy volume hits 2024 lows as sharks and retail sell"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/taker-volume.jpeg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-XXT09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-XXT12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-taker-buy-volume-analysis"" }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin taker buy volume drops to 2024 lows, signaling weak demand—seller cohorts and SOPR analysis show rising pressure and possible range-bound action between $111K and $114K.""} Why is SOPR relevant to Bitcoin selling pressure? SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicates whether spent coins are being sold at profit or loss; a SOPR persistently below 1 shows sellers are realizing losses or not achieving breakeven, which often aligns with selling pressure. Analyst Axel Adler notes SOPR has failed to clear 1 recently, a bearish confirmation of weak buyer follow-through. Who is selling Bitcoin now? On-chain cohort analysis shows elevated selling from mid‑sized ‘sharks’ and retail holders. Checkonchain metrics report a Sharks to Exchange Balance Change of +109k BTC (net deposits), while retail holder balances trended negative through September. Smaller wallet cohorts—Fish (-7.9k BTC), Crabs (-3.9k BTC), Shrimps (-1.7k BTC)—also recorded outflows at press time. Source: CryptoQuant At the time of writing, BTC traded near $113,541 after a 1.16% 24‑hour gain. Despite the short rebound, the demand side remains fragile and the recent upward move faces headwinds from low taker buy volume and active sellers. How are wallet cohorts affecting short‑term price action? Wallet cohort flows influence supply on exchanges. Sharks’ net deposits increase available supply for market sales. Retail negative balance change suggests small‑holder selling or reduced accumulation. Together, these flows increase immediate sell liquidity and pressure price support levels. Source: CryptoQuant What are the likely price scenarios for BTC? Two outcomes are most plausible based on current on‑chain signals: Downside scenario: Intensifying seller activity could push BTC below recent support toward $111,054, confirming a short-term reversal. Range-bound scenario: If selling and low buying pressure persist in balance, BTC may range between $111K and $114K until a clear catalyst emerges. What would confirm a sustained uptrend? Buyers must reassert control by driving a decisive breakout above $114K and securing daily closes near $115K. Sustained increases in taker buy volume and SOPR above 1 would signal renewed demand and reduce downside risk. Source: Checkonchain Source: Checkonchain Frequently Asked Questions How long can low taker buy volume persist? Low taker buy volume can persist for months, especially during consolidation or when macro sentiment is neutral. Ten consecutive months of decline suggests structural caution among aggressive buyers rather than a short-lived blip. Does a SOPR below 1 always mean price will fall? No. SOPR below 1 signals coins sold on average at a loss, which often accompanies capitulation or distribution. It is a bearish indicator but must be assessed alongside volume, exchange flows, and macro conditions. Which wallet cohorts should traders watch? Monitor sharks, whales, and retail cohorts.

Prediction markets currently assign a 91%–95% chance of U.S. Cardano spot ETF approval, with dates tentatively set for late October 2025.

Bulls believe institutional access could mirror BTC/ETH’s ETF strategy by increasing liquidity and expanding demand. However, options activity remains subdued, and recent long liquidations suggest traders are cautious about chasing gains before a clear breakout. If ADA closes above $0.85, potential upward targets are $0.87 (Fib 0.382) and $0.90 (Fib 0.5). Cardano (ADA) Key Levels: $0.78 Support, Then $0.75 and $0.71 The Cardano (ADA) near-term structure is a range between $0.78 and $0.83 after a pullback from highs near $0.95. Momentum has improved from oversold levels, but Parabolic SAR remains above the price, and the trend hasn’t fully flipped. Immediate support is at $0.78, with deeper liquidity pockets at $0.75 and $0.71; a failure there exposes $0.68 as the last major defense. Analysts also point out a developing death-cross risk on lower timeframes, implying rallies could fade without new catalysts. Macro factors remain influential: tighter financial conditions or a Bitcoin retrace can reduce altcoin bids, capping ADA under resistance even if ETF headlines stay strong.

Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview The 2026 Bear Case: Why Sub-$0.30 Isn’t Impossible Beyond the next few weeks, some strategists warn of a path where ADA may revisit sub-$0.30 in 2026. The reasoning: at a roughly $34B market cap near $0.80, multiples might shrink unless usage growth significantly accelerates. While Cardano promotes research-driven upgrades (Ouroboros Leios, the Omega roadmap) and has an eight-year record with no downtime, critics point to slow app adoption, capital shifting to newer ecosystems, and ETF attention potentially directing flows into a few large caps. If global liquidity tightens, ETFs underperform, or structural demand weakens, a prolonged cycle could push ADA toward value zones below $0.30, where longer-term buyers might enter.

This means that any officially approved or licensed trust company can hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether in the same way they hold hard cash or other assets. The American financial watchdog disclosed the update in a letter sent to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a law firm that reached out to the SEC, seeking clarification. SEC supports state-trusts as crypto custodians The Securities and Exchange Commission stated in the letter that trust companies may be treated as “banks.” The approach works under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. State-chartered trust companies are now eligible to hold crypto assets on behalf of their clients. The SEC shared the letter and analysis on its website. The agency wrote, “…any Registered Adviser that has custody of client funds or securities maintain those funds and securities with a qualified custodian, where “qualified custodian” is defined to include “a bank as defined in Section 202(a)(2) of the Advisers Act.” The SEC letter is classified as a no-action letter, meaning that the agency will not take enforcement action if advisers or funds use state trust companies to hold crypto assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis posted on X and said that she is “encouraged to see @SECGov recognizing state-chartered trust companies as qualified digital asset custodians.” She reminded people of how Wyoming paved the way for this decision when it issued a no-action relief in 2020 and was criticized back then by SEC employees. She said, “They finally recognized the rigor & value of WY’s digital asset supervision.” Brian Daly, Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, told Eleanor Terrett that, “This additional clarity was needed because state-chartered trust companies were not universally seen as eligible custodians for crypto assets.” Daly explained that the letter to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is a staff letter. He said the topic could be brought up in future rulemaking, but for now, it works and provides clear guidance for today’s products and managers. The decision taken by the SEC staff is a turning point, especially after the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department restricted how banks and regulated entities could work with crypto firms in what is known as Operation Choke Point 2.0.

52500943,593641,1759287635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52500943.jpeg,Stablecoin Crackdown: European Central Bank Gathers Backing For Joint Issuance Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-crackdown-ecb-joint-issuance-ban/,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is reportedly gaining traction in its pursuit of a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins across the European Union (EU). This move comes in light of recommendations from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is tasked with safeguarding Europe’s financial integrity. Multi-Issuance Stablecoins Under Fire Last week, the ESRB approved a recommendation that advocates for a prohibition on multi-issuance stablecoins. Sources familiar with the discussions, told Bloomberg that this guidance was sanctioned by a board comprising central bank governors and EU officials. Under the multi-issuance model, licensed providers in the EU are required to hold local reserves in at least one member state while simultaneously managing reserves for identical tokens issued abroad . The ECB, under the leadership of President Christine Lagarde, has been a vocal advocate for the proposed ban, stressing the need for clearer safeguards around the operation of such stablecoins within the European Union. The implications for existing stablecoin companies, such as Paxos and Circle (CRCL) , which are already licensed to operate under the multi-issuance framework, remain uncertain. Growing Concerns Over Financial Stability Both Paxos and Circle primarily operate out of the US, known for its crypto-friendly regulations under President Donald Trump’s vision of transforming America as the “crypto capital of the world”, which has raised concerns among some European regulators. Concerns have been repeatedly voiced by ECB officials regarding the potential risks posed by these dollar-pegged stablecoins to both financial stability and monetary sovereignty in Europe. Lagarde has previously warned that foreign holders of stablecoins may create significant “legal and operational risks” for European Union-based issuers, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity. Despite this, the European Central Bank does not have direct authority over the implementation of regulations governing digital assets in the EU. The European Commission has yet to adopt an official stance on the matter. Judith Arnal, a board member at the Bank of Spain and an associate senior research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies, highlighted in a recent paper that the ongoing debate over multi-issuance stablecoins poses a more profound challenge to the credibility of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. She cautioned that a regulatory landscape characterized by disputes among the ECB, the Commission, and the European Parliament could send a troubling message internationally, suggesting that MiCA may be fragile and open to varying interpretations. In conjunction with these developments, the ECB has been working since 2021 to establish a central bank digital currency (CBDC) tied to the euro, although it is still waiting for the necessary legal framework to move forward.

Neutral Fear & Greed readings and volatile social sentiment suggest ETH remains range-bound until conviction swings decisively toward optimism or caution. Psychology drives short-term ETH moves Neutral Fear & Greed readings (around 40–50) signal indecision, not immediate reversal. Social dominance spikes and weighted sentiment swings align with range-bound trading and abrupt breakouts. Ethereum sentiment, neutral amid volatility — monitor Fear & Greed and social metrics to time positions. Read the analysis and act with conviction. What is Ethereum sentiment and why does it matter? Ethereum sentiment is the market’s collective mood, measured by indicators like the Fear & Greed Index and social-weighted sentiment. It matters because shifts in sentiment can trigger rapid price moves, often amplifying or reversing trends independent of on-chain fundamentals. How has investor psychology affected Ethereum historically? Past cycles — notably the 2017 ICO frenzy — show that fear of missing out (FOMO) and herd behavior can push ETH far beyond fundamentals, then reverse quickly under regulatory or macro pressure. Historical price spikes and crashes consistently correlate with extreme sentiment readings. Key Takeaways What role does psychology play in Ethereum’s market cycles? Past ETH rallies and crashes—like the 2017 ICO boom—show that fear, greed, and herd behavior can drive price action as much as, if not more than, fundamentals or upgrades. What does today’s sentiment reveal about Ethereum’s direction? With the Fear & Greed Index at a neutral 49 and social sentiment swinging, ETH’s sideways trading reflects indecision. Since its inception, Ethereum’s performance has been shaped not only by fundamentals but also by investor psychology, with market sentiment amplifying both rallies and declines. Historical cycles reveal how fear, greed, and herd behavior can move ETH just as strongly as upgrades or demand shifts. Recent charts emphasize this psychological influence, highlighting neutral fear and greed signals, fluctuating sentiment, and social dominance trends. These dynamics suggest that Ethereum’s price trajectory is often as much about collective belief as it is about underlying technology or adoption. Does psychology trump fundamentals? Ethereum’s meteoric rise during the 2017 ICO boom demonstrates psychology’s dominance in market behavior. The chart shows ETH rallying from under $100 to over $400 in a matter of weeks, reflecting the frenzy surrounding token launches. Source: TradingView Retail investors piled in, driven by the fear of missing out rather than utility or adoption metrics. This rapid climb illustrates how psychological triggers can fuel unsustainable surges. However, once regulatory scrutiny increased and doubt replaced optimism, panic selling intensified the downturn, showing how quickly sentiment can reverse fortunes for Ethereum. Fear, Greed, and Ethereum The Fear and Greed Index was 43 at press time, a perfectly neutral reading that reflected indecision in the market. This midpoint highlights how investors remain cautious despite Ethereum’s recent gains. Neutral sentiment often signals a potential tipping point, where renewed optimism could ignite rallies or lingering doubt could spark pullbacks. The lack of extreme fear or greed provides a stabilizing effect, limiting wild swings in either direction. Traders closely watching this balance may interpret neutrality as an opportunity to reassess positioning rather than chase volatility-driven moves. Ethereum’s sentiment mirrors its sideways trading Ethereum’s Social Dominance and Weighted Sentiment have been swinging sharply — these fluctuations align with ETH’s recent sideways trading pattern. The charts showed how bursts of optimism briefly pushed Ethereum higher, only for equally strong negative waves to cap those gains, leaving the price range-bound. Source: Santiment This tug of war between bullish narratives and bearish caution mirrors the broader indecision in the market. As ETH consolidates without a clear direction, sentiment acts as both a driver and a reflection of uncertainty, reinforcing how psychology sustains the current stalemate. Can psychology dictate Ethereum’s next move? Ethereum’s history and present both highlight that market psychology is as critical as fundamentals in shaping price action. The ICO boom proved euphoria can fuel massive rallies, while today’s sentiment data shows mixed emotions are sustaining ETH’s sideways trade. Neutral fear and greed readings combined with volatile social sentiment point to an undecided crowd. In this environment, Ethereum’s next decisive move will depend on whether conviction shifts toward optimism or caution, making psychology the key force to unlock direction. Frequently Asked Questions How do I read the Fear & Greed Index for Ethereum? Readings near 0–25 indicate extreme fear; 26–49 is fearful to neutral; 50–74 is greed; 75–100 is extreme greed. Use neutrality (40–60) as a sign to reassess risk rather than chase momentum. What social metrics matter for ETH price action? Social Dominance, Weighted Sentiment and mentions volume reveal crowd conviction. Sharp spikes often precede volatile, range-extending moves or short-lived breakouts. Can on-chain metrics override sentiment? Strong on-chain trends (e.g., sustained growth in active addresses or fees) can anchor sentiment, but short-term price moves are frequently sentiment-driven. Key Takeaways Sentiment rules short-term: Psychological swings often amplify or reverse ETH trends. Neutral readings ≠ stability: Midpoint Fear & Greed values reflect indecision and potential for sudden moves. Monitor social metrics: Use Social Dominance and Weighted Sentiment to anticipate breakouts or capitulation. Conclusion Ethereum’s price behavior is a mix of fundamentals and collective psychology.

Leverage-driven risk: Open Interest > $80B creates vulnerability to cascades. Key levels matter: flipping $112,000 into a higher-low and holding above $108,650 signals bull control.

What is causing Bitcoin to risk looping lower? Bitcoin is facing a loop-lower risk because stacked leverage across futures and options leaves thin bid support that can trigger liquidation cascades. CoinGlass data shows $330M+ liquidations in the most recent session, while Open Interest has risen back above $80 billion, maintaining elevated volatility. How does stacked leverage create a leverage trap for Bitcoin? Stacked leverage concentrates stop-loss orders and margin calls around narrow price bands. When a clustered liquidation occurs, it can cascade: forced liquidations push price further, triggering more stops.

CoinGlass reported over $330 million liquidated in the latest session, with 53% from shorts, indicating short squeezes have been recurring. That compares with a $2 billion long squeeze reported earlier last week (plain text reference). This rotation of squeezes keeps both sides vulnerable and amplifies volatility. Bitcoin’s Open Interest climbing back above $80 billion signals larger notional exposure across derivatives markets. With bids thin, even modest directional moves can trigger outsized liquidation events. Source: CoinGlass How can bulls reclaim market control for Bitcoin? Bulls need a clear structural higher-low and absorption of leverage. Technically, flipping $112,000 into a higher-low base and holding above $108,650 on multi-hour closes would give bulls footing to rebuild momentum into Q4. Without those levels holding, the leverage setup increases the chance of a renewed downside loop. What do on-chain and exchange metrics say? Glassnode shows concentrated short exposure around $110k–$111k over the weekend of September 28. Meanwhile, exchange metrics (plain text reference: Binance Long/Short Ratio) sit near 50:50, reflecting indecision and equal pressure on both sides. TradingView price plots show the lower wicks testing $112k during the latest sessions. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Frequently Asked Questions Is a breakdown under $108,650 likely to trigger a large sell-off? A breakdown under $108,650 would increase the probability of cascading liquidations because it sits near proposed higher-low support; with elevated Open Interest, downside momentum could accelerate without a robust bid wall. What should traders watch this week? Watch multi-hour closes around $112,000 and $108,650, monitor Open Interest and liquidation reports from CoinGlass and Glassnode (plain text references), and track exchange Long/Short ratios for shifts in market bias. Key Takeaways Leverage risk: Open Interest > $80B and stacked exposures raise liquidation risk. Critical price levels: Flip $112,000 to a higher-low and defend $108,650 to sustain a bullish thesis. Actionable insight: Use position sizing and stops outside common liquidation clusters; map short clusters near $110k–$111k. Conclusion Bitcoin remains at a pivotal inflection ahead of Q4: stacked leverage and thin bids keep the market vulnerable to looping lower, while a successful flip of $112,000 into a higher-low and holds above $108,650 would give bulls a pathway to rebuild momentum. Monitor derivatives exposure and on-chain liquidation data closely for trade-ready signals. $80B and recent liquidations.

Schwartz, who helped code the XRP ledger, said in a post on X that he wanted to spend more time with his family and return to hobbies he had long set aside. “But be warned, I’m not going away from the XRP community. You haven’t seen the last of me (now, or ever),” he wrote. Although leaving his executive role, Schwartz will remain involved with Ripple. He will take a seat on the company’s board of directors and serve as CTO Emeritus, a position that will allow him to stay connected while pursuing personal projects. As happens in one’s life, I’ve been taking stock of my last 40 years. It’s been a wild ride. I’ve gone from consulting for the NSA to watching the early stages of Bitcoin. Then, I met Arthur, Jed, and Chris and worked on coding the XRP Ledger. Now, I’ve spent more than 13 years… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 30, 2025 Ripple CEO Welcomes Schwartz’s Continued Role On Board He explained that in recent months, he has been running his own XRPL node, publishing data and exploring new use cases for XRP outside Ripple’s core business. He added he looked forward to spending more time coding, talking to developers and experimenting with applications that go beyond payments. “I’ll still be in and out of the Ripple office as CTO Emeritus, and as my last task at Ripple, Chris asked me to join Ripple’s Board of Directors to continue supporting the company’s mission and long-term vision…and I accept,” he said. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised Schwartz in his own post , calling him a “true OG in crypto with the conviction and vision to see what others couldn’t.” He added that their regular check-ins would continue and showed relief that Schwartz would remain close as part of the board. Court Settlement Ends Shadow Of SEC’s $1.3B Lawsuit Schwartz’s departure marks the end of a chapter at Ripple. He worked closely with CEO Brad Garlinghouse during the company’s long legal battle with US regulators. The SEC had sued Ripple in 2020, claiming it raised US$1.3 billion by selling XRP as an unregistered security. That lawsuit weighed heavily on Ripple. It also shaped debate across the digital asset market about how cryptocurrencies should be regulated. After years of hearings and appeals, the case finally ended in Aug. 2025 . A court approved a settlement between Ripple and the SEC, which many viewed as a milestone for the industry. Now, as Schwartz prepares to scale back, Ripple is looking ahead. The company is positioning itself for a post-litigation era with more regulatory clarity. At the same time, his continued role on the board signals that Ripple still values his technical expertise, even as he steps away from daily operations. XRP traded 1.5% lower on Tuesday at $2.84, bringing its losses over the past week to 6.5%.

This guidance expands qualified custody options for client crypto assets while requiring protective procedures. SEC confirms state trust companies can act as crypto custodians when advisers follow specific safeguards. Relief is a limited, staff-level no-action assurance pending formal rule changes to custody requirements. Regulatory debate continues: some policymakers praise the step, while others call for formal rulemaking. state trust companies crypto custody — SEC staff allows advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as crypto custodians; review safeguards and act accordingly. state trust companies as crypto custodians : The SEC’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action assurance saying it will not recommend enforcement action if registered advisers use state trust companies to custody crypto, provided advisers meet due-diligence and safeguards requirements and act in clients’ best interest. What are state trust companies as crypto custodians? State trust companies as crypto custodians are state-chartered entities permitted to hold and safeguard digital asset private keys and related custody infrastructure for registered advisers and regulated funds. The SEC staff’s no-action assurance allows advisers to use these entities if they implement written procedures and perform client-focused due diligence. How can advisers use state trust companies to custody cryptocurrency? Advisers may rely on state trust companies when they determine, after due diligence, that using such an entity is in clients’ best interests. The SEC staff conditionally limited enforcement recommendations to cases where the trust company maintains custody safeguards, the adviser documents oversight, and fund managers meet custody provisions of the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act. The Division’s letter frames this as an “interim step to a longer-term modernization of our custody requirements,” according to Division of Investment Management director Brian Daly. The staff emphasized procedures designed to safeguard crypto and criteria for adviser oversight. Law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett requested assurances from the SEC that state trust companies could custody cryptocurrency assets. Source: SEC Why did the SEC issue this no-action assurance? The staff relief responds to industry requests for clarity about acceptable custodians for crypto assets, reducing uncertainty for registered advisers and regulated funds. It signals an intent to broaden custody options while the SEC considers formal rule changes under its regulatory flex agenda. The current statutory regime requires client assets to be held by qualified custodians. The staff letter indicates proposed rule amendments are forthcoming to modernize custody rules for digital assets. Who supports or opposes the change? Supporters note the guidance provides practical clarity. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said it ends a “guessing game” and could benefit advisory clients and fund shareholders. Market analysts and some industry participants said the move will expand custody capacity and help adoption. Critics, including Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, argued the staff should not make changes through no-action letters and that formal rulemaking with public comment is necessary to preserve statutory protections and fairness among applicants for national charters. Public reaction included comments from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and observers on social media platforms (formerly Twitter). Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also expressed encouragement, citing state-level actions beginning in 2020.

Yes. The staff indicated coverage extends to client crypto assets held by registered advisers and crypto asset investments of regulated funds that are subject to custody provisions, including tokenized securities. Will this immediately create more custodians? Potentially. By expanding viable custody entities, the assurance may encourage state trust companies to offer custody services. Market participants expect an increase in qualified custodial options over time. Key Takeaways Staff-level relief: The SEC Division of Investment Management will not recommend enforcement action when advisers use state trust companies with proper safeguards. Conditions apply: Advisers must document due diligence, oversight, and that custody choices are in clients’ best interest. Rulemaking likely: The assurance is an interim step while the SEC considers formal custody rule modernization through proposed amendments. Conclusion This staff no-action assurance clarifies that state trust companies can serve as crypto custodians for registered advisers when appropriate safeguards and documented oversight are in place. The move expands custody options now and sets the stage for formal rule updates; advisers should review policies and prepare for forthcoming regulatory changes. Publication date: 2025-10-07.

Stay informed with COINOTAG. What caused the Tron Inc. stock plunge? Tron Inc. stock plunge was driven by a combination of hype-driven valuation inflation, rushed public listings and growing regulatory scrutiny. The Nasdaq-listed company’s shares fell 85% from the June 20 peak, as investors digested execution concerns and investigations tied to suspicious pre-announcement trading across the sector. How have experts and data described the broader crypto treasury sell-off? Research heads and trading founders point to three main factors: Hype cycle deflation: Analysts say early speculative gains often reverse as market participants reprice fundamentals. Poor execution and fast IPOs: Industry participants note firms rushed to market without mature treasury strategies. Regulatory pressure: Ongoing inquiries into pre-announcement trading and market activity have increased risk premia. Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Research, described the pattern as “the hype is deflating.” Czhang Lin, head of LBank Labs, added that “many firms in the space are navigating similar headwinds.” Stephen Gregory, founder of trading platform Vtrader, cited “bad execution” and rushed market entries as drivers of the sell-off. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/tron-inc-stock-plunge"" }, ""headline"": ""Tron Inc. stock plunge: 85% collapse signals crypto treasury hype cooling"", ""description"": ""Tron Inc. stock plunge: 85% decline since June peak reflects cooling crypto treasury hype, execution issues and regulatory scrutiny according to market experts."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": """" } }, ""articleSection"": ""Crypto News"", ""keywords"": ""Tron Inc. stock plunge, crypto treasury companies, TRX price""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess risk in a crypto treasury company after a market drop"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step assessment for investors to evaluate crypto treasury companies following steep share price declines."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review treasury structure"", ""text"": ""Check the composition of on‑balance crypto holdings, lockup terms and diversification across assets."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify disclosure quality"", ""text"": ""Assess the clarity and frequency of company disclosures and whether token movements and issuance are fully explained."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor regulatory developments"", ""text"": ""Track investigations, enforcement actions and statements from securities regulators that affect market access and valuation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare peer performance"", ""text"": ""Benchmark against similar treasury companies to separate company-specific execution issues from sector-wide trends."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How big was Tron Inc.'s decline and over what period?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Tron Inc. is down about 85% from its June 20 peak of $12.80, with a 55% drop recorded in September alone."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are other crypto treasury companies experiencing similar losses?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Investors repriced valuations after several corporate listings and token events revealed weak execution and opaque token-handling practices. Market participants tightened expectations following reports of suspicious trading activity ahead of announcements and the rapid public-market entries of multiple crypto treasury firms. Comparative data indicates this is not isolated: MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Bitmine Immersion Technologies showed material share price declines, underscoring a sector-wide reassessment of treasury-linked equities. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the September sell-off for Tron Inc.? Tron Inc. experienced a 55% share price decline in September alone, forming the steep segment of a broader 85% drop since the June peak of $12.80. Did token movements by advisers affect market confidence? Yes. Justin Sun’s reported post-token generation actions—claiming 600 million WLFI tokens and moving 9 million to an exchange—prompted token freezes and harmed confidence, illustrating how token mechanics and advisor actions can influence investor sentiment. Key Takeaways Primary takeaway : Tron Inc. stock plunge reflects cooling hype and operational risks in crypto treasury listings. Regulatory impact : Investigations into pre-announcement trading have increased sector-wide risk premia. Investor action : Review treasury disclosures, token movement transparency and regulatory exposure before allocating to crypto treasury equities. Conclusion Tron Inc.’s 85% decline since June highlights how quickly valuations tied to crypto treasuries can unwind when hype fades, execution is questioned and regulators probe market activity. Investors should prioritize transparency, regulatory risk assessment and peer benchmarking when evaluating crypto treasury companies.

In a recent thread posted on X and a client memo, Hougan argued that Bitcoin’s $2.3 trillion valuation, while surprising to many, is rooted in its competition with the gold market , which is worth more than $25 trillion. Hougan illustrated this point with a simple analogy. “Imagine you had two startups,” he wrote . “One trying to disrupt Amazon and the other trying to disrupt gold. To be worth $2.3 trillion, the Amazon disruptor would need to take 100% of the market. The gold disruptor only needs 10%.” Hougan believes that this helps explain why Bitcoin has grown into one of the largest financial assets on the planet despite lacking the daily-use functionality of companies like Amazon. Instead, Bitcoin’s value rests on its role as digital gold. “Market sizing is everything,” Hougan said. “When you realize Bitcoin is going after gold, suddenly its valuation makes more sense.” Larger markets for Ethereum and Solana On the other hand, Ethereum and Solana are targeting markets that are even larger than gold. These blockchains are the foundations of the issuance, trading, and settlement of stablecoins and tokenized assets, which are all sectors linked to the enormous global payments and capital markets. Estimates from SIFMA and Savills place the combined value of global stocks, bonds, and real estate at $665 trillion. McKinsey, meanwhile, estimates that the global payments industry handles 3.4 trillion transactions worth $1.8 quadrillion each year. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Solana are currently valued at around $500 billion and $100 billion, respectively. Hougan concluded his 13-part thread by pointing out the advantageous position the cryptocurrency industry has to target some of the largest and most important markets in the world. He also highlighted the risks that come with it. Tether , the world’s leading stablecoin issuer, now counts more than 400 million users worldwide, growing by about 35 million wallets per quarter, according to its CEO, Paolo Ardoino. The company holds over $127 billion in U.S. Treasurys, placing it among the top 20 holders globally, alongside sovereign nations like Saudi Arabia and Germany. Hougan stated that Tether’s dominance in non-Western markets positions it for potentially historic profitability. If adoption in emerging markets accelerates and USDT manages trillions in assets, Tether’s annual profits could surpass those of Saudi Aramco, which reported $120 billion in 2024. With just under 200 employees, Tether generated around $13 billion in profit last year. “This is why Tether is seeking a $500 billion valuation,” Hougan said. “It may sound absurd compared to companies like SpaceX or OpenAI, but the market it’s targeting is unimaginably large.” Hougan admitted that a majority of projects will fail, and he even predicted more billion-dollar collapses in crypto than in any other industry. Yet those failures, he argued, will be outweighed by projects that become bigger than anything seen in traditional tech.

His latest chart highlights similarities between the 2017 breakout, the 2024 breakout, and the current cycle, suggesting the possibility of a major move if history repeats. $XRP : $8 > $15 > $27 Potential pic.twitter.com/A6qo10E8xd — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) September 28, 2025 Examining the Chart Setup The chart compares two multi-year consolidation patterns. The first symmetrical triangle structure , which was resolved in 2017, produced a surge that met Fibonacci extension targets quickly and sent the asset to its previous all-time high. The second symmetrical triangle, unfolding over several years since 2018, broke upward in late 2024, sending XRP up by over 500%. One of the key elements ChartNerd highlighted is the similarity in structure between the past and present cycles. In both cases, XRP consolidated within a tightening formation before breaking out with strength. The analyst uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to track market conditions, pointing out that the 2017 move reached extreme levels above 95. He anticipates a comparable situation may occur again in this cycle, predicting that XRP will create a bearish divergence on the monthly chart before targeting a new peak. XRP’s Price Targets After repeating that explosive surge, ChartNerd believes the digital asset is forming a similar formation, but on a compressed timeline. The asset began forming this new symmetrical triangle after its peak of $3.39 in January, and the asset’s all-time high of $3.65 in July briefly pushed above the upper trendline, suggesting that the asset is building toward a breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The outlined Fibonacci targets place the first level near $8.5 (Fib. 1.272), followed by $13.76 (Fib. 1.414), and extending up to $27.49 (Fib. 1.618). These figures represent levels where traders may expect resistance or a potential slowdown in momentum. For ChartNerd, the levels are not arbitrary but consistent with past performance, where XRP also met key Fibonacci markers during its last major bull cycle. If XRP were to advance toward these projected price levels, it would reaffirm the asset’s relevance in the digital asset sector. A move beyond $8 would signal renewed market strength, while progress toward $15 and $27 would likely draw new participants and validate long-term holders who have remained through extended consolidation. XRP is currently trading at $2.90, attempting to surpass the $3 level. A decisive break above this resistance and above the triangle’s upper trendline would be the first step toward reaching ChartNerd’s targets.

Institutions poured $291M into Solana last week, second-highest weekly inflow on record. Whales continue profit-taking on rallies; single trades exceeded $31M and significant sales by large funds occurred. Key technical support sits near $200; reclaiming $215–$220 is necessary to reduce downside risk to $190.

Solana institutional inflows surged to $291 million last week due to renewed institutional demand for alternative layer-1 exposure. Fund-level allocations and treasury purchases drove the bulk of inflows, even as some large holders realized profits during price upticks. How are whale sales affecting Solana price momentum? Whales continue to sell into strength: a single on-chain transfer on 29 September moved roughly $31.59 million in SOL to likely exit points. Large fund sales, including a 160.54K SOL block sold by a major asset manager (plain text reference: Grayscale), increase short-term supply during rallies. Source: X Why do institutional inflows matter for SOL now? Institutions provide sustained buy pressure that can offset episodic whale selling. With $291M in inflows—reported as the week’s largest among major crypto assets—Solana has attracted concentrated institutional interest despite broader market outflows. What does comparative flow data show? According to institutional flow trackers (plain text reference: CoinShares report), Bitcoin saw $719M in outflows and Ethereum $409M last week, while Solana pulled in $291M. That divergence highlights selective allocation shifts by institutional investors toward Solana. Source: CoinShares What technical levels should traders watch on SOL? Immediate support remains around $200, backed by recent volume. The $215–$220 zone is the critical reclaim area; failure to break and hold above it increases the probability of a deeper retracement toward $190, the next major volume-backed support. How to trade the inflows-versus-whales setup? Use the following checklist: Confirm inflows: Weekly institutional flow above recent averages signals structural demand. Watch for clustered whale sales: Multiple large transfers on rallies often precede short-term consolidations. Trade key levels: Consider bullish bias above $215–$220; tighten risk if price breaches $200 with rising sell volume. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are institutional inflows enough to sustain Solana's rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Large weekly inflows of $291M materially support Solana's rally, but sustained price strength requires reclaiming the $215–$220 range to reduce downside risk toward $190."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do whale sales impact short-term SOL price moves?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Whale sales frequently cap short-term rallies by increasing immediate supply; monitoring large transfers helps time entries and exits around resistance points."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain and market metrics should investors monitor?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Track weekly institutional flow reports, large wallet transfers, on-chain exchange inflows, and technical indicators (RSI, MACD) around $200 and $215–$220 levels."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How big were last week’s Solana inflows compared to other assets? Solana recorded $291 million in inflows last week, the largest inflow among major crypto assets for that period, while Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced outflows of $719 million and $409 million respectively (plain text reference: CoinShares). Is whale selling a long-term threat to SOL? Whale selling pressures can trigger short-term pullbacks but are not necessarily indicative of long-term trend reversal when institutional demand remains strong and technical supports hold. Key Takeaways Institutional demand: $291M inflows underscore strong institutional interest in Solana. Whale activity: Large sell-offs continue on rallies, creating short-term volatility. Technical roadmap: Reclaim $215–$220 to reduce downside odds; $190 is the next major support if $200 fails. Conclusion Solana institutional inflows of $291M present a meaningful tailwind that helps counter episodic whale selling, but market participants should watch the $215–$220 reclaim zone and $200 support to assess whether momentum can extend. Expect volatility as flows and large-wallet behavior interact; monitor on-chain data and institutional reports for updates.",News|BTC|ETH|FLOW|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 03:34:04

This points to measured accumulation rather than a market top. Binance sender-to-receiver ratio hit a 1-month MA low — sign of accumulation Only 24% of Binance-listed altcoins are above the 200‑day SMA, suggesting bargain conditions Long-term holders sold into strength but BTC held near $110K, showing market resilience Bitcoin accumulation signals: Binance sender-to-receiver ratio low and altcoins at bargain levels — read analysis and key takeaways from COINOTAG. Is Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation? Bitcoin accumulation appears underway: Binance’s sender-to-receiver ratio recently dropped to its lowest level since early 2024, and BTC remained stable near $110K despite long-term holder profit-taking. These on-chain signals suggest more HODL behavior and a reduced supply of active sellers. What does a falling sender-to-receiver ratio mean? The sender-to-receiver ratio measures addresses sending BTC versus those receiving it. A sustained decline — especially a 1‑month moving average low — typically means fewer wallets are selling and more are holding, which is a classic accumulation indicator. Source: Cryptoquant Source: Cryptoquant How did the market behave through the month? September saw long-term holders (LTHs) take partial profits as BTC swung from roughly $117K to $108K. Despite these movements, the price remained anchored near $110K, indicating the market absorbed selling without broad capitulation. Which holder cohorts were most active? Activity concentrated in coins held between 6 months and 5 years. The 7–10 year cohort showed limited movement. That pattern — older coins moving while prices stay firm — often signals selective profit-taking rather than panic selling. Source: Cryptoquant Are altcoins in a buy zone? Yes — altcoins appear undervalued relative to historical accumulation phases. Only 24% of Binance-listed altcoins trade above their 200‑day SMA, a level historically associated with early accumulation opportunities. What does the 200-day SMA tell us now? The low fraction of altcoins above their 200‑day SMA suggests broader weakness in speculative tokens while BTC shows relative strength. Historically, such divergence precedes selective altcoin rallies once macro liquidity or sentiment improves. Source: X Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is the sender-to-receiver ratio as an accumulation signal? The sender-to-receiver ratio is a reliable short-to-midterm gauge of selling pressure versus accumulation. Sustained declines in the 1‑month MA historically align with accumulation phases, but it should be used with other on-chain metrics for confirmation. Should traders buy altcoins now? With only 24% of Binance-listed alts above the 200‑day SMA, conditions appear favorable for selective accumulation. Risk management and project-level due diligence remain essential; broad buying without filters is not advised. What timeframe should investors watch for confirmation? Watch weekly on-chain trends and moving averages (50/200 SMA) plus volume. Confirmation often requires several weeks of consistent metrics — not a single-day move. Key Takeaways Accumulation signal : Binance sender-to-receiver ratio at a multi-month low signals more HODL behavior. Altcoins cheap : Only 24% of Binance-listed alts above 200‑day SMA — potential selective buying opportunity. Market resilience : BTC held near $110K despite LTH profit-taking, suggesting selling was absorbed. Conclusion On-chain metrics point to a measured accumulation phase: Bitcoin shows strengthening HODLer behavior while altcoins remain in a bargain bin. Monitor sender-to-receiver trends and the 200‑day SMA for altcoins for clearer timing. COINOTAG will continue tracking these signals and on-chain data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin shows accumulation as Binance sender-to-receiver ratio falls; altcoins trade below 200-day SMA"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0rwki_b99fc00fcc472ff8806dc1addde0d9214b3f5d46ae90ed7d463730395efe95a0.webp.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/news/bitcoin-accumulation-binance-data"" }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin accumulation evident as Binance sender-to-receiver ratio drops and only 24% of Binance-listed altcoins trade above the 200-day SMA.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Pavel Durov bought thousands of BTC in 2013 at about $700 per coin. He used Bitcoin proceeds to fund personal expenses while Telegram operated at a loss. Toncoin peaked at $8.25 in mid-2024 and has since fallen ~67% from that high. Primary keyword: Pavel Durov Bitcoin — Read how Durov used early Bitcoin holdings to fund Telegram-era costs. Learn TON and Toncoin context. Read now. 2025-10-01 2025-10-01 COINOTAG What is Pavel Durov’s Bitcoin holding and how has he used it? Pavel Durov Bitcoin holdings date to 2013, when he purchased several thousand BTC at roughly $700 each. Durov says those early investments financed personal costs — including real estate and private travel — while Telegram remained a money-losing operation for him personally. He described buying at a “local maximum” near $700 per BTC and investing “a couple of million” at the time. Durov has repeatedly framed Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant store of value and has said he is unwilling to sell. How many Bitcoin did Durov buy and at what price? Durov stated on the Lex Fridman podcast that he acquired his first “few thousand Bitcoin” in 2013 at about $700 per coin and invested “a couple of million.” When BTC later dropped below $200 in the following bear market, he said critics ridiculed him but he held firm. Pavel Durov talks Bitcoin to Lex Friedman. Source: YouTube Why does Durov say Bitcoin helps him “stay afloat”? Durov explained that Telegram often operates at a loss and that Bitcoin provided a personal financial buffer. He argued Bitcoin’s fixed supply and predictable issuance make it an attractive long-term reserve compared with fiat currencies that can be rapidly expanded by governments. Expert context: The comments were made publicly on the Lex Fridman podcast and recorded on YouTube, where Durov emphasized Bitcoin’s resistance to confiscation and political censorship. What is the status of TON and Toncoin compared with Bitcoin? Telegram’s blockchain initiative, originally developed as the Telegram Open Network (TON), was designed for scalability using shardchains to support hundreds of millions of users. Regulatory issues prevented a full Telegram-led launch, but the network lives on as The Open Network and is used for NFTs and other on-chain activity. Toncoin price context Metric Value Toncoin all-time high (mid-2024) $8.25 Drop since ATH ~67% Approximate current price (implied) ~$2.72 Frequently Asked Questions Did Pavel Durov say he would never sell his Bitcoin? Durov said he was not going to sell and that he sees Bitcoin as the way money should work, highlighting censorship resistance and predictable supply. His statement was made on the Lex Fridman podcast and repeated in subsequent interviews. How did Telegram’s TON project evolve after regulatory hurdles? TON was rebranded as The Open Network and continued without direct Telegram control. It retained scalability features like shardchains and has become notable for NFT activity, despite regulatory restrictions that prevented an initial Telegram-hosted launch. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Pavel Durov Bitcoin: How early BTC holdings funded his lifestyle"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999dd8-91f5-763d-93ec-9376d8f8a123.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/pavel-durov-bitcoin-2025"" }, ""description"": ""Pavel Durov bought thousands of Bitcoin in 2013 and says those holdings helped fund his lifestyle while Telegram operated at a loss.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many Bitcoin did Pavel Durov buy in 2013?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Durov said he purchased his first few thousand Bitcoin in 2013 at about $700 per coin, investing what he described as 'a couple of million' at the time."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why does Durov say Bitcoin allowed him to stay afloat?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Durov said Bitcoin provided a personal reserve to cover expenses while Telegram was a money-losing operation; he highlighted Bitcoin's fixed supply and resistance to confiscation."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to verify claims about public crypto holdings"", ""description"": ""Steps to corroborate public statements about cryptocurrency holdings using public interviews, on-chain data and trusted reporting."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check the original interview"", ""text"": ""Locate the recorded interview or podcast episode (for example, the Lex Fridman podcast) and note the direct quotes and timestamps."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Cross-check public statements"", ""text"": ""Compare the interview text with contemporaneous reporting and official statements from the person or organization named."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review on-chain indicators"", ""text"": ""When relevant, examine on-chain transaction history and public wallet activity for corroborating evidence, keeping in mind privacy and attribution limits."" } ]} Key Takeaways Early investment: Durov bought thousands of Bitcoin in 2013 at ~ $700 per BTC.

52502971,593166,1759291205,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum ETFs See Record Inflows as ETH Breaks $4,000: Is a Bigger Rally Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-see-record-inflows-as-eth-breaks-4000/,"Ethereum’s rebound accelerated after U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded $547 million in net single-day inflows, ending a five-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s FETH led with $202 million, while BlackRock’s ETHA contributed $154 million. ETH ETFs now oversee about $27.5 billion, around 5.4% of the circulating market cap, indicating renewed institutional interest as the price regained the $4,000 psychological level. The turnaround coincided with over $1 billion in combined inflows into U.S. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, boosting risk appetite across major assets. Smart Money Accumulates Ethereum (ETH) as Reserves Fall On the balance-sheet front, institutions continue increasing their exposure. BitMine Immersion Technologies disclosed a 2.65 million ETH corporate treasury, the largest tracked among its peers, while Bit Digital plans a $100 million convertible note raise to acquire more ETH, potentially boosting its treasury rankings. On-chain, CryptoQuant data indicate declining exchange reserves, consistent with coins being moved into custody and staking, conditions that historically tighten the circulating supply when demand rises. Technically, analysts note ETH has rallied approximately 250% from cycle lows; some, like Ted Pillows, suggest a brief pullback could set the stage for a move towards $4,500–$5,000, with $10,000 possible later if liquidity and macro tailwinds align. In the near term, sustaining closes above $4,200–$4,250 would keep bulls in control; failure to do so risks a decline towards the $3,800–$3,600 support level. TradFi Integrations Strengthen the Fundamental Case Beyond flows and treasuries, real-world rails are advancing. SWIFT has tested Ethereum’s Linea Layer-2 with BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon for on-chain settlement messaging, while a broader SWIFT–Consensys project explores a blockchain-based ledger for 24/7 cross-border payments. If even a small part of SWIFT volume moves on-chain, it could become a steady demand driver for block space and ETH staking. Alongside improving regulatory clarity and ETF adoption, these integrations strengthen Ethereum’s position as a neutral financial infrastructure for institutions, supporting the AI/data economy narrative highlighted by corporate buyers. Bottom Line Record ETF inflows, decreasing exchange supply, and rising TradFi pilots support a breakout above $ 4,000. Stay above $4,200, and the path opens towards $4,500–$5,000; lose that, and a healthy retest into the high $3,000s is likely to occur before the next move. For now, the evidence leans bullish.

According to blockchain trackers, the address sent its coins in multiple transactions, mostly split into batches of 15 BTC. The total value moved is roughly $44 million, based on current prices. Related Reading: Eric Trump Steps Into Market Talk, Says ‘Buy The Dips’ Wallet Linked To Early Mining Reports have disclosed that the coins trace back to mining activity from nearly 15 years ago. Lookonchain tied the funds to the early days of Bitcoin, and records show the wallet last moved coins in 2013, when Bitcoin traded near $135 per unit. That price then compared with today’s level — around $111,763 per BTC — means the holding rose by about 830 times in value since it went quiet. A dormant wallet woke up after 12 years, moving 400.08 $BTC($44.29M) to multiple new wallets 3 hours ago. The 400.08 $BTC was received from miners 15 years ago.https://t.co/aem7WhbkOu pic.twitter.com/3m4XSBNXFO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 29, 2025 Arkham Intelligence spotted the distribution pattern, noting the repeated 15 BTC transfers that drained the address. Even with full visibility of every transaction on the blockchain, the owner’s identity remains unknown. The pattern — chopping large sums into smaller, repeated amounts — is a common way wallets move coins without dumping everything on a single exchange at once. Part Of A Wave Of Old Addresses Becoming Active This activation comes amid a string of moves from so-called Satoshi-era wallets. Based on reports, institutional and private holdings tied to early investors have been on the move lately. In July, Galaxy Digital sold more than 80,000 BTC linked to an estate, a sale that markets valued at close to $10 billion. Another dormant address holding 444 BTC became active in September 2025 and moved approximately $50 million. Recently, one of the big holders is said to have cycled more than $5 billion of Bitcoin into Ethereum, locking up close to $4 billion worth of ETH afterward. Market Signals Remain Mixed October has traditionally been a good month for Bitcoin, with previous rallies of 40–45% in certain years, but the current signs indicate less conviction. Holder retention level has dropped to 80%, and on-chain derivatives flows and whale outflows suggest weaker demand. Bitcoin was trading near $114,000 at one point today, with a one-day gain of 2.05% reported, but analysts are watching risk levels closely. A continued selloff could push price toward $107,000; renewed buying pressure could take it back up toward $119,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data What This Means Going Forward Movements from Satoshi-era addresses carry symbolic weight, because they come from the group that held Bitcoin when it was still experimental and very cheap. Whether this 400 BTC transfer will spark wider selling or simply mark a reallocation remains to be seen. For now, the market has a clear record of the move, but the reason behind it — estate settlement, profit-taking, or internal reshuffling — is unknown.

It gives protocols and researchers clear procedures and legal protections to stop live exploits. 29 firms recognized for adopting SEAL Safe Harbor in 2025 Safe Harbor requires recovered funds returned within 72 hours; bounty set at 10% (max $1M). SEAL reports volunteers and platforms have helped protect billions; Immunefi cites >$25B in customer funds safeguarded. SEAL Safe Harbor: 29 firms adopt the Safe Harbor Agreement to protect user funds during live exploits — read nominees, rules, and how to support or vote now. What is SEAL’s Safe Harbor Agreement? SEAL Safe Harbor is a formalized ethical-hacking framework that defines legal and operational steps for white hat interventions during active crypto exploits. It instructs protocols and researchers how to coordinate, requires quick return of funds, and sets a standard bounty to encourage timely, lawful defense of user assets. How does the Safe Harbor framework protect white hat hackers? Safe Harbor reduces legal uncertainty by predefining consent, verification, and post-recovery steps. Protocols that adopt the agreement publish recovery addresses and on-chain policies; white hats follow onboarding checks (KYC, OFAC) and return funds within 72 hours to qualify for rewards. This protection lowers hesitation and increases coordinated responses. SEAL recognizes 29 companies — who joined and why? SEAL announced its first Safe Harbor Champions 2025 list recognizing 29 organizations as either “adopters” or “advocates.” Nominees include major DeFi platforms, security vendors, venture firms, and legal partners. The program signals a shift from fragmented defense to a coordinated industry standard aimed at preserving customer assets. Nominees for SEAL’s Safe Harbor award are split into “adopters” and “advocates.” Source: Cointelegraph Why does Safe Harbor matter for crypto security? Safe Harbor creates predictable incentives and legal guardrails, making ethical intervention more likely and reducing exploit profits. Industry adopters report measurable benefits: security platforms say adoption helped many researchers reach significant earnings from bug bounties while protecting billions in customer funds. Which notable white hat actions illustrate the framework’s value? Volunteer SEAL hackers and other good-faith actors have a track record of stopping large losses: a MEV-based interception recovered $2.6M from the Morpho App, another return delivered $5.4M to Curve users, and coordinated responses limited fallout from a JavaScript supply-chain event to under $50 in the first 24 hours. Plain text citation: a public tweet of thanks from banteg referenced c0ffeebabe.eth’s work in July 2023 — note presented as plain text, not an external link. How do protocols adopt the Safe Harbor framework? Protocols join SEAL’s onboarding waitlist and, if approved, receive a compliance guide. Adoption steps typically include publishing recovery addresses across supported chains, integrating the Safe Harbor language into user terms, and preparing internal processes for verification and payout. Source: Security Alliance Frequently Asked Questions How long do white hats have to return funds under Safe Harbor? Under the Safe Harbor rules, recovered funds must be returned within 72 hours to qualify for the standard bounty and legal protections, with verification and KYC/OFAC checks required before payout. Who oversees payouts and legal protections for white hats? Verification is handled by the adopting protocol and SEAL-aligned processes; payouts occur only after verification. The Security Research Legal Defense Fund (SRLDF) can provide legal-defense funding for good-faith researchers if needed. Key Takeaways Standardized legal protection : Safe Harbor reduces legal risk for white hats during live interventions.

Key catalysts cited are strong investor sentiment and potential regulatory clarity that could unlock fresh capital. Short-term dip but longer-term upside: ADA down 4% weekly, yet analysts target $2+ by Dec 2025. Community sentiment remains predominantly bullish, with surveys reporting 88% positive outlook. Regulatory clarity and on-chain upgrades are cited as main drivers; some models project $7–$10 in optimistic scenarios. Cardano ADA price: Analysts forecast a rebound to $2 by Dec 2025 amid bullish community sentiment and regulatory hopes — read the outlook and investor actions. What is the current Cardano ADA price outlook? The Cardano ADA price outlook shows near-term weakness but potential recovery: ADA has lost roughly 4% over the past 24 hours and similar on weekly and monthly frames, yet analysts expect a rebound to around $2 by December 2025 driven by renewed investor confidence and possible regulatory developments. How are experts and the community predicting ADA’s future? Cardano developer commentary and community polls point to elevated bullishness. A prominent developer, known as Phil, expressed optimism that ADA will outperform expectations as the market cycle matures. Independent commentators and models provide a range of targets—conservative forecasts near $2 and optimistic models up to $7–$10—reflecting varied assumptions about liquidity and adoption. Why do some models predict $2 to $10 for ADA? Forecast divergence stems from differing inputs: token supply, market-cap comparisons, and macro/regulatory scenarios. A $2 target implies roughly a 152% rise from a $0.79 price reference and would place ADA near a $71.6 billion market cap under current circulating supply assumptions. AI-driven models and stake pool operator projections that reach $7–$10 assume faster adoption, higher on-chain activity, or substantial inflows from institutional channels. What are the main bullish catalysts for ADA? Key catalysts include: regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, continued protocol development and upgrades, and elevated investor sentiment. Public commentary from ecosystem figures and references to legislative proposals (for example, discussions around digital-asset regulation in the U.S. Senate) are cited as potential triggers for renewed capital inflows. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Cardano ADA price outlook: Analysts eye $2 by Dec 2025 amid strong community bullishness"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""description"": ""Cardano ADA price faces short-term losses but analysts and community forecasts point to a potential rebound to $2 by December 2025 as regulatory clarity and investor sentiment improve.""} How strong is investor sentiment for Cardano? Investor sentiment appears robust: a community poll referenced by market data providers reports about 88% bullish sentiment for ADA and 12% bearish. High positive sentiment can support stronger price rallies when macro conditions and liquidity align. When could regulatory clarity affect ADA? Regulatory milestones could influence timing: if major jurisdictions enact clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutional capital may re-enter markets more confidently. Discussions in the U.S. Senate and public statements by project founders are often cited as timeline signals, but passage and implementation timelines remain uncertain. Frequently Asked Questions Can Cardano ADA reach $2 by December 2025? Yes, several analysts and community forecasts place a realistic target near $2 by December 2025, assuming steady adoption, favorable market conditions, and improved regulatory clarity. This assumes a sustained recovery from current levels and renewed liquidity inflows. What would a $2 ADA mean for market capitalization? At $2 per ADA, market capitalization would approach an estimated $71.6 billion given current circulating supply assumptions, reflecting substantial inflows compared with present valuations. What risks could prevent ADA from reaching these targets? Principal risks include broader crypto market weakness, delayed or adverse regulation, slower-than-expected on-chain adoption, and systemic liquidity shocks that suppress asset prices despite positive community sentiment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Cardano ADA reach $2 by December 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Several analysts and community forecasts consider $2 achievable by December 2025 given improving sentiment and potential regulatory clarity, but outcomes depend on market-wide liquidity and adoption."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the main catalysts for ADA’s price rise?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key catalysts include regulatory clarity, protocol upgrades, increased on-chain activity, and strong community/investor sentiment that can attract fresh capital."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the primary risks to ADA’s outlook?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Risks include negative regulatory outcomes, sustained market-wide sell-offs, slower adoption, and macroeconomic shocks that reduce liquidity and investor risk appetite."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess Cardano ADA price outlook"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Check transaction volume, active addresses and staking participation to gauge adoption strength."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor regulatory developments"", ""text"": ""Track legislative milestones and official statements that could affect institutional inflows and legal clarity."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess sentiment and model scenarios"", ""text"": ""Use community surveys, analyst models and conservative/optimistic scenarios to estimate price ranges and timing."" } ]} Key Takeaways Short-term: ADA has seen a recent 24-hour and weekly decline (~4%), reflecting market volatility. Analyst targets: Forecasts vary—common conservative target ~$2 by Dec 2025; optimistic scenarios reach $7–$10. Action: Monitor regulatory signals, on-chain metrics, and liquidity conditions before adjusting exposure. Conclusion Cardano ADA price faces immediate downside pressure but retains upside potential if regulatory clarity and on-chain growth materialize. Investors should prioritize data-driven monitoring—on-chain metrics, sentiment indicators and legislative developments—before making allocation decisions.

Despite the slight pullback, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is holding firm above key support levels, while fresh debates, bold predictions, and state-level interest keep momentum alive. Debate Over Bitcoin’s Future Use Cases The Bitcoin community is split ahead of the expected release of Bitcoin Core v30 . It would remove the long-standing 80-byte OP_RETURN data limit. Ultimately, this change would allow larger non-financial data storage directly on-chain. However, it’s raising questions about BTC’s purpose. Critics argue that this move contradicts Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer currency. Whereas, advocates see new opportunities for applications built on top of BTC’s base layer. Medium : Bitcoin Core v30 Is About to Change the Network Forever The newly released RC2 candidate of Bitcoin Core v30 proposes the removal of the 80-byte cap on OP_RETURN, allowing up to ~4MB of data to be embedded in each transaction output.

While purists warn of business interests pushing for more storage, developers and miners see potential revenue streams and new use cases. It’s another reminder that Bitcoin’s identity continues to expand, blending currency with broader digital utility. Draper and States Fuel Adoption Hopes And billionaire investor Tim Draper says retailers will eventually only accept Bitcoin. While most institutions, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc., view BTC as a long-term store of value, Draper says that when major retailers accept Bitcoin, it will trigger organic spending. He’s put his money where his mouth is with investments in Coinbase and Robinhood, both key players in the crypto infrastructure.

The bill faces hurdles in a Democrat-controlled legislature, but it’s a sign of growing recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset at the state level, following Texas and New Hampshire. Draper predicts future retail adoption of BTC. Massachusetts considers a state Bitcoin reserve. Institutional confidence continues to expand. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Uptober Rally in Focus On the charts, Bitcoin is consolidating near $114,154 after last week’s sharp breakout from a descending channel that defined September’s pullback. Price is now resting just below resistance at $114,741, with the 100-period SMA at $112,808 serving as a strong support floor. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has cooled to 60 from overbought levels near 80. It signals a healthy reset that preserves the bullish structure. Recent short-bodied candlesticks suggest indecision, but the pattern resembles an ascending triangle, a common continuation setup after strong rallies. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin defends its higher lows, a breakout above $114,741 could propel the price toward $116,150 and the September peak of $117,850, with a run at $120,000 possible if momentum holds. A breakdown below $113,000, however, would expose $112,600 and the 50-period SMA at $111,680. For market participants, long positions remain favorable on a confirmed breakout above $114,700, targeting $116,150 and $117,850, with stops placed just under $112,600. With seasonal “Uptober” optimism aligning with these technical signals, Bitcoin may not only push higher but also spark broader rallies across Ethereum, XRP, and Solana.

House Republicans say they are working with the SEC’s Office of Inspector General after the OIG reported that an automated SEC IT policy wiped former Chair Gary Gensler’s government phone, deleting key text messages tied to crypto enforcement actions. What happened to Gary Gensler’s deleted text messages? Gary Gensler deleted texts were removed when an automated SEC IT policy triggered a full wipe of his government-issued mobile device, deleting messages between October 2022 and September 2023, the SEC Office of Inspector General reported. The loss has prompted congressional oversight and demands for more transparency. How are House Republicans responding to the OIG findings? House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, joined by Ranking Members Ann Wagner, Dan Meuser, and Bryan Steil, wrote to SEC Chair Paul Atkins seeking details and follow-up. The committee said it is engaging with the OIG to review the report, clarify outstanding questions, and identify additional areas requiring oversight and investigation. The Hill-led letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Source: US House Committee on Financial Services Why do Republicans call this a double standard? The committee’s letter points to a perceived inconsistency: the SEC sued firms for record-keeping failures while apparently failing to preserve the agency’s own records. In 2023 the SEC collected more than $400 million in fines from firms over record-keeping issues, according to public filings and committee statements. What did the OIG say caused the deletions? The OIG attributed the loss to an automated, poorly understood IT policy that performed a full device wipe. Contributing factors included weak change management, lack of backup devices, missed system alerts, and unresolved vendor software flaws. These failures exposed gaps in the SEC’s internal controls and records preservation practices. When were potentially relevant enforcement conversations lost? OIG investigators found that some deleted communications related to enforcement actions against crypto companies and founders. That means exchanges of text messages that could clarify timing and decision-making on high-profile crypto cases may no longer be available for review. What additional SEC security incident is relevant? The SEC experienced a separate security lapse in January 2024 when its social account was compromised and used to post false news about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Public reporting attributed that breach in part to the SEC not using two-factor authentication at the time, underscoring broader cybersecurity and controls concerns at the agency. Frequently Asked Questions Did the SEC intentionally delete Gary Gensler’s texts? The OIG found no evidence the wipe was intentional to hide records; it identified an automated IT policy and systemic failures. House Republicans, however, say the outcome nonetheless raises transparency and accountability questions. Will missing texts affect ongoing enforcement reviews? Missing messages could limit the record available to oversight bodies and investigators, particularly for cases dated Oct 2022–Sept 2023. Congress and the OIG are evaluating next steps to determine impact on specific enforcement matters. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/sec-gensler-deleted-texts-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""House Republicans Probe Gary Gensler's Deleted SEC Text Messages"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999df4-489b-73af-a6fa-6ceafbb643c2.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""House Republicans pressed the SEC after an OIG report found an automated SEC IT wipe deleted Gary Gensler's government phone texts from Oct 2022–Sept 2023, raising transparency concerns over crypto enforcement.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What did the SEC Office of Inspector General find about the deleted texts?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The OIG found an automated SEC IT policy triggered a full device wipe that deleted messages from October 2022 through September 2023; poor change management, missing backups, ignored alerts, and vendor software issues contributed."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are House Republicans investigating the OIG report?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Binance co‑founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao issued a direct warning: do not click on any links recently posted from this account. How was the compromise detected and what did the fraudulent post claim? Security monitoring and community reports flagged a post that invited users to vote on an “upcoming $BSC rewards date” and promised early rewards for early participants.

First, do not click any remaining links from the compromised post.

52504878,593744,1759294830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52504878.jpeg,Circle And Deutsche Börse Partner To Boost Stablecoin Adoption In Europe,https://bitcoinist.com/circle-deutsche-borse-partner-stablecoin-europe/,"Global stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group and German multinational corporation Deutsche Börse Group have unveiled their collaboration to expand stablecoin adoption in Europe. Circle Partners With Deutsche Börse For Stablecoin Expansion On Tuesday, Circle and Deutsche Börse Group announced they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to integrate the global issuer’s euro and dollar stablecoins, EURC and USDC, within the international exchange organization’s financial market infrastructure. According to the joint statement, the collaboration aims to bring “new solutions” for market participants in Europe by connecting token-based payment networks with traditional financial market infrastructure. It also seeks to advance the regulated adoption of stablecoins in European markets. Circle and Deutsche Börse plan to initially focus on listing and trading stablecoins on the German corporation’s digital exchange 3DX and institutional provider Crypto Finance. Moreover, the partnership is set to enable institutional-grade digital asset custody via Deutsche Börse’s post-trade business, Clearstream, leveraging the German entity of Crypto Finance as sub-custodian. Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, affirmed that the collaboration will “advance the use of regulated stablecoins across Europe’s market infrastructure—reducing settlement risk, lowering costs, and improving efficiency for banks, asset managers, and the wider market.” “As clear rules take hold across Europe, aligning our regulated stablecoins, EURC and USDC, with trusted venues will unlock new products and streamline workflows across trading, settlement, and custody,” he added. The partnership follows the recent initiative by nine major European banks to deploy a MiCAR-compliant stablecoin next year. As reported by Bitcoinist, Italian banking giant UniCredit, alongside ING, Banca Sella, KBC, Danske Bank, DekaBank, SEB, CaixaBank, and Raiffeisen Bank International, have formed a consortium to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin to “fill the need for a trusted, regulated solution for on-chain payments and settlement.” EU Regulatory Landscape Faces Stablecoin Challenge As the announcement noted, the initiative is enabled by the European Union’s (EU) Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCAR), the bloc’s comprehensive framework for cryptocurrencies, which covers areas such as the issuance and custody of digital assets. Circle also highlighted its status as the first major global issuer to achieve compliance with MiCAR. Nonetheless, recent reports affirmed that the European Central Bank (ECB) is pushing for stricter regulations, which could impact how issuers like Circle and Paxos operate across borders. As Bloomberg alleged on Tuesday, the ECB is calling for a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins in the bloc and other jurisdictions. According to the report, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) recently passed a recommendation to ban jointly issued stablecoins, people familiar with the discussions told the news media outlet. Recently, Judith Arnal, an associate senior research fellow at the Centre for European Credit Research Institute (ECRI) and board member at the Bank of Spain, discussed the issue in an in-depth analysis for ECRI, affirming that multi-issuance stablecoins would be MiCA’s first “real credibility test”: At the heart of this controversy lies a fundamental tension between regulatory ambition and market reality. The European Central Bank (ECB), backed by key members of the European Parliament (EP), argues that multi-issuance structures could undermine the prudential safeguards that MiCA was designed to establish, potentially exposing European holders to risks from third-country issuers and weakening EU monetary sovereignty. The European Commission, meanwhile, has sought to resolve the matter through internal administrative procedures, avoiding the political debate that the ECB and EP believe is necessary. Despite being supported by a high-powered board of central bank governors and EU officials , the guidance is not legally binding, noted Bloomberg. However, it will reportedly pressure EU authorities to “implement the restrictions or explain how financial stability can be preserved in their absence.” Arnal considers that “this institutional standoff has created regulatory paralysis with far-reaching consequences,” which risks “undermining MiCA’s credibility as a coherent and globally influential regulatory framework – just as other jurisdictions, notably the US, are establishing clear and competitive alternatives.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Circle|deutsche boerse|EU regulations|EURC|European Central Bank|jeremy Allaire|MiCA regulation|MiCA-Compliant Stablecoins|Paxos|USDC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT|USDC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 05:00:30

Bitcoin Survives September Whale Selling Pressure According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, September was marked by clear fluctuations between Bitcoin’s attempts to rally and exposure to selling pressure by whales and long-term holders. Binance trading volume data confirms this. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure As Exchange Inflows Stay Elevated – Will BTC Lose $112,000 Support? Arab Chain highlighted Binance’s Exchange Inflow Coins Days Destroyed (CDD) indicator, which showed significant volatility throughout September. The indicator recorded multiple peaks at various points during the month, especially during mid-September. For the uninitiated, the Exchange CDD indicator tracks the movement of older, long-held Bitcoin when it flows into exchanges, weighting transactions by the age of the coins being spent. Spikes in this indicator signal that long-term holders or whales are moving coins with the intent to sell, which can create selling pressure. It is worth noting that despite the high peaks hit in September, the Exchange CDD indicator did not reach the extreme levels that it did in the previous months. However, the repeated spikes seen in September indicate inflows from older wallets into Binance. The CryptoQuant analyst stated that the multiple spikes in the Exchange CDD indicator reflect a state of caution among long-term investors. Some of these investors tried to test the market by moving their BTC to the exchange, without turning it into a mass sell-off event. Another point worth emphasizing is that the Exchange CDD spikes often coincided with price pullbacks in BTC, reinforcing the hypothesis that these flows likely represent short-term selling pressure. The analyst added: However, these pressures did not lead to a breakdown of key support levels around $108K, indicating the presence of corresponding buying liquidity that absorbed these moves. In conclusion, although some long-term investors showed willingness to take some profits, the absence of large waves of sell-offs shows that they have not fully lost confidence in the market yet. Similarly, Bitcoin’s price remaining above $108,000 despite repeated selling pressure shows that the market still possesses the capacity to absorb BTC inflows, confirming the robust underlying demand for the top digital asset. What Does October Hold For BTC? In a separate CryptoQuant post, analyst crypto sunmoon remarked that past data suggests that a surge in taker buy orders has often preceded major Bitcoin bull runs. However, currently, there are no signs of any increase in taker buy orders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Dynamics Shift As Binance Premium Signals Aggressive Longs The analyst added that even if BTC witnesses some price increase, it is unlikely to record the same magnitude of gains as before. That said, improving Bitcoin network fundamentals offers some hope to the bulls. For instance, Bitcoin network transactions are once again approaching the important 600,000 transactions threshold, which could spark bullish momentum for the digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $113,200, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

His comments came after reports that SWIFT is building a blockchain ledger with over 30 banks using Consensys. In response, he considered how Ripple’s path since the conclusion of the SEC lawsuit may intersect with the shifts now underway in the global payments space. The analyst suggested that the timing of recent developments deserves attention. He noted that Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s chief executive, for the first time stated that Ripple is aiming to capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume . Shortly after this, SWIFT began speaking publicly about the importance of blockchain in its future settlement models. To him, the sequence did not appear to be a coincidence. If we in the $XRP community are right that Ethereum, ConsenSys, and even Gensler had something to do with the SEC lawsuit against Ripple, and now we see ConsenSys potentially building with SWIFT, doesn’t it make sense to consider two possibilities? First, SWIFT may have realized… https://t.co/eOhbBtgZwq — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 29, 2025 Ripple’s Potential Approach According to Cryptoinsightuk, one possibility is that SWIFT had recognized the need for a distributed ledger technology to enhance its system. He speculated that Ripple and SWIFT may have previously engaged in discussions and that Ripple could have declined any form of partnership or acquisition. If this scenario were accurate, Ripple’s decision might reflect a deliberate strategy to remain independent and directly compete with SWIFT. Meanwhile, SWIFT’s latest deal could be an attempt to soften the blow when XRP enters the market. He also argued that the SEC lawsuit against Ripple could have reinforced that approach. Rather than seek integration with legacy networks, Ripple may have positioned itself to stand as a challenger. This path would align with Garlinghouse’s stated goal of securing a significant share of global payment flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for Ripple and XRP The analyst also commented on the shifting perception of SWIFT. He observed that Russia is unlikely to ever return to the system, even if relations with the U.S. improved. From his perspective, this refusal highlights how geopolitical disputes have reduced confidence in SWIFT’s neutrality. Other nations, he said, are closely monitoring these dynamics. China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System exists as an alternative, but as Cryptoinsightuk pointed out, it lacks the global liquidity to operate as a truly dominant network. This environment creates a gap that Ripple could fill by providing settlement services through XRP across corridors where trust in SWIFT has eroded. In doing so, XRP could establish itself as a neutral bridge asset , gradually building liquidity and extending its global role.

Saylor stated that the main goal of their strategy is to accumulate one trillion dollars worth of BTC and aims to grow by issuing loans on this capital. Michael Saylor argued that this strategy is simple yet transformative. Saylor summarized their ultimate goal: “The ultimate goal is to accumulate a trillion dollars worth of Bitcoin and then grow that capital by issuing more credit.” Saylor describes Bitcoin as “digital energy” and the monetary foundation of the 21st century. He argues that, like fire, the wheel, or oil, Bitcoin is the next technological paradigm shift that will improve the human condition. According to Saylor, BTC Treasury companies leverage this capital by issuing new digital credit instruments (bonds, preferred stocks) using Bitcoin as digital gold. Saylor states that these companies' primary competition isn't with each other, but with the legacy 20th-century credit and equity markets. He claims that this new form of digital credit is more transparent, more reliable, and offers higher returns. Saylor predicts that these new financial products will replace traditional, lower-yielding instruments. In Saylor's vision, this strategy presents the greatest opportunity in the current financially stressed large capital markets. Bitcoin-backed loans could offer significantly higher returns, say up to 10%, and thus restore the health of traditional banking and deposit markets, particularly in markets like Switzerland or Japan where risk-free interest rates are close to zero. Related News: The Lost Coins Theory: Analysis Firm Shares Special Metric Predicting the Future of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin Saylor noted that institutional adoption is rapidly increasing, noting that the institutional Bitcoin treasury trend that began in 2020 has now reached more than 180 publicly traded companies. He explained that institutions are the “engines that keep the Bitcoin economy running,” enriching individual investors with every capital injection they make into the network. Later in the interview, Saylor reiterated his long-term optimism for Bitcoin, claiming it offers a risk-free return as an investment. “I expect Bitcoin to appreciate at an average of 29% per year for the next 21 years,” Saylor said, sharing his prediction that the price of BTC will reach $21 million in 21 years. Saylor stated that Bitcoin will be the foundation of the 21st century's digital credit, digital equity, digital banking, and digital economy, arguing that Bitcoin treasury companies will be the main engines of this major transformation. *This is not investment advice.

Institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $57B, signaling long-term accumulation. Exchange holdings are at multi‑year lows, tightening circulating supply. Experts cite monetary expansion and sovereign diversification as catalysts for higher long‑term valuations. Bitcoin price prediction: $1M target driven by institutional demand and supply compression — read analysis & next steps from COINOTAG. Pavel Durov joins top analysts predicting Bitcoin could reach $1 million amid rising institutional demand. Institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $57B, indicating sustained long term accumulation. Pavel Durov says early Bitcoin purchases at $700 helped fund his ventures as prices later surged. Analysts expect sovereign adoption to increase as exchange balances hit seven year lows. Bitcoin’s momentum has cooled after its recent rally, yet several prominent figures continue to project extreme long‑term targets. The cryptocurrency sits below its year‑to‑date peak of $124,200, but proponents argue structural demand and constrained supply could push fair value much higher over years. What is the basis for Pavel Durov’s $1 million Bitcoin prediction? Pavel Durov’s $1 million Bitcoin prediction rests on three pillars: ongoing monetary expansion eroding fiat purchasing power, growing institutional allocations to spot Bitcoin ETFs, and steadily declining exchange balances that limit readily tradable supply. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s fixed issuance as a hedge against fiat dilution. How large are institutional inflows and why do they matter? Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have exceeded $57 billion to date, according to filings. These flows represent long‑term allocation from funds and institutions rather than short‑term retail speculation. Large, persistent inflows reduce available liquidity and can amplify price appreciation when matched with limited supply. Why does shrinking exchange supply increase upside potential? Exchange balances have trended lower for seven consecutive years. Lower exchange reserves mean fewer coins available for sale on major platforms, tightening on‑chain supply. With demand rising, persistent outflows from exchanges can translate to upward pressure on price over time. Who else endorses high Bitcoin targets? Notable figures — including Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, Chamath Palihapitiya, and others — have publicly stated expectations above current levels. These projections vary in magnitude but share common assumptions about institutional adoption, monetary policy, and scarcity dynamics. How did early purchases help founders like Durov? Durov disclosed buying several thousand Bitcoin around 2013 at about $700 per coin. He says those holdings provided personal liquidity during later business funding needs. Early adoption by founders illustrates how long‑term holding can support ventures when markets are volatile. What are the risks and counterarguments? Risks include regulatory interventions, technological failures, and changes in macroeconomic conditions that reduce the urgency for non‑sovereign stores of value. Short‑term volatility remains high, and predictions of extreme targets require multi‑year horizons and continued adoption trends. How might sovereign adoption affect Bitcoin’s price? Analysts argue sovereign diversification away from a single reserve currency could accelerate demand. If nations allocate reserves or payment systems to include Bitcoin, that would represent a large, durable source of demand that could intersect with already compressed exchange supplies. What data supports supply compression claims? On‑chain data shows a persistent decline in exchange reserves over several years. Combined with ETF accumulation and long‑term holding by institutions and early adopters, these metrics support the thesis of diminishing available supply for short‑term trading. Comparison: Public price targets from prominent figures Observer Stated target Primary rationale Pavel Durov $1,000,000 Monetary expansion + scarcity Michael Saylor High multi‑hundreds of thousands to $1M Institutional adoption and corporate treasuries Cathie Wood Long‑term targets above current peaks ETF inflows + technology adoption Chamath Palihapitiya Very high long‑term valuation Sovereign and institutional demand Frequently Asked Questions Can institutional ETF inflows alone push Bitcoin to $1 million? Institutional ETF inflows are a major factor but not the sole driver; reaching $1 million would likely require sustained inflows, reduced exchange liquidity, broader sovereign interest, and continued macro conditions favoring scarce digital assets. Is Bitcoin’s supply truly limited? Yes. Bitcoin has a fixed issuance schedule that caps total supply at 21 million coins, a structural feature that supporters cite when arguing for long‑term price appreciation. Key Takeaways Institutional demand is material : ETF inflows above $57B indicate durable, large‑scale allocation. Supply compression is real : Exchange balances have declined for years, tightening available liquidity. Long‑term targets require patience : Extreme predictions like $1M depend on multi‑year adoption trends and macro dynamics. Conclusion The narrative supporting a $1 million Bitcoin includes institutional inflows , shrinking exchange supply, and monetary policy trends that may weaken fiat purchasing power. While not guaranteed, these structural factors underpin long‑term bullish cases and merit monitoring by investors and policymakers.

This situation has illustrated how protectionist trade policies can have undesirable effects, which is also observed in data affected by holidays. Regarding the decrease in South Korea’s exports, data from reliable sources revealed that the 6.1% decline in September was the lowest compared to the same period last year, after accounting for the number of working days. This was after the overall exports surged by 12.7%, following a slight upswing of 1.2% in August. On the other hand, imports increased by 8.2%, resulting in a trade surplus of $9.6 billion. Trump’s extensive tariff policies threaten South Korea’s economic growth The recent data released indicated how the calendar affected business operations . Regarding the working days set, this year’s September had 22 official working days due to the October Chuseok holiday, while last year’s September had only 20 working days. The change observed in the working days boosted the monthly total but reduced the daily average. This decline ended a three-month streak of growth, according to reports. Following this information, South Korean officials and analysts concluded that the situation resulted from the tension triggered by Trump’s tariff policies, which caused exporters to send shipments out earlier before the policies took effect. The drop in South Korea’s exports demonstrates the difficult circumstances that exporters in the country face during this new phase of protectionism initiated by Trump’s presidency. With these figures released, officials at the Bank of Korea might consider the urgency of resuming their monetary easing strategy when they review their policy on October 23. Notably, exports in South Korea play a significant role in the country’s economy. To support this claim, data released in 2024 showed that the sector accounted for more than 40% of the country’s GDP. Therefore, a significant decline in the sector weakens the country’s economy. South Korea strikes a new deal with the US Considering the drastic drop in exports, South Korean officials have devised a strategy to enhance their relationship with the US. As part of the effort, the country has agreed to share monthly details with the US regarding its foreign-exchange interventions. It will also release annual information about its reserve currencies. This new deal aims to enhance transparency and solidify both countries’ commitments not to manipulate their currencies. In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, October 1, the US Treasury Department and the South Korean Ministry of Finance announced that this agreement was reached during ongoing trade negotiations. They emphasized that any interventions must be limited to preventing severe market volatility or disorderly trading. Talks began in April, although the statement did not specify when these actions would take effect. Meanwhile, Korea will share the monthly intervention data confidentially with the US Treasury and publicly announce annually its currency composition. Moreover, it will publish its market stabilization figures every four months and continue to release monthly data on reserves and forward positions, as mandated by the IMF. In April, South Korean news media reported that a senior foreign exchange official had joined the trade team negotiating with the US. In June, the Treasury Department added South Korea to its watch list in a report on foreign exchange and called for the country to reduce its currency actions .

Quintenz confirmed the decision and pointed to industry tensions, including a dispute with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, as factors that complicated his confirmation. His exit was announced as Congress debates the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which could give the CFTC primary oversight of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, there are some serious questions about who will lead the agency during this crucial regulatory transition. Quintenz Nomination to CFTC Collapses The Trump administration withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), ending what was one of the most closely watched appointments for the US crypto industry. Quintenz isa former CFTC commissioner and head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), and confirmed the move. He described the nomination process as “the honor of my life.” While he is very grateful to President Donald Trump and the Senate Agriculture Committee, he said he now looks forward to returning to the private sector during what he called an “exciting time for innovation” in the country. Quintenz is a popular figure among many in the digital asset industry, who see his track record as supportive of innovation and balanced oversight. However, his path toward confirmation became bogged down in delays and controversy, particularly after public clashes with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini. Quintenz alleged that the Winklevoss twins directly lobbied President Trump to block his confirmation after he declined to give assurances regarding Gemini’s legal challenges. He even released private text messages to back up his claims, which showed the twins’ dissatisfaction with his unwillingness to discuss the company’s $5 million civil case settlement with the CFTC earlier this year. The messages also showed the brothers calling for “cultural reform” at the agency and a shift away from what they described as “lawfare” against crypto firms. Quintenz responded that he will address these issues only if he were confirmed to lead the regulator. The withdrawal leaves the CFTC in a leadership vacuum. The agency has been without a full chair for almost a year and is currently run solely by Acting Chair Caroline Pham. However, she said that she will depart once a permanent head was nominated. Main goals of the CLARITY Act This uncertainty comes at a pivotal time for crypto regulation in the United States. Congress is currently considering the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which could clearly define the roles of the CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other financial regulators in overseeing digital assets. Under the bill, sufficiently decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, which will make the agency a central regulator for much of the industry. For now, Quintenz’s withdrawal raises some new questions about how quickly the CFTC can secure stable leadership to guide it through this critical phase of crypto policy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 05:30:00

At the same time, attention is shifting to Remittix , the viral payments token that just set new crypto records by raising over $26.8 million and selling more than 673 million tokens. Analysts now compare Remittix’s momentum to XRP’s early rise. XRP Price Prediction Signals Undervaluation Ahead XRP price today is holding steady at $2.90 after bouncing strongly from its $2.50 support zone, with buyers showing resilience in the face of market volatility. This renewed strength has sparked optimism across XRP news, as traders eye a potential repeat of past Q4 rallies. On-chain signals also point to growing demand, with a lower NVT ratio suggesting the asset could be undervalued at current levels. For bulls, the short-term test is at $2.98, and the additional higher targets are at $3.14 and $3.30. Any further breakout will open the door to $3.66, and longer-term speculation suggests that XRP may hit $5 in the case of continued momentum. Historical patterns show that Ripple price prediction cycles often align with institutional inflows and regulatory clarity, both of which remain hot topics as ETF decisions loom. While XRP price prediction models highlight opportunity, analysts caution that losing support at $2.70 could stall progress and drag the coin lower. Still, with whales accumulating and ETF speculation growing, Ripple news suggests the stage may be set for a decisive move. Remittix Ranks Number One For Pre-Launch Tokens On CertiK Remittix has captured the spotlight after smashing through $26.8 million in funding, selling more than 673 million tokens at $0.1130 each. This milestone puts the project in the same conversation as established giants in cross-border finance, while excitement grows around comparisons to Ripple and XRP. Remittix is unique in that it aims to provide an easy way to transfer money all over the world, providing speed, security, and low-cost services through blockchain technology. Over $26.8 million raised in presale, signaling strong investor confidence More than 673 million RTX tokens sold, priced at $0.1130 each Beta testing for the Remittix wallet now live with select community members Referral program offering 15% back in USDT for every new buyer introduced The Remittix team has also confirmed major listings, with BitMart revealed as the first CEX partner after the $20 million milestone and LBank joining soon after. Coupled with CertiK verification and a #1 pre-launch token ranking, this progress strengthens trust within the community.

According to Wedson, Bitcoin has entered the final stages of a similar process compared to previous cycles, 528 days having passed since the last halving (April 19, 2024). Wedson reminded that the number of days between the halving and the all-time highs (ATH) in historical data was 371 in 2012, approximately 525 in 2016 and 546 in 2020, respectively. “This small but steady extension trend suggests that we are in the final phase of the current cycle,” he said. Related News: The Lost Coins Theory: Analysis Firm Shares Special Metric Predicting the Future of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin The analyst also argued that other cycle metrics such as the Fractal Cycle and Max Intersect SMA similarly indicate that the top is near. According to Wedson's calculations, Bitcoin could see a potential peak on October 19, 2025, which is 548 days away. If this process extends to 561 days, the date could shift to November 1, 2025. “Considering the consistency of four-year cycles, it is possible that we will reach the current price peak within 30 days at most,” Wedson said, noting that the market is approaching a critical threshold. *This is not investment advice.

In its suspension order, the SEC flagged potential manipulation via social-media “recommendations” by unknown parties that appeared designed to inflate price and volume. The halt took effect Monday and is slated to run for 10 trading days while regulators dig in. QMMM announced it would allocate a $100 million portfolio across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and also launch a crypto analytics platform. The news triggered a sharp rise from around $11 to an intraday peak near $207, before the stock last traded around $119.40 before the freeze. A Wider Crackdown on “Crypto Treasury” Pop-and-Drops The QMMM halt comes as the SEC and FINRA expand investigations into unusual trading activities linked to corporate crypto-treasury announcements. This year, over 200 companies have announced plans to raise funds through token purchases, often following sharp price increases before the announcements. Regulators are examining potential insider leaks and Reg FD violations related to the selective sharing of material information. Hype-driven stock promotions and speculative treasury strategies can cause share prices to drift away from their true value, leaving late traders vulnerable when market realities catch up. Recent reports indicate this strategy has become overcrowded, with some firms turning to financial engineering after crypto-related rallies decline, prompting the SEC to accelerate efforts to halt trading and investigate suspicious surges. What the QMMM Halt Means for Investors Now For holders, the suspension locks in positions until trading resumes, and outcomes vary from an orderly reopen to potential enforcement actions if wrongdoing is discovered. Expect increased demands for detailed disclosure: audited wallet attestations, treasury risk policies, and clear business rationales beyond simply “numbers go up.” The QMMM episode highlights a new baseline: crypto adjacency alone won’t suffice, especially when social-media promotion is involved. Key levels to watch after the halt include liquidity conditions, opening auction volatility, and any SEC updates clarifying the scope of the investigation. Overall, investors seeking equity exposure to digital assets may prefer experienced operators and transparent balance-sheet strategies over sudden pivots. With regulators indicating ongoing scrutiny of the crypto-treasury relationship, due diligence, on both the tokens and the corporate narratives, has never been more important.

Then came move-to-earn. Both models showed how Web3 could turn everyday activities into income. But in 2025, a new frontier is taking shape: wear-to-earn. At the center of this trend is GetStyleMoney (GSM) , a presale project combining AI, fashion, and blockchain to reward users for styling, wearing, and promoting fashion items. Now in Stage 2 of its public presale, GSM is priced at just $0.00003, with more than 30% of tokens already sold. Fashion Meets Crypto Fashion is one of the most powerful industries in the world, worth over $2.5 trillion globally, and billions of people already post their outfits every day on TikTok, Instagram, and X. Until now, those posts mostly benefited brands and platforms. GetStyleMoney flips the model by giving the rewards back to the users themselves. Through its Proof of Wear system, GSM verifies fashion engagement on-chain. Anyone can earn tokens by sharing outfits, scanning items, or joining brand campaigns. At the same time, fashion labels gain protection against counterfeits and access to authentic community promotion. This combination of AI verification and blockchain rewards creates the first wear-to-earn ecosystem, where everyday style has real, monetizable value. It’s a new way to think about fashion, as both an expression and a means to generate income. Why GSM Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now The rise of play-to-earn and move-to-earn proved that people are willing to monetize daily activities, but those models were limited. Gaming appeals mainly to niche communities, while fitness rewards mostly health enthusiasts. Fashion, by contrast, is universal. Everyone participates, and everyone has a style to share. That’s why early investors see GSM as one of the best cryptos to buy now. It has a scalable model that could bring millions into Web3 without asking them to change their behavior. Meanwhile, other blockchain and AI projects like NEAR Protocol and Bittensor (TAO) already carry multi-billion-dollar valuations. While established, their growth potential is capped. GSM , in contrast, is still in its early presale phase, giving it room to deliver 300x–500x upside if adoption scales. Each presale stage increases in price, meaning early backers secure the best multiples while latecomers will pay more. The total supply of GetStyleMoney is set at 20 billion tokens, with 6 billion allocated to presale participants. Stage 2 is currently live at $0.00003 per GSM , and demand has already cleared more than 30% of the available supply in this round. To increase investors’ trust, the project’s smart contract has been audited by CertiK. Building Momentum Across Social Media Community hype is often what separates successful projects from forgotten ones in crypto. GSM is already showing signs of strong demand and community interest. On its X page, the team is rallying influencers and early adopters, emphasizing that style should finally be rewarded. On LinkedIn , the project is highlighting how blockchain and digital fashion are converging into a lifestyle movement. This growing presence across both crypto and fashion circles signals that GSM is serious about building a strong brand identity and engaged community well before its first exchange listings. Final Thoughts Wear-to-earn has the potential to be the next viral Web3 model, and GetStyleMoney (GSM) is ready to lead the charge. By rewarding users for what they already do, wearing and sharing fashion GSM delivers real-world utility with explosive upside. With Stage 2 tokens priced at just $0.00003 and selling out fast, GSM is being hailed as one of the best cryptos to buy now and potentially one of 2025’s last true 700x opportunities. Join the presale now and be part of the wear-to-earn revolution. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

This uncertainty has led one analyst, known for accurately predicting BTC’s trajectory during this cycle, to suggest that a new bear market may be closer than many investors anticipate. Bear Market Warning In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the analyst, who goes by the name Doctor Profit, expressed ongoing confidence in his bearish outlook. Since adopting a negative stance in August, he has maintained that Bitcoin is likely to reach the $90,000 to $94,000 range. While he initially expected this target to be hit this month, he noted that the price has spent an average of 77% of the time below his short position entry point of $115,500. This has reinforced his belief in the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: Solana Gaining Ground On Ethereum: These Key Metrics Show Colossal Growth Doctor Profit emphasized that the critical test for BTC involves the $90,000 to $94,000 range. He predicts that not only will this level be tested, but there is a strong possibility that Bitcoin could break below it, effectively signaling the end of the current bull market. While the probability of a bear market is alarmingly high, Doctor Profit insists that confirmation hinges on how Bitcoin reacts within this key price band. He clarified that reaching this target does not need to happen immediately, nor does a temporary bounce back to $116,000 or $117,000 invalidate his bearish thesis. The analyst views any upward price movements, such as the mid-September surge to $117,800, as mere opportunities to enter short positions at more favorable levels, instead of being signals of a new bullish catalyst. 4 Key Indicators For The Bitcoin Price Analytics platform CryptoQuant has identified four critical indicators to watch based on on-chain data. Notably, Tether’s USDT market cap has seen a substantial increase of $10 billion over the past 60 days, signaling fresh liquidity entering the market, which is typically a positive sign during bullish phases. Moreover, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) RSI currently sits at 21, which indicates a “buy” signal. This metric assesses the buying power of stablecoins in relation to Bitcoin’s market cap.

Additionally, the number of accumulator addresses, which are wallets that have made multiple purchases of the leading cryptocurrency without selling, has reached an all-time high of 298,000 BTC. Conversely, the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), which tracks Bitcoin flows between spot and derivatives exchanges, is currently trending downward—an indicator commonly associated with bearish market conditions.

This development builds on Thunes’ earlier partnership with Ripple , first established in 2020 and expanded in September 2025, which introduced Ripple Payments into Thunes’ SmartX Treasury System and Direct Global Network. The companies first began working together in 2020, and the latest development highlights their commitment to delivering faster and more reliable financial services. Together, these moves demonstrate a growing effort to modernize cross-border payments, create faster, more reliable access to financial services, and provide greater flexibility for institutions worldwide . Thunes Connects Ripple to SWIFT WrathofKahneman, a well-followed figure in the digital asset community, highlighted an important detail tied to this announcement. He pointed out that Thunes has integrated its Pay-to-Banks service with SWIFT. This connection means Ripple liquidity routed through Thunes can now reach SWIFT’s network of 11,000 banks . Money runs on connectivity. #Ripple partner Thunes plugged its Pay-to-Banks service into SWIFT. This means Ripple liquidity that is routed through Thunes can reach any SWIFT connected bank. Said to cover 11,000 banks. pic.twitter.com/Rj8lKuxLXH — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) September 29, 2025 This link is significant because SWIFT has been the traditional backbone for cross-border transactions for decades. By connecting Ripple-powered liquidity to SWIFT-linked banks, Thunes creates a bridge between blockchain-based payment solutions and the conventional financial system. Ripple’s technology can leverage SWIFT’s scale, offering both reach and utility that would have been difficult to achieve independently. The Significance of Reaching SWIFT’s Network SWIFT’s network allows nearly universal access to banks and financial institutions involved in international payments. For Ripple and XRP, this reach provides credibility and practical value in positioning them as viable competitors to traditional systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Connecting to 11,000 banks removes the barriers that often separate blockchain networks from existing infrastructure. XRP has long been promoted as a solution to the inefficiencies of cross-border transfers and as a viable alternative to SWIFT’s network . By linking Ripple’s liquidity solutions with SWIFT-connected banks through Thunes, the asset gains direct access to the largest established global financial rail. Strengthening XRP’s Role in Global Payments Ripple’s strategy has focused on ensuring XRP is more than just a digital asset. Through Thunes, it now reaches 11,000 banks, 4 billion accounts in over 130 countries, and 3 billion mobile wallets, strengthening its role in the $150 trillion global payments market. Integrating with Thunes enhances that capacity by allowing payments to settle quickly across new markets where local banking infrastructure may have been limited.

Managed by Qazaqstan Venture Group and operating under the Astana International Financial Centre, the fund aims to become a cornerstone of the country’s digital asset strategy. The initiative aligns with President Tokayev’s broader push for technological advancement, including directives to accumulate strategic reserves of digital assets and expand the digital tenge into national and local budgets. Kazakhstan has also approved stablecoin payments for regulatory fees, making it the first in the region to introduce a regulatory framework for such transactions. Kazakhstan’s crypto ambitions mirror global trends. The country recently launched Central Asia’s first spot Bitcoin ETF, confirmed plans to diversify sovereign reserves into crypto, and completed pilot testing of its central bank digital currency, scheduled for full rollout by end-2025. Chinese Woman Pleads Guilty in UK’s Largest-Ever Crypto Seizure Case As reported, Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national also known as Yadi Zhang, has pleaded guilty in a London court to her role in a massive crypto fraud that led to the seizure of 61,000 Bitcoin, worth over $6.7 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated an investment scam in China targeting over 128,000 victims, funneling stolen funds into digital assets and laundering proceeds through high-end property purchases. UK authorities launched their investigation in 2018, eventually arresting Qian, who had been living under a false identity in the country. She was aided by Jian Wen, a former takeaway worker who helped move illicit funds into luxury real estate. Wen was sentenced in 2023, and police confiscated over £300 million in Bitcoin from her. The case is being described as a landmark moment in law enforcement’s fight against crypto-based financial crime. Qian remains in custody pending sentencing.

Early believers who trusted the vision of decentralized money and smart contracts saw extraordinary outcomes. With today’s crypto predictions highlighting smaller projects with greater upside, the hunt is on for the next opportunity under $0.05 that has the potential to reshape portfolios. That conversation increasingly points toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform in presale that blends strong fundamentals with a highly scalable model. Right now, the presale is deep into Phase 6 with around $16.6 million already raised. The current price is locked at $0.035, and more than 16,700 holders have taken their positions. Roughly 53% of this phase’s allocation has already been sold, and the next price jump to $0.04 will mark a 15% step higher. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, this final discounted window before further climbs has investors paying close attention to the changing crypto prices and opportunities for crypto investment. A new standard for decentralized lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a lending architecture designed to combine reliability for large-cap assets with flexibility for riskier tokens. At the heart of its design are peer-to-contract pools that will handle established collateral like USDC and SOL. These vaults will give lenders predictable returns while maintaining deep liquidity for borrowers. Running alongside these will be peer-to-peer rails where lenders can negotiate terms on tokens like FLOKI or PEPE. By isolating these arrangements, the platform ensures that unexpected volatility from memecoins never spills into the core liquidity system. The integration of Layer-2 scaling will play a central role in this vision. By shifting borrowing and repayment activity to cheaper, faster rails, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will make high-frequency loan management practical for all users. The project has already aligned its roadmap toward a Beta launch, where live borrowing and lending functions will showcase these mechanics. The platform’s borrowing rules are being shaped around strict overcollateralization standards, with each asset assigned a loan-to-value threshold depending on its volatility profile. Safer assets like ETH may support LTVs up to around 75% while higher-risk tokens will be capped closer to 35–44%. A Stability Factor will act as a buffer against drawdowns, with liquidation penalties applied if collateral falls under safety margins. These penalties are structured so that a portion of liquidated assets flows back into the treasury, strengthening long-term incentives for users. Market resilience through liquidity and oracles The importance of on-chain liquidity becomes most obvious in times of stress, when thin markets can trigger cascading liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designing its liquidation engine with liquidity-aware incentives that scale based on how much depth exists at the time. This ensures liquidators are motivated to stabilize the system even during volatile periods. Loan-to-value ratios will be tuned to minimize undercollateralization risk, meaning the system stays solvent even when crypto prices swing rapidly. Price discovery will rely primarily on Chainlink oracle feeds, with fallback providers and time-weighted average prices from decentralized exchanges as additional safeguards. This multi-layer approach is set to prevent false triggers and give institutional users confidence that liquidations are only executed when absolutely necessary. Combined with Layer-2 execution speed, this structure points toward a lending platform able to withstand the kind of shocks that have historically undermined weaker protocols. Why analysts forecast a 200x runway Investors looking at long-range crypto predictions are not only analyzing technology but also demand drivers that can multiply valuations. For Mutuum Finance (MUTM), three stand out as defining: First, reserve factor accumulation will channel a percentage of borrowing activity into a treasury that can later be redeployed into incentives and ecosystem growth. This steady reinforcement strengthens the balance sheet over time and adds depth to the project’s utility. Second, the robust oracle strategy that mixes Chainlink feeds with multiple fallback mechanisms positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for institutional partnerships. Larger players prioritize risk controls, and the ability to showcase transparency in price feeds will encourage greater total value locked. Third, the buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures that protocol revenue will flow into repurchasing MUTM on the open market and distributing these tokens to stakers. This creates a predictable demand curve, tying growth in platform usage directly to increased returns for long-term participants. Security credentials reinforce this investment thesis. The protocol has already been reviewed by CertiK with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program with clear reward tiers is in place, alongside a $100,000 giveaway campaign. A live dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard are keeping the growing community engaged, and the project has already attracted over 12,000 followers on social media. A new generation of wealth creation The best way to understand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to look at how its early investors have done. A person who joined during Phase 1 at $0.01 is already up to $0.035, which is a 3.5x gain in value before the platform ever goes live. With the Beta launch, Layer-2 throughput, buybacks from revenue, and eventual exchange listings all coming up, a way to get 200x returns is no longer just a dream; it’s a matter of scaling adoption. Phase 6 is now more than halfway sold, and the next step up to $0.04 is coming soon. Investors have only a short time remaining to get in before this early entry price is gone. If you missed the life-changing runs of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is swiftly becoming the next big thing in crypto investing that can turn strong beliefs into real money.

Crypto markets appear to have taken this in their stride with very little movement in most digital assets over the past few hours. Total capitalization is holding on to the $4 trillion level, which it reclaimed earlier this week. Bitcoin tapped an intraday high of $114,700 in late trading on Tuesday and has only dipped marginally from that local high at the time of writing. Ether prices revisited $4,200 but fell back over the past couple of hours to trade at $4,140 during trading in Asia on Wednesday morning. Most of the altcoins were seeing minor losses, which is nothing unusual. Asian stock markets were mixed as investors focused on issues closer to home rather than US politics. Why Has The US Govt Shut Down? Both Republican and Democratic funding proposals failed in the Senate on Tuesday night, and the government officially shut down at 12:01 am Wednesday when funding expired. BREAKING: US Government officially shuts down after running out of money. pic.twitter.com/g08p5TWAvM — Globe Eye News (@GlobeEyeNews) October 1, 2025 In the political standoff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of refusing to negotiate, while Vice President JD Vance blamed Democrats for not compromising. “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing,” he said. The Democrats are demanding changes to Medicaid cuts and healthcare tax credits that Republicans oppose, according to reports. The Senate plans to vote again on Wednesday on the same two failed measures, while federal agencies were instructed to execute orderly shutdown plans. This could lead to a data blackout with no fresh labor or inflation reports, leaving the Federal Reserve flying blind. The move marks the 21st government shutdown since 1977, the last of which was in December 2018, lasting 35 days. This was during the depths of “crypto winter” and the brutal bear market that followed the 2017 cycle peak. Crypto markets are currently in a bull cycle, and their non-reaction to the shutdown shows greater resilience and market maturity. “Bitcoin and altcoins trade like high-beta assets, so a shutdown spike in volatility can hurt prices, but if it pushes the Fed toward a softer stance, that can later lift sentiment,” commented researcher ‘Hunt’. Gold Up, Dollar Down Gold, which is seen as a safe haven during periods of uncertainty, is at a new all-time high of $3,870 an ounce. Meanwhile, the US dollar is hovering near a one-week low against other major currencies. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, has slumped 12% since the beginning of this year as the world’s reserve currency continues to weaken.

Each rally has stalled at the same wall, and the capital flow is now shifting toward projects with clearer token demand mechanics and functioning DeFi models. This rotation is already visible in the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol aligning its token with real utility. The numbers are telling: with a total supply of 4 billion, Phase 6 has already generated around $16.6 million. At the current price of $0.035, more than 16,700 holders are on board, and 53% of this phase’s 170 million allocation is sold. The price in Phase 7 will rise by 15% to $0.040, creating urgency for those who want entry before the next leg up. Building stablecoin utility, lending demand and price discovery Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being engineered as a dual-mechanic protocol where lending happens in two streams. Peer-to-Contract pools will handle stablecoins and blue-chip crypto coins, while Peer-to-Peer desks will serve riskier meme assets in isolation. This structure will keep the system robust while allowing yield opportunities across segments. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its stablecoin innovation. A native $1-pegged stablecoin will be minted only against collateralized borrowing, governed by interest adjustments to ensure the peg remains strong. This mechanism adds an on-chain medium of exchange that supports both borrowing activity and long-term stability. Price discovery is central to healthy liquidations and reliable lending. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use Chainlink oracles as its primary feed, with fallback and aggregation layers included to prevent manipulation or errors. Accurate pricing ensures that collateral values are always correctly calculated, protecting lenders and borrowers during volatile swings. The lending mechanics show clear profit potential. For instance, a depositor adding $25,000 DAI into a P2C pool will receive mtDAI at a one-to-one rate. Utilization modeling projects an average APY around 14%, meaning this position will generate $3,500 over 12 months. On the borrower side, someone using $1,500 worth of ADA as collateral will access up to 65% loan-to-value in stablecoin, unlocking liquidity while staying long on ADA’s upside. P2P will also serve a role, offering isolated desks for tokens like FLOKI, SHIB, and PEPE, where direct lending agreements will function without exposing the main pools. Market volatility often sparks the question of why crypto is down during corrections, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing answers in its infrastructure. Accurate price feeds paired with fallback oracles will shield users from false liquidations. Liquidation incentives will scale with on-chain liquidity to guarantee closeouts, while Layer-2 speed will minimize slippage and deliver smooth executions even in high-pressure market moments. The road to 1,000% returns beyond early gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already up 250% from its Phase 1 launch, but analysts are looking ahead to much larger outcomes. The path to 1,000% rests on three demand drivers. First, rapid adoption is expected once the Beta launch goes live, as real platform usage and word-of-mouth will draw in both lenders and borrowers. Second, protocol revenue from borrowing and fees will drive buyback mechanics, where MUTM tokens will be repurchased and redistributed to mtToken stakers, ensuring continuous buy pressure. Third, expected listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, combined with growing total value locked, will amplify liquidity and visibility. This foundation is backed by security milestones. A CertiK audit is underway, combining manual review with static analysis. Scores already include a TokenScan of 90 and a Skynet rating of 79. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty program is live, with rewards scaling from $200 for low issues to $2,000 for critical discoveries. A $100,000 giveaway is also running, awarding ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. The community now exceeds 12,000 followers on Twitter, and a live dashboard with a Top-50 leaderboard provides transparency for investors. Conclusion The growth math is already visible. A Phase 2 buyer who entered at $0.015 is now sitting on a 2.33x position at today’s $0.035 price. As the presale moves to $0.040 in Phase 7 and platform features roll out, price paths to $0.60 or even $1.50 are supported by protocol revenue and buybacks. For Phase 6 investors, this translates to 30x–100x outcomes, a realistic trajectory when paired with expanding demand drivers. The window is getting smaller because more than half of Phase 6 has already been sold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself to be the next big brand in crypto investing. It gives you an opportunity to move on from assets that aren’t growing and into a token that has genuine use. This presale is the time to buy XRP if you want more than the delayed $3.5 ceiling. The price will go up again soon.

Binance Announces TRUMP/JPY Spot Trading Pair and Zero Maker Fee Campaign According to the company's statement, the TRUMP/JPY spot trading pair will be available on October 3, 2025, at 11:00 AM. The addition of the new trading pair will allow Japanese yen investors to trade directly with the TRUMP token. This move is part of Binance's strategy to increase trading diversity, particularly in the Asian market. Binance is also launching a zero maker fee campaign to incentivize users. As part of the campaign, there will be no fees for maker trades on the TRUMP/JPY trading pair. The campaign, which will run from 11:00 AM on October 3, 2025, to 10:59 AM on November 3, 2025, will provide a cost advantage, particularly for high-volume investors. Binance aims to expand its user base with campaigns like these aimed at increasing trading volume. Experts believe the listing of a new trading pair could both increase interest in the TRUMP token and attract more Japanese investors to the platform. The exchange had previously strengthened user engagement by launching trading pairs with different currencies and zero-commission campaigns. *This is not investment advice.

With altcoin season still anticipated, long-term buyers are debating which project has the fundamentals to deliver multi-year gains rather than short-lived pumps. Many are now examining Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project building a real utility platform around lending, borrowing, and staking that analysts argue is engineered for 2,000% growth potential. Long-term utility driving growth The presale already shows serious traction. Out of a total of 4 billion tokens, Phase 6 has raised around $16.6 million. The current price is $0.035 with more than 16,700 holders, and 53% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this round have already been taken. Security underpins this progress: a CertiK audit with Manual Review and Static Analysis is ongoing, supported by a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet rating of 79. Investor incentives are also powerful — a $100,000 giveaway will select ten winners to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, and a $50,000 bug bounty program will reward testers up to $2,000 for critical findings. With Phase 7 lifting the price to $0.040, this round represents the last chance to lock in tokens before a guaranteed 15% increase. The thesis behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its dual lending model, which allows users to engage with both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer structures. In P2C, blue-chip and stablecoin deposits are pooled to generate predictable yields. For instance, an investor supplying $10,000 in SOL to a pool will receive mtSOL in return. With an average annual yield of 12%, this generates $1,200 in passive income while the mtTokens remain usable as collateral. Borrowers benefit from capital efficiency without liquidating their assets. By depositing $1,000 worth of LINK and leveraging a 65% loan-to-value ratio, a trader can unlock $650 in liquidity for new opportunities while keeping exposure to LINK’s upside. This creates a system where capital is not locked but dynamically repurposed. P2P adds depth by isolating riskier tokens such as PEPE and FLOKI into a separate marketplace. Here, terms are negotiated directly between lenders and borrowers, ensuring that the core pools remain insulated and sustainable. This design provides the foundation for long-term total value locked growth and makes the system robust enough to attract larger participants. Collateral, liquidity, and institutional safety For long-term investors wondering why crypto is down in volatile stretches, risk management is a deciding factor in selecting projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) structures loans with overcollateralization, using a Stability Factor to monitor health continuously. Assets like ETH or stablecoins support up to 75% LTV with liquidation thresholds near 80%, while more volatile assets are capped between 35% and 53% LTV with liquidation around 65%. Reserve factors ranging from 10% to 53% will add extra protection and recycle revenue back into the treasury. Liquidity depth is equally important. Large withdrawals or liquidation waves can collapse poorly designed systems, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering dynamic liquidation incentives and caps to keep pools balanced. On-chain liquidity ensures smooth execution, and with Layer-2 integration, transactions will become faster and cheaper, encouraging higher on-chain activity. In addition, the use of aggregator oracles and fallback feeds reduces risk from downtime and will keep liquidations functioning accurately. Roadmap and demand drivers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is putting together a number of factors to help long-term adoption. Staking mechanisms will let mtToken users receive MUTM rewards, while open-market buybacks paid for by protocol revenue will keep demand high. There will be a test launch so that people may interact with the platform directly and see how it works in real time. Planned listings on major exchanges like MEXC and Kraken will make the coin more visible and give it more liquidity. These projects will bring in additional users and money to the ecosystem, which will keep prices rising for years. A clear example shows the impact. A long-term investor who swapped ETH into MUTM during Phase 1 at $0.01 with a $6,000 outlay secured 600,000 tokens. At today’s Phase 6 price of $0.035, that position is valued at $21,000, a 3.5× return. At a target representing 2,000% growth — about 21× from the original price — that stake is projected to climb into six-figure territory. These numbers are supported not by hype but by structural adoption drivers: the beta platform launch, scalability through Layer-2, staking and buyback rewards, and expected listings on tier-one exchanges. If you’re still trying to figure out which cryptocurrency to buy for long-term growth, the numbers and mechanics underlying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) make it plain. Over half of Phase 6 has already been sold, and the price is about to go up. Now is the time to get ready for what analysts think will be one of the most important altcoin plays of the next cycle.

Ein Gesetzesentwurf sieht unter anderem Steuerfreiheit für kleinere Transaktionen unter 300 Dollar vor. Die Finanzkommission des Senats arbeitet parteiübergreifend an einem neuen Rahmen für digitale Assets. Kryptowährungen sind längst mehr als ein Nischenphänomen. In den USA rücken sie nun verstärkt in den Fokus der Politik, denn Senatorin Cynthia Lummis arbeitet mit Kollegen an neuen Regeln für die Besteuerung digitaler Vermögenswerte. Die Debatte könnte weitreichende Folgen für Anleger, Unternehmen und den gesamten Kryptomarkt haben. Politischer Vorstoß für digitale Assets Senatorin Cynthia Lummis hat bei einer Veranstaltung in Washington bekräftigt, dass die Steuerbehandlung von Kryptowährungen dringend reformiert werden müsse. Bereits im Juli hatte sie einen Gesetzesentwurf eingebracht, der kleine Transaktionen bis zu einer Grenze von 300 US-Dollar steuerfrei stellen soll. Dieser Schritt soll alltägliche Zahlungen mit Bitcoin und anderen Coins erleichtern und Bürokratie abbauen. Auch das Verleihen von digitalen Assets soll nach ihrem Entwurf nicht mehr als steuerpflichtiges Ereignis gelten, was Investoren mehr Spielraum gibt.

It includes seven miscellaneous tax provisions aimed… — Clinton Donnelly (@CryptoTaxFixer) September 29, 2025 Ziel der Reform ist es, die rechtliche Unsicherheit zu beenden und Innovation in den USA zu fördern. Lummis betont, dass die bisherige Steuerpraxis Investoren hemmt und den Kryptomarkt belastet. Mit ihren Vorschlägen will sie den USA eine Vorreiterrolle geben. Viele Branchenvertreter begrüßen den Vorstoß, da sie auf klare und verlässliche Regeln angewiesen sind. Die Senatorin tritt seit Jahren für Kryptowährungen ein und hat sich den Ruf als eine der größten Befürworterinnen digitaler Vermögenswerte im Kongress erarbeitet. Zusammenarbeit im Senat Die Finanzkommission des Senats spielt bei der Ausarbeitung der neuen Regeln eine entscheidende Rolle. Nach Angaben von Lummis arbeitet das Gremium derzeit an einem Entwurf, der zehn zentrale Punkte umfasst, von denen neun direkt aus ihren bisherigen Vorschlägen stammen. Sie sprach von einem deutlichen Fortschritt, der zeigt, dass parteiübergreifende Zusammenarbeit möglich ist. Besonders hob sie Senator Ron Wyden hervor, der als Demokrat ein enger Partner in dieser Frage sei. BREAKING: SENATOR LUMMIS JUST SAID SHE WANTS TO MAKE #BITCOIN PAYMENTS UNDER $600 TAX FREE BTC ADOPTION IS ABOUT TO SKY ROCKET pic.twitter.com/tqOM6Wpws4 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 27, 2025 Die Debatte über Kryptowährungen ist im Kongress nicht neu, doch bisherige Versuche für klare Steuerregeln scheiterten. Lummis hatte bereits versucht, ihre Ideen in umfassendere Gesetzespakete einzubringen, allerdings ohne Erfolg. Nun scheint die Dynamik günstiger, da immer mehr Abgeordnete den wirtschaftlichen Wert von Kryptowährungen anerkennen. Befürworter hoffen, dass die Einigung über Steuerfragen auch ein Signal für breitere Akzeptanz digitaler Assets sein könnte. Einfluss der Krypto-Lobby Verschiedene Interessenverbände der Krypto-Branche fordern seit Jahren eine Neuregelung der Besteuerung. Besonders die sogenannte de-minimis-Regel, die kleine Transaktionen steuerfrei stellt, gilt als Kernforderung. Für Alltagszahlungen mit Bitcoin wäre dies ein entscheidender Schritt, da bisher jede kleinste Transaktion steuerlich dokumentiert werden musste. Viele Unternehmen und Privatnutzer hatten dies als Hemmnis kritisiert. Lies hier, warum immer mehr Unternehmen in den USA auf Ethereum (ETH) setzen. Die Unterstützung aus der Wirtschaft könnte für den Erfolg des Gesetzes entscheidend sein. Lummis betont, dass ein innovationsfreundliches Umfeld geschaffen werden müsse, damit die USA nicht von anderen Regionen abgehängt werden. Gerade in Europa und Asien entstehen zunehmend Krypto-Hubs, die Investoren anziehen. Mit einer klaren Steuerregelung könnten die USA dagegenhalten und ihre Position als globaler Finanzplatz stärken. Kritiker sehen jedoch die Gefahr, dass zu großzügige Regeln Schlupflöcher eröffnen könnten. Bevorstehende Anhörung Am Mittwoch plant die Finanzkommission eine Anhörung unter dem Titel „Examining the Taxation of Digital Assets“. Zu den geladenen Experten zählen Vertreter von Coin Center sowie Rechtsanwältin Andrea S. Kramer. Sie sollen die Sichtweise der Branche und juristische Aspekte beleuchten. Diese Anhörung gilt als wichtiger Schritt im Gesetzgebungsprozess und könnte die Richtung der Reform bestimmen. Die Diskussion fällt in eine politisch angespannte Zeit, da ein möglicher Regierungsstillstand droht. Sollte der Kongress bis zum 1. Oktober keine Einigung über den Haushalt erzielen, könnten zahlreiche Prozesse ins Stocken geraten. Laut Angaben eines Sprechers würde die Anhörung zu digitalen Assets jedoch auch bei einem Shutdown wie geplant stattfinden . Damit signalisiert der Senat, dass das Thema höchste Priorität besitzt. Anleger und Unternehmen blicken gespannt auf die Ergebnisse. Lesetipp: Warum Experten glauben, dass in 2025 noch 250k bei BTC erreicht werden können Ebenfalls gespannt sind Investoren bei den Altcoins, denn dort gibt es immer neue Projekte, die mit mehr oder weniger sinnvollen Use-Cases Schlagzeilen machen. Eines davon – Bitcoin Hyper. Dieser Coin möchte die besten Seiten von Bitcoin und Solana miteinander verbinden. Doch wie genau funktioniert das? Bitcoin Hyper – die nächste Stufe für Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will das Beste aus zwei Welten verbinden: die Sicherheit von Bitcoin und die Geschwindigkeit von Solana. Bitcoin selbst ist zwar extrem sicher, aber langsam, teuer und nicht flexibel genug für moderne Anwendungen wie DeFi, Games oder smarte Verträge. Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an: Als Layer-2-Lösung macht es Bitcoin endlich schnell, günstig und programmierbar. So funktioniert die Zusammenarbeit von BTC und SOL Über die sogenannte Canonical Bridge können Nutzer echtes Bitcoin in das Hyper-Netzwerk bringen. Dort wird es als „Wrapped BTC“ genutzt, ohne dass die Coins ihre Sicherheit auf der Bitcoin-Blockchain verlieren. So lässt sich BTC endlich als Zahlungsmittel einsetzen – ob für Finanz-Apps, Spiele oder einfache Transaktionen – und nicht nur als Wertanlage. Lies hier eine detaillierte Analyse von Bitcoin Hyper. Die 3 größten Vorteile von Bitcoin Hyper: Schnelligkeit: Transaktionen laufen in Echtzeit, vergleichbar mit Solana. Niedrige Gebühren: Kosten sind nur ein Bruchteil im Vergleich zur Bitcoin-Blockchain. Hohe Sicherheit: Bitcoins Stabilität kombiniert mit einer dezentralen, vertrauenswürdigen Bridge. Der $HYPER-Token treibt dieses System an: Er bezahlt Transaktionen, bringt Staking-Rewards und ermöglicht Mitspracherecht. Mit fairem Presale, ohne Insider-Vorteile, bietet Bitcoin Hyper besonders jetzt – wo immer mehr Unternehmen und Institutionen in Krypto einsteigen – spannende Chancen für Investoren.

While there’s still some time before this kicks, tokenized securities could bring traditional finance and blockchain technology ever closer. As the lines between the two worlds blur, this could benefit certain crypto projects such as Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Considered the best crypto to buy these days, these projects make it even easier for anyone to get into crypto investing. We’ll explain why that is after going over the SEC’s proposal for tokenized stock trading! Tokenized Securities: The Way Forward or Just Hype? The SEC is currently in its early stages of allowing people to trade tokenized securities on crypto exchanges. Nova Wealth President Nate Geraci emphasized this on X when he said that the NYSE met with the SEC Crypto Task Force to discuss tokenized securities. As their name suggests, tokenized securities are a digital securities on the blockchain. While they can make stock trading faster and cheaper and allow for 24/7 trading, some companies have cautioned against rushing on the hype train. One of these is market-making firm Citadel Securities. Back in July, it advised the SEC to be careful about adopting these securities, as they could confuse investors and siphon liquidity away from equity markets. Nevertheless, with the SEC potentially approving tokenized securities soon, TradFi could step into the future with blockchain at its side. In fact, data from RWA.XYZ shows that tokenized stocks are gaining momentum , with a 99.65% growth in their total value in the last 30 days, and a 153.94% increase in their monthly transfer volume. With the growing adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, the industry will need projects that further accelerate this adoption and bring innovation to the space. Here best long term crypto investments that fall in that category. 1.

Key Takeaways: The UK is seeking to keep 61,000 BTC seized from a Chinese fraud case, now worth $6.7 billion. Victims are pushing for compensation based on current Bitcoin value, not just original investments. Legal battles and market volatility could delay resolution and impact the final windfall. The potential windfall stems from the conviction of Zhimin Qian and her Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling, both of whom pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in London earlier this year. $6.7B in Bitcoin Seized at London Mansion in 2018 Fraud Probe The digital assets were first discovered in 2018 on devices seized at a luxury mansion in Hampstead, north London, during an investigation into suspicious property purchases. At the time, authorities were unaware they had stumbled upon what would become the UK’s largest-ever crypto seizure. Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, had funneled stolen investor funds from China into Bitcoin before fleeing the country and settling in the UK under a false identity. Court documents reveal that Qian ran a fraudulent investment firm in China between 2014 and 2017, offering returns as high as 300%. The scheme reportedly defrauded over 128,000 individuals, many of whom are now seeking compensation. Lawyers for some victims argue that the Bitcoin should be returned at its current value, not merely the original sums invested, citing years of delay and the life savings many lost. UK officials are debating what to do with the massive haul, according to a report from the Financial Times. Some Treasury insiders have speculated the recovered crypto could reduce the fiscal burden in the upcoming Budget, but others caution that legal proceedings could stretch into 2027. The Office for Budget Responsibility does not account for asset seizures in its fiscal forecasts, and crypto holdings are not formally recognized as financial assets. The next civil hearing is expected in January, with a High Court decision likely to be appealed. Meanwhile, Qian and Ling await sentencing in November. UK authorities face another challenge: how to liquidate such a large amount of Bitcoin without causing a price shock. With crypto markets notoriously volatile, the final value of the seized funds could fluctuate dramatically before any resolution. Crypto-Related Physical Attacks Surge 169% in Six Months As reported, physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to new data tracked by CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. Since late February, 35 new violent incidents have been reported globally, a 169% increase in just six and a half months. The uptick adds to an already troubling trend, as cryptocurrency markets continue their bullish run. In total, 48 attacks have occurred so far in 2025, marking a 33% increase over all of 2024. France alone has accounted for 14 of this year’s reported incidents. One of the most disturbing cases took place on September 6 in Cambridge, Canada, where a young man was abducted at gunpoint and forced to transfer funds into a cryptocurrency wallet.

Crypto provides scalable, programmable money and settlement that traditional 100-year-old finance rails cannot match for real‑time AI-driven trading and automated economic agents. AI agents need scalable, programmable money rails for real‑time transactions. Blockchain provides verifiable, machine-readable sources of truth for autonomous agents. Institutions may adopt crypto gradually; rate moves and liquidity unlocking could increase flows. AI agents require crypto: scalable, programmable money rails for real‑time finance — read how institutions and Bitcoin fit into the picture. Coinbase’s John D’Agostino says expecting AI agents to run on legacy financial rails is unrealistic; crypto and blockchain offer the speed and programmable money AI requires to operate effectively in markets. What role does crypto play for AI agents? AI agents rely on fast, programmable, and verifiable payment and data rails, and crypto supplies those capabilities. Blockchain offers machine-readable settlement, on‑chain truth and near-instant transfers, enabling agents to execute strategies and settle positions without the latency and manual reconciliation of legacy systems. How will AI agents use blockchain-based money rails? AI agents will use blockchain rails to transact micro-payments, execute automated trades, and access auditable data feeds. Machine-to-machine payments can be near-instant and atomic. As John D’Agostino noted on CNBC, asking agents to operate on century-old financial rails is like streaming on a dial‑up modem — it won’t scale. Coinbase’s John D’Agostino believes AI agents require crypto to operate effectively in financial markets. Source: CNBC Why are legacy finance rails inadequate for AI? Traditional financial infrastructure was designed for human-paced settlement, not automated, high-frequency, machine-to-machine activity. These systems incur batching, manual checks and latency. Blockchain and crypto enable continuous, programmatic settlement and reduce reconciliation overhead for autonomous agents. How does Bitcoin compare to gold for institutional investors? Bitcoin is digital, programmable and easily transferred across borders. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be moved, tokenized and integrated into smart contracts, offering yield opportunities and composability. D’Agostino emphasizes Bitcoin’s unique characteristics — not a direct gold analog — particularly for portfolios seeking assets that outpace expanding money supply. Context: The Federal Reserve cut rates on Sept. 17, 2025, and market commentary from JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon has varied on future cuts. Interest rate moves can unlock liquidity from cash and money-market products into risk assets, including crypto. When will institutions meaningfully increase crypto allocations? Institutions are cautious and methodical. Pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds typically adopt new asset classes incrementally. Expect a measured increase driven by regulatory clarity, custodial solutions, and shifts in interest rates that release parked cash into alternatives. Are institutions “lemmings” in crypto adoption? No. According to D’Agostino, institutions act deliberately. They use due diligence, governance and staged allocations rather than herd-based moves. Adoption is steady, not a single explosive wave. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Why AI Agents Need Crypto: Coinbase’s John D’Agostino Explains"", ""description"": ""Coinbase’s John D’Agostino says AI agents require crypto and blockchain rails for machine-speed transactions and verifiable data."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999e51-4e21-78c7-b14d-4126c873bc8f.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ai-agents-crypto"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How AI agents can integrate with crypto rails"", ""description"": ""Steps for enabling AI agents to transact and operate using blockchain-based money rails."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Establish on‑chain identity and wallets"", ""text"": ""Provision cryptographic wallets and identities for agents to sign transactions programmatically."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Use smart contracts for business logic"", ""text"": ""Deploy smart contracts to encode agent rules, settlement conditions, and dispute resolution."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Integrate oracle and data feeds"", ""text"": ""Provide authenticated, tamper-evident inputs so agents act on reliable real‑world signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Settle and monitor on-chain"", ""text"": ""Execute atomic transactions and continuous monitoring to ensure finality and compliance."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Do AI agents need crypto to function in financial markets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""AI agents benefit from crypto because blockchain provides low‑latency, programmable settlement and verifiable data, which legacy systems cannot deliver at scale."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will institutions quickly move large allocations into Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutions typically allocate gradually; adoption depends on regulatory clarity, custody solutions, and macro drivers like interest rates."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How is Bitcoin different from gold for portfolio use?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin is digital and programmable, easier to transfer and integrate into modern financial plumbing, offering use cases gold cannot provide."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How fast must money rails be for AI agents to trade effectively? AI agents need near‑real‑time settlement and programmable conditional transfers. Millisecond-level decision-making requires settlement that minimizes latency and supports atomic operations, which blockchain rails can deliver where legacy batching cannot. Can decentralized oracles fix data reliability for AI? Yes. Decentralized oracles provide cryptographic proofs and multiple data sources so AI agents can rely on tamper-resistant inputs for automated decision-making and reduce single-source failures. Key Takeaways Speed matters : Blockchain enables the low-latency settlement AI agents require. Programmability : Crypto lets money be encoded into contracts and agent logic. Institutional adoption : Will be gradual; macro factors and custody solutions are key triggers. Conclusion AI agents and crypto are complementary: AI agents need fast, verifiable, programmable rails and crypto provides them.

Traders are using scaled 10% profit-taking at resistances to manage risk, per IncomeSharks. Key trigger: Weekly close above $4,000 confirms continuation Structured selling of 10% at resistance points keeps targets like $4,800 conditional on momentum. Repeated dips below supports followed by rapid recoveries (fakeouts) highlight persistent demand; prior support near $3,600 remains central. Ethereum $4,000 resistance explained: watch weekly closes, scaled profit-taking, and targets to $4,800 — actionable analysis from COINOTAG newsroom. What is driving Ethereum’s battle at $4,000? Ethereum $4,000 acts as both a psychological and technical gatekeeper that determines near-term direction. Repeated intraday breaks followed by fast recoveries have created a pattern of fakeouts, forcing traders to prioritize weekly structure and scaled risk management over single-session moves. How would a weekly close above $4,000 affect Ethereum’s outlook? A weekly close above $4,000 would signal sustained buyer control and likely open a path toward $4,400–$4,800. Analyst Ted compares the level to Bitcoin’s $12,000 in 2020, where a decisive weekly resolution preceded a larger expansion. Volume confirmation and follow-through on daily closes would strengthen the breakout case. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ethereum-4000-battle"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum’s $4,000 Level Remains Key Resistance as Traders Test Weekly Structure"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2Hk3eLaIAIUGBu-1-1024x535.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Ethereum’s $4,000 level is the decisive near-term resistance; traders watch weekly closes, volume and scaled profit-taking toward $4,800 while $3,600 remains key support.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Ethereum's $4,000 resistance"", ""description"": ""Stepwise guide to assess whether Ethereum's reclaim of $4,000 is a breakout or a fakeout."", ""totalTime"": ""PT30M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm a weekly close"", ""text"": ""Monitor a sustained weekly close above $4,000; weekly structure matters more than intraday spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check volume and follow-through"", ""text"": ""Look for above-average volume and consecutive daily closes above $4,000 to validate momentum."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Use scaled profit-taking"", ""text"": ""Implement structured selling (for example 10% at resistance tiers) to lock gains while retaining exposure to a larger move."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What happens if Ethereum closes the week above $4,000?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A weekly close above $4,000 would likely confirm bullish continuation and open targets near $4,400–$4,800, provided volume and daily follow-through support the move."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are recent dips under support false breakouts?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""IncomeSharks describes repeated dips followed by swift recoveries as fakeouts that trap bears; these reversals indicate persistent buyer demand around $3,600."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What risk management are traders using at resistance?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders are scaling profits by selling roughly 10% at each resistance layer to manage exposure while keeping upside participation."" } } ]} Ethereum’s $4K level remains the key resistance as analysts monitor repeated fakeouts and critical weekly close signals. IncomeSharks notes repeated dips below support followed by fast recoveries, reinforcing bullish resilience. Analyst Ted says only a weekly close above $4K would confirm continuation, comparing it to Bitcoin’s $12K breakout. Structured 10% profit taking at resistance levels suggests confidence but keeps $4,800 dependent on sustained strength. Context and market structure: Ethereum’s price action centers on $4,000, which has alternated between support and resistance in recent sessions. That oscillation creates a short-term battleground that defines near-term bias for traders and funds. Pattern of fakeouts: IncomeSharks documents several cases where ETH dipped below key supports and then rebounded quickly. These moves have trapped bearish positions and suggested buyers are defending lower levels, with $3,600 repeatedly acting as a resilient support base. Why are traders selling into strength near $4,800? Traders are executing staged profit-taking to manage risk while preserving upside. Selling 10% at resistance points allows participants to capture short-term gains without fully exiting positions. This strategy makes higher targets like $4,800 contingent on continued buying pressure and consistent closes above $4,000. Source: IncomeSharks on X When should traders expect a clear directional resolution? A clear directional resolution depends on multi-session structure. A single intraday spike above $4,000 is less meaningful than a weekly close with confirmatory volume. If ETH holds above $4,000 for several sessions and posts higher highs, targets around $4,400 and $4,800 become attainable. If not, $3,600 remains the likely fallback. Frequently Asked Questions What is the significance of $3,600 support? $3,600 has acted as a repeat recovery zone after brief breakdowns. Rebounds from this level indicate demand and provide a stop-loss reference for traders managing downside exposure. How do fakeouts change short-term strategy? Fakeouts encourage traders to focus on weekly closes and scaled entries rather than chasing intraday moves. They also favor risk management tools like staggered take-profit orders and trailing stops. Key Takeaways Weekly close matters : A sustained weekly close above $4,000 is the primary confirmation signal. Scaled risk management : Selling ~10% at resistances preserves upside while locking profits. Support to watch : $3,600 is the immediate support that has held after recent fakeouts; failure risks deeper consolidation. Conclusion Ethereum’s near-term direction pivots on the $4,000 level. Traders and funds are prioritizing weekly structure, volume confirmation, and staged profit-taking to differentiate genuine breakouts from recurring fakeouts.

Solana: Under Pressure, Poised For Pivot Solana price sits near $202.18 after a swift pullback of roughly 16 percent. Bulls need the $200 zone to hold or the market may probe $185 to $195 support. A decisive reclaim above $210 could open $220 to $240 into Q4 if momentum revives. More than 70 percent of the supply is staked, which tightens the float and can amplify rallies when demand returns. The Solana price story remains a high-growth narrative, yet the near term path is fragile, so capital is selectively rotating toward utility plays. Remittix: The PayFi Challenger Many Call The Best Crypto To Buy Now As Solana price chops around key levels, Remittix is being positioned as the best crypto to buy now by investors who want real-world utility with upside. Remittix is a cross-chain PayFi project that connects crypto to bank accounts across 30-plus countries with low friction. The team is fully audited by CertiK, ranked #1 for Pre pre-launch tokens, and live wallet beta testing is underway with community users. BitMart listing was secured after the $20M milestone, LBANK followed after $22M, and a third listing is in preparation. The current RTX price is about $0.1130, placing it firmly in the ‘top crypto under $1’ conversation for early positioning. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction • Users can move crypto into real bank accounts in 30 plus countries, which solves a payment problem that pure speculation cannot. • The mobile first wallet beta is live, with real time FX conversion designed for everyday transfers. • CertiK verification and the top ranking for pre launch tokens strengthen trust for cautious buyers. • Exchange momentum with BitMart and LBANK signals liquidity pathways from day one. • Community growth and steady funding show product market fit, not just hype. Remittix does not try to outcompete Solana on throughput; it rides major chains while focusing on settlement into money people actually spend. Bottom Line For Q4 If you follow Solana price into Q4, you know the setup can flip fast. But if you want the best crypto to buy now with a payment use case, live beta, CertiK strength, and confirmed listings, Remittix keeps checking boxes. Miss the early window, and you may watch others lock better entries while you chase.

The shutdown also threatens delays to key U.S. economic data , including Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers, creating more uncertainty for global markets and pushing the dollar lower. Bullion is now up more than 47% this year, on track for the biggest annual gain since 1979. The surge has been fueled by central bank buying and heavy inflows into gold-backed ETFs after the Federal Reserve resumed interest rate cuts. September ETF inflows were the largest in three years, according to Bloomberg data. Spot gold traded at $3,864.60 per ounce at 1:11 p.m. in Singapore after closing 0.7% higher on Tuesday, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index flat. Global markets are trading sideways as shutdown reality deepens The shutdown began after two failed attempts by the Republican-controlled Senate to pass a temporary spending bill on Tuesday. Democrats want the measure to include an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits for millions of Americans. President Donald Trump had called a government shutdown “probably likely” and said, “I didn’t see them bend even a little bit.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told employees to prepare for a potential funding lapse, as Cryptopolitam reported. Trump also suggested his administration could take major actions during the shutdown, including cutting government benefits for “large numbers of people.” Both Republican and Democratic proposals failed, and the Senate adjourned after last-ditch votes. Silver also rallied, jumping as much as 2% to $47.5598 per ounce, less than 5% from its all-time high. The metal is up over 60% this year, driven by the same macro forces lifting gold as well as tight supply after years of deficits. Silver was up almost 1% after losing 0.6% in the previous session. Platinum and palladium both fell. The euro rose 0.3% to $1.1767, the highest since September 24. The dollar slipped 0.3% to 147.46, its lowest since September 19, extending a three-day slide of 1.2%. U.S. futures reflected the strain. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 192 points, or 0.41%, while S&P 500 futures dropped 0.44% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.51%. Europe’s FTSE gained 0.54% to 9,350.43, while the SMI, HEX, IBEX 35, and DAX were unchanged. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.16%, and the Topix dropped 1.71%. The Reserve Bank of India held rates at 5.5% as expected, with the Nifty 50 up 0.31% and the Sensex up 0.22%. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.79%, and the Kosdaq gained 0.56%. The Taiwan Weighted Index led Asian gains, adding 1.14% as healthcare and tech stocks drove the rise. Chip giant TSMC jumped 2.3% after Nvidia’s market cap passed $4.5 trillion. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.26%. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. Oil prices also moved. Brent crude futures for December delivery rose 28 cents to $66.31 per barrel at 0500 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 26 cents to $62.63 per barrel. The stock market has typically glided by previous government shutdowns, but analysts say this one could be riskier given the slew of economic factors at play. Though investors are still concerned about a slowing labor market and inflation risks as well as historically elevated stock valuations and market concentration levels. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated Tuesday that the shutdown will result in the furlough of about 750,000 federal employees. Over the weekend, Trump threatened mass firings of federal workers under a shutdown. Get seen where it counts.

House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, in a letter Tuesday to current SEC Chair Paul Atkins, pointed to an OIG report this September that indicated the Gensler-led SEC may not have operated with “integrity” between 2021 and 2025. Hill added that the committee is cooperating with the OIG “to understand their report better, to get clarity around unanswered questions, and to identify other areas in need of oversight.” Lawmakers slam Gensler over double standards The letter, also signed by Representatives Ann Wagner, Dan Meuser, and Bryan Steil, lambasted Gensler for applying standards to firms his own agency did not live up to. Gensler, for example, fined financial firms more than $400 million in penalties for “widespread record-keeping failures” in 2023, even as the SEC failed to preserve its own communication records due to IT mismanagement. At the beginning of the month, the Office of Inspector General [OIG], an independent office within the SEC, noted the agency’s tech office “implemented a poorly understood and automated policy that caused an enterprise wipe of Gensler’s government-issued mobile device.” The office stated that this, in turn, led to the loss of text messages between October 2022 and September 2023. During that period, the SEC raised multiple cases against crypto firms, including Coinbase and Binance. Coinbase recently asked a federal court to compel an “expedited proper search” of Gensler’s deleted texts. Gensler’s recordkeeping and security lapses fuel SEC credibility concerns Lawmakers also raised Gensler’s prior use of a personal email for business while he was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC’s sister agency “Collectively, these incidents, along with the OIG’s findings, raise serious concerns about former Chair Gensler’s and OIT’s [Office of Information Technology] compliance with federal recordkeeping laws, transparency obligations, and the integrity of agency oversight,” they said . The loss was exacerbated by poor change management, insufficient backup systems, unattended system alerts, and unpatched vendor software flaws, the OIG said. Deleted messages included discussions of SEC enforcement actions against specific crypto companies, which might have influenced how the regulator decided cases that shaped the industry. Crypto advocates have long accused Gensler of leading a Biden administration campaign to limit U.S. banking access for digital-asset firms and suing the sector aggressively in the process. The SEC’s credibility has already been called into question in the past following a security breach in January 2024 when hackers took over its official X account and falsely claimed that it had approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. X said later that the regulator had failed to enable two-factor authentication. In related developments, the SEC staff has opened up to allowing investment advisers to use state trust firms to custody digital assets. As reported by Cryptopolitan , a rare no-action letter from the SEC’s Division of Investment Management was issued on Tuesday, noting that it wouldn’t suggest the watchdog take disciplinary action if advisers used state trust firms as a crypto custodian. Law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett had sent a letter to the Division on Tuesday, seeking confirmation that registered financial institutions, such as venture capital firms, are free to custody crypto assets and will not face enforcement action by the regulator if they take the move. This is the second no-action letter from the SEC this week, showing the agency’s hands-off approach to crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. The White House has vowed to ease regulatory oversight of the sector to draw firms and projects to America. Get seen where it counts.

ChatGPT Makes Bold Claims,https://cryptopotato.com/how-high-can-xrp-go-as-uptober-kicks-off-chatgpt-makes-bold-claims/,"The historically bearish month for the cryptocurrency markets – September – is over, and it provided some enhanced volatility. Now, though, all eyes are on October, which is also referred to as ‘Uptober’ in the digital asset community due to the gains registered in the past. So, what’s next for XRP? Here’s ChatGPT’s take. XRP in Uptober The previous month began on the wrong foot for Ripple’s native token, which quickly dumped to the crucial support level at $2.70. It bounced off rather well in the following weeks and peaked at $3.20 on September 13 after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the first time in 2025. That was all she wrote in terms of gains, though, as the historical bearishness of September kicked in and drove the entire market south. XRP revisited the aforementioned support on a couple more occasions, but it managed to hold. It reclaimed some ground by September 30 and actually finished the month slightly in the green (around 3%). October is finally here, and Q4 has started, which usually goes well for the cryptocurrency markets. ChatGPT agreed with the overall bullish sentiment for the new month and quarter. In terms of monthly performance, it noted that XRP tends to do well in past Octobers, which is why the community can hope for some gains. Its most bullish case sees XRP surging beyond $4.50 and up to $6. It admitted that this is a bit unlikely, given the fact that the asset would need to double its value to reach the higher target, but noted that some news catalysts, such as a spot XRP ETF approval, could send it flying. The current odds on Polymarket for such a green light by the end of the year are close to 100%, even after the US government shutdown . Ripple ETF Approval Odds on Polymarket The more likely scenario for XRP, according to ChatGPT, is to peak somewhere between $3.50 and $4.50, which would still represent a solid surge in October. “If I were to place a probabilistic target, I’d lean toward $3.50 to $4.50 as the upper bound for October (assuming the ETF approvals happen and crypto sentiment remains supportive). It’s unlikely (though not impossible) that XRP would hit a massive new all-time high within a month unless multiple catalysts align perfectly.” The Warning Despite the bullish predictions above, the AI solution also warned investors about the possibility of a pullback due to the crowd’s expectations and hype. It reminded of Warren Buffett’s immortal financial words that people should be greedy when others are fearful and vice versa. As such, it cautioned that XRP, alongside the rest of the market, could correct in the following month(s) in contrast to what many anticipate – a massive run in Q4. The retracement for XRP could be intensified if the SEC actually surprises everyone and rejects the ETF applications, the trading volumes disappear, or there’s a bigger market-wide downturn, ChatGPT added.

We believe that the Sharpe Ratio’s use of total realized volatility may have overestimated bitcoin’s true risk. As of September 15, bitcoin’s Omega Ratio over the previous year was 1.29, upside returns outpacing downside returns by 29%. By David Puell Introduction This article is written not only for investors with an intermediate-to-advanced degree of knowledge about financial metrics, but also for bitcoin skeptics whose concerns persist even as the asset is maturing in institutional markets. During its 16-year history, conservative investors have observed that: “Bitcoin is too volatile,” or, more specifically, “Bitcoin’s returns are not worth the anxiety associated with its volatility.” In our view, such observations miss the nuances of bitcoin’s price history: they fail to separate its upside reward from its downside risk . As a result, we believe many, if not most, investors have underallocated to bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios. In this article, I review and explore techniques to gauge bitcoin’s risk relative to its reward and to assess its portfolio viability relative to other asset classes. The Sharpe Ratio A widely regarded financial metric, the Sharpe Ratio assesses the potential risk relative to reward of an asset, helping analysts and investors with financial modeling and portfolio optimization. Designed to measure the unit of reward per unit of risk, the Sharpe Ratio is constructed as follows: Interestingly, the Sharpe Ratio equates risk to an asset’s total realized volatility over time. While somewhat controversial, that notion is widely applied in financial analysis. 1 How does the Sharpe Ratio measure bitcoin’s risk relative to its reward? The chart below captures bitcoin’s mean returns and realized volatility—the numerator and denominator of the Sharpe Ratio, respectively—on a yearly basis over the past 14 years. 2 As of September 15, 2025, bitcoin’s yearly returns and volatility have averaged 76.4% and 44.1%, respectively. In other words, the rewards have been “worth” the risk. Source: Glassnode, as of September 15, 2025.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. That said, we believe that the Sharpe Ratio’s use of total realized volatility may have overestimated bitcoin’s true risk. Why, we ask, should the volatility of upside returns penalize risk-adjusted returns? Financial research offers two meaningful alternatives that adjust for the volatility of upside returns. The Sortino Ratio Contrary to the Sharpe Ratio, the Sortino Ratio assumes that the risk of holding an asset is denoted by the downside volatility realized over time, as follows: In this measurement of risk-adjusted returns, the reward is penalized only by the volatility associated with negative returns—the true “pain” of holding bitcoin long term. Compared to total volatility, downside volatility is always lower, as shown in the red compared to the blue shaded areas below. 3 Source: Glassnode, as of September 15, 2025. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The chart above illustrates that the Sharpe Ratio demands a higher hurdle rate of return to break above a minimum acceptable risk compared to Sortino. In turn, the table below illustrates how, on average, the volatility hurdle implied by the Sharpe Ratio (79.7%) tends to be roughly one and a half times the volatility hurdle of the Sortino Ratio (47%). This implies a “premium” penalty of 70.5%—or 32.7 percentage points (pp)—presented by the Sharpe Ratio over the Sortino Ratio. Sharpe(Total Volatility) Sortino(Downside Volatility) Absolute Premium Relative Premium 2011 177.8% 94.1% 83.7 pp 88.9% 2012 79.6% 49.8% 29.8 pp 59.8% 2013 145.2% 87.2% 58 pp 66.5% 2014 75.2% 46.3% 28.9 pp 62.4% 2015 69.1% 45.5% 23.6 pp 51.9% 2016 48.5% 30% 18.5 pp 61.7% 2017 93.7% 50.2% 43.5 pp 86.7% 2018 81.5% 53.3% 28.2 pp 52.9% 2019 68.1% 38.3% 29.8 pp 77.8% 2020 73.2% 48.7% 24.5 pp 50.3% 2021 80.2% 46.2% 34 pp 73.6% 2022 63.6% 42.3% 21.3 pp 50.4% 2023 43.7% 21.8% 21.9 pp 100.5% 2024 53.3% 28.3% 25 pp 88.3% 2025 (YTD) 44.1% 23.7% 20.4 pp 86.1% Average 79.7% 47% 32.7 pp 70.5% Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025, based on data from Glassnode, as of September 15, 2025.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. As of September 15, 2025, bitcoin’s year-over-year Sharpe and Sortino ratios were 1.7 and 3.2, respectively. The Omega Ratio Instead of accounting only for mean-variance (Sharpe) or downside deviation (Sortino), we now add the Omega Ratio to our analysis because of the clarity it lends to measuring the entirety of the return distribution. The Omega Ratio evaluates the probability-weighted gains versus losses, making it especially valuable in non-normal or fat-tailed distributions, such as crypto or assets where extreme outcomes are common. This simplified version of the Omega Ratio, also known as Gain/Loss Ratio compares bitcoin’s cumulative positive returns against its cumulative negative returns, defining every unit of reward per unit of risk in a direct, linear fashion. In this case, we assume 0% returns as the minimum “hurdle” the investor would expect for holding the asset. As with the Sortino Ratio, we believe the Omega Ratio portrays a more accurate measurement of risk-adjusted returns.

Bitcoin In A Portfolio: Sortino And Omega Case Studies Bitcoin’s Risk-Adjusted Returns We begin this case study by comparing bitcoin’s various risk-adjusted return ratios against those of four major asset classes: US equities, US bonds, US real estate, and gold. First, in the table below, we show how bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is higher, on average, than other asset classes over various 5-year periods.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. That said, if we compare bitcoin’s Sortino Ratio to that of the other asset classes, the difference—or “delta”—is even more striking, with bitcoin increasing its gap considerably when compared to equities, the second top performer. Note: The indices used as asset class representatives for the portfolio optimizations in this study are MSCI US Broad Market Index (MZUSB, US stocks), Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index (LBUFTRUU, US bonds), MSCI US REIT Index (RMZ, US real estate), and LBMA Gold Price PM (GOLDLNPM, gold).

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Lastly, bitcoin’s Omega Ratio, similar to the Sortino Ratio, also results in a larger gap between the cryptocurrency and its legacy counterparts, as shown below.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Based on the averages, the difference—“delta”—between each bitcoin risk-adjusted return ratio and the second best per table equals +0.22 pp for Sharpe, +2.18 pp for Sortino, and +0.85 pp for Omega—confirming how bitcoin tends to stand out even more among asset classes when discounting penalties for upward volatility. Portfolio Optimization Next, for the purposes of portfolio optimization, we believe that bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns are best measured by penalizing only for downside risks—by compartmentalizing, in other words, the realized “pain” or cost of holding the asset from the benefits of upward momentum. As a result, we will again use the Sortino and Omega Ratios to assess bitcoin’s place in an optimal portfolio, using the Sharpe Ratio as our benchmark. Furthermore, our comparison frames bitcoin as a component in a portfolio that also comprises representatives of the typical major asset classes—once again, equities, bonds, real estate, and gold—using the Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega Ratios across a rolling 5-year window between year-end from December 2015 to 2024. For the purposes of running these hypothetical portfolio scenarios, we assume the typical risk-free rate, with target expected returns for Sortino and Omega of 0%—an absolute minimum hurdle. Allocation In Max Sharpe Optimization Allocation In Max Sortino Optimization Allocation In Max Omega Optimization 2011-2015 0.8% 6.7% 4.5% 2012-2016 1.0% 8.9% 8.3% 2013-2017 1.0% 10.0% 8.4% 2014-2018 2.7% 4.2% 3.2% 2015-2019 4.3% 5.1% 4.1% 2016-2020 4.7% 5.4% 2.5% 2017-2021 5.5% 4.0% 2.1% 2018-2022 7.0% 4.5% 3.0% 2019-2023 20.8% 23.1% 21.7% 2020-2024 27.0% 21.1% 18.2% Average 7.5% 9.3% 7.6% Note: The green cells in the table represent when the Sortino or Omega Ratio is higher than the Sharpe Ratio. The indices used as asset class representatives for the portfolio optimizations in this study are MSCI US Broad Market Index (MZUSB, US stocks), Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index (LBUFTRUU, US bonds), MSCI US REIT Index (RMZ, US real estate), and LBMA Gold Price PM (GOLDLNPM, gold).

During the last 10 years, across a 5-year horizon, the Sortino and Omega maximizations on average have out-recommended bitcoin compared to Sharpe—+1.8 pp and +0.1 pp, respectively.

If only Sortino and Omega are considered, the cross-average recommended allocation becomes 8.4% per year. We hope that this article helps investors measure bitcoin’s risk in all its nuances, potentially serving as a guide for those seeking to measure risk when assessing bitcoin, or any asset, as a part of their portfolio. Important Information Regarding Bitcoin Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and the market for bitcoin is subject to rapid changes and uncertainty. Bitcoin is largely unregulated and bitcoin investments may be more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than more regulated investments. Bitcoin is subject to unique and substantial risks, including significant price volatility and lack of liquidity, and theft. Bitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for bitcoin, and other factors. There is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain its value over the long term. ARK strongly encourages any investor considering an investment in bitcoin or any other digital asset to consult with a financial professional before investing. All statements made regarding bitcoin are strictly beliefs and points of view held by ARK and are not recommendations by ARK to buy, sell or hold bitcoin. Historical results are not indications of future results. Footnotes As an example, an article by Voss and Howard clarifies how volatility does not necessarily equal risk. See Voss, J., and T. Howard. 2017. “The Active Equity Renaissance: New Frontiers of Risk.” Enterprising Investor. CFA Institute. Mean returns are annualized by multiplying by 365 and realized volatility is annualized by multiplying standard deviation times the root of 365. In this section, mean returns are annualized by multiplying by 365 and realized volatilities are annualized by multiplying the respective standard deviations times the root of 365. We annualize the ratios by dividing the unscaled mean returns by the standard deviation, then multiplying the result by the root of 365.

On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens confirmed the purchase in an X post earlier today. Tether Continues To Stack Bitcoin Tether, the issuer of the top USD-pegged stablecoin USDT, today purchased another 8,888 BTC, increasing its total Bitcoin reserves to new highs. Onchain Lens said that Tether acquired it on the last day of Q3, 2025. Following the Bitcoin purchase, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the acquisition in an X post, saying, “yeah.” With today’s purchase, Tether’s total holdings now stand at almost 10,940 BTC. Tether’s total BTC holdings have propelled it to second position among private companies with the most BTC reserves. The list is currently led by Block One, which currently holds 164,000 BTC, worth roughly $18.5 billion. In the overall list, including public companies, Tether is now ranked third, behind Strategy, which leads the list by far, holding 640,031 BTC on its balance sheet, according to data from Coingecko. It should be noted that this is not the first time that Tether has acquired such a huge amount of BTC. The company purchased a similar amount of BTC and transferred it to its wallet at the end of Q1, 2025. To recall, Tether started buying BTC as part of its reserves back in September 2022. Subsequently, in May 2023, the firm announced that it would allocate up to 15% of its net profits each quarter to purchase more BTC. Since announcing its BTC buying strategy, Tether has consistently enhanced its BTC reserves as part of its long-term diversification strategy. It is worth noting that Tether-backed Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One also holds around 43,514 BTC currently. Tether’s Bitcoin reserve wallet address, starting with “bc1qj” is also among the top ten single address holders of BTC. The wallet trails several centralized exchange cold wallets, such as those of Binance. The Rush For Accumulating BTC Tether’s move to accumulate BTC is not an isolated incident. An increasing number of firms have been actively purchasing BTC over the last few years, seeing the digital asset’s extraordinary price appreciation in a relatively short period. For instance, Strategy recently added to its already high amount of BTC holdings, purchasing 196 BTC. Similarly, Cyprus-based ship-owning firm Robin Energy recently made its first BTC acquisition, as it bought the flagship cryptocurrency worth $5 million. The trend of companies buying BTC in large amounts is likely to dry up the asset’s active circulating supply, as confirmed in a recent report by Fidelity. This could put further upside price pressure on BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $113,219, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Acquisition|Bitcoin Adoption|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|stablecoin|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 07:00:03

Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Round 2? Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest Kazakhstan Adoption Pushes BNB To $1,000 Nearly two weeks after breaking above the $1,000 milestone for the first time, BNB is attempting to hold this key area as support following the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has recorded a massive multi-month rally this quarter, surging 54% since the July opening. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has climbed 16% from the start-of-September lows, turning the crucial $800-$900 zone into support before surging toward its latest all-time high (ATH) of $1,083 nine days ago. Nonetheless, the altcoin’s massive run was halted during the end-of-month pullback, which saw most cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), hit multi-week lows. BNB dropped over 10% from last week’s high, losing the critical $1,000 breakout level on Friday. During the pullback, the altcoin retested the $930 level as support, bouncing off this level over the weekend and reclaiming the crucial barrier yesterday morning. The recent price surge was driven by Kazakhstan’s announcement of its investment in the altcoin. On Monday, Kazakhstan announced the launch of its first crypto reserve, the Alem Crypto Fund, aimed at long-term investment in digital assets. According to the statement, Binance Kazakhstan is the strategic partner of the fund, which was established by the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan. As part of the partnership, Alem Crypto Fund made BNB its first investment. Nurkhat Kushimov, General Manager of Binance Kazakhstan, stated that “The fund’s choice of BNB as its first digital asset highlights the trust in the Binance ecosystem and marks a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan.” Price Discovery Continuation In Q4? It’s worth noting that the BNB Chain ecosystem also saw a strong performance, with multiple projects built on the network leading in terms of profitability. As reported by NewsBTC, BNB Chain projects led Binance Wallet’s top ten Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) list with up to 2,000x historical returns, while BSC projects led the top five Alpha trading volume rankings. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades suggested that neither BNB nor BSC-related tokens’ rally is over yet, as the “market is eager for a narrative or chain to gamble on.” Analyst Ali Martinez affirmed that the token “still has many legs up,” suggesting that successfully holding this level could target new highs. The analyst previously stated that BNB’s price targets the $1,200-$1,300 area as part of its bullish breakout from its macro range. Turning the current area into support in the higher timeframes could set the stage for a price discovery continuation with a 20%-30% run in the coming months. On the contrary, a rejection from this level could see the price retest the $900-$930 area again.

As of this writing, BNB is trading at $1,002, a 1.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-a-flush-out-is-better-than-a-quick-pump-heres-what-it-means/,"Technical analyst Egrag Crypto has once again provided an in-depth perspective on XRP’s price movement, emphasizing the importance of structural health in the market rather than short-lived rallies. His analysis suggests that the asset could experience another downward flush before any significant upward momentum, a move he considers more sustainable in the long run. #XRP – A Flush Out is Better Than a Quick Pump! Same Stance: My long-term view on #XRP hasn’t changed, so do not start crying in the comments section. It’s important to understand the context of each post and the time frame I’m discussing. Fair Value GAP Analysis I… pic.twitter.com/XtcLAZV60i — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 29, 2025 Probabilities of Market Scenarios According to Egrag, the probability of XRP undergoing a flush-out before resuming its uptrend sits at around 70%. He views this outcome as more favorable than the alternative, which he assigns a 30% likelihood. In the less probable scenario, XRP could surge immediately, but he warns that such a move would risk a sharp correction. From his perspective, a more measured decline followed by recovery would create a stronger base for growth. The Role of the Fair Value Gap Central to his analysis is the concept of the fair value gap (FVG), which he identifies between $2.35 and $2.40. Egrag argues that markets often return to these gaps as part of a process known as mean reversion, where prices align back to their average or fair value. In this case, the FVG acts as both a target and a potential support zone. He highlights that once this range is filled, it could serve as a foundation for a more aggressive upward move, establishing a stronger market structure. Time Frame Considerations Egrag bases his current outlook on the three-day chart, a time frame he consistently uses for long-term clarity while still accounting for short-term volatility. He recalls a previous gap that took 129 days to fill, drawing a parallel to the present setup. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While not providing a specific timeline for the upcoming move, he notes that if the pattern repeats, the market could be approaching an important turning point by mid-November. Key Levels and Expectations In terms of price levels, the analyst identifies $2.65 as a near-term area to monitor. If that point holds, it could suggest the market has found temporary stability. However, his preferred scenario is for XRP to dip further into the $2.30 to $2.40 zone before initiating what he refers to as the final leg upward. He stresses that this potential flush would not weaken the asset’s long-term trajectory but would instead reinforce its structural integrity. Egrag Crypto’s perspective maintains a cautiously optimistic tone, balancing the short-term possibility of a deeper correction with the longer-term potential for significant gains. By focusing on the fair value gap as both a technical target and a structural support, his analysis emphasizes sustainability over immediate price surges.

Here's the Latest Altcoin Listed,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-upbit-releases-new-listing-announcement-heres-the-latest-altcoin-listed/,"South Korea-based global cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced support for a new digital asset. According to the announcement, Somnia (SOMI) will be listed with KRW, BTC, and USDT trading pairs. Upbit Launches New Transaction Support for Somnia (SOMI) Deposits for SOMI will open within 2 hours of the announcement, while transaction support will begin at 16:00 on October 1st. The exchange warned investors to be careful with their network selection. SOMI can only be deposited and withdrawn via the Somnia network. Transfers made via other networks will not be accepted, and refunds may take longer. Furthermore, transactions will only be processed through “self-wallet verified addresses.” Upbit has also implemented some temporary restrictions for investor protection. Buy orders will be restricted for the first five minutes after trading begins, while sell orders 10% below the previous day's closing price will not be allowed for the same period. Additionally, only limit orders will be valid for 2 hours after the trade is opened. The Somnia network is described as an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain optimized for high-throughput applications. The project stands out with its capacity for millions of transactions per second, sub-second finality, and parallel processing infrastructure. Somnia's native token, SOMI, will be used for staking, gas payments, and governance mechanisms. Experts say that SOMI's Upbit listing will increase its market visibility and attract interest among Korean investors. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin is currently performing positively and eyeing new weekly highs while altcoins continue to falter. US government officially shuts down, analysts warn of downward risks The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years. This latest development comes after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the lights on. While each shutdown differs, functions that are critical to protect lives and property are typically deemed essential and stay open. In the past, shutdowns have affected immigration hearings, while also delaying federal lending to homebuyers and small businesses. Analysts have cautioned traders about the ongoing events, as many believe assets could react to the government shutdown. Bitcoin maintains its price above $114K and could rally higher in the near term. However, most altcoins have turned red despite recording some gains earlier this week. Analysts at Bitfinex pointed out that the shutdown would halt the release of key economic indicators such as the jobs data and CPI inflation. The delay in these reports could cause volatility across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The analysts added that, For markets, the immediate risk is confidence erosion and data blind spots, rather than systemic financial instability. Bitcoin eyes fresh upside as support at $113K holds Despite the US government shutdown, Bitcoin’s price has remained above $114k and could rally higher in the near term. The BTC/USD 4H Chart remains bearish and efficient, but could switch bullish if the current market conditions persist. BTC is up by nearly 2% since the start of the week and is now trading at $114,522. It closed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,402 on Tuesday and could rally higher towards the $117k resistance level over the next few hours or days. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) had a bullish crossover earlier this week, suggesting that buyers are gaining control of the market. The RSI of 66 also shows that BTC is currently in the bullish region. If the 50-day EMA at $113,402 continues to hold as support, the leading cryptocurrency could rally towards the next major resistance level at $117K in the near term. The $120k psychological mark remains a strong resistance level at the moment. However, if the market negatively reacts to the government shutdown, Bitcoin and other major assets could record losses. This could see Bitcoin fail to hold the support around the 50-day EMA and close below, allowing it to test the next daily support level at $107,245 over the next few days. The current market conditions remain choppy, with no clear direction. With the fourth quarter commencing, traders are already looking forward to key economic indicators that could determine Bitcoin’s performance over the next few months.

The decision doesn’t include a bilateral currency swap line. According to a joint statement released on October 1, the U.S. and South Korea reaffirmed their commitment to avoid manipulating the international monetary system, as outlined in the IMF Articles of Agreement. The initiative aims to present an effective balance of payments adjustment and unfair competitive advantage. Both parties aim to prevent unfair competitive advantage Washington and Seoul also agreed that any macroprudential or capital flow measures will not target exchange rates for trade advantage. The decision from both countries mirrors an agreement between the U.S. and Japan announced in August. In Japan’s deal, there was no mention that foreign exchange rates had to be market-determined. Unlike the Japan deal, the U.S.-South Korea agreement stipulates that both countries will continue to monitor currency market stability. The statement also highlighted that government investment vehicles will invest abroad for risk-adjusted return and diversification purposes, and not to target the exchange rate for competitive purposes. South Korea’s National Pension Service, the world’s third-largest pension fund, was not explicitly mentioned in the statement. The fund has emerged as a point of concern during Seoul’s trade negotiations with Washington. The report revealed that the U.S. has kept South Korea on its list of countries to monitor for their foreign exchange policies. Seoul was removed from the list in November 2023 for the first time since April 2016, but reappeared in November 2024. According to the report , South Korea utilizes the NPS funds for exchange rate intervention, with the U.S. stating that its use of funds for foreign exchange hedging could impact the Korean won’s value. The U.S. Department of the Treasury noted in its foreign exchange report released in June that there was a surge in foreign assets of the NPS and its swap line with the Bank of Korea. The report raised concerns among market participants that it might be regarded as a tool for currency intervention. Seoul also requested the exclusion of a bilateral currency swap line to address the foreign exchange implications of a $350 billion investment package agreed by both parties during trade negotiations in July. “Since the agreement sets mutual standards for foreign exchange policy with the U.S., it can be interpreted to mean that as long as these standards are upheld, South Korea is unlikely to be designated a currency manipulator.” -Jung Yue-jin, Chief Executive of South Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. The U.S. and South Korea agreed that market intervention should be used to tackle excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates. Both countries also agreed that market interventions would be considered equally appropriate for combating excessively volatile or disorderly depreciation or appreciation. Seoul plans monthly exchange of market operations with the U.S. The statement also reveals that Seoul agreed to exchange its market intervention operations with the U.S. every month. A South Korean official also mentioned that public disclosures will continue to be made every quarter, with a three-month delay. South Korea will disclose its foreign exchange reserves data and forward positions on a monthly basis to enhance communication and monitor foreign exchange market developments. The country will also reveal its currency composition of central bank reserves on an annual basis, despite the data already being publicly available. Seoul has maintained currency policy consultations with the U.S. through a channel between finance officials since it was put on the agenda at the opening round of trade negotiations in April. The country’s Ministry of Finance acknowledged that the latest initiative reaffirms the importance of close communication and mutual trust between the two countries’ financial authorities in ensuring foreign exchange market stability. Both countries agreed in July to reduce U.S. tariffs on Korean imports, including automobiles, from 25% to 15%. South Korea also pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S. as part of the deal, but the initiative has stalled due to Seoul’s concerns over the foreign exchange implications.

Bitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out. Total market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound. The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET). “The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk. “This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said. Jobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing. That usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added. Market structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations. “The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.” Kuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.” “On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted. Ethereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review. News around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months. Regulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves. Elsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-01 07:25:05

Since the majority of investors are revaluing their investments, the spotlight automatically falls on newer utility-based projects with far higher upside potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the better ones. Now priced at just $0.035 in presale, Mutuum Finance is building a strong decentralized finance platform with emphasis on peer-to-peer and pooled lending with the freedom of earning yield while still holding asset custody. The project has staking rewards with flexibility, deflationary tokenomics model, and genuine real-world usage aside from speculation madness, all the ingredients in favor of rapid adoption. With well over 16,670 holders already on board and more than $16.6 million worth of funds raised before its exchange listing, investors project MUTM’s initial growth path to dwarf that of veteran altcoins like SOL in 2025, thereby emerging as a top choice among explosive potential-seeking investors. Solana Bulls Take Command as Price Bounces Back From Crucial Demand Zone Having lost 13% during the week, Solana (SOL) is showing new life, with bulls successfully keeping a decisive demand zone at bay. The price dipped below $190, the lower side of a key support zone, before moving up towards $205, signaling new buying and a potential change in trend. Unless SOL dips to the $173–$186 zone, the positive trend is expected to continue unchallenged, with upside targets of $230, $242, $254, and $262 in contention. While Solana’s technicals are undoubtedly on the bulls’ side, most investors have also moved to newer growth assets, a move that has fueled meteoric interest in Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on its record-breaking run in its sixth presale phase. The project already hit 16,670 registered members and achieved more than $16.6 million, a record high for both, and is demonstrating growing belief in the marketplace for its long-term vision. Investors seeking sustainable returns and long-term value will find Mutuum Finance’s rapidly growing ecosystem an investment worth considering. Security is also one of the key cornerstones in Mutuum Finance’s vision. In the effort to develop a secure and strong ecosystem, the project has collaborated with CertiK to launch a bug bounty program with a total reward pool of $50,000. The project categorizes vulnerabilities into four levels, such as critical, major, minor, and low, and provides a solid framework for discovery and avoidance of potential issues before impacting users. The platform also includes a remarkably robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation architecture that dynamically responds to real-time collateral volatility. In addition to this, an additional layer of security is achieved through the imposition of a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier on riskier forms of collateral. Security and transparency designed infrastructure makes Mutuum Finance a stable, secure, and robust DeFi platform designed for long-term resilience and prosperity. High-Upside Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is firmly establishing itself as one of the most robust utility-driven cryptos for 2025, bringing in more than $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and more than 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. As Solana (SOL) bounces back from a 13% weekly decline, MUTM’s functional real-world DeFi application, flexible LTV model, and security-focused network are gaining good traction among retail and whale investors. Value seekers interested in placing high-upside wagers and long-term value appreciation will be eager to grab Mutuum Finance tokens before the presale cap is reached.

The coin, which survived a years-long bear market, is making a comeback through the quantum resistance narrative. ZCash (ZEC) rallied in the past few weeks, rising to a one-year peak above $79. ZEC has been largely forgotten after years of a bear market and aggressive pump-and-dump events. Now, the asset is reawakening, on track to rejoin the top 100 coins and tokens. ZEC rallied to the highest level in 12 months, with over 199% in net gains. | Source: Coingecko ZEC traded at $81.51 after a rapid mid-week expansion, rising to the highest level for the past 12 months. For the period, the token is up more than 199%. The current rally is the best performance for the token since the late 2024 price spikes. The coin rallied to the $80 range just days after breaking above the $56 resistance threshold. The most bullish expectations are for the rally to extend above $170. Currently, ZEC stands at its highest level since Q2 2022. Most of the ZEC price action comes from its Binance and KuCoin pairs, legacies from previous bull markets. ZEC launched before the rapid proliferation of tokens and was among the main privacy coins. The exchanges have retained their listings, despite a general trend of removing fully anonymous assets. Why is ZEC rallying? ZEC is trading with a slight premium on Binance, as well as the Rhea Finance DEX on Near Protocol. The current trading for ZEC uses its tokenized form, and not actual coins from the ZCash network. The trading is speculative, as not all protocols reflect the actual usage of the ZCash network. Since April, Binance recovered its ZEC withdrawals to the ZCash chain, meaning some of the recent trading may reflect true demand for the coins. Nearly 70% of ZEC trading is against USDT. The coin has lost its legacy trading venues and is hardly represented on Perp DEXs. Additionally, ZEC has also acquired a derivative market, mostly through Binance and Bybit. Some of the recent price action may be an attack on short positions. A larger proportion of traders shorted ZEC just before its recent rally, triggering a short squeeze. Is ZEC quantum-resistant? One of the reasons for interest in ZEC is its claims to quantum resistance. ZEC has been deemed resistant to currently available quantum technology , which may in theory decode legacy coins like BTC. The other reason for the ZEC rally is attention from Qubic, the mining project that previously targeted Monero. The Qubic mining pool took over Monero mining, also sparking a price rally. However, Qubic has since set its sights on mining DOGE, leaving ZEC behind. For now, ZEC does not have to deal with concerns of a reorg or a 51% attack , the typical MO of Qubic when demonstrating its mining technology. The involvement of Qubic’s mining pool also helped push Monero (XMR) to a permanently higher range. XMR has traded at the $297.60 range for the past month after years of hovering around $100.

While the hype is building up for the possibility of Ethereum crossing $10,000 by 2026, investor interest is expanding to the whole ecosystem rather than the giants. At the same time, newer projects such as Remittix (RTX) are consistently making progress. Launched at a mere $0.11 per token, analysts believe it can cross more than $5 by 2026, anticipating the growing popularity of investment in nascent stages. This alludes to how current networks and emerging projects are building the future of digital assets together. Ethereum Market Developments Ethereum remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies powering decentralized finance and Web3. Recent figures place ETH at $4,155.1, a 1.1% increase in a day. The asset’s market cap is now at $501.95 billion, with daily trading volume at $40.17 billion, up 29.61%. These figures confirm the network as the leader in decentralized exchanges, NFT platforms, and smart contracts. The strength of Ethereum continues to attract long-term investors looking for stability along with growth. With scaling solutions and Layer 2 answers on the increase, ETH remains in top of mind discussions on the best crypto to purchase now and the upcoming dominant altcoin. It is considered by many as a key barometer of the well-being of the overall crypto market. Remittix’s Growing Ecosystem With Ethereum continuing to advance, Remittix (RTX) has been a practicable low gas cost cryptocurrency project for real-world payments. RTX can be bought for $0.1130 per token, and more than 673 million tokens have been sold and more than $26.8 million in presale. As a cross-border transaction-based project, it constitutes both a Remittix DeFi project and a successful payments network. Remittix hit its presale milestone of $20 million recently, which revealed its first future CEX listing on BitMart. Within a short while after that, it broke $22 million, which revealed LBANK as its second future exchange listing. These actions are higher levels of accessibility for early stage crypto investment choices within utility-first tokens. Security, Utility, and Community One of Remittix milestones came when it was fully verified by CertiK as team and ranked as the #1 pre-launch token on the platform. This ranking highlights its focus on trust, transparency, and real-world adoption. In the meantime, the beta launch of the Remittix wallet continues, allowing community members to try fast transactions and low gas fees. Remittix has also begun a $250,000 giveaway and introduced a 15% reward referral scheme in USDT, one of the most vibrant next-gen crypto initiatives. With all of these qualities, Remittix is setting itself up to be more than a speculative buy—it is a utility crypto with real use designed for borderless payments and daily usage. Why Utility Matters in 2025 With the narrative growing around Ethereum’s long-term potential, projects like Remittix indicate another direction of the market—adoption driven by utility. Investors are searching more and more for the best crypto presale of 2025, low-gas-fee projects, and scalable solutions that have the capacity to support real-world demand. By bridging crypto and traditional banking in 30+ countries, Remittix is carving out its position alongside legacy networks like Ethereum. While ETH marches towards a $10,000 level by 2026, RTX is setting the stage at $0.1130, looking to offer valuable solutions in the world’s payment space. Both show how crypto innovation still swaps growth, stability, and utility in changing times.

Strong Entry into Ethereum and Bitcoin Spot ETFs: BlackRock Takes Leading Position Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total of $127 million in net inflows, while none of the nine listed funds experienced net outflows. The biggest inflow of the day was into BlackRock's ETHA ETF. ETHA alone attracted $127 million, bringing its historical total net inflow to $13.44 billion. This brings the total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs to $27.396 billion, equivalent to 5.41% of Ethereum's market capitalization. The historical total net inflow stands at $13.799 billion. Bitcoin spot ETFs also performed strongly on the same day, with total net inflows reaching $430 million and all 12 listed funds closing positive. BlackRock's IBIT ETF was the largest contributor. IBIT saw $199 million in inflows in a single day, bringing its total net inflow to $60.971 billion. Ark Invest and 21Shares' ARKB ETF came in second. ARKB saw $106 million in daily inflows, bringing its historical total to $2.271 billion. As of the latest data, the total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs has reached $150.771 billion, equivalent to approximately 6.6% of Bitcoin's market capitalization.

The Chinese account of Binance verified that the handle of @BNBCHAIN was hacked, and users should not like new posts. The account issued a warning that the official English-language BNB Chain account has been hacked. Attackers promoted a memecoin featuring CZ just two weeks after the creator commented that meme coins carry “utility” of memecoins. Hackers promote token CA via the compromised BNB Chain account. Source: X Along with the meme coin push , hackers shared links for free reward distribution through an airdrop event. One fraudulent post stated that users could receive early access to $BSC rewards if they participated within 24 hours. The links implicated in this scam led to phishing websites to acquire wallet credentials via Wallet Connect prompts. CZ warns about BNB Chain account compromise CZ responded directly on his personal X account, asking users to stay vigilant. He confirmed that a Binance security team had reached out to X, asking to suspend the compromised account, and is also working on takedown requests for the phishing domains. “The @BNBCHAIN account is compromised. The hacker posted links to phishing websites. Do NOT connect your wallet,” Zhao wrote, reinforcing his standard SAFU warning. He advised followers to exercise caution on all fronts, even when it is on official channels. Wider pattern of crypto account breaches The BNB Chain hack is one among a series of high-profile social media hacks in 2025. In February, the account of Pump.fun was stolen to advertise a fake governance token, and the account of a WIRED journalist was used to advertise a meme token. In March, the former president of Ghana, John Mahama, had his X profile used to advertise a fake Solana-based token called Solanafrica. In April, there were further cases where the account of a UK government minister, Lucy Powell, was hacked, in promotion of a fake community token. Following the breach, BNB fell 1.83% to $1,010 but managed to find support above the $1,000 support zone. Despite the setback, bulls still successfully defended the key level as the broader market headed into October on a positive note, with a brand given to it by traders: “ Uptober ” after a resilient September. On the other hand, BNB Chain saw the biggest inflow ever of stablecoins in a single 24-hour period. BNB also had a major breakout, and the $780-$800 resistance zone is now solid support. Analysts are pointing out that as long as the token is still trading above that range, momentum is heading toward higher price targets of $1,100 and $1,200.

The stalemate leaves agencies without money as the new fiscal year begins and threatens wide disruption, from air travel to public parks. About 800,000 workers, nearly 40% of the federal workforce, are expected to go without pay. A Shutdown That Feels Different The closure began at midnight on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to agree on a short-term measure to extend funding into fiscal 2026. It is the first shutdown since 2018, although this one comes with greater strain, as political talk of deeper cuts and even permanent layoffs looms over agencies already struggling with limited resources. Breaking News: The U.S. government has shut down, after Congress failed to pass a bill to keep federal funding flowing. Hundreds of thousands of workers are set to be sent home without pay, and a wide range of federal programs will be disrupted. https://t.co/q0caziSzXd pic.twitter.com/vEwubNgeNm — The New York Times (@nytimes) October 1, 2025 The Senate will revisit a Republican-backed funding plan, but progress looks unlikely without concessions from both parties. Until then, essential services continue on thin staffing while millions of Americans brace for fallout. Why Crypto Cares About Washington Gridlock Crypto is not directly tied to federal budgets, but it is not immune to the ripple effects. Shutdowns slow data releases, delay regulatory reviews and create a layer of uncertainty that unsettles investors. Analysts warn Bitcoin and Ethereum could be especially sensitive to swings, while smaller tokens may see sharper drops if volatility spikes. “Government shutdowns are not without precedence; should history be our guide, suggest little if any effects on markets,” said Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth at VeChain. He added that while the political noise feels louder, a solution is usually found. Crypto ETFs Could Face Delays Due to Shutdown One flashpoint is the timeline for spot crypto ETFs. In September, optimism grew that issuers including VanEck, 21Shares and Grayscale could secure approval for spot Solana ETFs in early October. That confidence followed SEC rule changes on Sept. 17 that streamlined the process and cut review times . Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas Seyffart put approval odds at 100% for this year. But Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store and host of ETF Prime, cautioned that the shutdown could throw off the schedule. Honestly the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their “clock” meaningless. That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready. https://t.co/5JtfTm82Wi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Looking Back To Look Ahead The average shutdown runs about eight days. In past episodes, markets recovered quickly once federal functions restarted. But if this one drags on for weeks, it could stall momentum by pushing back decisions at the Federal Reserve or slowing approvals for new investment products. SEC Left Running On Skeleton Crew Existing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, approved in 2024 and 2025, continue trading without disruption. However, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets would now be operating with less than 10% of its usual staff. As a result, crypto ETFs are not treated as essential. This means S-1 filings and final approvals will remain on hold until funding returns. What Investors Should Expect Next The shutdown does not mean crypto ETF applications are cancelled, only delayed. If lawmakers strike a deal soon, approvals could arrive this quarter. However, if the stalemate drags on, the momentum built in September may fade. As a result, market sentiment could weaken heading into year-end.

While many investors have reacted positively to this significant investment, caution has emerged from industry experts like Jacob King, CEO of SwanDesk, who warns that this move may contribute to what he believes could be the “largest bubble in history.” Bitcoin’s True Value Could Be Below $1,000 In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), King raised serious concerns about the Bitcoin market, claiming that 80-90% of the total buy volume is artificially inflated. He argues that Tether essentially creates money “out of thin air,” injecting it into Bitcoin and thereby exacerbating the speculative environment. Despite the growing trend of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, the cryptocurrency’s real value might be “far below $1,000.” Related Reading: Will October Crown Bitcoin Or Break It? Key Levels In Play This narrative has been ongoing for years, provoking varied responses within the community. One investor countered King’s assertion by asking why major institutional players, including sovereign ETFs and Fortune 500 companies, continue to invest in Bitcoin if such a large portion of the trading volume is deemed fake. His argument suggests that either these institutions are misinformed or that the real bubble lies within traditional fiat currencies rather than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. King refuted this notion, alleging that the idea of significant institutional investment in Bitcoin is largely “a myth.” He contended that most inflows into ETFs are driven by retail investors, not large institutions. Skepticism Vs. Optimism Further amplifying his skepticism, King criticized Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the largest publicly traded company holding over 600,000 BTC, describing it as a “leveraged Bitcoin casino.” He alleged that the company’s co-founder, Michael Saylor, has a history of inflating numbers during the dot-com bubble, suggesting that the current situation is a repetition of “past mistakes.” Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs In contrast, other experts like Quinten Francois view Tether’s recent Bitcoin purchase through a more optimistic lens. Francois highlights the US government’s push for stablecoin adoption via the GENIUS Act, which mandates that stablecoin issuers be licensed, transparent, and fully backed by US Treasuries. He argues that this regulatory framework could channel trillions in offshore Eurodollars into US bonds through stablecoins, effectively continuing quantitative easing but through these private entities rather than the Federal Reserve (Fed). At the time of writing, BTC is trading within the lower channel of its consolidation range at $113,200, with no clear indication of where prices will move next. According to CoinGecko data, the leading cryptocurrency is currently 8% below its all-time high.

Bitcoin Difficulty Will Reach A New ATH On Wednesday The “ Difficulty ” is a feature built into the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine blocks. The metric’s value changes about every two weeks in network “adjustments.” The Difficulty is fully controlled by the code that Satoshi wrote in, meaning that these adjustments happen without intervention from a human or an organization. The pseudonymous Bitcoin creator integrated one simple rule for the blockchain to follow: keep block time (that is, the average time it takes miners to find a block) consistent around 10 minutes. Satoshi added this feature to make sure that the growth in BTC’s supply, which happens every time miners receive block subsidy as compensation for mining a block, remains consistent. Whenever miners become faster at their task, the BTC network responds by upping its Difficulty just enough to slow the validators back down to the standard rate. Similarly, the chain has to drop the metric’s value if miners are struggling to keep up pace. In the last six adjustments, the network has raised its Difficulty, suggesting miners have continued to be faster than needed, as data from CoinWarz shows. As displayed in the above chart, five of these six previous positive adjustments all led to new all-time highs (ATHs) for the metric. This implies BTC mining has been the toughest it has ever been over the last couple of months. It would appear, however, that even six straight Difficulty increases haven’t been enough to slow the miners down, as the network is heading toward yet another positive adjustment. As is visible above, Bitcoin miners have produced blocks at an average time of 9.50 minutes per each since the last adjustment. This is 0.50 minutes faster than Satoshi’s optimal rate, so the chain is gearing up for a significant Difficulty increase of over 5% on Wednesday. This adjustment would take the indicator to a new ATH of 149.83 trillion hashes, extending the streak of jumps to seven. The seemingly never-ending run of Difficulty increases is a direct consequence of the relentless expansion that miners have recently been participating in, as the below chart from Blockchain.com shows. The 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate , a metric that tracks the total amount of computing power that miners have connected to the network, has been exploring new records for a while now. Miners have been leveraging the extra computing resources to continue to pump out blocks at extraordinary rates. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $113,500, up 1.6% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 08:00:21

Read how to verify domains and stay safe now. SlowMist’s chief security officer said the phishing domains behind BNB Chain’s compromised X account are tied to the notorious Inferno Drainer group. What happened when BNB Chain’s official X account was compromised? BNB Chain hacked when attackers gained access to its verified X account and posted phishing links that asked users to connect wallets via fake WalletConnect prompts. The posts were shared from an account with nearly four million followers and were used to drive traffic to look‑alike domains designed to drain wallets. Source: Changpeng Zhao How did attackers disguise phishing domains to trick users? Attackers used homograph-style tricks—swapping visually similar letters such as the letter “i” for “l”—to make phishing domains appear legitimate. SlowMist’s chief information security officer (handle: 23pds) flagged the domain manipulation and linked the infrastructure to the Inferno Drainer phishing‑as‑a‑service network, which has supplied turnkey wallet‑draining sites since 2022.

AI accelerates vulnerability discovery and exploitation Automated phishing and voice-synthesized social engineering reduce attack costs to pennies. Over 3% of total value locked was stolen in 2024; Immunefi has paid $100M+ in bounties. AI crypto attacks: learn defensive steps now with Immunefi insights — read best-practice countermeasures and adopt a unified security platform. What are AI crypto attacks and why do they matter? AI crypto attacks are instances where attackers use artificial intelligence to automate discovery, exploitation, and social engineering against blockchain projects. These attacks matter because they compress the time from finding a vulnerability to exploiting it, increasing theft risk and forcing projects to change how they secure code and infrastructure. How has AI changed vulnerability discovery and exploitation? AI tooling that once helped defenders is now widely available, enabling attackers to find and weaponize vulnerabilities rapidly. Immunefi CEO Mitchell Amador told COINOTAG that advanced auditing agents and automated scanners are no longer exclusive to security firms and can be replicated by state-linked groups and organized cybercrime. Automated scans and prompt-driven exploit generation reduce cost per attack to pennies, while AI-generated phishing calls and messages drastically improve social engineering success rates. Industry data shows over 3% of total value locked was stolen across the ecosystem in 2024, highlighting the real-world impact. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""AI crypto attacks are accelerating — Immunefi CEO on defenses"", ""description"": ""Immunefi warns AI has given attackers defender-grade tools, speeding discovery and exploitation.

Bug bounties and manual audits remain valuable but face limits. Immunefi has facilitated over $100 million in payouts to white-hat hackers and distributes $1M–$5M monthly, yet CEO Mitchell Amador says the approach has “hit the limits” due to scaling and incentive issues. Automated AI scanning catches common, low-hanging issues earlier, reducing the burden on manual reviews. However, subtle and context-dependent vulnerabilities still require deep human expertise, so hybrid models—AI-assisted audits plus targeted human review—are becoming the practical standard. How are attackers bypassing code security? Major incidents now often exploit non-code vectors: compromised front-ends, multi-sig misconfigurations, key-management failures, and sophisticated phishing. The $1.4 billion Bybit incident this year illustrated attackers replacing front-end multisig transactions rather than exploiting smart contract code. Immunefi emphasizes that a single large outlier hack each year follows a predictable distribution pattern; defending only code is insufficient without stronger infrastructure, governance, and human verification layers. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to defend against AI-driven crypto attacks"", ""description"": ""Practical steps projects can adopt to reduce exposure to AI-accelerated exploits."", ""image"": [], ""estimatedCost"": { ""@type"": ""MonetaryAmount"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""value"": ""Varies"" }, ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Embed AI into CI/CD and repositories"", ""text"": ""Integrate automated AI auditing agents into GitHub repositories and CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities before code reaches production."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Adopt whitelist-only access controls"", ""text"": ""Implement whitelist-only policies for internal resources to reduce successful spear-phishing and lateral movement."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Deploy multi-sig manual review for significant transactions"", ""text"": ""Assign trusted, security-focused reviewers to manually confirm high-value transactions before execution."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Combine AI scanning with targeted human audits"", ""text"": ""Use hybrid models where AI handles scale and humans focus on context-dependent, complex vulnerabilities."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can AI tools be used by criminal groups to hack crypto projects?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

AI can generate convincing voice and message impersonations at scale for negligible cost. Immunefi’s CEO noted that AI-driven calls and prompts can be executed for pennies, enabling mass spear-phishing campaigns that dramatically raise successful compromise rates. Should every project adopt AI auditing tools? Yes—integrating AI into development pipelines is recommended. Immunefi predicts widespread CI/CD integration will drive a precipitous drop in exploit volume within one to two years, while hybrid human checks remain essential for complex decisions. Key Takeaways AI levels the playing field : Defender-grade tools are now accessible to attackers, increasing speed of exploitation. Hybrid defenses work best : Combine AI scanning with targeted human expertise and manual review processes. Broader attack surface : Focus beyond smart contracts—multi-sig, front-ends, phishing, and governance are high-risk areas. Conclusion AI has fundamentally changed both offensive and defensive security in crypto. Immunefi and other security leaders recommend embedding AI into CI/CD, enforcing strict access controls, and building unified security platforms to defend against fast-moving threats. Projects that adopt hybrid AI-human security models and prioritize infrastructure hardening will be best positioned to reduce incidents going forward. Published by COINOTAG — updated 2025-10-01.

The review was conducted by audit firm Harris & Trotter LLP under the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000). Independent validation of reserves According to the report, USDf reserves are held in segregated, unencumbered accounts on behalf of token holders. The audit verified wallet ownership, collateral valuation, user deposits, and overall reserve sufficiency. Falcon Finance also publishes weekly verification of USDf issuance and reserves through its Transparency Page, with additional third-party reviews planned. “Independent quarterly audits are essential for building trust in stablecoin infrastructure. This review confirms that USDf is not only fully collateralized but backed by a diversified reserve base designed for resilience,” said Andrei Grachev, Founding Partner of Falcon Finance. “At Falcon, we are building stable, yield-generating infrastructure that meets the expectations of institutions, regulators, and onchain users alike.” The publication of the first quarterly audit sets a framework for regular reporting on USDf’s collateral base, with Falcon positioning the stablecoin as compliant and transparent infrastructure for institutional and on-chain adoption.

CryptoQuant Says These Alerts Are To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-big-move-cryptoquant-alerts-are-to-watch/,"On-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has revealed the five key Bitcoin on-chain alerts that could be to keep an eye on in the coming week. Bitcoin Is Observing Developments On These Metrics In a new thread on X, CryptoQuant has discussed about some Bitcoin on-chain alerts that could be to watch amid the consolidation phase in the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Makes $54 Million Coinbase Outflow: Sign Of Dip Buying? The first indicator shared by the analytics firm is the 60-day change in the market cap of USDT, the number one stablecoin. As is visible in the above chart, the 60-day change in the USDT market cap has continued to sit at a notable positive level recently, implying the stablecoin has been witnessing growth. Stablecoins are one of the main inlets of capital into the cryptocurrency sector, so growth in them can generally be a positive sign. Currently, the 60-day change in the USDT market cap has a value of $10 billion. “This is a clear sign of fresh liquidity entering the market,” notes CryptoQuant. Another stablecoins-related indicator that can be relevant for Bitcoin is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures the ratio between the market cap of BTC and combined that of all stables. A low value in the indicator can prove to be a bullish sign, as it implies investor purchasing power in the form of stablecoins is high compared to the Bitcoin market cap. From the below chart, it’s apparent that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the BTC SSR stands at a value of 21 right now, which is considered to be inside the “buy” territory. Another bullish sign that’s developing for Bitcoin is in the Accumulator Address Demand, an indicator that measures the demand that’s coming from addresses that have zero history of selling the cryptocurrency. These perennial HODLers now own 298,000 BTC, which is a new record. A metric that’s still inside the bearish zone, however, is the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP). This metric keeps track of the BTC flows happening between spot and derivatives exchanges. The indicator has been following a downtrend during the past few months, which is considered to be a bear market pattern. “Watch closely: a shift upward often marks the start of bullish momentum,” says the analytics firm. The final metric shared by CryptoQuant is the Realized Price of the short-term holders (STHs), which measures the average cost basis of the Bitcoin investors who got in during the last 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns Back To Neutral As BTC Breaks $114,000 During BTC’s recent plunge, the STHs briefly dipped into losses, but the asset has since recovered above their Realized Price of $109,775.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-5841800-xrp-price-rally-isnt-impossible-but-inevitable-heres-why/,"The debate surrounding XRP’s long-term value has resurfaced, with bold claims challenging the conventional assumptions applied to digital assets. XRP Enthusiast, known as XRP Dragon, shared a perspective that places XRP at the center of a global shift in how money is valued and moved. Rather than applying traditional valuation models, the argument suggests that XRP should be measured against the framework of a new digital financial system, one that fundamentally changes how capital flows across borders. Moving beyond traditional metrics The central point of XRP Dragon’s statement is that many critics dismiss the possibility of XRP reaching extreme valuations, such as $170,000 per token, because they rely on what he describes as “old world math.” This refers to models such as market capitalization, which are widely used to determine the potential growth of an asset. According to his view, these methods are no longer appropriate in an era where digital assets are becoming integrated into the financial infrastructure of banks, governments, and institutions. XRP, designed as a bridge asset , is seen as uniquely positioned to play a role in this transformation. Everyone says $XRP can’t reach $170k because they’re still using the “old world” math. But we’re not in the old world anymore. We’re stepping into a digital money system where value moves differently, and XRP was built to be the bridge. This is why I believe #XRP hitting $170k… pic.twitter.com/Ff6QKDOBFB — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) September 29, 2025 The attached explanation Alongside the post, a video was included featuring a woman who expanded on the reasoning behind this outlook. She began by drawing a comparison to the early internet era, pointing out that it would have been illogical to measure the potential of the internet using outdated tools such as a phone book. In her words, the phone book represented an old system that was incompatible with the technological advances that followed. She explained that the same logic applies to today’s financial landscape. Current methods, such as market capitalization , stem from the paper money era, and she argued that they do not capture the true scope of a digital economy. According to her explanation, money is now moving into a system of digital rails, where banks and even entire countries will rely on blockchain-powered solutions. In this vision, XRP is the key connector, bridging different assets and systems into a single interoperable network. The case for inevitability Both XRP Dragon’s post and the accompanying video conclude with the idea that XRP reaching $170,000 is not only possible but inevitable within this framework. The reasoning is that, as global financial infrastructure transitions to digital formats, the demand for a bridge asset could grow beyond the limits of traditional valuation metrics. Those who claim such a valuation is impossible are attempting to measure the future with tools designed for the past.

Bitcoin has broken through the $116,000 mark, climbing 2% in the past 24 hours and briefly reaching as high as $116,600. The rally is unfolding against a backdrop of a U.S. government shutdown and record-setting strength in gold, which is trading near $3,900. Ether (ETH) is following suit, jumping nearly 4% in the same 24-hour period to trade at $4,287. The surge in bitcoin during the European session has spilled over into U.S. crypto equities, fueling sharp pre-market activity. Strive (ASST) is the standout winner, soaring 25% to $3.15. Strategy (MSTR) , widely seen as a leveraged bitcoin play, is up more than 2% at $328 per share.

Recently, a competitive battle has erupted in the perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) sector, with emerging platforms like Aster and Lighter significantly challenging Hyperliquid’s former dominance. Last week, Aster surpassed Hyperliquid in terms of 24-hour trading volume. This has sparked a race among competitors to launch new DEXs, aiming to capture market share in this expanding field. In this context, Justin Sun announced the launch of a new DEX at the Token2049 conference in Singapore, signaling further intensification in this rapidly evolving landscape. The excitement, however, is likely to be short-lived, according to Lutz, who called DEXs as inherent pump-and-dump schemes. “DEXs are about giving access to markets without intermediaries, and they build momentum by relying heavily on incentives, it’s basically an inherent pump‑and‑dump scheme,” Lutz said. “I don’t mean that in a bad way or as a scam. It’s all public, you know what you’re getting into."" He likened the incentive programs to an advertising blitz that pays for attention, explaining that these platforms hook users with token rewards and fee rebates and then depend on that feedback loop to keep people trading. ""The question is, what sticks?"" he continued. This boom‑and‑bust cadence not only makes it hard for DEXs to retain liquidity over the long term, he added, it also means retail traders chasing outsized yields are exposing themselves to considerable volatility and risk. In contrast to the churn he sees in DeFi, Lutz said the largest centralized exchanges, led by Coinbase and its peers, are well-positioned to ride out these cycles and remain dominant long after the latest DEX incentives subside. He added that BitMEX’s goal is to straddle both worlds, noting that while he sees DeFi enduring and embraces it personally as a crypto native, institutions can't interact with it like they can with a centralized exchange. BitMEX’s Tokyo pivot The Japanese capital, not Hong Kong or Singapore, is where the trading volume is, according to Lutz. In August, the exchange officially moved its data infrastructure to AWS Tokyo from AWS Dublin in a move aimed at boosting liquidity. The switch has delivered the desired results, underscoring Japan’s attractiveness. ""We were in Ireland before … but it became more and more difficult because basically everyone except the U.S. players are in the Tokyo data centers,"" he said. He said the switch boosted liquidity by roughly 80% in BitMEX’s main contracts and up to 400% in some altcoin markets, gains he attributed not to market-maker intervention but to reducing latency by being in Tokyo. Looking towards the next crypto cycle Lutz predicts the next crypto cycle will look markedly different from prior booms and busts. With greater institutional participation, he said, BTC could behave more like a “real asset,” smoothing out the dramatic peaks and troughs that have defined past runs. “I expect that with greater adoption we’ll see longer plateau phases than in previous cycles; the market will still follow the same rules and characteristics, but with lower volatility as it becomes a real asset embraced by the world’s wealthy,” he said. The bitcoin market volatility has declined markedly since the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. last year. Moreover, BTC’s implied volatility indices have steadily evolved into VIX-like structures, moving in the opposite direction of spot prices . All this means that even though some of these new DEXs, offering eye-watering leverage – which Lutz believes won't last until next year – there aren't fireworks in store for BTC. Instead, it'll look like any other sophisticated asset class with gradual ups and downs as the market cycle continues.",Markets|Trading|Markets|TOKEN 2049|BitMEX|Decentralized exchange|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-01 09:04:44

After 7 Years, the US Government Has Officially Shut Down! How Will Bitcoin (BTC) and Cryptocurrencies Be Affected?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-fears-have-come-true-after-7-years-the-us-government-has-officially-shut-down-how-will-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrencies-be-affected/,"Following the US budget crisis that has been talked about for days, the US federal government has officially shut down. As the 2025 financial year draws to a close, no agreement has been reached on a budget to fund the federal government, the BBC reported. As a result, the US federal government went into shutdown (temporary work stoppage) on the morning of October 1st, after the US Congress definitively rejected the budget deal. Senators rejected the Democratic-backed bill, which included government funding and nearly $1 trillion in health care regulations, while the Republican-backed bill was also put to a vote but failed to receive the necessary votes. As a result, the publication of key economic indicators such as employment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data will be suspended and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed. In a scenario where a temporary budget is not approved, the government loses its spending authority and suspends all activities except essential services. Those not working in essential services are placed on indefinite leave. This will be the first U.S. government shutdown in nearly seven years, since the five-week shutdown on December 22, 2018. This will be the 22nd government shutdown in U.S. history. How Are Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Affected? While the impact of the US lockdown on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is also wondered, Bitfinex analysts warned that the US government shutdown could lead to volatility in cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, Bitfinex analysts noted that a possible US federal government shutdown could increase volatility in the cryptocurrency market by halting the publication of key macroeconomic indicators. Analysts said the main problem that the shutdown could cause would be a loss of confidence and a data gap, rather than immediate financial instability. Analysts, noting that Bitcoin has experienced three major increases, unlike previous cycles, and is currently in a correction phase following the Fed's interest rate cut, predicted that Bitcoin will remain sideways for now. *This is not investment advice.

The financing will support deployment of more than 500 new ASIC miners, potentially bringing total operational rigs to over 4,000 by year-end, according to a Tuesday announcement from the Nasdaq-listed digital asset accumulator. The capital infusion follows Thumzup’s August agreement to acquire DogeHash in an all-stock deal that will create what executives describe as the world’s largest Dogecoin mining platform . DogeHash shareholders will swap all holdings for 30.7 million Thumzup shares, with the combined company rebranding as DogeHash Technologies Holdings and trading under ticker XDOG upon deal closure expected in the fourth quarter. Thumzup gained attention in July when Donald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump, purchased 350,000 shares worth nearly $3.3 million at the time. The company has rapidly transformed from a social media marketing firm into a crypto-focused operation since launching its digital asset strategy in January with a $1 million Bitcoin purchase. Thumzup announces $2.5 million capital infusion into DogeHash Technologies to expand its #Dogecoin mining capacity. Strategic funding expected to accelerate fleet deployment to over 4,000 ASIC miners.

The company’s board authorized up to $250 million in total crypto holdings, including Bitcoin , Dogecoin , Litecoin , Solana , XRP , Ether , and USDC . DogeHash currently operates approximately 2,500 Scrypt ASIC miners across North American colocation sites, focused on producing Dogecoin and Litecoin. The new $2.5 million loan will add over 500 cutting-edge miners during what DogeHash CEO Parker Scott called “a pivotal period for the Dogecoin market.” Thumzup CEO Robert Steele stated the company is “ enthusiastic about all the recent developments in the Dogecoin ecosystem ” and looks forward to building “ a premier Doge mining company together ” with DogeHash. The combined entity plans to leverage Dogecoin’s Layer-2 infrastructure through DeFi staking products built into the DogeOS ecosystem. In September, Thumzup purchased approximately 7.5 million Dogecoin tokens for $2 million at a weighted average price of $0.2665, marking its first open-market DOGE acquisition. The company now holds 19.106 Bitcoin and around 7.5 million Dogecoins in its treasury. Thumzup appointed Jordan Jefferson, CEO and co-founder of DogeOS and head of Dogecoin wallet MyDoge, to its Crypto Advisory Board alongside DogeOS executive Alex Hoffman. Jefferson, whose platform is backed by Polychain Capital, has been active in Bitcoin and blockchain development since 2011. The company also launched a $10 million share buyback program in September, which will extend through December 2026, following the completion of a $1 million repurchase that bought back 212,432 shares at an average price of $4.71. Shares climbed 5.7% to $4.81 following the announcement, giving Thumzup a market cap of roughly $78 million. Trump Family Crypto Empire Expands Across Mining and Memecoins The Trump family has rapidly built extensive crypto holdings across multiple ventures. American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump and backed by Donald Trump Jr., surged 110% at its September debut following an all-stock merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining, giving the company a $7.7 billion market value. American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump and backed by Donald Trump Jr, closed 14% higher in its Nasdaq debut, valuing their stake at $1.5B. #AmericanBitcoin #Trump https://t.co/sJo6aWBClB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 4, 2025 At peak prices, the brothers’ combined stake was briefly worth $2.6 billion before closing at around $1.5 billion. At that time, American Bitcoin operates roughly 6,000 mining computers and entered into a $2.1 billion controlled stock offering with Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities to acquire more Bitcoin and upgrade mining technology. Eric Trump predicted at the Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong that Bitcoin would eventually reach $1 million, stating, “ everybody wants Bitcoin, everybody is buying Bitcoin .” Trump Media & Technology Group raised $2.5 billion in May to build a massive Bitcoin Treasury, and most recently launched a new $6.42 billion digital asset treasury company in partnership with Crypto.com. The family’s ventures also include NFT trading cards, two memecoins, and the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. However, while bullish for the crypto community, the family’s crypto ventures have drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts regarding potential conflicts of interest. Thumzup’s stock is up 3.80% to $5.00 on Wednesday following the announcement of its expansion. Dogecoin also rose nearly 1% to $0.23 at the same time.

The findings, compiled by Finbold research using data from blockchain security firm SlowMist , underscore the persistent vulnerabilities across crypto exchanges and protocols, even as the overall volume of attacks declined compared to earlier in the year. Unlike the first quarter of the year, when the $1.5 billion Bybit incident dominated the headlines, the third quarter was shaped by a cluster of mid-sized attacks. The most significant was the $54 million breach at Turkish exchange BtcTurk, with the attack method still undisclosed. Other incidents included $44.2 million stolen from CoinDCX due to a security flaw, $42 million drained from GMX through a reentrancy exploit, $41.5 million lost at SwissBorg because of a third-party vulnerability, and $27 million stolen from BigONE in a supply chain attack. Combined, these events made up almost the entire quarterly total. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Notably, the Q3 total lifts the amount stolen in 2025 to $2.55 billion, ensuring that this year already ranks among the most damaging on record for the digital asset sector. Decline in quarterly losses after the Bybit breach The third quarter figure continues the downward trend that followed the catastrophic opening months of the year. Losses fell from $1.77 billion in Q1 , driven almost entirely by the Bybit wallet hack, to $465 million in Q2, and further down to $307 million in Q3. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); While the slowdown suggests improvements in exchange security and protocol risk management, it may also indicate that attackers are concentrating on smaller, targeted exploits. Analysts caution that quarterly comparisons can be distorted by reporting delays, leaving open the possibility that the final totals for Q3 could be revised upward. Crypto hack losses in 2025 so far With $2.55 billion stolen across the first nine months, 2025 has already surpassed many previous full-year totals. The figures illustrate how a single large-scale event, such as the Bybit hack, can dramatically shape annual statistics while still exposing systemic weaknesses across DeFi contracts, custodial services, and third-party integrations. Even though quarterly numbers have trended lower since Q1, the cumulative damage highlights the fragile foundations of much of the ecosystem. Q4 outlook for crypto security The absence of a billion-dollar breach in Q3 may appear to signal stability, but the underlying vulnerabilities remain unresolved. Exchanges and protocols continue to operate in an environment where security lapses can erase hundreds of millions in value within a short period. As 2025 enters its final quarter, the key test will be whether the industry can sustain the downward trajectory in losses, or whether another large-scale incident resets the trend.

According to a Wednesday X post announcing the contest, the awards will include 29 nominees, split into two categories: adopters and advocates. Voting has already opened on X, with the public encouraged to support nominees by interacting with campaign posts through likes, reposts, or replies. SEAL co-leads Dickson Wu and Robert MacWha said the initiative stems from the Safe Harbor Agreement, first introduced in 2024, to protect white hats who intervene during active exploits on blockchain networks. 4/ Find your favorite nominees’ post & start voting now! You can vote on as many posts as you want. #SafeHarborChampion2025 pic.twitter.com/m5lzzLqimd — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) October 1, 2025 As seen in the SEAL Safe Harbor forum , the framework is a set of rules for both hackers and projects, which shield those who seize stolen funds for safekeeping from criminal liability. SEAL opens voting on awards through social media The non-profit Web3 security platform has dubbed the campaign “a public popularity contest.” SEAL stated that every social interaction counts as a vote, with no limits on the number of nominees a user can support. “This is about creating visibility and social pressure,” the group posted on X. “When competitors are recognized, others will want to implement Safe Harbor too.” The organization believes that adopting its Safe Harbor framework is imperative for the safety of the entire crypto industry. According to SEAL, when white hats act without fear of legal retaliation, exploits are “stopped faster” and “fewer users lose funds.” “Every organization that implements Safe Harbor makes the entire ecosystem more secure. This is how we get there,” SEAL wrote. Companies nominated in the Adopters category feature decentralized finance platforms and protocols that have formally adopted the SEAL Whitehat Safe Harbor, including Alchemix, Balancer, Cantina, ENS Domains, Ensuro, Immunefi, Inverse Finance, Origin Protocol, PancakeSwap, Pareto Credit, Pendle, Polymarket , Sandclock, Silo Finance, Singularity, Uniswap Foundation, and zkSync. In the Advocates category, SEAL nominated venture capital firms such as a16z Crypto, Paradigm, and Dragonfly; law firms Cooley LLP and Debevoise; advocacy groups like LeXpunK Army and PowerhouseDAO. Other nominees in the latter category include the Filecoin Foundation and cybersecurity company Osec. SEAL has lauded these groups for promoting Safe Harbor and sparking more conversations about white-hat protection, while encouraging more firms to onboard the “ethical hackers.” White hat hackers recover billions from crypto network exploits SEAL currently counts 79 volunteer white hat hackers able to respond to active threats in the crypto ecosystem. As of October 1, 14 decentralized finance protocols holding roughly $20 billion in total value had adopted the Safe Harbor framework, according to data from DefiLlama. The adopters include several of the sector’s largest platforms, such as Pendle, a yield derivatives protocol managing $10 billion, and Uniswap , the top-most decentralized exchange by volume in the last month, with close to $6 billion in locked deposits. One of the well-known white hats on social media is the pseudonymous hacker c0ffeebabe.eth, who intervened in the April 2024 Morpho App exploit. c0ffeebabe.eth used a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot to front-run a malicious transaction and intercept $2.6 million stolen from Morpho. A year earlier, the hacker returned $5.4 million worth of Ether to Curve Finance users after a breach, and 300 ETH from a smart contract exploit targeting SushiSwap. In August 2024, good-faith hackers withdrew and returned $12 million worth of Ether and USDC during the Ronin bridge incident. More recently, SEAL coordinated a response to the NPM supply chain attack in the first half of 2025, which compromised JavaScript software libraries. Cryptopolitan reported that a JSCEAL malware campaign had mimicked over 50 crypto platforms to harvest data from users who downloaded the spoofed apps.

In times like these, investors look for alternatives that are equipped with a combination of price resilience and intrinsic utility, especially in the sub-$1 segment. One such project that is becoming increasingly popular is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is currently on phase 6 of its presale that is over 50% sold out. The tokens at this stage are available for purchase for $0.035. With a total of over $16.6 million raised and over 16,670 individual investors, it is gaining momentum. While DOGE struggles with declining sentiment and little new functionality, MUTM is building a twin-lending DeFi platform, raising millions, and riding solid early investor demand. Dogecoin Remains Significant Support, A Big Move Ahead? Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself at a significant price point where bulls and bears grapple with who will be in charge of its next big move. Resistance at $0.23 is now support in the channel of the uptrend, and if there is an increase in buying pressure, analysts anticipate a reversal to $0.28 with potential for a larger breakout rally to $0.43. A breakdown below $0.22, however, may see DOGE drop back down into the $0.17–$0.15 demand zone before bulls attempt another push higher. This setup is characteristic of a traditional consolidation phase, one that can either give way to an abrupt squeeze higher or another correction. And as traders watch DOGE’s next step, investors are already anticipating newer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as part of a grander game plan in 2025. Investor Confidence Soars as Mutuum Finance Presale Breaks New Ground Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has shattered another presale record, raising more than $16.6 million in limited time. Tokens currently stand at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from Phase 5. High investor demand still exists, with more than 16,670 backers demonstrating confidence in the long-term vision of the project. Security is paramount to Mutuum Finance. It has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, encouraging developers and security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities and get compensated for it. Bugs are assessed against four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low, providing end-to-end security and lending support to the security strategy of the platform. Mutuum Finance employs dynamic LTV and liquidation rates, which change in real-time based on market conditions such that the protocol is highly responsive to volatility. Reserve multipliers would range between 10% for risk assets and 35% for conservative assets to offer a secondary layer of systemic safety. Efficiency and Collateral Optimization Efficiency is a fundamental concept of Mutuum Finance. Collateral is kept to a minimum to assets in order to maximize capital usage, and correlated assets are maximized for better lending and borrowing efficiency. These mechanisms reduce insolvency risk, enhance user trust, and enable a more stable and sustainable lending ecosystem. To encourage early backers, Mutuum Finance organized a $100,000 giveaway , and ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The program encourages participation and interaction from the community during the presale. Volatility is also the central area of focus in the collateral management of Mutuum Finance. Asset volatility determines LTV percentages and risk classes, and reserve multipliers ranging from 10% for low-risk assets to 35% for high-risk assets act as buffers, with stability without portfolio diversification being compromised. DOGE Flails as MUTM Rises Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has positioned itself as a leading sub-$1 crypto of 2025 after raising more than $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and advancing more than 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. While Dogecoin (DOGE) is beset by short-term volatility, MUTM delivers actual DeFi utility through its two-way lending platform, dynamic LTV, and prudent risk management, attracting retail investors as well as whales. Early birds are also rewarded with a $100,000 giveaway and strong community incentives. Investors seeking high-upside, utility-driven crypto exposure need to lock up MUTM tokens before presale is exhausted.

52512859,593743,1759311014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52512859.jpeg,Binance Founder Triggers Bitcoin Bull Run Expectations With Cryptic Tweet,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-founder-bitcoin-bull/,"Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has shaken up the crypto community again with a new post about Bitcoin on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The founder, who many believe has called the top and bottom of the market various times, holds significant sway over the market, triggering major movements . Thus, it is no surprise that his latest post, talking about his participation in the crypto market in the past, is being interpreted by many as bullish. Binance Founder Shows Where The Market Was In The Past The post shared by the crypto founder shows what looks to be the price of Bitcoin sitting as low as $4,300. He highlights that this was from eight years ago in 2017, showing where the market was for the month of September and what happened after. At the time, the market looks to be coming out of another bearish September, with the Bitcoin price trading below $5,000. However, the next few months, which were the last quarter of the year, turned out to be incredibly bullish for the Bitcoin price . After September drew to a close, the month of October 2017 was significantly bullish, with the price quickly crossing the $5,000 threshold. In the next few months, the Bitcoin price ended up rising by over 200%, to reach a new all-time high of $19,000 before the 2018 bear market began. Community Members Expect A Bitcoin Bull Run Even though the post by the Binance founder read: “Not predicting the future. And don’t get too excited. A September in a past (my first) crypto cycle. Just data,” it did little to stop the speculation that followed . So far, the tweet has garnered more than 1 million views and 3,000 comments and quotes, with most predicting that the former Binance CEO is predicting a bull run. One analyst points out that CZ had previously marked the local top and bottom and believes that the post is pointing out the concept of seasonality in the market. With CZ posting a chart that showed the Bitcoin price before it went on a bull run, the analyst believes that this could be the start of another run . Another community member, Stygian, claims that CZ has been the one steering the market up or down, and that people can see it. However, another response goes against the grain, saying that what is happening now is simply wealth transfer and not the kind of rally that retail is expecting. Despite the conversations that the post has triggered, the market continued to trend low, with Bitcoin skirting around $113,000 at the time of the post. With the opening of the new month, investors continue to anticipate a bullish rally for Bitcoin and the entire market.",Bitcoin|binance|Binance news|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 09:30:14

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it remains subject to regulatory approval. CoinShares to Absorb Bastion Team to Expand Quant Crypto Strategies Bastion specializes in market-neutral and quantitative strategies for institutional clients. Once approved, its full team, including CEO Philip Scott and CIO Fred Desobry, will integrate into CoinShares, bolstering its expertise in systematic digital asset investing. CoinShares, primarily recognized for its passive exchange-traded crypto products, sees the acquisition as key to broadening its platform into a one-stop shop that blends passive exposure with active management.

CoinShares ranks fourth globally for crypto ETPs and leads in EMEA with a 34% share. The firm has more than tripled AUM in two years, driven by new product launches, pricing tailwinds, and strong inflows. With 32 products now spanning ETPs, indices, and digital asset equities, CoinShares is betting on U.S. demand for tokenization and blockchain-based financial tools.

She responded to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick’s remarks over the weekend, stating that Washington’s pitch to Taiwan would involve a 50-50 split in chip production. Cheng, Taiwan’s lead tariff negotiator with Washington, told reporters upon returning to the country that she had not discussed the 50-50 idea suggested by the U.S. during the talks. She also maintained that the negotiating team would never agree to such conditions. U.S. aims for 40% semiconductor market share Taiwan is still working to finalize a tariff deal with the U.S., following President Donald Trump’s imposition of a temporary 20% tariff on the island. Trump has also threatened to impose additional levies on semiconductors coming into the U.S. Cheng acknowledged that there was some progress in negotiations over U.S. levies on Taiwanese shipments. Cryptopolitan previously reported that Lutnick, over the weekend, said having half of Taiwan’s chip production in the U.S. would ensure the U.S. has much-needed capacity. He added that the conversations Washington has had with Taiwan have maintained that it’s vital for the island to have the U.S. produce 50% of semiconductor chips. “Our goal is to get to 40% market share, and maybe 50% market share, of producing the chips and the wafers, you know, the semiconductor we need for American consumption, that’s our objective.” – Howard Lutnick , United States Secretary of Commerce. Cheng said she hopes for more comprehensive talks on special considerations under Section 232, a U.S. law that allows tariffs on imports deemed a national security risk. Trump had previously accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip business. The cabinet stated in a press release that more than 70% of Taiwan’s exports to the U.S. are in the information and communications technology sector, including chips. The growing demand for AI-related technology has fueled Taiwan’s trade surplus with the U.S., as the island is home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning to invest $165 billion to establish chip factories in the U.S., but will still maintain a bulk of its production in Taiwan. The island produces more than half of the world’s semiconductors, while the U.S. currently produces less than 10% of the global chip supply. TSMC invested approximately $30 billion in capital projects in 2024 and plans to spend about $40 billion this year. Trump threatens to impose additional tariffs on chipmakers The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Trump administration threatened to add a tariff on chipmakers unless they match the volume of semiconductors that their customers currently import from overseas providers through domestic production. Trump has offered exemptions from tariffs of roughly 100% on chips to companies that produce semiconductors locally. According to the report, Trump is allegedly planning to impose levies for companies that fail to sustain a 1:1 domestic-to-import ratio over time. Lutnick also championed the idea, telling semiconductor executives that it might be necessary for economic security. White House spokesperson Kush Desai argued that the U.S. cannot be reliant on imports for the semiconductor products that are necessary for the country’s national and economic security. The report also highlighted that companies committing to produce chips in the U.S. under the proposal would receive credit for that pledged volume. John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabeli Funds, which holds shares in GlobalFoundries and Intel, believes the 1:1 rule would be very difficult to implement and would likely take many years to achieve. He also argued that the proposal would benefit firms that already have U.S. fabs. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Dark Defender noted, “This wave can still extend into double digits,” while acknowledging current bearish sentiment and wider market uncertainty. Despite that, XRP recently closed a weekly candle above the 50% retracement level, reinforcing its support range. Cup and Handle Formation in Play CryptoBull pointed out a cup and handle in the works on the weekly time frame for XRP. The rounded base was initiated toward the end of 2024, with resistance forming near $3 sometime earlier this year. The sideways action from August onward seems to be forming the handle itself. The price remains above the 200-day moving average, which has served as a key support line. CryptoBull stated, “Next stop $8,” if the handle resolves upward with strong buying. The setup requires XRP to break past the neckline near $3 to confirm the bullish structure. #XRP cup and handle pattern almost complete. Next stop $8. pic.twitter.com/XfVpKrKSDK — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 30, 2025 Echoes of 2017 Bull Run Another analyst, CRYPTOWZRD, compared XRP’s current action to its 2017 bull run. At that time, extended consolidation led to a parabolic rally into new highs. The recent pattern of boxed consolidations and breakouts resembles that cycle. XRP is currently close to $3.00. The chart highlights $3.65 as the level to watch. A breakout and weekly close above that mark could lead to $4.50 or higher. “It’s a question of when, not if,” CRYPTOWZRD remarked , referring to the possibility of XRP entering price discovery. Source: CRYPTOWZRD/X Additionally, Market Prophit reported that overall sentiment for XRP is bullish across both crowd data and its own measures. Meanwhile, reports noted a lack of corporate buy orders despite rising reserves, showing that institutional participation may still be limited. XRP is currently trading above the support levels, and analysts are viewing $3.33, $3.66, and $3.65 as the significant break points next in line. Traders are waiting to see if the ongoing structure can confirm a sustained upward movement. The post Is Ripple’s (XRP) Next Stop a New ATH?

""In the Short Term…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/major-bull-tom-lee-reveals-incredible-price-predictions-for-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-in-the-short-term/,"Known for his bold predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market, Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine president Tom Lee made important statements about Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Speaking at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore, Tom Lee said that BTC could reach $140,000 and ETH could reach $22,000. Comparing gold to Bitcoin, Lee predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $140,000 in the short term. For this to happen, he noted that Bitcoin's value would need to reach about 10% of gold's current value. Lee also added that if the value of the Bitcoin network were to be the same or higher than that of gold, BTC could rise to as much as $2.2 million. Secondly, touching on Ethereum, Tom Lee stated that the price of Ethereum could reach $22,000. Lee stated that there are two conditions for this: the ETH/BTC ratio reaching its all-time high of 0.087 in 2021 and BTC reaching $250,000 by the end of the year. If both of these are met, the ETH price could reach $22,000. Tom Lee has also said in other recent statements that he expects the Bitcoin price to be between $200,000 and $250,000 by the end of the year, and the Ethereum price to be between $10,000 and $12,000. Related News: Big Bull Tom Lee Announces Year-End Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Price Predictions! ""Will Be a Favorite of Wall Street and the White House!"" Lee also stated that Bitmine's goal is to increase its Ethereum holdings to 5% of the ETH supply. As you may recall, Bitmine announced on Monday that it purchased 234,846 ETH worth $963 million in the past week. With this latest purchase, Bitmine (BMNR) now holds 2,650,900 ETH worth approximately $11 billion, representing more than 2% of ETH's total supply. *This is not investment advice.

52513533,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=824605,1759312222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52513533.jpeg,"Robert Kiyosaki slams Warren Buffett for switching gold, silver stance after decades of criticism",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robert-kiyosaki-goes-after-warren-buffett/,"Kiyosaki said he wants to “vomit” after hearing the exiting Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett touting investments in gold and silver after bashing the precious metals for decades. According to the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, this means the market is about to crash. Warren Buffett has been bearish on gold since he took the reins at the Omaha-based multinational holding conglomerate in 1970, saying it is “neither of much use nor procreative.” During a shareholder meeting in 2005, the Oracle of Omaha said precious metals were “down on his store of value list,” adding that he would rather invest in a “hundred acres of land near Nebraska, or an apartment house, or an index fund.” Twenty years later, according to Robert Kiyosaki, Buffett is now touting the benefits of investing in the two assets, as spot gold rose 0.4% to reach $3,872 per ounce. In contrast, US gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.7% to $3,901. Silver is up $47.27 per troy ounce, a 15.55% uptick over the past month and 48.43% higher than the same period a year ago, according to CFD trading data tracking the benchmark market. “I want to vomit: getting nauseous, listening to Buffett tout the virtues of gold and silver… after he ridiculed gold and silver for years,” Kiyosaki wrote on X. “That means the stock and bond markets are about to crash. Depression ahead?” Buffett did not like gold In a 2011 interview with CNBC, Buffett called gold investments “a way of going along on fear.” He proposed that its value was largely based on sentiment, explaining that when people were fearful, gold demand and prices rose. At the same time, calmer conditions led to a decline in demand and, eventually, a drop in prices. Despite his long-standing criticism, Berkshire Hathaway briefly ventured into the gold sector during the pandemic with a $565 million investment in Barrick Gold in the second quarter of 2020. Not surprisingly, the conglomerate sold nearly all its stake in Barrick by the end of the year. At the time, inflation was low, economic activity was suppressed, and the move was exactly how analysts who had long regarded Buffett as a critic of gold had expected. Inflation remains a concern for the US economy, although the rate has decreased significantly from its 2022 peak of 9%. In July 2025, consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of 2.7%, but accelerated to 2.9% in August. That backdrop has redirected the interest from stock markets back to safe-haven assets, with many investors seeking protection against currency weakness and geopolitical risks. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Kiyosaki believes Buffett is now advocating for gold because he has seen an impending crash. “Even though Buffett shit on gold and silver investors like me for years, his sickening endorsement of gold and silver must mean stocks and bonds are about to crash. Might be time to listen to Buffet and buy some gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum,” he surmised. Precious metals rally as US faces shutdown The US Senate failed to pass legislation to extend government funding on Tuesday, placing America on the edge of a shutdown. President Donald Trump, who has pushed for major federal spending cuts, has cautioned Congress that he would have to reduce the workforce size if no deal is reached. According to some analysts, this has contributed to the rally in gold, alongside other factors such as the value of the US dollar, inflation, and trade tariffs. “Gold is benefiting from concerns over a weaker dollar, and the political situation with the standoff about a government shutdown in the US, and also general geopolitical uncertainty,” said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery. A shutdown could delay key economic data releases, including the non-farm payrolls report due Friday. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), released on Tuesday, already showed marginal growth in openings but a hiring downturn, providing more signs of a cooling labor market, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell discussed during the last FOMC meeting.

This quick rise turns attention to other digital coins on the market. Could XYZVerse be the next token to surprise investors? Growing curiosity surrounds what might fuel the next price rally. The stage is set for what could happen next in the digital asset space. Bitcoin's Next Beat: Why the Oldest Digital Coin Still Turns Heads Bitcoin began in 2009 when a mysterious coder, Satoshi Nakamoto, shared a plan for electronic cash. It runs on a public log, copied across many computers, so no bank is needed. People called miners check each payment by solving math tasks. They earn new coins for this work. Every four years that reward is cut in half, slowing the flow of fresh coins. Only 21 million can ever exist. This strict cap and open record aim to block fraud and keep the network fair. Today, many new tokens chase quick gains, yet Bitcoin still leads the show. Big firms add it to balance sheets, and some cities accept it for taxes. Rising interest in simple online money and fear of bank glitches push users toward the oldest coin. The next halving is near, and past cuts often sent the price higher as supply tightened. Fees may jump, and small miners could leave, but history shows the network adapts. For buyers who want a scarce and proven store, Bitcoin still looks lively this cycle. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.0055 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Conclusion BTC looks good in the 2025 rally. Attention now turns to XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, uniting sports fans and memes, chasing outsized gains through community gaming growth.

For XRP Tundra, however, the math stretches conventional expectations. The Phase 4 presale is structured so that even modest allocations translate into outsized outcomes — returns so steep they challenge the utility of traditional forecasting tools. The reason lies not in hype but in the project’s architecture. A dual-token system, transparent launch pricing, staking utilities, and engineered liquidity combine into a model where exponential upside is built directly into the economics. Early buyers are discovering that Tundra’s design produces results that conventional calculators can barely capture. Phase 4 Presale: Ground Floor Multiples At the current stage, TUNDRA-S is priced at $0.068. Each purchase comes with a 16% token bonus, and buyers also receive TUNDRA-X free of charge, referenced at $0.034. Launch prices are fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X. This means a relatively small allocation today converts into multiples rarely seen in established assets. Unlike speculative forecasts that depend on uncertain market cycles, the pathway here is transparent. Defined launch values allow investors to calculate upside in advance, and the numbers reveal returns that overwhelm typical crypto benchmarks. Yield Features Beyond Speculation Presale multiples are only part of the story. XRP Tundra also introduces Cryo Vault staking, where holders can lock tokens and earn up to 30% APY. Frost Keys, NFT-based utilities, enhance this system by boosting yields or shortening lock durations. Although staking has not yet launched, presale participants secure guaranteed access once vaults open. This transforms tokens from speculative chips into yield-bearing assets, ensuring that investors benefit even if broader market conditions shift. Liquidity Engineering to Preserve Value The risk with presale multiples is always the same: volatility at launch can wipe them away. XRP Tundra has built in protections to counter that outcome through Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools. These pools introduce dynamic fees that start high, deterring bots and immediate dumping, and then ease gradually to allow organic trading. Liquidity positions are represented as NFTs, while permanent lock features guarantee a stable baseline of tradability. For investors, this means that extraordinary presale gains are not undermined the moment trading begins. Instead, the architecture itself helps preserve value through the most turbulent phases of price discovery. Verified Oversight and Independent Attention Confidence in presales depends on verification, and XRP Tundra has taken steps that few new projects attempt. Its contracts and tokenomics have been reviewed by Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . Team identity is confirmed via Vital Block KYC . External coverage has also begun amplifying its reach. In a recent video, Crypto League highlighted how Tundra’s dual-token model and launch safeguards differentiate it from conventional presales, framing it as one of the most distinctive opportunities of the cycle. Returns Too Massive to Ignore Crypto calculators can model Bitcoin doubling or Solana tripling, but they struggle to capture the kind of growth baked into XRP Tundra’s presale. With dual tokens, staking yields, and liquidity protections, returns are not just hypothetical but structured into the economics from day one. As Phase 4 advances, the presale is redefining expectations of what “early entry” means in digital assets. For participants, the question is no longer whether gains are possible but how large they can become — and the numbers already suggest outcomes that standard models cannot compute.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin has kicked off ‘Uptober’ in the best possible fashion. The token has gained 1.9% today, adding up to nearly a 7% rise over the past six days. Having reclaimed all of its important short-term moving averages – the 10, 20, 50, and 100 EMA on the daily chart – Bitcoin is now fast approaching the key resistance level of $117-$118K. This particular resistance level caused a sharp 7% downward correction just a couple of weeks ago, so it’s crucial for digital gold to reclaim this level quickly if it wants to repeat its historical October trend – an average monthly return of 29.23% . It’s also worth noting that the current bounce comes off a weekly Fibonacci retracement at the 0.5 level. According to this technical setup, the token should at least retest its Fibonacci swing high, which coincides with BTC’s current all-time high of $124.5K. That said, with both fundamental and technical tailwinds, Bitcoin appears well-positioned not only to retest but to push well past its previous highs in the upcoming cycle. CZ Sparks Uptober Buzz With Bitcoin Rally Hints — Can Bitcoin Hyper Capitalize? October 1, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, has hinted at a potential October rally for Bitcoin based on the currency’s historical performance. His prediction is backed by data showing that $BTC surged 4072% from mid-2015 to late-2017 . CZ believes BTC’s past trends point to the possibility of another ‘Uptober’ rally. Historical data support CZ’s outlook, showing that $BTC has averaged gains of around 22% in October over the past few years. In light of CZ’s prediction, investors are closely monitoring seasonal patterns, rising ETF flows, gold price correlation, the Fed’s rate cut , and US crypto regulatory clarity , as these factors could play a significant role in driving $BTC’s price up this October. When influential figures like CZ shed light on past runs in the crypto space, it often uplifts investor sentiment and redirects capital flows. This momentum not only benefits $BTC but has also spilled over into upcoming layer-2 Bitcoin-based projects, such as the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Currently in presale, $HYPER has already raised $19.4M, creating waves across the market. Discover how to purchase Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) in our comprehensive guide .

He also said that he expects Bitcoin to evaluate by 29% on average per year for the next 21 years. Saylor’s Strategy currently holds 640,031 $BTC, valued at almost $74B. The news brings Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $19.5M presale into the spotlight.

The Banque de France’s losses and a 5.8% GDP shortfall raise the likelihood of quantitative easing, which historically redirects capital into BTC as an inflation and liquidity hedge. France’s fiscal gap may trigger ECB quantitative easing Banque de France posted a €7.7B net loss; government deficit reached €168B (5.8% of GDP). Historically, QE cycles have coincided with significant Bitcoin inflows and price appreciation. France budget deficit Bitcoin: France’s €168B shortfall may force ECB QE and drive BTC inflows — read concise analysis and investor implications at COINOTAG. What is the impact of France’s budget deficit on Bitcoin? France budget deficit Bitcoin dynamics suggest the Banque de France’s €7.7 billion net loss and a 5.8%-of-GDP government shortfall increase the odds of ECB quantitative easing. QE would expand liquidity across euro markets, raising the probability of capital flows into Bitcoin as investors seek inflation-resistant assets. How large is France’s fiscal shortfall and what drove it? The Banque de France reported a net loss of €7.7 billion in fiscal 2024, largely from negative net interest income amid high interest payments. France’s government deficit reached €168 billion ($176 billion) in 2024, equal to 5.8% of GDP , well above the EU 3% benchmark. Arthur Hayes at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph Why could the ECB respond with money printing? With roughly 60% of French bonds held by foreign investors , reduced external financing can tighten France’s borrowing conditions. Industry observers, including Arthur Hayes (co‑founder of BitMEX), posit that the ECB may choose to deploy large-scale QE to stabilize banks or fund fiscal spending—each path increases euro liquidity. Hayes has stated that French capital is leaving and that the ECB faces a binary choice: print now or print later. That decision, he argues, would likely expand aggregate money supply and create tailwinds for crypto markets. How has quantitative easing affected Bitcoin historically? Quantitative easing has previously coincided with major Bitcoin appreciation. During the 2020–2021 QE cycle, Bitcoin rose over 1,050% , climbing from about $6,000 in March 2020 to roughly $69,000 by November 2021 after large-scale bond-buying programs were announced. BTC/USD, one-week chart, 2020-2021. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView When might ECB action occur and what are the scenarios? The ECB could print either to preserve banking stability or to enable sovereign spending. Both scenarios expand money supply; timing depends on capital flows and macro stress signals. If foreign investment into French bonds continues to wane, policymakers may accelerate intervention. What metrics should investors monitor? Banque de France balance sheet changes and reported net income. ECB bond‑buying announcements and policy meeting statements. Cross‑border capital flows into French sovereign bonds and FX reserve adjustments. Summary table: Key figures Metric Value Implication Banque de France net loss (FY2024) €7.7 billion Signals central bank strain France government deficit (2024) €168 billion (5.8% GDP) Exceeds EU limit; fiscal pressure Foreign ownership of French bonds ~60% Vulnerability to capital outflows Bitcoin 2020–2021 rise ~1,050% Historical QE correlation Frequently Asked Questions Will ECB quantitative easing directly cause higher Bitcoin prices? QE increases money supply and can boost risk-asset liquidity; historically, major QE cycles aligned with significant BTC inflows. While not deterministic, QE raises the probability of capital moving into Bitcoin as part of broader liquidity-driven asset allocation shifts. Is France likely to default or redenominate its debt? Current indicators point to elevated fiscal stress but not an imminent default. Policymakers have options—QE, fiscal consolidation, capital controls—and the ECB’s response is a key variable. How should investors prepare for possible ECB money printing? Monitor central bank statements, sovereign bond yields, and capital-flow data. Diversify exposures and consider inflation-hedge assets, but base allocations on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Key Takeaways Immediate risk: Banque de France losses and a 5.8% deficit increase Eurozone policy pressure. Likely response: ECB quantitative easing is a plausible tool to restore liquidity. Market impact: Greater euro liquidity historically correlates with capital flows into Bitcoin; investors should track policy signals. Conclusion The Banque de France’s reported losses and France’s €168 billion deficit elevate the probability of ECB intervention. France budget deficit Bitcoin dynamics suggest that any large-scale QE could act as a catalyst for renewed Bitcoin inflows. Market participants should watch ECB communications and bond‑market signals closely for policy-driven liquidity changes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""France budget deficit could push ECB to print — what it means for Bitcoin"", ""description"": ""France budget deficit Bitcoin: France’s €168B shortfall may force ECB QE and drive BTC inflows — analysis and investor implications."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/news/france-budget-deficit-bitcoin-ecb-qe-2025"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999eec-7bc2-71ff-abdc-65cf6451aa5f.jpeg"" ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will ECB quantitative easing directly cause higher Bitcoin prices?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""QE increases money supply and can boost risk-asset liquidity; historically, major QE cycles aligned with significant BTC inflows, increasing the probability of higher Bitcoin prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is France likely to default or redenominate its debt?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Indicators show fiscal stress but no immediate default; options include QE, fiscal measures, or capital controls, with ECB policy responses being decisive."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess the impact of ECB QE on Bitcoin"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to evaluate how ECB quantitative easing could affect Bitcoin and investor positioning."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999eec-7bc2-71ff-abdc-65cf6451aa5f.jpeg"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor central bank announcements"", ""text"": ""Track ECB policy statements and bond‑buying program details to gauge the scale and timing of QE."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch bond yields and capital flows"", ""text"": ""Rising yields or net capital outflows from France increase the likelihood of ECB intervention."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess historical asset responses"", ""text"": ""Compare previous QE cycles and Bitcoin performance to estimate potential market reactions."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Adjust risk exposure"", ""text"": ""Rebalance portfolios according to risk tolerance, time horizon, and expected policy outcomes."" } ]} Sources: Banque de France press release (March 2025), Arthur Hayes interview at TOKEN2049 (reported in Cointelegraph), historical Fed QE and Bitcoin price data.

52513764,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84944,1759312839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SOL’s 100x Run Fades as Retail Targets $0.035 DeFi to Hit $2 Like SOL’s $10-to-$200 Surge,https://timestabloid.com/sols-100x-run-fades-as-retail-targets-0-035-defi-to-hit-2/,"Solana (SOL)’s remarkable surge from $10 to $200 gave investors one of the most iconic stories in crypto investing. But as momentum cools and new buyers hesitate to enter at elevated levels, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage projects priced at a fraction of the cost. Many are questioning why crypto is down across the broader market and searching for value plays that combine innovation, stability, and strong upside. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steps forward, priced at just $0.035 in its presale and structured to create sustained growth that mirrors Solana (SOL)’s early trajectory. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Retail’s Fresh Investment The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already showing strong traction. In Phase 6, the project has raised $16.6 million, secured over 16,650 holders, and sold through 53% of the available allocation. The next stage is set at $0.04, which means a 15% increase is on the horizon for anyone entering now. This low entry point provides an early positioning advantage similar to Solana (SOL)’s $10 base before its explosive run, only this time with risk-managed mechanics that prepare the project for sustainable scaling. Unlike many tokens that lose direction after a crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a dual lending model that combines peer-to-contract pools for stable, liquid tokens and peer-to-peer pools for riskier assets. This structure diversifies income streams while reducing systemic risks. Every loan on the platform is protected by overcollateralization, ensuring that the treasury remains safe even when volatility strikes. On top of that, reserve factors accumulate from borrowing activity, strengthening the protocol’s ability to fund staking rewards, incentives, and buybacks that will directly support token demand. For professional borrowers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer stable interest rates and predictable repayment terms, features that encourage long-term usage. These mechanisms create a steady flow of fees, which are channeled into the buy-and-distribute program. This means tokens are bought from the market and redistributed to mtToken stakers, rewarding mtToken stakers and reinforcing demand over time. Such mechanics build the groundwork for a reliable price climb rather than a speculative bubble. The Road To $2 And Beyond Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just presenting theoretical models; the project already has its dashboard and leaderboard live, gamifying user engagement and encouraging accumulation. These features will push users toward staking and long-term participation, increasing velocity and enhancing liquidity. At the same time, its Layer 2 foundation will guarantee low transaction fees and high speeds, ensuring the platform is practical for day-to-day lending and borrowing. With the beta launch offering early access to the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already proving its real-world application before hitting major exchanges. Upcoming listings will further expand visibility, attract liquidity, and open MUTM to a global investor base. When combined with its revenue-backed buyback program, the effect is simple: increased demand, stronger staking incentives, and a token economy designed for lasting growth. These elements justify why analysts are aligning their crypto predictions with the view that MUTM has the right mix of utility, engagement, and financial engineering to target $2, just as Solana (SOL)’s early supporters witnessed a historic leap from $10 to $200. The numbers highlight the opportunity. An investor who entered Phase 1 with $8,000 secured 800,000 MUTM tokens. At the Phase 6 price of $0.035, that holding is already valued at $28,000, and when the token climbs to $1, it will be valued at $800,000. For those stepping in now, a $10,000 allocation at $0.035 secures 285,700 tokens. By the next phase at $0.04, this stack will be worth $11,400, and at the $1 projection, it will deliver $285,700. These outcomes reflect not guesswork but the structured mechanisms embedded in the project’s design. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the market at a time when many investors are still asking why crypto is down and where the next growth story will emerge. By combining transparent lending systems, gamified user incentives, Layer 2 scalability, and buyback-supported economics, the project is positioning itself as the answer. Solana (SOL) showed what early conviction in a scalable DeFi project can achieve. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering retail investors a similar chance, with entry prices at just $0.035 and a pathway that logically supports a climb to $2. The window is narrowing, and those who recognize the parallels are already securing their positions before Phase 6 closes.

According to his explanation, Linea, developed by ConsenSys, was chosen for the messaging function, while XRP helps in liquidity provision. His remarks were aimed at clarifying recent discussions around SWIFT’s blockchain prototype and its collaboration with ConsenSys. SWIFT is a two part System…messaging and liquidity I told you the other day ConsenSys was the one behind LINEA for SWIFT messaging XRP is for the liquidity. If SWIFT didn’t use XRP, Ripple would eventually take it over since they are the ones that hold the patent to… pic.twitter.com/9d1pyD8qGx — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) September 29, 2025 Linea’s Purpose and Development Remi Relief emphasized that Linea is not intended for liquidity or settlement functions, but rather serves as a messaging system. In his description, Linea enables banks to transmit instructions between one another on-chain. He highlighted that ConsenSys is behind Linea’s development, aligning with reports that SWIFT partnered with the company to test blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions. In his view, this means Linea functions as an infrastructure layer where developers can build applications for communication between financial institutions, but it is not designed for direct retail use. XRP and On-Demand Liquidity The central point in Remi Relief’s analysis is that XRP remains the asset positioned for liquidity services. He noted that only XRP has On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and argued that this makes it irreplaceable in this framework. He added that Ripple holds a patent for ODL, which he sees as a critical factor in determining how liquidity solutions are integrated into global payment systems. From his perspective, if SWIFT did not incorporate XRP for liquidity , Ripple could eventually dominate that role due to its proprietary position in ODL technology. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging, Stablecoins and Interoperability Remi Relief also referenced interoperability as an important consideration in this structure. Remi pointed to the existence of RLUSD on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger . He also mentioned that bridging solutions, such as Axelar, connect XRP with other blockchains, including Ethereum, which hosts assets like RLUSD and Linea. He suggested that these connections provide the means for liquidity and messaging systems to interact, reinforcing his argument that XRP and Linea are complementary components in SWIFT’s setup rather than competing solutions. In his post, Remi Relief summarized SWIFT’s work as a system divided into messaging and liquidity. He stated that Linea, developed by ConsenSys, accounts for the messaging component, while XRP provides the liquidity through ODL. His interpretation links recent announcements about SWIFT’s blockchain partnerships with the role of XRP in cross-border payments, presenting a structured view of how the two can operate together.

The fund was intended to provide a boost to the Telegram Open Network (TON), a platform that facilitates the integration of blockchain and cryptocurrency within the Telegram messenger. The primary objective of the $20 million TON Ecosystem Fund was to provide support for early-stage projects within the TON ecosystem, with a particular focus on driving innovation. Visa Pilots Stablecoin Payments to Modernize Cross-Border Transfers As reported, Visa has launched a pilot program that allows businesses to fund cross-border payments using stablecoins instead of pre-funding local accounts. The initiative, built on Visa Direct, is designed to reduce friction and eliminate the need for firms to hold large cash reserves across multiple currencies. It follows the passage of the GENIUS Act, which gave regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers in the US. Targeting banks and remittance firms, the system is expected to speed up transactions and unlock dormant capital. While regulators remain cautious about stablecoins, Visa’s move signals a shift toward integrating blockchain rails into traditional financial systems instead of opposing them. The company has already processed $200 million in stablecoin settlements and sees growing convergence between traditional payments and crypto infrastructure. With its Tokenized Asset Platform and new bank partnerships, Visa is positioning itself as both a facilitator and direct player in the future of global payments.

The Tokyo-listed company now ranks as the fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, surpassing its fiscal year 2025 target of 30,000 BTC ahead of schedule. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The acquisition puts Metaplanet’s behind Strategy’s 640,031 BTC, MARA Holdings’ 52,477 BTC, and XXI’s 43,514 BTC. CEO Simon Gerovich has set an ambitious goal of accumulating 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027, representing approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet achieved a 33.0% BTC yield in the third quarter of 2025, adding 4,412 BTC in gains through its treasury operations. The company’s quarterly BTC yield has consistently exceeded targets, with Q4 2024 posting 309.8%, Q1 2025 achieving 95.6%, and Q2 2025 recording 129.4%. Options Trading Revenue Surges 116% as Phase II Strategy Launches Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Income Generation business reported $16.28 million in quarterly revenue, representing a 115.7% increase from Q2 2025. Source: Phase II Report The breakout performance prompted management to revise full-year consolidated guidance to $45.4 million in revenue and $31.38 million in operating profit, representing a 100% increase in revenue and 88% increase in operating profit compared to prior forecasts. The options trading segment has also grown rapidly since its launch, with Q4 2024 generating $4.62 million, Q1 2025 producing $5.14 million, and Q2 2025 reaching $7.55 million, before the surge in Q3. Metaplanet allocated $136.3 million exclusively to Bitcoin Income Generation operations, using capital to sell Bitcoin options and monetize implied volatility while keeping long-term holdings in cold storage. The company unveiled Phase II of its strategy on October 1, introducing complementary business lines designed to amplify accumulation capacity without common equity dilution. Metaplanet Phase II: The Bitcoin Platform https://t.co/d0kj0QRths pic.twitter.com/WgasCOvHKv — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) October 1, 2025 The plan includes three revenue streams. Internal Bitcoin Income Generation through proprietary options trading, Bitcoin.jp platform revenue from media and conferences, and Project NOVA, a classified initiative scheduled for 2026 launch. Management is scaling sophisticated trading operations by onboarding global talent with expertise in institutional derivatives. The revenue expansion will support planned perpetual preferred share issuances capped at 6% annual dividend yield, approved at the September 1 Extraordinary General Meeting, though not yet issued. Metaplanet targets a perpetual preferred capacity of 25% of net asset value initially, with the potential to expand as revenue grows. Class A perpetual preferreds will be non-convertible with no common equity dilution, while Class B may partially dilute upon conversion. The company is considering listing these securities pending consultation with the exchange, although no formal examination has commenced. Capital Group Takes 11.45% Stake as Stock Trades Below Bitcoin Holdings Capital Group acquired an 11.45% stake , worth nearly $500 million, through its subsidiary, Capital Research and Management Company, becoming Metaplanet’s largest shareholder. The $2.6 trillion asset manager increased ownership from 8.31% in August to 11.39% by September 17, surpassing the previous largest shareholder, National Financial Services. The investment validates the corporate Bitcoin treasury model as over 196 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, totaling more than $120 billion in combined holdings. The investment coincided with Metaplanet’s $1.45 billion international offering completed on September 17 , which issued 385 million new common shares to qualified institutional buyers. The company raised over 500 billion yen ($3.34 billion) through multiple financing mechanisms, including moving strike warrants, convertible bonds, and equity offerings, since adopting its Bitcoin treasury strategy. Eric Trump also joined Metaplanet’s advisory board in March and appeared at shareholder meetings to support the Bitcoin-focused strategy. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin.jp initiative will serve as the distribution gateway for Bitcoin-related content, education, products, and services in Japan. The premium domain platform will generate revenue through multi-channel partnerships, advertising, white-labeled services, and affiliate programs while hosting Bitcoin Magazine Japan and the Bitcoin Japan 2027 conference.

Acquisition aims to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US. CoinShares will integrate Bastion’s systematic trading team and strategies to create alpha-focused products. Active crypto ETFs outnumbered passive funds in July 2025; CoinShares targets institutional demand for sophisticated strategies. CoinShares Bastion acquisition: CoinShares will launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US — learn what this means for investors and institutional demand. Read more. What is CoinShares acquiring Bastion Asset Management to do? CoinShares Bastion acquisition will combine Bastion’s systematic trading capabilities with CoinShares’ 1940 Act registration to develop actively managed crypto ETFs for US investors. The integration is designed to deliver strategies that seek alpha regardless of market direction, not just passive exposure to BTC or ETH. How will CoinShares launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US? CoinShares will fully integrate Bastion’s trading team, quantitative models, and execution systems into its platform pending UK FCA approval. As a registered investment adviser under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, CoinShares can structure actively managed products and list them in the US once regulatory and operational milestones are met. Key operational steps include: Regulatory clearance and integration of compliance frameworks. Technical and trading-system consolidation to support systematic strategies. Product design, testing, and filing with US exchanges using new streamlined listing standards. CoinShares is set to acquire investment manager Bastion Asset Management to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US. European crypto asset manager CoinShares is set to make another strategic acquisition as the company prepares to go public in the United States. CoinShares announced Wednesday that it will acquire London-based crypto investment manager Bastion Asset Management as part of its strategy to expand crypto investment products in the US. The deal, pending approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, will see CoinShares fully integrate Bastion’s trading capabilities, strategies and team into its platform. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. “By combining Bastion’s systematic trading expertise with our 1940 Act registration, we can develop actively managed products for the US market that go beyond simple directional exposure to cryptocurrencies,” a CoinShares spokesperson told media sources. What is the difference between active ETFs and passive ETFs? Active ETFs are managed with a goal to outperform a benchmark through active selection and trading. Passive ETFs simply track an index or asset price. In crypto markets, most US offerings have been passive spot funds, while active strategies use discretionary or systematic selection to pursue returns. Passive ETFs versus active ETFs. Source: HANetf As CoinShares holds registered investment adviser status under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, the company is permitted to offer actively managed investment products in the US, including sophisticated strategies such as actively managed ETFs. However, creating these products requires deep quantitative expertise and proven systematic trading capabilities, which CoinShares expects to obtain from Bastion. “Bastion’s team has over 17 years of experience developing systematic, alpha-generating strategies at leading hedge funds including BlueCrest Capital, Systematica Investments, Rokos Capital, and GAM Systematic,” CoinShares noted in company comments. “Their quantitative approach, using academically-backed signals to generate returns independent of market direction, is precisely the type of sophisticated, actively managed strategy that differentiates managers in competitive markets.” Why are active crypto ETFs gaining traction now? The crypto ETF market has historically been dominated by passive spot Bitcoin and Ether funds. That trend shifted when active crypto ETFs outnumbered index-tracking funds in July 2025, reflecting greater demand for advanced strategies. Regulatory changes in the US that allow faster listing processes for new crypto funds have also accelerated product launches. Industry reporting indicates a shortened maximum filing-to-launch window — from 240 days to as little as 75 days under new exchange rules — making active product launches more feasible. Actively managed ETFs outnumbered passive funds in July 2025. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence How does CoinShares’ planned US listing affect this strategy? CoinShares plans a US public listing via a special purpose acquisition company at a reported $1.2 billion pre-money equity valuation. The listing is intended to increase access to US capital and institutional distribution channels. “The US remains the world’s deepest capital market for digital assets, and we’re building the infrastructure, team, and product suite to become a leading institutional player in that market,” CoinShares said in company remarks. Frequently Asked Questions Will CoinShares offer both passive and actively managed crypto ETFs? Yes. CoinShares intends to offer directional (passive-like) products and actively managed strategies designed to generate alpha regardless of market conditions, leveraging Bastion’s systematic models. When will CoinShares’ actively managed ETFs be available in the US? Timing depends on regulatory approval, integration milestones, and exchange listing processes. CoinShares must complete UK FCA approvals and US product filings before launch; expedited exchange processes may shorten timelines. What experience does Bastion bring to CoinShares? Bastion’s team has over 17 years of experience building systematic strategies at major hedge funds. That expertise is central to CoinShares’ plan to build quantitative, academically-backed signals for crypto ETFs. Key Takeaways Strategic acquisition : CoinShares is acquiring Bastion to add systematic trading and quantitative expertise. Product innovation : The goal is to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US that pursue alpha, not just market exposure. Market timing : Regulatory changes and increasing demand for active strategies create a favorable window for launches. Conclusion CoinShares’ acquisition of Bastion Asset Management positions the firm to bring actively managed crypto ETFs to the US market, combining regulatory capability and deep quantitative expertise. Investors and institutions should watch for regulatory clearances and product filings as CoinShares executes its US listing and product rollout plans. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""CoinShares acquires Bastion to build actively managed crypto ETFs in the US"", ""description"": ""CoinShares is acquiring Bastion Asset Management to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US, using Bastion's systematic trading and CoinShares' 1940 Act registration."", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999f4d-4670-7f97-9f06-6a819b524671.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is CoinShares acquiring Bastion Asset Management to do?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""CoinShares will integrate Bastion’s systematic trading team and models to develop actively managed crypto ETFs for the US, leveraging its 1940 Act registration to offer alpha-seeking strategies."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will CoinShares launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""CoinShares will complete regulatory approvals, integrate Bastion’s trading infrastructure, design products, and file with US exchanges under new streamlined listing standards."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When might these actively managed ETFs be available?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Availability depends on UK FCA approval, US filing and listing timelines; expedited exchange procedures may reduce time from filing to launch."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How CoinShares will bring actively managed crypto ETFs to the US"", ""description"": ""High-level plan for integrating Bastion and launching actively managed ETFs."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Secure regulatory approvals"", ""text"": ""Obtain UK FCA approval for the acquisition and confirm compliance with US 1940 Act requirements."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Integrate technology and team"", ""text"": ""Combine Bastion’s systematic trading models, data pipelines, and execution systems with CoinShares’ product infrastructure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Design and file products"", ""text"": ""Develop actively managed ETF strategies, run operational tests, and file listing applications with US exchanges."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 4, ""name"": ""List and distribute"", ""text"": ""List the ETFs on US exchanges, launch marketing to institutional channels, and monitor performance and compliance."" } ], ""totalTime"": ""P3M""}",Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 10:58:42
52515465,594649,1759316348,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52515465.jpeg,Michael Saylor’s $1T Bitcoin Goal Propels L2 Scaling Solution Bitcoin Hyper,https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-trillion-dollar-bitcoin-empire-pumps-hyper/,"Michael Saylor’s $BTC ambitions know no bounds. Now, he plans for his company – Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) – to stack up $1T of the world’s largest crypto asset. Even as critics get louder about the company’s $BTC buying strategy, Saylor remains unfazed. As more $BTC is scooped up, projects building on Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Hyper, are likely to see their utility and demand accelerate. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , now in presale, is a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution being developed to address the Bitcoin network’s pain points. And it’ll only help as demand peaks. Strategy’s $47.35B $BTC Stash Generates $27B in Returns In 2020, Strategy boldly pivoted from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. And boy, has it paid off. The company is now the largest corporate holder of $BTC worldwide. Currently, Strategy holds a total of 640,031 $BTC, following a recent purchase of 196 $BTC worth approximately $22.1M. The total stash was accumulated for roughly $47.35B at an average price of about $73,983. However, with $BTC now trading at $116,5K , Strategy is sitting on over $27B in unrealized gains. Despite the humongous profit, Strategy’s large $BTC buys have received some backlash. Take short-seller Jim Chano, for instance. He slammed the company’s valuation by calling it ‘financial gibberish.’ Not helping matters, Chanos argues that Strategy’s market cap shouldn’t exceed the value of its $BTC holdings. Yet, in June, the company’s $108B valuation was around 1.74x its $62.27B worth of $BTC – a cap critics say creates an arbitrage opportunity. Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, also criticizes Strategy. In an X post last week, he called the firm’s approach ‘harebrained’ and noted that Strategy ($MSTR) is down 45% from its November 2024 peak. Still, ongoing criticism hasn’t deterred other firms from betting big on the crypto king. 108 Public Companies Now Hold $119.5B Worth of $BTC CoinMarketCap data shows that 108 public companies now hold 1,029,413 $BTC worth over $119.5B – 4.90% of the asset’s total supply. Behind Strategy, MARA Holdings is the second-largest $BTC treasury, holding 52,477 $BTC, valued at over $6B. Meanwhile, XXI is firmly in third place, holding 43,514 $BTC worth roughly $5.05B. These companies, including the likes of Metaplanet (which recently established a US subsidiary to expand its $BTC income business ), view the crypto leader as a long-term investment with high profit potential. But as more capital flows into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the network often becomes congested. In turn, this results in slow transaction speeds and high fees — a less-than-ideal setup for users. This is where Bitcoin Hyper steps in. Bitcoin Hyper to Make Bitcoin as Efficient as Solana Bitcoin Hyper is on a mission to address the Bitcoin network’s biggest limitations. Once launched this quarter, its L2 chain will leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to make the Bitcoin network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Right now, Bitcoin can only process 4.2 transactions per second (TPS) , ~18,521% less than Solana’s 782.1 TPS . In fact, Solana far outpaces Bitcoin in many key performance areas. The network’s maximum throughput reaches 4,709 tps, roughly 357x higher than Bitcoin’s 13.2 tps peak. And that’s not all. Solana’s block time average is much higher at 0.39 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s 9 minutes and 35 seconds. But it’s not just the utilization of the SVM that’ll make the L2 more scalable – the addition of a Canonical Bridge will help, too. The bridge will enable the movement of wrapped versions of $BTC across the Bitcoin mainnet and the L2 network. In doing so, $BTC can be used across DeFi, dApps, NFTs, and other Web3 ecosystems. This unlocks new use cases previously unseen on Bitcoin, which will also boost liquidity. All while preserving the inherent security of Bitcoin’s base layer. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, global mining network, and decentralized validator base make it highly resistant to attacks and manipulation. $HYPER Powers the Bitcoin L2’s Utility, Scalability & Growth At the core of the entire ecosystem is $HYPER , the project’s native token that drives utility, sustainability, and scalability. The presale tokenomics show that a hefty 30% of its total token supply is earmarked to fund ongoing development, while an extra 25% is reserved for the ecosystem treasury. Supporting the project and buying $HYPER on presale – currently available for just $0.013005 – comes with several additional perks. From lower gas fees to governance rights and passive income at a 60% APY through staking (or all three!), holding $HYPER unlocks attractive, exclusive benefits to holders. If you’re interested in staking for gains, there’s no better time to do precisely that; the APY will drop as more investors catch on. Experts predict $HYPER could reach $0.32 after it’s listed on some of the best crypto exchanges . This alone could generate over 24x returns, and that’s without factoring in any staking income. Weighing all these points together, it’s no surprise $HYPER has raised over $19.5M already, with recent whale buys as big as $113.8K , $109.9K , and $105.4K . Start stacking like Strategy — Join Bitcoin Hyper today. Disclaimer: The information provided is solely for educational and informational purposes.

52515530,594150,1759316415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52515530.jpeg,Cardano Founder Confirms Google Collaboration On Midnight,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-google-collaboration-midnight/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has confirmed a new collaboration between Midnight—Cardano’s privacy-focused partner chain—and Google Cloud, framing it as a strategic step to harden the network’s infrastructure and accelerate developer adoption. “Proud to be working with Google on Midnight. They are a wonderful company and add a ton of value to our ecosystem,” the Cardano founder wrote on X, amplifying Midnight’s announcement and a same-day blog post from the project. Google Is Now Part Of Cardano’s Midnight In a September 30, 2025 post , Midnight said the Midnight Foundation has launched a “strategic collaboration” with Google Cloud “for enterprise-grade security and infrastructure and to expand community tools and resources,” positioning zero-knowledge technology as “essential infrastructure for next-generation digital systems.” The announcement situates Midnight’s core thesis —selective disclosure and privacy-preserving computation—inside a compliance-aware architecture aimed at institutions handling sensitive data. The scope of work is unusually concrete for a cloud–blockchain tie-up. According to Midnight, Google Cloud will “operate critical network infrastructure, including running a validator for Midnight,” and will bring its Mandiant division’s threat monitoring and incident-response capabilities to the network. Midnight also says it will leverage Google Cloud’s Confidential Computing to remove operators from the trust boundary and harden against provider-level access, signaling an attempt to bind zero-knowledge proofs with hardware-enforced isolation. “The future of enterprise applications requires both transparency and privacy,” said Richard Widmann, Head of Web3 Strategy and Operations at Google Cloud. “By providing scalable infrastructure, we’re enabling developers to experiment with innovative zero knowledge frameworks to verify transactions without exposing sensitive data.” Midnight framed the collaboration as an accelerant for real-world use cases that have historically struggled on transparent public chains. Fahmi Syed, President of the Midnight Foundation, argued that “Midnight transforms privacy from a technical barrier into a competitive advantage, enabling confidential financial systems, verifiable digital identity, and secure applications that can operate at scale with regulatory compliance built in.” The blog post points to selective-disclosure patterns for financial institutions (private trading and compliant cross-border payments), credential issuance for governments, and privacy-preserving data-sharing in healthcare as early targets. On the developer front, Midnight said projects building on the network can apply to the Google for Startups Web3 Program, with “up to $200,000 in Google Cloud Platform Credits over two years,” plus training and mentorship—an increasingly standard incentive package in cloud-supported web3 ecosystems but notable for a privacy-centric L1. Midnight’s own post and social messages also emphasize that the Google Cloud collaboration includes support for community tooling and expanded resources, indicating a bid to spur third-party app growth around Midnight’s zero-knowledge stack. Hoskinson’s endorsement underscores the partner-chain strategy that Cardano entities have advanced this year, with Midnight frequently described as the lead privacy chain in that model. While the announcement stops short of financial terms or service-level guarantees, it commits Google Cloud to an operational role on the network—validator operations and security services—beyond marketing or co-branding, and provides direct quotes from both organizations that anchor the collaboration in concrete infrastructure and security deliverables.

Speaking on Lex Fridman's podcast, the Telegram CEO said that he invested in Bitcoin early and that it was very important to him. At this point, Pavel Durov said that early BTC investment was the only lifesaver for him. Durov said that investing a few thousand Bitcoins early in 2013 was the key to getting through the difficult times he went through. Durov stated that he has been a firm believer in Bitcoin's vision since its inception, adding that he purchased approximately $2 million worth of BTC in 2013 when the price was around $700 and then ignored his investment. He added that he wasn't bothered by people mocking him after the price later dropped. “I have been a big believer in Bitcoin almost since its inception. I bought my first few thousand Bitcoins in 2013 and didn't really care about it after that.” He also explained that many people believe that he is making profits from Telegram but this is not the truth, the company is only making losses for him. At this point, Durov emphasized that his past Bitcoin investment was the only reason he was able to withstand financial difficulties. “As I said, Telegram is a money-losing platform for me. Bitcoin is something that keeps me afloat.” Durov added that he believes that Bitcoin's value will one day exceed $1 million due to governments constantly printing money. He explained that this is due to Bitcoin's limited supply and predictable inflation, which cannot be arbitrarily changed. Durov stated that he concluded that the longevity of fiat currencies cannot be guaranteed, stating that Bitcoin will exist forever and adding, “Nobody is printing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is permanent. The future of all fiat currencies is uncertain.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: An Altcoin CEO Who Had a Hard Time Last Year Praises Bitcoin (BTC)!

Ethereum network activity: transactions up to 1.7M, Active Addresses ~422k, ETH range-bound near $4,147 — read the analysis and trade-ready takeaways. What is driving Ethereum’s recent network activity and price action? Ethereum network activity is being driven by rising real-user transactions and renewed on‑chain engagement; daily transactions reached 1.6–1.7 million while Active Addresses rose to ~422k. Despite these fundamentals, ETH price remains range-bound near $4,147 due to weak momentum indicators. How high are transactions and what do they mean? Daily Ethereum transactions recently broke a four‑year range, registering between 1.6 and 1.7 million. Source: CryptoQuant. This uptick, paired with higher Active Addresses, points to growing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and utility-driven demand rather than speculative ticks. As of writing, network throughput shows the highest recorded transaction levels for Ethereum, reflecting sustained user activity across wallets and DeFi protocols. Why are Active Addresses important now? Active Addresses climbed from roughly 342k to 422k, showing a meaningful rebound in on‑chain users. Source: CryptoQuant. When Addresses and Transactions rise together, it typically signals genuine adoption rather than exchange or wash trading. Real-user growth supports long-term value capture for ETH when paired with productive uses like DeFi and NFT activity. How are whales and derivatives impacting ETH flows? Large holders increased exposure while futures/perpetuals volume spiked. Source: Lookonchain (wallet activity); DefiLlama (perpetuals volume). Two wallets related to Bitmine reportedly received 51,255 ETH (~$213M), lifting reported holdings materially. Perpetuals volume for Ethereum reached $1.268 billion on 01 October, the highest since July. These flows show both accumulation and elevated trader positioning. When will momentum confirm a breakout? Momentum indicators remain weak: the Directional Movement Index (DMI) sits near 17 with -DI higher, and the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) is around 33. Source: TradingView. For a bullish trend reversal, DMI needs a +DI flip above -DI and SMI must clear 40. Until momentum confirms, expect ETH to remain range‑bound near $4,000–$4,300, with potential upside retests to $4,250 and $4,456 if whale flows translate to spot buying. Frequently Asked Questions How many transactions did Ethereum record recently? Ethereum recorded between 1.6 and 1.7 million transactions in the latest daily snapshot, marking a multi‑year high and stronger on‑chain demand. Source: CryptoQuant. Is whale accumulation driving ETH price higher? Whale accumulation increases upside potential but has not yet overcome weak momentum indicators; futures volume growth shows rising exposure but price remains range‑bound until technicals improve. What momentum readings should traders watch? Traders should watch DMI for a +DI flip and SMI breaking above 40; these signals would suggest momentum is shifting from bearish to bullish. Key Takeaways On‑chain adoption is up : Transactions and Active Addresses confirm rising real‑user activity. Market positioning is elevated : Whale accumulation and higher perps volume signal increased exposure. Momentum constrains price : Weak DMI/SMI keep ETH range‑bound until technicals improve. Conclusion Ethereum network activity shows clear adoption strength while price action reflects short-term technical inertia. Combining on‑chain data with derivatives positioning gives a balanced view: fundamentals are supportive, but traders should wait for momentum confirmation before assuming a sustained breakout.

This year, XRP sits at a critical juncture, with traders closely monitoring every daily close. In a recent video posted on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO laid out a clear case for why the current corrective phase may be nearing its end. His analysis offers both optimism for an imminent rally and caution for those expecting an immediate surge. Steph’s Outlook on the Current Phase Steph believes XRP is close to breaking free from its corrective structure. “I believe that XRP is at the end of its correction,” he explained, emphasizing that throughout this bull cycle, pump phases have been followed by longer corrective periods. According to him, this pattern remains intact, but history also shows that once XRP breaks a key downward trend line, the correction phase officially ends. He sets a clear benchmark: “If we close above $2.96 with at least one to maybe three daily closes… then we have the confirmation signal that the next pump phase has officially started.” Until then, he acknowledges the possibility that October could remain sideways or slightly bearish before momentum builds in November. #XRP OCTOBER PRICE PREDICTION! (Watch before tomorrow) pic.twitter.com/mdGXycGHYt — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 30, 2025 Technical Picture Heading Into October On the charts, XRP is currently consolidating in a wedge formation . Support lies in the $2.70–$2.80 region, while resistance aligns with the downward trend line Steph has mapped out. He notes: “Every time you break this trend line to the upside, it labels the end of the correction,” making the next break above resistance crucial for traders seeking confirmation of a bullish move. The historical structure of XRP’s corrections supports his claim. Past corrective periods have lasted anywhere from 80 to 115 days, and the current correction is now deep into that time window. This strengthens the case for a near-term shift in momentum. Potential Catalysts for a Breakout Fundamental and psychological factors could support Steph’s technical thesis. XRP recently recorded its strongest quarterly close in history, a milestone that instills confidence among momentum traders and long-term investors. This structural strength adds weight to any breakout above resistance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, institutional involvement in the digital asset sector continues to grow, with ETF-related flows and increasing regulatory clarity influencing market sentiment. Such developments can act as accelerators if the technical breakout aligns with improving fundamentals. As Steph summarized: “Best case scenario, within ten days we could see the start of that next pump phase.” Risk and Confirmation Levels The critical number to watch remains $2.96. Without multiple daily closes above this level, the market remains vulnerable to sideways movement or further retests of lower support. Steph acknowledges this by warning: “Worst case scenario [is] sideways price action in October and then a blast off at the beginning of November or so.” For traders, this means patience is key. Managing risk through careful position sizing and respecting support zones is essential. Confirmation, not speculation, is key to high-confidence entries. In conclusion, October could prove pivotal for XRP’s trajectory. A sustained break above $2.96 would likely confirm the end of the correction and spark a rally into Q4 . If this doesn’t happen, consolidation could continue until November. As Steph reminds traders, the pattern has been consistent: longer corrections eventually give way to powerful breakouts once trend lines are cleared. For now, XRP’s October price prediction rests on a simple but powerful question: will the market deliver confirmation above $2.96, or will traders need to wait just a little longer for the next pump?

The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index ( CD20 ) rose 3.5%. Equities markets excluding the U.S. also moved higher, even as traders remain cautious over the shutdown. Europe’s STOXX 50 is up 0.3% in today’s session, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.7%. Futures on the S&P 500 are, however, down 0.55% while on the Nasdaq they’re down 0.64%. The U.S. government shutdown could lead to economic data delays, which are compounded by looming tariffs on various items. This has seemingly seen investors move away from the country and into alternative stores of value. That uncertainty has seen the price of gold rise 3.75% in the past week to now hover around $3,890 per ounce. Spot crypto ETFs drew in more than $550 million in net inflows on Sept. 30, with spot bitcoin ETFs representing the lion’s share of that figure. The flight to alternative assets is occurring against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep cutting interest rates this month, with Polymarket traders weighing an 85% chance of a 25 bps cut. That figure is near 95% in the CME’s Fedwatch tool. Lower interest rates could make risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies, more appetizing for investors. Institutional involvement has also deepened amid the changing monetary policy. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) overtook Deribit to become the top venue for bitcoin options trading by open interest, now near $38 billion. “We have seen the convergence of both institutional backing and maturation across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is more embedded in the foundations of global finance, and institutional interest is at an all-time high,” Dom Harz, co-foudner of Bitcoin DeFi gateway BOB, told CoinDesk. “Unlike previous years, this Uptober will see more targeted inflows, which could be a breakout moment in accelerating Bitcoin DeFi, as investors will want to do more with their Bitcoin holdings; transforming it from a static store-of-value into a yield-bearing asset class,” he added. Indeed, bitcoin exposure coupled with yield appears to be becoming a new trend. Just this morning Swiss digital bank Sygnym launched a new BTC Alpha Fund , aiming to generate yield on bitcoin without reducing exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements. While traditional markets are likely to see lower volatility due the upcoming data vacuum from the government shutdown, crypto market see a wave of spot ETF decisions in the near future to look forward to. The SEC is scheduled to make decisions on a total of 16 spot crypto ETF applications this month. Stay alert!

ZEC touched $97.25 before retreating back to around $92.00 - a 41% rise for the day on the back of a 36% rise in daily trading volume to $300 million. The surge comes alongside a boost across the wider altcoin market, with DeFi tokens ethena (ENA), curve (CRV) and raydium (RAY) all increasing by more than 8%. A number of catalysts triggered the crypto recovery; notably the U.S. government shutdown that brought the dollar lower and gold to fresh record highs at $3,887. Altcoins have outperformed bitcoin so far on Wednesday, although it's worth noting that the average crypto relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, suggesting that a period of consolidation is on the cards as the market begins to cool. One market outlier was aster, the native token of its namesake's BNB Chain-based perpetual exchange. ASTER slumped by 6.8% on Wednesday to compound a 25% decline over the past week as hype in the HyperLiquid rival begins to fade. Derivatives Positioning The BTC futures market continues to show a strengthening bullish bias. The overall futures open interest remains high at around $31.69 billion, reflecting sustained trader engagement, with Binance still leading the pack at $13.19 billion. Concurrently, the 3-month annualized basis is holding firm between 6% and 7%, indicating that the yield from the basis trade remains robust. This consistent metric across both open interest and basis suggests that traders are not only increasing their exposure but are doing so with conviction, reinforcing the positive sentiment observed in the market. The BTC options market continues to show a divergence between its key metrics, presenting a complex picture of market sentiment. While the 25 Delta Skew for short-term options remains low, suggesting that traders are still willing to pay a premium for puts to hedge against downside risk, the 24-hour Put/Call Volume points to a surge in bullish speculation. The latest data shows that calls now make up 63.54% of the total volume, a strong reversal from a put-dominated market. This conflicting data indicates a highly polarized environment where some traders are hedging against potential price drops, while a larger number are actively betting on a short-term rally. Funding rates have not only remained positive on major exchanges like Binance and OKX, but have picked up across the board, including on the historically volatile Hyperliquid. Deribit, in particular, is seeing a significant premium, with its annualized funding rate jumping to 17%. This indicates a strong and sustained demand for leveraged long positions, as traders are consistently willing to pay a high premium to hold their bullish bets. The widespread positive funding across all major platforms signals a collective market conviction in a continued upward trend for BTC. Coinglass data shows $644 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 38-62 split between longs and shorts. BTC ($166 million), ETH ($164 million) and Others ($69 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $116,650 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise.

After finding acceptance above the yearly open, which coincides with the 20D EMA, PUMP has now traded back to the first highs at $0.0069. If momentum continues, PUMP can target the daily order block around $0.0074, which, if cleared, could lead to new all-time highs. Bulls will want to see PUMP continue trading above the yearly open in the event of a drawdown.

52515944,https://finbold.com/?p=254465,1759317257,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,XRP Q4 price prediction after 30% Q3 rally,https://finbold.com/xrp-q4-price-prediction-after-30-q3-rally/,"XRP ended Q3 2025 on a strong note, rising from $2.20 in early July to $2.90 by the end of September, a gain of 31%, marking one of its best quarterly performances in years. With this momentum, cryptocurrency analyst Mikybull outlined the possible outlook for XRP as Q4 begins. In an X post on October 1, the analyst noted that XRP’s bullish quarterly close above long-term resistance is the first since 2017, a setup that previously preceded one of the token’s most explosive rallies. XRP price analysis. Source: TradingView This outlook is supported by XRP forming a multi-year inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that has now broken to the upside. The breakout points to potential continuation, with immediate resistance near $5.50 and long-term targets at $19, $63, and even $215 if the pattern fully plays out over the coming years. With momentum rising, Q4 could be crucial. If buyers sustain the breakout, higher levels may follow, though past cycles suggest rallies often bring profit-taking and volatility, so caution is advised. Notably, XRP’s trajectory is also influenced by broader market catalysts. In this case, the SEC is reviewing multiple spot XRP ETF applications, with decisions expected between October 18 and November 14, including Grayscale’s on October 18. Industry sentiment is optimistic, with approval odds above 99%, and analysts predict a potential price surge to $20 and $30 by 2026 if the ETFs attract institutional capital inflows. XRP price analysis At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $2.94, up almost 4% in the past 24 hours and over 2% in the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, the 50-day SMA at $2.96 sits just above the current price, indicating potential short-term resistance, while the 200-day SMA at $2.50 provides solid long-term support, with the current price 14% above it. The 14-day RSI at 47.16 suggests neutral momentum, leaving room for accumulation before a significant move and likely stabilizing XRP ahead of any breakout.

Speaking at the conference earlier today, Chief Executive Paolo Ardoino told the audience that Rumble will launch a Tether-powered crypto wallet featuring USAT and other stablecoins, scheduled for release later this year. “Rumble has 51 million active users per month,” Ardoino said. “That is already a huge amount of users if you compare it to what the competition has now in the United States.” According to Bloomberg data, Tether holds a 48% stake in Rumble, having invested $775 million in 2024. The deal gave Tether significant influence over the YouTube rival, which Americans have dubbed a conservative-leaning alternative to mainstream platforms. USAT stablecoin was launched for American users According to the USDT issuer, USAT is a dollar-backed stablecoin created for the US market, specifically because it complies with American regulatory standards. Bo Hines, a former Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council under President Donald Trump, was appointed CEO of USAT. The team will be based in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Hines has political roots. Tether has long profited from investing the reserves backing its flagship USDT stablecoin into US Treasuries and similar assets. In the second quarter, the El Salvador-based company reported $4.9 billion in profit, according to a July blog post from the company. USDT is the largest stablecoin in circulation, with a supply of $174.6 billion, per data from CoinGecko. Its main rival, Circle’s USDC, trails as the second-largest digital dollar but has more influence and ties to US crypto exchanges like Coinbase. Tether’s acquisition of Rumble shares in December 2024 secured nearly half the company. Rumble used $250 million of the proceeds to support growth initiatives, while the rest funded a self-tender offer for up to 70 million shares of Class A stock at $7.50 each, the same price as Tether’s investment. Rumble’s founder and CEO, Chris Pavlovski, maintained his controlling stake after the Tether agreement. “Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth,” Pavlovski said. US stablecoin market heats up, Tether makes more investments The stablecoin sector has grown exponentially since the passage of the GENIUS Act in July, which established a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins. The legislation, championed and signed into law by President Trump, has encouraged private issuers to expand operations in the country. After years of absence from the US due to sanctions, Tether’s return to the US saw it pay a $41 million fine to settle allegations that it misrepresented its reserves. Cryptopolitan had reported that Tether is seeking to raise up to $20 billion through the sale of a 3% stake. According to a Bloomberg exclusive, the offering could value the company at nearly $500 billion, pitting it against some of the world’s largest private firms like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ChatGPT parent company OpenAI. One source close to the discussions insisted that talks are still at an early stage, and final details, including the size of the stake, could change. A few hours after the news broke, Ardoino took to his X account to say the “key investors” were involved and the “valuation is a discount,” without elaborating on the math. According to CEO Ardoino, the proceeds from a potential capital raise could support Tether’s ambitions in artificial intelligence. The company is reportedly hiring dozens of specialists to build an AI platform capable of running on low-cost smartphones. The project includes an offline language-translation app powered by AI agents to be used in developing regions with limited internet connectivity, particularly in Africa and South America.

Firma potwierdziła zakup 8 888 bitcoinów o zawrotnej wartości około miliarda dolarów. To nie jest kolejny ruch na giełdowej szachownicy. Kierunek, który obrał Tether to sygnał, że cyfrowe złoto staje się coraz ważniejsze w portfelach największych graczy. Mimo korekt i sprzecznych prognoz, Bitcoin uważany jest za opłacalną długofalową inwestycję, czego potwierdzeniem jest fakt, że Tether wzmacnia rezerwy BTC. Tether nie zwalnia tempa Jak potwierdziła platforma analityczna Onchain Lens, Tether sfinalizował transakcję w ostatnim dniu trzeciego kwartału 2025 roku. Chwilę później CEO spółki, Paolo Ardoino, w krótkim wpisie na X potwierdził, że kolejny miliard dolarów zamienił się w Bitcoina. Dzięki tej operacji Tether posiada już niemal 10 940 BTC . To pozycjonuje go na drugim miejscu wśród prywatnych firm z największymi rezerwami Bitcoina. Ustępują jedynie Block One, kontrolującemu aż 164 000 BTC. Skąd ta strategia? Tether nie pierwszy raz kupuje tak duże ilości Bitcoina. Pierwsze zakupy do rezerw spółka ogłosiła już we wrześniu 2022 roku. W maju 2023 padła jasna deklaracja, że nawet 15% kwartalnych zysków będzie przeznaczane na kolejne zakupy BTC. Ta polityka przynosi efekty. Adres rezerwowy Tethera, zaczynający się od „bc1qj” należy obecnie do dziesiątki największych posiadaczy Bitcoina na świecie, ustępując głównie zimnym portfelom giełd. Trend wśród firm Tether nie działa w próżni. Coraz więcej przedsiębiorstw inwestuje w BTC. Strategy, globalny lider pod względem rezerw, trzyma na bilansie ponad 640 000 BTC . Cypryjska spółka żeglugowa Robin Energy także dołączyła do grona posiadaczy. Jej debiutancki zakup opiewał na 5 milionów dolarów. Wszystko to sprawia, że podaż w obiegu maleje , a presja cenowa rośnie. Raport Fidelity potwierdza, że im więcej instytucji akumuluje Bitcoina, tym mniej go zostaje na rynku. W efekcie inwestorzy indywidualni muszą szukać alternatywnych możliwości wejścia w ten ekosystem. Bitcoin Hyper, czyli nowe spojrzenie na Bitcoina Właśnie tu pojawia się Bitcoin Hyper . Świeży projekt infrastrukturalny, który zbiera coraz większe zainteresowanie wśród sympatyków aktywów cyfrowych. Twórcy chcą zbudować niezależną warstwę drugą dla Bitcoina , opartą na Solana Virtual Machine. Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogliby wykonywać transakcje szybciej i taniej, a dodatkowo korzystać z funkcji stakingu i aplikacji DeFi. Projekt już teraz przyciągnął ponad 19,5 miliona dolarów w ramach przedsprzedaży, a cena jednego tokena to 0,013005 USD . Jak działa Hyper? Mechanizm jest prosty: użytkownik przesyła BTC do sieci Hyper poprzez most Bitcoin Relay. System analizuje transakcję i emituje token reprezentacyjny w ekosystemie Hyper. Ten token można wykorzystać do stakingu, przesyłania środków czy udziału w DeFi. Kluczową rolę odgrywają zero-knowledge proofs , które zabezpieczają transakcje i gwarantują prywatność. Z kolei Solana VM zapewnia szybkość i skalowalność, niwelując kluczową bolączkę BTC. Dlaczego $HYPER może odegrać kluczową rolę? Zakupy Tethera pokazują, że Bitcoin jest traktowany jako skarbiec wartości. Ale jednocześnie rośnie potrzeba nowych narzędzi, które odblokują dodatkowe możliwości dla użytkowników. Bitcoin Hyper jest próbą połączenia stabilności BTC z innowacyjnością DeFi. Dzięki temu powstaje pomost między klasycznym Bitcoinem a nowoczesnymi rozwiązaniami, które do tej pory były domeną Ethereum czy Solany. Token $HYPER – więcej niż inwestycja Całkowita podaż Hyper została ograniczona do 21 miliardów tokenów. Model deflacyjny zwiększa przewidywalność i ogranicza ryzyko inflacji. Środki rozdzielono na rozwój, staking, marketing i płynność. Najważniejsze jednak jest to, że staking aktywuje się automatycznie . Nie trzeba wykonywać dodatkowych kroków. Nagrody naliczają się same, a środki można wycofać w każdej chwili. To rozwiązanie szczególnie przyjazne dla osób, które dopiero zastanawiają się, jak kupić kryptowaluty i nie mają dużego doświadczenia w obsłudze skomplikowanych narzędzi. Portfele i wygoda użytkownika Token $HYPER działa zarówno w standardzie ERC-20, jak i BEP-20. Można go przechowywać w popularnych aplikacjach jak MetaMask, Trust Wallet czy Best Wallet. Ten ostatni uznawany jest za topowy portfel krypto , bo integruje obsługę przedsprzedaży i stakingu w jednym miejscu. Takie podejście eliminuje bariery techniczne. Użytkownik nie musi przeskakiwać między różnymi platformami, aby śledzić swój stan konta i nagrody. Co łączy Tether i Bitcoin Hyper? Na pierwszy rzut oka to dwa różne światy. Z jednej strony gigant finansowy, który dywersyfikuje rezerwy, a z drugiej nowy projekt technologiczny w fazie rozwoju. Jednak wspólnym mianownikiem jest wiara w Bitcoina jako fundament . Tether akumuluje BTC w skarbcach, a Hyper daje możliwość korzystania z jego wartości w bardziej dynamiczny sposób. Razem tworzą obraz rynku, w którym Bitcoin to nie tylko pasywny zasób, ale aktywne narzędzie budowania nowej gospodarki cyfrowej. Tether, kupując kolejne 8 888 BTC, wysyła jasny sygnał, że Bitcoin pozostaje najwazniejszym ogniwem kryptowalut. BTC pozostaje także bezsprzecznie kluczowym elementem globalnych finansów cyfrowych. Inwestorzy, którzy zastanawiają się, gdzie może być najlepsza giełda kryptowalut albo jak w praktyce działać na rynku, powinni śledzić zarówno ruchy gigantów pokroju Tethera, jak i innowacyjne projekty w rodzaju Hyper. To właśnie tam może kryć się kolejna fala adopcji i potencjalnych zysków.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|SOL|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 11:22:15

These forces lifted Bitcoin above $116,000 and reduced downside protection demand, signaling growing institutional confidence and a materially improved probability of further gains this quarter. ETF inflows and institutional positioning are the primary bullish drivers. Short liquidations and options skew contraction show reduced downside hedging. Bitcoin surged past $116,000; total crypto market cap reached $4.09 trillion on October 1. Bitcoin Q4 outlook: ETF flows, dovish Fed, and Q4 seasonality lifted BTC to $116K. Read expert analysis and market signals now. What is driving the Bitcoin Q4 outlook? Bitcoin Q4 outlook is shaped by sustained ETF demand, a dovish Federal Reserve outlook, and persistent Q4 seasonality. These factors lifted BTC above $116,000 and increased market-wide capitalization, while options and liquidation metrics point to lower downside hedging and heightened bullish sentiment. How did today’s rally unfold and what were the key data points? On Wednesday morning, Bitcoin surged past $116,000, erasing much of September’s losses and pushing total crypto market capitalization to $4.09 trillion. At publication time, Bitcoin was trading near $116,441, up approximately 3.1% on the day, per CoinGecko data. Short liquidations during the London session wiped out roughly $60 million in short bets, according to Coinalyze data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Q4 outlook: ETF demand, dovish Fed and Q4 seasonality lift BTC past $116K"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin Q4 outlook improved as ETF inflows, dovish Fed signals and historical Q4 strength pushed BTC above $116,000, reducing demand for downside protection."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""name"": ""Bitcoin Q4 outlook"" }} Why do options skew and dominance metrics matter for the outlook? Options data shows a roughly 55% decline in Bitcoin’s 25-delta skew, indicating reduced demand for downside protection. Glassnode’s note on Bitcoin dominance rising from 57% to 59% after breaking $114,000 signals a healthier market structure and suggests rallies led by Bitcoin tend to be more durable than altcoin-led moves. Frequently Asked Questions Will ETF flows keep supporting Bitcoin in Q4? ETF flows have been a consistent demand source; continued inflows would likely sustain upward pressure. Institutional positioning and ETF activity are cited by market analysts as core drivers of the current bullish setup. How likely is a sustained Q4 rally for Bitcoin? Historical seasonality shows strong Q4 performance: over the past 12 years, Q4 delivered a median gain of more than 50% for Bitcoin, per Coinglass data. Combined with current market signals, the probability of a bullish Q4 has increased. What short-term risks should traders monitor?

Key Takeaways ETF demand drives structural buying : Sustained ETF flows are a core bullish engine for Bitcoin. Market structure improved : Bitcoin dominance recovery and fewer downside hedges point to healthier breadth. Seasonality and macro align : Historical Q4 strength plus a dovish Fed increase probability of continued gains; monitor ETF flows and macro data. How to act on the Bitcoin Q4 outlook?

BlackRock added $136M to BTC and ETH ETFs, emphasizing institutional confidence. IBIT now holds roughly 781,900 BTC; ETHA saw structured allocations totalling ~16,901 ETH. BlackRock manages $103.7B in crypto products, balancing Bitcoin’s store-of-value role with Ethereum’s smart-contract utility.

BlackRock’s ETF buying refers to the firm routing $136 million in fresh Bitcoin and Ethereum purchases into addresses linked to its IBIT and ETHA ETFs via Coinbase Prime. These structured buys included ~794 BTC in multi-million-dollar batches and ~16,901 ETH across two allocations. How much Bitcoin and Ethereum did BlackRock buy? BlackRock transferred approximately $136 million in crypto: roughly 794 BTC in batches valued near $11.30M each, 6,901 ETH (~$28.44M) and 10,000 ETH (~$41.21M).

Subsequent flows moderated: occasional withdrawals in April and August exceeded 5,000 BTC, while recent daily movements range from 1,000–4,000 BTC, suggesting steady accumulation with tactical liquidity management. Frequently Asked Questions How does BlackRock acquire ETF assets like BTC and ETH? BlackRock purchases assets through institutional custody and execution partners (for this reporting, purchases flowed via Coinbase Prime) and allocates them to ETF custody accounts to back share issuance and maintain NAV integrity. Does BlackRock’s buying change market structure? Large institutional purchases can reduce available spot liquidity short-term and signal confidence, but structured buys (larger blocks spread over time) aim to limit market impact and preserve orderly pricing.

Diversified approach: The firm balances Bitcoin’s role as digital gold with Ethereum’s smart-contract utility. Long-term positioning: Steady accumulation and structured buys suggest emphasis on sustained exposure, not short-term trading. Conclusion BlackRock’s recent purchases for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and BlackRock Ethereum ETF reinforce its institutional strategy of allocating to both store-of-value and utility-layer digital assets.

No longer viewed as offering outsized returns, SHIB’s growth potential is now fairly modest as investors seek out projects with genuine utility and improved fundamentals. Leading the way in that shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi darling now at a modest $0.035. The project is over 50% sold out phase 6 of its presale. Compared to meme-based tokens that rely on social media hype, Mutuum Finance is building a strong financial framework with peer-to-peer and pool lending, staking rewards with dynamic tiers, and real yield generation, providing genuine value to investors. Already, over 16,670 holders are in the list and over $16.6 million has been raised from presale, showing MUTM’s early momentum as potentially being one of the most explosive altcoins of 2025. Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal Indicators as Supporting Levels Hold Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing initial signs of a potential bullish reversal after a decline below a significant support level in a false breakdown, before reversing to re-take the ground in a hurry, a move which indicates hidden strength behind recent price action. The token is now testing the lower border of a clear triangle formation after rebuffing from the balance zone, and a decent break above $0.00001250 can resuscitate momentum to the $0.00001350 target zone. The price configuration is such that the bears might have exhausted themselves in bear pressure, and there is ample room for SHIB to stage a comeback to Q4. However, as investors keep on looking for utility-based alternatives for further upside potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps on capturing an increasingly large share of the limelight. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Keeps Gathering Pace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is recording explosive gains at its sixth presale stage, demand surging as the project surpasses $16.6 million raised and gains the backing of more than 16,670 investors. Investors early on are positioning themselves for potentially astronomical gains when the token hits the open market. Mutuum Finance is also laying the groundwork for a well-healthy DeFi ecosystem with the launch of a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. As part of its platform security and investor trust promise, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to introduce a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Coders, white-hat hackers, and security researchers are invited to participate in the program to discover bugs, with payout depending on the severity ranging from low and minor through major and critical. The initiative is supplementing community participation with an early bird $100,000 giveaway , offering an additional motivation to join the presale. Mutuum Finance protocol design is a close-order book system that will eliminate market risk and reduce illiquidity. The most important parameters of liquidation levels, close-level conditions, and liquidator incentives are fixed to provide a safe and stable lending process. Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels and liquidation levels are dynamically tuned based on asset volatility, and riskier assets will impose tighter lending conditions. Apart from that, risk-weighted multipliers are applied across asset classes to ensure maximum overall resilience, security, and stability in a range of market conditions. With strong presale traction, a growing ecosystem, and great focus on security and risk management, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a key driver of the next generation of decentralized finance platforms. Top Utility Token of 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the top utility-based altcoins in 2025, having raised over $16.6 million from over 16,670 investors and sold over 50% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. Unlike meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), MUTM offers real-world DeFi usage in the form of peer-to-peer and pooled lending, a USD-backed stablecoin, and robust risk mitigation features that attract retail and whale investors. MUTM offers investors a high-potential investment opportunity before listing on the market. Lock in your tokens now.

Metaplanet Adds More Bitcoin Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet made another massive addition to its crypto holdings, and announced that it bought 5,268 BTC for 91.6 billion yen ($623 million). The purchase price equated to roughly 17.4 million yen, or $118,328, per coin. With this acquisition, the company now holds a total of 30,823 BTC, which makes it the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. According to CEO Simon Gerovich, only Strategy, MARA Holdings, and XXI hold larger reserves. The announcement was made just days after Metaplanet disclosed its largest single Bitcoin acquisition to date on Sept. 21, when it bought $632 million worth of BTC. Gerovich said in a Wednesday post on X that the Q3 earnings and recent purchases prove the firm’s scalability and reinforce the foundation for its long-term treasury goals. Metaplanet’s Q3 financial results also shed some light on the momentum behind its strategy. The company reported revenue of 2.438 billion yen ($16.5 million), a 115.7% increase from Q2. Gerovich pointed out that this performance supports Metaplanet’s plan to issue preferred shares as part of a larger $1.4 billion capital raise. The company previously announced that it will issue 385 million new shares, with the proceeds dedicated to even more Bitcoin purchases. In addition, its board recently approved the creation of a US subsidiary, Metaplanet Income Corp., which will focus on scaling a “Bitcoin income generation” business that includes derivatives and other related financial products. Despite the bold expansion, the company’s stock faced short-term volatility. Metaplanet shares dropped 10.26% in Tokyo, which extended a 38% decline over the past month. However, the company is still up more than 48% year-to-date. In contrast, US-traded shares under the ticker MTPLF gained 8.86% to close at $3.96 on Tuesday. Metaplanet’s share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Metaplanet’s ongoing accumulation and structural expansion suggest that the company is doubling down on its role as a leading corporate player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, despite the fact that short-term market reactions are mixed. Massachusetts Weighs Bitcoin Reserve It is not just companies planning on loading up on Bitcoin. Lawmakers in Massachusetts are preparing to weigh in on a proposal that could place the state among a growing group of US jurisdictions considering Bitcoin as part of their financial reserves. The state’s Joint Revenue Committee is set to hold a hearing on a bill that was first introduced in February by Republican Senator Peter Durant, which would establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The legislation will allow the state to deposit any Bitcoin or other digital assets seized by the commonwealth into the reserve and authorize the treasury to allocate up to 10% of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund for crypto investments. Part of the proposed Bill The push is part of the trend among Republican lawmakers in multiple states advocating for Bitcoin as part of government holdings. However, the bill faces an uphill battle in Massachusetts, where Democrats hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate, as well as control of the governor’s office. The state’s entire congressional delegation is also Democratic, which casts some doubt on whether a Republican-led initiative has a realistic path to passage. Durant’s proposal is similar to efforts across the country where states consider whether to follow the federal government’s lead. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national stockpile of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, partly sourced from seized assets. Congressional Republicans are currently seeking to codify that order into law through the BITCOIN Act. So far, only a few states, including Texas and New Hampshire, actually enacted laws to hold Bitcoin reserves. Others like Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wyoming rejected or failed to advance similar proposals in 2025. New bills in Michigan and Ohio are still under consideration. For Massachusetts, the decision to explore a Bitcoin reserve proves that there is at least some growing interest in digital assets as a hedge against inflation. This strategy was popularized by corporate players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has been steadily expanding its Bitcoin holdings. The upcoming hearing will determine whether Massachusetts might move in the same direction or stall like other states have done.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 11:30:00

Binance’s co-founder Changpeng Zhao confirmed that the hacker made away with $13,000. In a statement posted on X at around 08:26 AM UTC, the BNB Chain team said the attacker used the compromised account to post ten phishing links. The malicious links tricked users into connecting their wallets and signing off on fraudulent transactions. Update on Account Security Incident We’re back! The team has regained full access of the @BNBCHAIN account. The root cause of this breach is still under active investigation and we will share the updates as soon as we can. The estimated damage is $8K and the victims will be… — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 At the time of its update, the team revealed that investigations were ongoing, and the total amount stolen from several blockchains reached around $8,000. The largest single victim suffered losses of $6,500 after interacting with one of the links. The attacker also deployed one phishing contract address, injecting $17,800 before cashing out all of his meme tokens for $22,000. CZ, the former Binance chief executive, confirmed the attack had been neutralized, but not before the exploiter caused the chain an estimated loss of $13,000. “Hacker went through all this trouble, plus criminal liability. He could have made more by building. Victims will be compensated in full,” Zhao wrote on X. CZ, Binance Chain, thank community vigilance for quick recovery BNB Chain has thanked the community for spreading word of the exploit, saying alerts from users helped limit the impact of the hack. “A massive thank you to our community and partners for spreading the word quickly, staying vigilant and supportive throughout this incident,” the statement read. Following his earlier post on the account’s restoration, Zhao also noted that the community “mocked” the hacker after they tried to sell meme tokens. “Interestingly, after the hacker dumped ALL his tokens for a $4k gain, the community took over and bought the meme coin higher, as a mock at the hacker. Funniest comeback by the community,” he remarked. According to security platform SlowMist, the hacker used a well-known phishing technique that swaps similar-looking characters in website domains. SlowMist’s chief information security officer explained that the fake website changed the letter “i” to “l” in order to appear legitimate. “BNB Chain’s English official X account has been hacked! The phishing website changed the letter i into l,” the chief security officer posted, adding that the malicious domain could be connected to the Inferno phishing group.

Crypto hackers swindle $306 million in Q3 The breach of BNB Chain’s X account comes during a year of frequent mid-sized crypto hacks, and one massive exploit that saw Bybit lose over $1 billion. According to Finbold’s Q3 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report in conjunction with SlowMist, the crypto market lost $306.7 million in hacks during the third quarter alone. Unlike the first quarter, when a $1.5 billion Bybit incident was the headline, the third quarter was characterized by a cluster of smaller but damaging breaches. The largest was the $54 million theft from Turkish exchange BtcTurk, where details of the attack are still unknown. Other incidents included $44.2 million stolen from CoinDCX due to a security flaw, $42 million drained from GMX via a reentrancy exploit, $41.5 million lost at SwissBorg because of a third-party vulnerability, and $27 million stolen from BigONE in a supply chain attack. Data from blockchain security firm CertiK showed that in the month of September, platforms lost $155.9 million. Of this amount, $26.4 million came directly from phishing attacks, alongside 14 exploits each resulting in losses of at least $1 million.

According to Coindesk, Sygnum Bank launched the BTC Alpha Fund for its investors. Accordingly, Sygnum launched the BTC Alpha Fund, which allows investors to generate returns by holding Bitcoin without selling it. This new Fund promises annual returns of 8-10% in Bitcoin by transforming stranded assets into larger investments using smart arbitrage and DeFi strategies. By converting arbitrage gains into Bitcoin, investors can increase their holdings without reducing their exposure to BTC's long-term price appreciation. Only 0.8% of Bitcoin's supply is currently used in DeFi, which equates to less than $6.5 billion of the approximately $1 trillion market. According to Sygnum, this suggests significant growth potential for Bitcoin-based yield products. The fund targets professional and institutional investors and returns are paid in Bitcoin. Markus Hammerli, head of the BTC Alpha Fund, says the product has already seen significant interest. He also notes that every $1 billion inflow into Bitcoin ETFs could boost prices by 3-6% due to Bitcoin's limited supply and multiplier effect. *This is not investment advice.

The asset recovered after Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao stated he believed the price dip was a temporary shaking of weak hands. ASTER recovered to $1.70, following a local low of $1.50.

Markets always try to shake out the weak hands. The foundation/support is more solid without them. 🤷‍♂️ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 1, 2025 The recovery arrived after ASTER briefly wiped out 30% of its value, diminishing its market cap by $1B within hours. The price drop happened right after Zhao spoke during an X space at @Shillin_villian , outlining the risks and opportunities of the Aster DEX. ASTER dipped to local lows of $1.50, before recovering the $1.70 range. | Source: CoinGecko . ASTER fell prey to FUD on having a sniped supply, wash trading, or other non-organic activities. However, Zhao also expressed long-term support for the project, in its bid to challenge Hyperliquid and become a leading perp DEX. Is ASTER undervalued? According to the recent X Spaces moderator Alex, ASTER has an extremely high mindshare, yet it is underperforming. The project has shown to be profitable from its initial trading days, easily challenging other perp DEX. The amount of mindshare aster has while the token price is moving slowly is very peculiar Somethings off… This token is gonna send Its too profitable and its too under priced Something is holding it back… cant put my finger on it… but dont get shaken out — Alex (@ShiLLin_ViLLian) October 1, 2025 The Aster perp DEX continues to produce fees of over $15M per day, with over $25M as of September 28, an all-time peak. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Aster gained significant exposure from its fee generation. The trading of ASTER still depends on decentralized markets, which are more chaotic. Retail investors are also not always looking at the long-term value of the Aster project. ASTER also trades on the open market, unlike HYPE, which started out on its own native platform. Currently, ASTER relies on Bybit, Gate, and MEXC, though the token expects major listings in October. Can Aster challenge Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid still produces over $3M in daily fees, and continues to attract high-profile whales. For Aster, the initial growth in mindshare cannot translate into tracking whale positions, due to the structure of the DEX and its dark liquidity pools. For now, Aster still lags behind Hyperliquid , which carries over $12B in total open interest, while Aster is still at around $1.5B in open interest. Aster is also still relying on point farming, and offers no other services except perp DEX trading. Hyperliquid’s ecosystem has already added tokens, as well as NFTs, and retains its first-mover advantage. The coming weeks may change the ratio, if Aster continues its rapid growth. Currently, the new perp DEX advantage suggests ASTER is undervalued, based on the fee production. However, for now Aster traders have logged relatively smaller earnings when compared to top Hyperliquid whales. Despite this, whale trader James Wynn switched to promoting his Aster signup code, though still trading on Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid is also not giving up, as its token retains some strength. HYPE recovered to $45.61 following the latest downturn, expecting a bigger potential breakout. HYPE has also been challenged by other projects with a similar model, though their tokens have diminished over time. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

52517314,594250,1759320022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52517314.jpeg,Gary Gensler’s Vanishing Messages Trigger Republican Inquiry,https://bitcoinist.com/gary-genslers-vanishing-messages-trigger-republican-inquiry/,"Former Securities And Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler lost nearly a year of text messages after an automated IT action, a federal review found. According to a special review by the SEC’s Office of Inspector General, information technology staff triggered an automated “enterprise wipe” that erased text messages sent and received on Gary Gensler’s government phone between October 18, 2022, and September 6, 2023. The review says the device had not been backed up during that interval, and routine alerts and change controls were missed or ignored. Gary Gensler & The Missing Text: Inspector General’s Findings The OIG report found the wipe resulted from a poorly understood automated policy put in place by the SEC’s Office of Information Technology in August 2023. Based on the review, the wipe was avoidable and was compounded by weak change management, failures to act on vendor software flaws, and a lack of timely backups — gaps that left key messages unrecoverable. The report lists recommendations and said agency management has responded with corrective steps. Lawmakers See A Double Standard House Republican leaders are pressing the SEC for answers. Based on reports from the House Financial Services Committee, Republican chairmen have written to SEC Chair Paul Atkins seeking details about how the loss happened, what records were affected, and whether the agency’s recordkeeping met federal law. They point out that in fiscal year 2023 the SEC obtained more than $400 million in penalties tied to recordkeeping and off-channel communications by firms, and say the agency itself must meet the same standard it enforced on others. Political And Legal Stakes The missing messages overlap with a busy year of enforcement actions and policy talks at the SEC. Reports have disclosed that some deleted texts involved enforcement work tied to crypto cases and other high-profile matters, which could matter to litigants and to records requests under the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA . Across the industry, critics point to Gary Gensler as instrumental in an alleged Biden administration campaign to nudge banks into restricting services to crypto companies, and they charge that the SEC under his watch weakened the sector by bringing several lawsuits. What The Agency Has Said And What’s Next The SEC’s OIT and agency leadership have acknowledged the failures flagged by the OIG and have described steps to fix system controls and backup processes. The House committee’s letter asks for a full account and timelines, and signals lawmakers may follow up with additional oversight or hearings. For now, investigators and agency officials are focused on closing the technical gaps the report identified.

52517249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=830009,1759320057,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52517249.jpeg,"Bitcoin Will Go To $1 Million, Telegram Founder Durov Predicts",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-1-million-telegram-founder-durov/,"Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, used a wide-ranging conversation on the Lex Fridman Podcast to make one of his clearest long-term calls on Bitcoin yet: “I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” The remarks appear on Fridman’s newly released episode with Durov. Why Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million: Pavel Durov Pressed by Fridman on why he kept accumulating Bitcoin and whether he sees further upside, Durov traced his conviction to the asset’s earliest days and to its monetary design. “I was a big believer in Bitcoin since more or less the start of it,” he said, recalling that he bought “my first few thousand of Bitcoin in 2013,” around “$700 per Bitcoin,” and refused to sell even as the price later fell toward $300. Related Reading: Will October Crown Bitcoin Or Break It? Key Levels In Play “And my response to them was, I don’t care. I’m not going to sell it. I believe in this thing.” For Durov, the crux is Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and predictable issuance: “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange… The governments keep printing money like no tomorrow. Nobody’s printing Bitcoin. There is a predictable inflation and then it stops at a certain point. Bitcoin is here to stay.” Durov also drew a sharp line between his personal finances and Telegram’s operating economics, saying Bitcoin appreciation has effectively financed his lifestyle, not profits from the company. “Telegram is a money losing operation for me personally. Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat,” he noted, adding that his long-term horizon on the asset has not changed since his early purchases more than a decade ago. The timing of Durov’s $1 million thesis is notable given Telegram’s expanding role at crypto’s consumer edge. The company has progressively integrated the TON ecosystem into its product and business model, committing to Toncoin-based ad payments and revenue sharing for channel owners and opening its advertising platform to a broad set of markets. That TON-denominated ad infrastructure has been credited with catalyzing user and developer activity across Telegram’s mini-app economy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders At Cost Basis: SOPR At 1 Signals Mareket Equilibrium On the wallet side, Telegram’s crypto functionality—first rolled out internationally—extended to the United States in July 2025, with the TON community’s wallet mini-app enabling in-app transfers and payments. The US expansion followed what Telegram described as nine-figure global wallet activation metrics in 2024, underscoring the scale of a potential distribution channel for on-chain payments and games. As for the $1 million number itself, Durov anchored it in supply discipline and fiat debasement rather than in short-term market catalysts. His reasoning tracks with hard-cap arguments long advanced by Bitcoin’s most committed holders: issuance is programmatic and terminal, while fiscal and monetary expansion remains discretionary.

Nobody is printing bitcoin.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/AiDwr7xVkQ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 30, 2025 Whether that macro narrative alone can deliver seven-figure prices is a market question; what Durov made clear is that his own positioning reflects a decade of conviction. “Just look at the trends,” he told Fridman. “Bitcoin is here to stay. All the fiat currencies remain to be seen.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,372.

In a letter issued on September 30, the SEC’s Division of Investment Management responded to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP on behalf of financial advisers. The letter confirmed that, for now, state-chartered trusts may be treated as “banks” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 when safeguarding digital assets. Advisers Get Green Light to Store Client Crypto With State Trusts The decision means investment advisers and regulated funds may place client crypto holdings and related cash with such entities without breaching federal custody rules. The no-action position is significant because advisers under federal law must use a “qualified custodian” to hold client assets, typically a national bank or trust company with recognized fiduciary powers. Until now, state-chartered trust companies were not universally viewed as eligible custodians for crypto assets. The SEC’s guidance comes with conditions. Advisers must conduct due diligence to ensure the state-chartered trust is authorized by its state banking authority to provide crypto custody, maintains audited financial statements, and has internal controls verified by independent accountants. They must also confirm that the trust follows strict policies to protect private keys, segregate client assets, and prohibit rehypothecation without client consent. The letter emphasized that the SEC’s stance does not constitute formal rulemaking. “Our letter provides our position on enforcement action only and does not provide any legal conclusions,” wrote Taylor Evenson, senior counsel in the Division of Investment Management. He added that the position could change if facts differ or if the Commission pursues new custodial rules currently under consideration. Market analysts said the move could broaden the crypto custody market. BREAKING: The @SECGov has issued a no-action letter saying that investment advisers can use state-chartered trust companies as qualified custodians for crypto assets. What does this mean? Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, advisers must keep client assets with a… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) September 30, 2025 Bloomberg’s Eleanor Terrett noted that advisers and funds now have clearer assurance they can use state trust companies, which opens the door to greater participation from firms such as Coinbase, Ripple’s Standard Custody, BitGo, and WisdomTree. Brian Daly, director of the Division of Investment Management, said the additional clarity was necessary to address doubts about whether state-chartered trusts qualified. Industry reaction has been largely positive. ETF analyst James Seyffart described the letter as “a textbook example of more clarity for the digital asset space,” adding that it reflects the type of regulatory guidance firms have sought for years. This is a textbook example of more clarity for the digital asset space. Exactly the sort of thing the industry was asking for over the last few years. And it keeps coming. https://t.co/vIA9XQ0XMU — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 30, 2025 Daly also said the guidance was designed to meet current needs. “We believe the market will benefit from having this guidance for today’s products, today’s managers, and today’s issues,” he said. While the letter provides a near-term path for advisers, it stops short of providing long-term certainty. The SEC stressed that all existing custody requirements remain in force and that future rulemaking could revisit the treatment of crypto custody under federal law. SEC Signals Major Policy Shift Under Chair Paul Atkins, Softening Stance on Crypto The SEC is showing a major policy shift, moving away from the lawsuit-heavy approach of its previous administration and toward a more collaborative framework for crypto and corporate oversight. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who took office in April, said the agency will issue preliminary notices of potential technical violations before pursuing enforcement, giving companies up to six months to respond. “You can’t just suddenly come and bash down their door,” Atkins said, criticizing the enforcement-first approach of former chair Gary Gensler. SEC softens stance with warning notices before crackdowns, while Trump pushes an SEC shakeup and UK–US unite on stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulations https://t.co/OsAJZnw5fm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 19, 2025 During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC pursued lawsuits against Ripple, Binance, Coinbase, and others, cases Atkins said lacked predictability and legal grounding. Atkins has also rejected the view that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities. He voiced support for tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as stocks and bonds while dropping several high-profile cases inherited from the Gensler era. The SEC’s new Crypto Task Force will host a public hearing on October 17 to explore financial privacy and surveillance technologies. Beyond crypto, the SEC is weighing broader reforms to corporate disclosure rules. On September 19, Atkins confirmed the agency is prioritizing a proposal to give companies flexibility to move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reporting, aligning with a push by President Donald Trump. Republicans currently hold a 3-1 advantage at the agency, boosting the proposal’s chances. SEC Chairman @secpaulsatkins says the agency is preparing reforms for corporate disclosure rules, which could end mandatory quarterly reporting #SEC #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/1AwEdIW1bj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 19, 2025 The shift coincides with Trump’s August executive order opening the $12.5 trillion 401(k) market to alternative assets , including crypto. Lawmakers are urging the SEC to revise its accredited investor rules to expand access. Atkins has further signaled an “innovation exemption” for digital asset firms , expected by year-end, that would let new products launch without immediate regulatory burdens. Together, the changes mark the SEC’s most significant pivot toward crypto since its inception.

Instead of fading into routine end-of-month trading, XRP ended September 2025 with a close that has set a new record in its history, sparking discussions across the crypto community about what comes next for the digital asset. Xoom, a respected commentator on X, drew attention to the event, emphasizing its importance. Verified market data supports the claim: XRP closed Q3 2025 at approximately $2.84, the highest quarterly close the asset has ever recorded. This figure surpasses notable past benchmarks, including the December 2017 quarter-end level of around $2.30, when XRP was riding the momentum of the last major bull cycle. XRP just had its highest quarterly close EVER. pic.twitter.com/c8udX6tsOx — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 1, 2025 The Significance of a Quarterly Close Quarterly closes are not just calendar markers. These levels hold significant technical importance, reflecting where the market has stabilized after prolonged trading pressure. Unlike daily or weekly closes, quarterly finishes reflect sustained conviction from both buyers and sellers, offering a more reliable signal of long-term strength. By closing above previous highs, XRP has effectively reset its technical foundation. Traders now see $2.84 as a key reference point — a price level that could act as strong support in future retracements or as the springboard for the next major breakout. Such levels are closely monitored by institutional players and retail investors alike, making this close particularly influential for upcoming market behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context Within the Crypto Market This milestone arrives at a time of renewed optimism across the digital asset sector. Institutional adoption continues to expand, supported by developments such as ETFs and the growing integration of blockchain into payment systems and financial services. XRP, long positioned as a solution for fast and efficient cross-border value transfer, appears well-placed to benefit from this momentum. Yet, the achievement should be viewed with a balanced perspective. A record quarterly close does not guarantee uninterrupted growth. Historically, markets often experience increased volatility following such milestones, as profit-taking and speculative positioning create short-term fluctuations. For XRP, traders will be watching closely to see if volume and liquidity can sustain momentum above this new level. Looking Ahead The highest quarterly close ever recorded for XRP is more than a number on a chart — it represents renewed strength, broader acceptance, and a shift in how the asset is perceived within the market. Investors now have a fresh benchmark to measure future moves, and analysts will be scrutinizing Q4 performance to see whether XRP can maintain and build upon this foundation. As Xoom highlighted, the close of September 2025 will be remembered as a turning point in XRP’s journey. With Q4 underway, the key question is no longer whether XRP can set records, but how high it can climb from here.

A major catalyst for the rally came from decentralized exchange ( DEX ) THORSwap, which announced full support for Zcash swaps, allowing users to trade the asset against top performers like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ). Meanwhile, network activity also picked up, as Zcash Community Grants recently launched a Rust repo for Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function (MFKDF), giving developers new tools to experiment with. At the time of writing, ZEC is trading at $92.62, up 42.18% on the 24-hour chart and posting the best daily performance in percentage terms among all crypotcurrencies in the top 100 by market cap, as per CoinMarketCap data retrieved by Finbold. With a market cap of over $1.5 billion, it is currently the 65th largest crypto. Top-performing cryptocurrencies. Source: CoinMarketCap Will Zcash hit $100? It is possible the sudden surge in ZEC activity isn’t mere short-term speculation, as the timing coincides with the ongoing debates around financial and digital ID surveillance. This is evident from the impact of the Zashi cross-chain swap update on September 16, which led to shielded transactions surging to 3.06 million ZEC and Google searches for “privacy coins” hitting record highs . However, the asset is not propped by mere panic alone, as technical indicators likewise suggest strong upward momentum. Namely, ZEC has skyrocketed way past the $56 resistance level dating back to June 2022. At the same time, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 83.69 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level of 7.95 reinforce the bullish picture. Crypto analyst and commentator Vini Barbosa discussed the climb in market cap, noting that ZEC had climbed past the likes of TRUMP ( TRUMP ) and Immutable ( IMX ), going from the 92nd to the 65th largest crypto in only nine days.

ChatGPT predicted that the most optimistic outcome for PI is to rise in the $0.35-$0.45 range, potentially driven by positive news and a broad crypto rally. The asset currently trades at around $0.27 (according to CoinGecko’s data), with the chatbot indicating that the resurgence will heavily depend on a breakout above the psychological resistance level of $0.30. Moreover, it argued that if the “Uptober” enthusiasm accelerates and liquidity flows into speculative assets, PI could even aim toward the $0.50 region: “PI could break through key resistances and surprise investors with a rally into the $0.40–$0.50 range, establishing itself as one of the standout performers of the month.” Last but not least, ChatGPT touched upon Pi Network’s devoted community, which consists of millions of users. According to the chatbot, the vast base of Pioneers could be reenergized if the price starts climbing, and that in turn might lead to a further ascent. The Bearish Outlook At the same time, ChatGPT noted that the upcoming token unlocks, weak sentiment, and other bearish factors may prevent such a bull run for PI. “Realistically, a rally into the $0.30–$0.35 band might be possible in a strong scenario. But given the looming token unlocks, weak sentiment, and technical resistance, expecting a massive leap beyond ~$0.40 would be risky.” It is important to mention that almost 13 million tokens will be unlocked today (October 1): the record for the following 30 days. A total of 136.3 million PI will be released within that period, providing investors with the opportunity to offload assets they have been waiting to sell for some time.

However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213. The price fell to an intraday low of $204 on Wednesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $211, ultimately falling 0.77%.

Price action was mixed over the weekend, with SOL falling 0.83% on Saturday to $203. However, it was back in positive territory on Sunday, rising nearly 4% and settling at $210. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 1% to $212. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to $208. The price has increased by almost 4% during the current session, trading around $216. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping over 2% to $1.683. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell almost 11% to a low of $1.413 before settling at $1.499. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2% to $1.468. TIA fell 1.20% on Wednesday and over 6% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, the price fell to a low of $1.337 before settling at $1.362.

Here Are the Details…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/white-house-withdraws-cryptocurrency-friendly-names-cftc-chair-candidacy-here-are-the-details/,"Following the US budget crisis, which has been talked about for days as the 2025 fiscal year draws to a close, an agreement on a budget to fund the federal government has been reached. As a result, the US federal government has officially shut down. While the shutdown continues to be discussed on the US agenda, a new announcement came from the White House. The White House withdrew Brian Quintenz's nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Tuesday evening, Politico reported. “It was the honor of my life to be nominated to chair the CFTC and go through the confirmation process,” Quintenz said, confirming a report published in Politico on Tuesday. “I am grateful to the Chairman for this opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for considering it. I look forward to returning to my private sector work during this exciting time of innovation in our country.” Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC member and head of cryptocurrency policy at a16z, was widely supported by the crypto industry, but his nomination faced delays in Congress. Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss also opposed Quintenz's candidacy, arguing that past decisions involving Quintenz could create a conflict of interest. While the delays raise questions about Quintenz's nomination, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett recently reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the White House is considering nominating former CFTC chair Jill Sommers and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) President Kyle Hauptman for CFTC chair. Terrett noted that both support cryptocurrencies. Related News: Fox Business Reporter Reveals! White House Considers Two New CFTC Chairs Critical to Bitcoin and Altcoins!

52517894,594836,1759321350,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,La ripresa di Ethereum accelera grazie agli afflussi record negli ETF spot statunitensi,https://bitcoinist.com/la-ripresa-di-ethereum-accelera-grazie-agli-afflussi-record-negli-etf-spot-statunitensi/,"La ripresa di Ethereum si è rafforzata dopo che gli ETF spot su ETH negli Stati Uniti hanno registrato 547 milioni di dollari di afflussi netti in un solo giorno , ponendo fine a una serie negativa di cinque giorni consecutivi di deflussi. A guidare la giornata è stato il Fidelity FETH con 202 milioni di dollari, seguito dal BlackRock ETHA con 154 milioni di dollari. Attualmente, gli ETF su ETH gestiscono circa 27,5 miliardi di dollari, pari a circa il 5,4% della capitalizzazione di mercato circolante, un dato che segnala un rinnovato interesse istituzionale mentre il prezzo ha riconquistato il livello psicologico dei 4.000 dollari. Smart Money accumula Ethereum (ETH) mentre le riserve calano Dal punto di vista dei bilanci societari, le istituzioni continuano ad aumentare la loro esposizione. BitMine Immersion Technologies ha rivelato di detenere un tesoro aziendale di 2,65 milioni di ETH, il più grande tracciato tra i suoi pari, mentre Bit Digital prevede di raccogliere 100 milioni di dollari tramite una nota convertibile per acquisire ulteriore ETH, con la possibilità di scalare la classifica delle tesorerie più ricche. Sul fronte on-chain, i dati di CryptoQuant mostrano un calo delle riserve sugli exchange, segnale coerente con il trasferimento delle monete verso la custodia e lo staking: condizioni che storicamente riducono l’offerta circolante quando la domanda cresce. Previsioni Prezzo Ethereum: obiettivi a 4.500–5.000 $ Dal punto di vista tecnico, ETH ha registrato un rialzo di circa +250% dai minimi di ciclo. Alcuni analisti, come Ted Pillows, ritengono che una breve correzione potrebbe preparare il terreno per un movimento verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari, con la possibilità di raggiungere anche i 10.000 dollari in caso di condizioni macro e di liquidità favorevoli. Nel breve termine, mantenere chiusure sopra i 4.200–4.250 dollari manterrebbe i rialzisti in controllo; in caso contrario, il rischio è di una discesa verso l’area di supporto tra 3.800–3.600 dollari. Le integrazioni con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano Ethereum Oltre agli afflussi e alle tesorerie, progrediscono anche le integrazioni nel mondo TradFi. SWIFT ha testato la Layer-2 Linea di Ethereum insieme a BNP Paribas e BNY Mellon per la messaggistica di regolamento on-chain, mentre un progetto più ampio tra SWIFT e Consensys sta esplorando un registro blockchain per i pagamenti transfrontalieri 24/7. Se anche solo una piccola parte del volume di SWIFT si spostasse on-chain, potrebbe diventare un motore costante di domanda per lo spazio dei blocchi e per lo staking di ETH. Conclusione Afflussi record negli ETF, riduzione delle riserve sugli exchange e nuovi progetti con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano lo scenario rialzista di Ethereum sopra i 4.000 dollari. Sopra i 4.200 dollari, il percorso si apre verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari. Sotto tale livello, è probabile un sano retest nella fascia alta dei 3.000 dollari prima della prossima gamba rialzista.

Based on reports, the rebound followed a series of events that together eased selling pressure and drew fresh money into the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data The move touched off debate among traders about whether this is a short-term bounce or the start of a stronger leg up into Q4 2025. Bitcoin’s strong rebound in late September 2025 was no accident, according to a recent analysis by XWIN Research Japan. It came from overlapping forces — a weaker dollar, record-breaking gold, steady inflows into large funds, and signs of renewed accumulation — that gave the rally a strong foundation. Macro Shifts Fueled The Move According to central bank announcements, the Federal Reserve’s September 17 rate cut weakened the dollar. Gold hit record highs as cash moved toward hard assets. XWIN Research said investors often park cash in gold first, then shift some of that capital into Bitcoin when they feel risk appetite returning. Add concerns about the growing US fiscal deficit. That pushed some investors toward assets seen as inflation-resistant, and Bitcoin was one of the beneficiaries. Institutional Appetite Added Momentum Reports have disclosed that the SEC eased ETF listing rules, clearing the way for new XRP and DOGE products. That change gave large funds more confidence to allocate to crypto. Major funds such as BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC continued to attract notable inflows. Money from big players matters. It signals that the move was not driven only by retail traders. Technical Signals And Market Mechanics Traders focused on a critical price barrier between $108,000 and $110,000, where it provided extreme support during the reversal. Simultaneously, momentum indicators led the oversight committee to see oversold conditions, leading to some short covering. Long-term holders had previously taken profits while short-term sellers largely capitulated which made it less likely for more individuals to add immediate selling pressure to the market and ultimately began to stabilize prices in the market. This combination of technical relief was compounded by changing trader behavior, and propelled the sentiment from fear towards cautious optimism.

In a market where hype often reigns supreme, this disciplined approach is capturing attention. Market Rebound Adds Fuel to Presale Sentiment This week witnessed a striking rebound across major cryptos. Bitcoin clawed back into the $116K range after earlier sliding near $109K. Ethereum followed suit, climbing above $4.3K after trading below $3.9K. A weakening US dollar and renewed ETF optimism could be key drivers behind the rally; the USD index is down roughly 6% since the beginning of the year. The market’s broader resurgence is strengthening risk appetite across altcoins and presales; the Altcoin Season Index remains firmly in Altcoin Season territory at 58/100. Against that backdrop, Tapzi’s structured trajectory is turning heads, with nearly 42% of the $TAPZI token presale already sold. Tapzi’s Presale Architecture: Scarcity Meets Discipline Tapzi capped its total token supply at 5B. Of that, only 20% is earmarked for the presale – offering a limited entry point for early participants. But the real strength lies in how $TAPZI is priced, and how those tokens unlock: Stage 1 price: $0.0035 Stage 2 price: $0.0045 Launch listing price: $0.01 That means, for early buyers, the presale structure delivers potential 3x gains before the token even lists. At launch, only 25% of presale tokens vest immediately. The rest unlock gradually over the ensuing three months. Team and development allocations are locked for six months and then distributed over 18 months. The staggered vesting aims to tame token inflation and avoid sudden sell pressure. In contrast to many speculative token launches, Tapzi chooses predictability over volatility, appealing to more sophisticated backers. It’s also a subtle way to indicate just what Tapzi prioritizes – skill, not luck; investment, not speculation. Skill-Based Gaming for the Web3 Era Tapzi’s core offering is a Web3 gaming hub built on the Binance Smart Chain, where players stake $TAPZI tokens to compete in games such as chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe, and rock-paper-scissors. $TAPZI also serves as the prize for those games. To strengthen retention and lower barriers to entry, Tapzi introduces: Gasless gameplay so casual users aren’t deterred by transaction costs Developer SDKs & staking modules enabling new game launches Prize-pool mechanics that grow with user engagement With forecasts projecting Web3 gaming to climb from $25B today to $300B by 2030 , Tapzi is positioning itself to bridge the gap between mainstream gamers and blockchain-native reward economies. Why Tapzi Could Be Among 2025’s Top Presales Every presale claims huge potential, but Tapzi backs its narrative with structure: Presale upside: Investors can lock in potential 185% returns before listing Scarcity and discipline: Fixed supply and vesting reduce inflation risk Utility-driven demand: Gameplay isn’t just a gimmick, but the engine of token demand As the major market rebound restores confidence, Tapzi’s presale trajectory becomes increasingly appealing to investors tired of blind hype. $TAPZI’s planned listing on PancakeSwap could unlock access to the broader market and spark further momentum. In 2025, the best crypto presales are among the hottest plays, but few combine fiscal discipline, real-world utility, and clear tokenomics. Tapzi is an exception, with the necessary scarcity, utility, and structure to make it not just one of the best presales of 2025, but a leading candidate for sustained growth beyond. You can learn more about Tapzi in the project whitepaper , or follow the project on X . Lock in 185% gains if you buy today. As always, do your own research. This isn’t financial advice.

As traders look for the next big opportunity, attention has shifted toward new tokens launching on base chain. The new base meme coins list highlights projects competing for visibility and adoption, while early presales continue to capture strong interest. With the right mix of community, innovation, and accessibility, certain tokens are shaping the conversation for 2025. Among them, Based Eggman is drawing interest with its presale momentum, while Brettcoin and Toshi remain notable names in the wider base meme ecosystem. Based Eggman Presale Leads the New Base Meme Coins List in 2025 Based Eggman has emerged as a standout among base meme coins with an active presale already surpassing $200,000. Positioned at the intersection of defi, gaming, and streaming, the project is building utility beyond typical meme token appeal. Its design places it in conversations around best web3 crypto projects, while traders searching for the best cheap cryptocurrency to invest in are increasingly looking at its entry price point. The presale is now in stage 2, offering a 30% bonus for early participants through the code GGS-30. By combining culture, entertainment, and blockchain applications, Based Eggman seeks to carve its own path within the new base chain meme coins environment. Its versatility makes it part of discussions about how to find crypto coins before they explode, as more investors track its progress through cryptocurrency events calendars. Key benefits of Based Eggman include: Active $200K+ presale progress, showing strong early traction Built with DeFi and streaming integrations in mind Gamified features attracting a broader crypto audience Early-stage pricing compared to established meme tokens Exclusive presale bonus for GGS-30 participants This combination of momentum, affordability, and multi-sector reach is helping Based Eggman shine over other Base Meme projects. Brettcoin Faces Challenges Among Established Base Chain Meme Coins Brettcoin ($BRETT) has gained attention as part of the growing base meme ecosystem, yet it illustrates the risks of relying on older meme tokens. Its live price currently trades near $0.0409 with a circulating supply of almost 9.91 billion tokens. While its earlier peak around $0.45 positioned it as a strong contender, sustaining that level has proven difficult. For those evaluating alt coins to buy in 2025, Brett represents both opportunity and caution. Some traders still believe in its revival, but the broader sentiment places it in the shadow of newer projects featured on the new base meme coins list. As more innovative meme tokens launch, Brett’s value proposition feels limited compared to ico cryptocurrency presales that deliver additional utility. This places Brett in a challenging position, as investors increasingly focus on the next base memecoins to list on Coinbase. Toshi Token Shows Momentum on the Base Meme Market Unlike Brett, Toshi ($TOSHI) is currently posting stronger performance within the base meme space. Over the past week, the token has recorded a 20.8% gain, reaching $0.00075. This level now acts as a support zone, indicating potential resilience in its price movement. The technical picture shows the 50-day EMA sitting below the candlesticks, pointing to active bullish momentum. If Toshi holds its support, analysts expect it could rebound toward $0.00086 and possibly test $0.00098. Such moves demonstrate that Toshi still has room to play a role among the best cheap cryptocurrency to invest in within the base chain ecosystem. While Toshi is not part of the ico cryptocurrency market, its ability to generate short-term returns has kept it in focus for traders watching the cryptocurrency events calendar. It highlights how established tokens can still attract attention even as new presales continue to rise. Conclusion: Choosing Between Base Meme Coins in 2025 The Base meme category is evolving fast, with projects like Based Eggman , Brett, and Toshi each highlighting different aspects of the market. Based Eggman’s presale status places it within discussions about the best web3 crypto projects, while Brett and Toshi reflect the current state of base chain meme coins already trading live. For traders comparing the new base meme coins list, the decision comes down to balancing early access opportunities with existing market performers. As the next base memecoins to list on Coinbase emerge, investors will need to track presales and live tokens carefully. If you want to explore new opportunities within Base meme categoy, now is the time to review ongoing presales like Based Eggman and evaluate where these projects fit in your strategy.

As we move toward 2025, certain tokens on base chains are garnering significant attention due to their unique value propositions and vibrant communities. Among these, Based Eggman emerges as a frontrunner, capturing the interest of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Meanwhile, Brettcoin and Toshi are also key players, each with distinct characteristics and market positions. The Rise of Based Eggman As a new contender, Based Eggman has quickly distinguished itself with a successful presale, crossing the $200,000 mark. This coin's integration into DeFi, gaming, and streaming sectors enhance its appeal, positioning it as a potentially transformative force within the meme coin domain. Investors are drawn to its multifaceted utility, cultural relevance, and the gamification of its features, which broaden its appeal beyond traditional cryptocurrency audiences. Aiding its ascent, the presale of Based Eggman offers a 30% bonus for early investors using the promo code GGS-30, highlighting its strategy to build early momentum and secure a robust initial user base. Brettcoin's Market Struggles Conversely, Brettcoin represents the volatility and challenges faced by older meme coins. Despite its peak trading price of around $0.45, the coin struggles to maintain its relevance as emerging tokens outpace it both technologically and culturally. This scenario underlines the importance of continuous innovation and community engagement in the meme coin sector. Toshi's Steady Performance Unlike Brettcoin, Toshi has demonstrated resilience and an upward trajectory in the meme coin market. With recent gains of over 20%, it shows potential as a stalwart investment among newer base chain meme coins. Such performance is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and for Toshi's sustainability in a highly competitive market. Investment Considerations for Base Chain Meme Coins For potential investors, the choice between these coins should be informed by their market performance, technological innovation, and community strength. Each coin has its trajectory and potential, with Based Eggman leading in innovation, Toshi in stability, and Brettcoin needing strategic pivots to reclaim its market position.

The digital asset, which has long been at the center of both market speculation and institutional interest, is once again in the spotlight following a bold projection from one of the industry’s most followed traders. The statement has sparked debates across trading circles, leaving many to weigh the feasibility of such a price target against the realities of today’s market structure. Cobb’s Q4 XRP Price Call Renowned trader Alex Cobb recently shared his forecast for XRP on the social media platform X, predicting it will reach $6.32 by the end of 2025’s fourth quarter. This figure represents more than a doubling from XRP’s current range, with live data showing the asset trading around the $2.80–$2.90 mark and maintaining a market capitalization in the low hundreds of billions. Translating Cobb’s call into performance terms implies a surge of over 120% within the coming months — a level of growth that, while ambitious, is not unheard of in crypto cycles. Q4 XRP $6.32 — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 1, 2025 Why $6.32 Could Be Within Reach The bullish projection is not entirely detached from market realities. Two significant developments continue to shape optimism around XRP. First, Ripple’s launch of RLUSD , its enterprise-focused USD stablecoin introduced in December 2024, has strengthened the ecosystem. RLUSD’s deployment across exchanges and payment corridors ties Ripple more firmly into institutional finance, with XRP serving as a bridge asset in many use cases. Second, the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle has lifted a cloud that weighed heavily on the token for years. The resolution removed regulatory uncertainty and gave financial institutions greater confidence in engaging with XRP-linked products. With a functional stablecoin and clearer regulations, Cobb’s target appears more grounded in reality than mere speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Challenges Ahead Yet, for XRP to double in value within Q4 2025, several headwinds must be overcome. Liquidity at higher price levels remains a concern, as does competition from other leading blockchains vying for capital inflows. The overall sentiment in the crypto market, influenced by Bitcoin’s price movements and macroeconomic factors, will also be a key determinant. Independent analysts caution that XRP must first consolidate above key support zones before any sustained rally toward new highs can materialize. The Bigger Picture Cobb’s prediction underscores a broader narrative that XRP’s best days may still be ahead. With institutional-grade infrastructure now in place and regulatory clarity achieved, the groundwork for growth is solid. However, like all high-conviction forecasts in the crypto market, the $6.32 target should be viewed as an informed opinion rather than an inevitable outcome. For traders and investors, Cobb’s projection serves as both a motivator and a reminder: opportunities abound, but so do risks. Sound strategy and prudent risk management remain as vital as ever.

We also explain how to compare low cap altcoin gems with 1000X Potential with steadier assets, using simple checks for liquidity, supply, and real utility.

Final Words Volatility rewards discipline more than dreams. Start with a plan, not a hope. Map entries, invalidation, and targets before money moves. If you chase the best crypto to buy now, test ease of use, verify token supply, and read the contract. Simple steps lower mistakes. Real usage reduces noise. Compare activity across chains and note where value actually circulates. For meme coin project setups, track distribution, treasury wallets, and unlock calendars. Keep positions small until data confirms strength. Review results weekly and write down lessons to avoid repeat errors. When you hunt low cap altcoin gems with 1000X Potential inside the most volatile cryptos, your edge is patience plus exits. Treat every ICO Cryptocurrency as a live experiment with records. The Next Altcoin to Explode will stand out through numbers, not hype. Act today with care. Visit the official channels, read updates, and decide with intention.

Among these, meme coins like Based Eggman's $GGs stand out for their extreme price fluctuations and potential upside. The Intricacies of Based Eggman and $GGs $GGs, the native token of the Based Eggman ecosystem, plays a multifaceted role in gaming, tipping, and payment processes. This meme coin exemplifies how digital currencies can extend beyond simple financial tools to become integral parts of online communities and entertainment. In the gaming world, $GGs are not only a medium of exchange but also a badge of honor, often used to commend good gameplay or sportsmanship with the term ""GGs"" standing for ""Good Games."" Driven by a community-focused approach, Based Eggman aims to revolutionize crypto gaming by enhancing user engagement through interactive play, watch, and share experiences. Why Meme Coins are Market Movers Meme coins often experience rapid price changes, which can be attributed to their high speculative nature and the behaviors of their tight-knit communities. These assets are highly influenced by social media, trends, and influencer endorsements, leading to swift and significant market movements. Understanding the liquidity, supply dynamics, and utility of such tokens is crucial for investors looking to engage with these high-risk, high-reward assets. Strategic Investment in Volatile Cryptos Investing in volatile cryptocurrencies like $GGs requires a disciplined approach. Prospective buyers should focus on solid fundamentals like token utility, project roadmap, and community strength rather than just speculative potential. It’s also essential to maintain a diversified portfolio and implement risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders and taking profits at predetermined levels.

The Problem: Bitcoin’s Scalability Gap Bitcoin has always been a store of value first, a payment network second. That worked when the main use case was simply ‘buy and hold.’ But as crypto culture exploded, Bitcoin’s limitations became obvious. While Ethereum and Solana were running meme coins, NFTs, and DeFi apps at full throttle, Bitcoin was left sitting on the sidelines. Fees spiked during bull runs, transactions slowed to a crawl, and forget about trying to run complex apps directly on the chain. Bitcoin might be the biggest crypto by market cap, but it couldn’t keep up with the modern demands of builders, traders, and degens. This lack of scalability is the exact gap Bitcoin Hyper is designed to fill. The Solution: Bitcoin Hyper Brings Speed and Power Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a real Bitcoin Layer 2 built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). That’s important, because it brings Solana’s lightning speed and cheap fees straight into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Here’s how it works: you bridge $BTC into the network, it gets verified and minted on the Layer 2, and then you can trade, stake, or run dApps instantly. Transactions are bundled with zero-knowledge proofs and regularly synced back to Bitcoin’s Layer 1 for security. What does this mean in plain English? You can move Bitcoin around in sub-seconds with near-zero gas fees, all while staying connected to Bitcoin’s base chain. Payments, DeFi, meme coins, even NFTs – it’s all on the table now for Bitcoin users. Finally, Bitcoin can do it all. Why $HYPER Is the Token to Watch Every transaction in this ecosystem runs on $HYPER. It’s the fuel for staking, governance, and app launches. That means the more people use Bitcoin Hyper, the more demand there is for the token. The presale numbers already tell the story: $19.5M raised so far, and you can buy $HYPER for $0.013015. At the same time, whale activity around Bitcoin has been heating up, with fresh buys of $12.3K and $10.9K recorded just last night – another sign that confidence in Bitcoin’s growth cycle is back on. Early buyers also get priority access to staking rewards, token launches, and governance. Think of it like a VIP ticket to Bitcoin’s new playground. And in Uptober, when the market heats up and everyone’s chasing the next big thing, $HYPER looks positioned to take off. If you’ve been looking for the best presale of the season, this project checks all the boxes. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin’s Second Act The wild part is what this means for Bitcoin itself. For years, Bitcoin has been called ‘digital gold.’ Great as a store of value, but boring compared to the best altcoins running the show in DeFi and memes. Bitcoin Hyper flips that script. It gives Bitcoin an execution layer where builders can launch dApps, DAOs, and meme coins directly tied to the world’s largest crypto. That could unlock new demand and push Bitcoin even further up the ranks. If Bitcoin is already the number one asset in crypto, imagine what happens when it becomes the most usable one too. It’s like giving a vintage sports car a brand-new turbo engine – the same classic design, but now it roars on the track. Bitcoin’s Next Big Chapter Starts Here Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is more than just a new crypto project. It’s a serious attempt to make Bitcoin relevant for the fast, experimental world of DeFi and meme culture. With a working solution, a huge presale, and Uptober momentum, $HYPER might just be the ticket to Bitcoin’s next big chapter. This article is for informational purposes only.

TRON currently hosts around $80 billion in USDT, providing SunPerp with a strong liquidity foundation. SunPerp supports BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, and BNB perpetual contracts settled in USDT. Early Momentum and User Activity Since launch, SunPerp has seen strong activity, particularly in deposit flows. On September 20, deposits peaked at 264 transactions, making up 74% of total flows that day and reaching $10.3 million in USDT, CryptoQuant reports. Deposits dominate on SunPerp. On Sept 20, they made up 74% of all flows, totaling $10.3M USDT. TVL has already climbed to nearly $30M, showing strong early demand for TRON’s perp trading. pic.twitter.com/OtKsev9jpu — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 30, 2025 The platform’s total value locked (TVL) has now climbed close to $30 million. TVL represents the net deposits that remain after withdrawals, and a growing TVL is often associated with increased trading volumes. For traders, higher TVL shows deeper liquidity and stronger collateral availability for leveraged positions. Competitive Edge: Technology and Cost Efficiency According to CryptoQuant, SunPerp is designed with several features that differentiate it from other decentralized perpetual platforms. One of its key advantages is deep aggregated liquidity, achieved by integrating with leading multi-chain liquidity providers. In terms of performance, the platform offers millisecond-level order matching and high-performance APIs, enabling both retail and institutional users to trade at scale. Intelligent on-chain routing technology further optimizes execution, improving reliability during fast-moving markets. Another standout feature is its zero-gas trading fee structure. By eliminating transaction costs, SunPerp significantly lowers the barrier for frequent trading and high-volume strategies, a critical factor for professional traders who rely on tight margins. Risk Management and Security CryptoQuant reports that security and risk mitigation are central to SunPerp’s architecture. The platform uses multi-source oracle real-time pricing and innovative anti-snipe mechanisms to minimize exposure to abnormal price fluctuations and front-running risks. These measures aim to protect traders during sudden market swings, a key concern for perpetual futures users. SunPerp stresses asset security by ensuring that user deposits remain fully transparent and traceable on-chain. With institutional-grade safeguards, the DEX is targeting both retail traders and professional participants who require higher levels of trust and efficiency in derivatives trading. Outlook for TRON’s DeFi Ecosystem SunPerp’s emergence signals an important step in the growth of TRON’s DeFi sector. With nearly $30 million in TVL and growing participation, the platform is positioned to attract more traders seeking high-speed, low-cost perpetual futures trading. If adoption continues to accelerate, SunPerp could become a cornerstone for derivatives within the TRON ecosystem, reinforcing the network’s derivatives infrastructure.

The initiative, led by VisionSys subsidiary Medintel Technology, is to begin with a plan to acquire and stake $500 million in SOL within the next six months, the company said in a press release . The firm teamed up with Marinade, one of the largest staking operators on Solana with a $2.2 billion total value locked on the protocol, to manage and generate yield on holdings. VisionSys AI's stock was down 20% premarket following the news, but has been a hot name this year, rising more than 300% since coming available for trade in April.

SOL was among the top performers in a rallying crypto market on Wednesday, ahead 6% to $219. The company is the latest addition to a roster of public firms pivoting to holding crypto directly on their balance sheets, seeking to mirror early adopters like Micheal Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), which has become the largest corporate owner of bitcoin (BTC).

Past Resistance Vanguard has resisted crypto for years, citing volatility and poor fit with long-term portfolios. It previously blocked access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, framing them as speculative and unsuitable for its investors. Reports suggest the firm would not create its own products but could open trading for third-party ETFs, though no timeline has been confirmed.

Timing matters more than ever in this market, and presales have become the launchpads for investors chasing 100x narratives. But here’s the catch: not every presale turns into a rocket. The real winners are the ones that combine meme culture with mechanics that can actually sustain growth. That’s why the hunt for the best crypto presales to buy now has intensified. Investors want more than hype; they want liquidity engines, built-in rewards, and systems that favor community over whales. When in doubt, zoom out: history shows the strongest presales are those that structure scarcity and reward conviction. Pepe and Notcoin are still commanding attention with their updates, but MoonBull is where the market’s spotlight is shining brightest. MoonBull’s Engine Makes It One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now MoonBull is more than just a meme; it’s a machine built to reinforce trust and fuel momentum. At the heart of this system is what could be called “The Bull’s Engine.” Every transaction strengthens the project, rather than draining it. A slice of each sale is allocated to the liquidity pool, maintaining deep and stable markets, while another portion is instantly redistributed to holders. Additionally, a cut is permanently marked, reducing supply and creating natural scarcity. It’s a closed loop that rewards the community, deepens liquidity, and sharpens token rarity over time, making MoonBull one of the best crypto presales to buy now for investors seeking sustainable growth Another standout feature is the referral system. Most referral setups are fluff, but MoonBull’s is structured to actually reward both sides. Anyone using a referral code gets a 15% bonus on their token purchase, while the referrer pockets 15% of that purchase instantly. To make things even more compelling, top referrers are ranked monthly and rewarded in USDC, with payouts as high as 10% for leaders. Backed by over 8 billion tokens reserved for this mechanic, the referral program scales with community growth, creating organic buzz without gimmicks. MoonBull Presale Numbers Show Why Early Entry Matters Stage 3 of the MoonBull presale is now live at $0.00004057, with over $180,000 raised and more than 600 holders onboard. The math is staggering: from Stage 3 to the confirmed listing price of $0.00616, the ROI potential clocks in at 15,000%. Early adopters have already secured 62.28% gains, and the next surge is projected at 27.40%. Momentum is not just hype, it’s written into the presale’s design, where every stage brings higher prices and tighter supply. Consider this scenario: a $1,000 allocation at today’s Stage 3 rate secures around 24.65 million MOBU tokens. By the time listing day arrives, that same bag could be worth roughly $151,900 in paper value. It’s the kind of asymmetric bet that excites presale hunters scanning for the best crypto presales to buy now. As one meme-style line goes: “This feels like buying Bitcoin when it still needed training wheels.” Pepe ($PEPE) Holds Meme Market Momentum Pepe Price Slips 0.97% in 24 Hours, dropping to $0.000009289. Despite this slight decline, Pepe still boasts a massive $3.81 billion market capitalization and maintains strong liquidity with $257.91 million in 24-hour trading volume. Ranked among the top meme coins under $1, Pepe’s scale and visibility make it one of the most heavily traded tokens in the market. The token’s real edge comes from its cultural dominance and global accessibility. Available on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, Pepe has secured broad exposure and trading depth that many meme projects never achieve. This ensures that even during dips, Pepe retains one of the healthiest liquidity profiles across meme assets. However, with competitors like MoonBull introducing features such as staking rewards, referral bonuses, and auto-liquidity, investor expectations are shifting. Pepe continues to dominate by sheer scale and recognition, but its long-term position may hinge on evolving beyond community-driven hype alone. Notcoin ($NOT) Faces Pressure But Holds Strong Notcoin Price Drops 4.47% as Trading Volume Dives, with the token sliding to $0.001513 in the past 24 hours. Ranked #275, Notcoin now holds a market cap of $150.52 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $154.99 million. Nearly the entire supply is already in circulation, with 99.43 billion NOT tokens out of a maximum supply of 102.45 billion released, giving it a more mature profile than many meme or social tokens that are still rolling out emissions. The sharper concern comes from its 24-hour trading volume, which plunged 94.89% to $27.55 million. This steep decline signals fading speculative activity, often a headwind for short-term price momentum. Still, with a volume-to-market-cap ratio of 18.32%, Notcoin remains actively traded relative to its overall size, which highlights underlying liquidity strength. For investors, Notcoin’s appeal comes from its accessibility and viral adoption. It rapidly rose into the mid-cap ranks, attracting casual traders worldwide. But sustaining that growth won’t be easy. As presale tokens like MoonBull roll out features such as auto-liquidity, staking, and referral rewards, Notcoin will need new catalysts to remain competitive in 2025. Conclusion Pepe remains a cultural force, and Notcoin continues to show mid-cap resilience, but MoonBull has stolen the spotlight. Its “engine” ensures every transaction feeds liquidity, rewards holders, and burns supply. Add to that a referral system that fuels organic expansion and presale numbers already pushing $180,000 raised with 15,000% ROI potential, and it’s clear why MoonBull presale tops lists of the best crypto presales to buy now. The presale is live, the numbers are climbing, and the design rewards early entry at every stage. Investors scanning for the top crypto to buy today don’t need to look far, MoonBull is charging full speed toward launch. Don’t get caught holding the bag after the run starts.

This comes as the UAE recently joined the CARF framework. In September 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Finance signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) and joined the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The UAE framework is scheduled to roll out in 2027, and then the UAE is expected to start sharing data with international tax authorities in 2028. CARF provides an international standard for the automatic exchange of crypto-asset-related information between tax authorities and is part of the global standards in the exchange of information for tax purposes. Close to 70 jurisdictions have committed to implementing CARF, with most preparing for their first information exchange in 2027 or 2028. According to SCA, the CARF regulatory initiative will effectively contribute to the development of clear and effective governance standards to enhance the UAE’s commitment to global standards. Feedback is required by November 8th, 2025. يسعد هيئة الأوراق المالية والسلع (SCA) أن تدعوكم للمشاركة في المشورة العامة التي أطلقتها وزارة المالية حول مقترح تطبيق إطار الإبلاغ عن الأصول المشفّرة (CARF) في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة. إن تعاونكم ودعمكم لهذه المبادرة التنظيمية سيسهم بشكل فعال في تطوير معايير حوكمة واضحة… pic.twitter.com/91EBjuXRIK — SCA UAE (@sca_uae) October 1, 2025 UAE forces exchanges to report crypto deals above $50K The SCA Consultation paper notes that CARF compels crypto intermediaries such as crypto exchange platforms and crypto custodians to report certain crypto payment transfers, such as disposals and acquisitions, especially those above $50,000. Under the OECD model, information on retail payment transactions reported under the CARF would be subject to de minimis thresholds, with values exceeding $50,000 requiring specific customer data. The customer in this instance is identified as a crypto-asset user, and their details are exchanged as well. As for transactions below $50,000, the customer is not reported, the transaction is treated as a transfer under the given rules, and only the recipient (e.g., the merchant) is reported as a crypto-asset user. UAE to address non-compliance with strong measures The SCA CARF consultation paper makes it clear that the UAE will take strong measures to address any instances of non-compliance by Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) and reportable users with penalties ranging from AED 20,000 ($5,000) to AED 250,000 ($68,000). The penalties would cover inaccurate or incorrect information in self-certification, up to failing to submit reports to the relevant regulatory authority, or violations of relevant provisions with the intent to circumvent the CRS regulations. In some instances, licenses might be suspended or withdrawn. Six Swiss Exchange , in March, published an article covering CARF, noting that one of the primary risks associated with it is the increased compliance burden on CASPs, as well as issues related to privacy infringements. Additionally, entities might seek jurisdictions with less stringent reporting requirements to avoid compliance, potentially undermining CARF’s effectiveness. This could have an effect on the UAE and its status as a crypto innovation hub .

Buyers repeatedly defended the $0.229–$0.230 floor while rejection volume capped upside at $0.234. A late-session push showed momentum building, but conviction remains tethered to whether DOGE can sustain closes beyond resistance. News Background DOGE advanced 1.6% between Sept. 30, 9:00 AM and Oct. 1, 8:00 AM, recovering from a $0.227 low to close at $0.234. Institutional desks dominated flows, defending the sub-$0.230 zone during Asian and European hours. Resistance materialized at $0.234, where volumes exceeded the 24-hour average of 248.7 million tokens. Analysts said the session reflected growing institutional presence in a market once defined by retail participation. Price Action Summary The token traded inside a compressed $0.007 range, reflecting 3% volatility. Afternoon turnover spiked above 400M tokens — nearly double average levels. In the final hour, DOGE rose from $0.233 to $0.234, with a 15.3M surge accompanying a breakout attempt at 7:32 AM. Technical Analysis Support has been validated at $0.229–$0.230, where multiple defenses held against sell pressure. Resistance hardened at $0.234, with rejection prints capping rallies. The tight corridor suggests controlled price discovery dominated by institutional desks, rather than retail-driven volatility. While the late breakout shows momentum, strength above $0.234 is required to confirm continuation toward $0.240. What Traders Are Watching? Whether DOGE can close decisively above $0.234 to flip resistance. If institutional inflows sustain volumes above daily averages. Broader CD20 index reaction to DOGE’s relative resilience.

The combined market cap of these mining stocks rose 43% month-on-month to $56 billion in September, the bank noted. The move was driven by a number of announcements, including Cipher Mining's (CIFR) HPC colocation deal with Fluidstack, and IREN's (IREN) expansion of its Cloud Services business, the report said. The BItcoin hashrate also rose. The monthly average network hashrate ""increased ~82 EH/s (+9%) m/m to an average of 1,031 EH/s in September,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. Mining profitability fell for the second month in a row as the hashrate exceeded 1000 EH/s. The bank's analysts estimated that miners ""earned an average of $49,700 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in September, down 10% from August."" Daily block reward gross profit also slumped 17% from the month prior. Bitfarms (BITF) outperformed the group with a 110% gain, while Cango (CANG) underperformed with an 11% decline. Twelve of the fourteen miners in the bank's coverage outerformed bitcoin in September, the report added.

In an interview for Lex Fridman’s podcast, the tech entrepreneur discussed a number of topics around him, including his troubles with governments, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy. Durov bought Bitcoin early and kept buying Pavel Durov admitted he has been a big believer in Bitcoin since almost the very beginning of the leading cryptocurrency. He got his first bitcoins in 2013, at that time’s peak of $700, when he “just threw a couple of millions there.” When the following year, Bitcoin fell to around $300, he “didn’t care too much” and wasn’t going to sell anyway: “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you, for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange.” The Russian-born businessman revealed his Bitcoin investment, and not his Telegram business, helped him fund his lifestyle. “Telegram is a money-losing operation for me personally. Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat,” he stated, adding: “And I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” Durov suggested reading the trends: “Governments keep printing money like no tomorrow,” he pointed out, noting that at the same time, Bitcoin has a predictable inflation which stops at a certain point. He was positive Bitcoin is here to stay, while it remains to be seen whether this will be the case with all the fiat currencies in existence today. Telegram would rather leave than share info Answering a question he has likely heard many times before, Pavel Durov insisted “Telegram has never shared a single private message with anyone, including governments and intelligence services.” Emphasizing that data within the messenger is encrypted, he stressed that the system’s design makes it impossible even for Telegram to share user correspondence with state actors. Durov rejected any notion this could happen in the future and declared that the company would rather leave a jurisdiction than do that. Describing privacy protection as fundamental, he criticized authorities working against it: “You don’t like privacy, and you think you should ban encryption in your country, like the EU is trying to do now for all its member states? Well, go ahead. We’ll quit this market.” Durov commented on his recent woes in France, where he was arrested in August 2024 and spent time confined in a small cell, amid accusations of complicity with crimes allegedly enabled by his messenger. He also recalled attempts by the French government to exploit the situation he was in. For example, during Romania’s presidential election last year, he was asked if he was ready to shut down Telegram channels supportive of the conservative candidate or opposing “pro-European” candidates. Last week, the 40-year-old Russian accused the French intelligence of also pressing him to censor Telegram channels ahead of the presidential vote in Moldova, Romania’s close neighbor, in exchange for favorable treatment in his ongoing legal case in France, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Durov’s decision to make Telegram different finally delivers Pavel Durov owns 100% of Telegram and has invested millions of dollars of his own money into the messaging app, which only became profitable in 2024. The platform does not permit advertisement based on users’ private data and doesn’t show ads in private chats and small groups, neither has an intrusive news feed. Durov commented: “We had to innovate a lot in order to reach a point where we are profitable, without having to resort to dubious business activities involving exploiting personal data of users.” In 2022, Telegram introduced a subscription model, for certain additional features, and it now has over 15 million paid subscribers, having made more than $500 million from premium subscriptions this year alone. The messenger enabled in-app payments and purchases for its growing ecosystem of mini app developers, charging a reasonable commission, and is experimenting with blockchain technologies. Durov highlighted the development of the TON (The Open Network) blockchain, which started as a Telegram project but was eventually launched by the open-source community, without its direct involvement. He also recently noted the significant growth in prices of NFT gifts on Telegram, making TON one of the largest blockchains in terms of daily volume of non-fungible tokens.

The asset has posted 3% gains over the past day and week. Several analysts are pointing to bullish chart setups that could open the way for higher levels if confirmed. Inverse Head and Shoulders Forms on 4-Hour Chart Trader Tardigrade posted a chart showing Bitcoin shaping an inverse head and shoulders pattern (iH&S). This pattern features three troughs, with the middle one lower than the others, and is often tracked as a bullish reversal structure. The neckline sits between $114,400 and $114,800, acting as resistance. Bitcoin is now testing that zone. A move above it with follow-through would complete the formation.

Key level to watch for a breakout pic.twitter.com/8EgvVQIzdp — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) October 1, 2025 Moreover, analyst Lennaert Snyder noted Bitcoin’s trading range within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. The narrowing range signals compression ahead of a decisive move. Yesterday’s close added momentum, raising the chance of a test at $115,700. Key resistance sits at $119,200. A breakout above this level could trigger a new all-time high. Snyder explained , “Above $119,200 = new ATH imo. Lose $108,900 and $105,000 is next.” A breakdown below those supports could point toward the $100,000 region. Source: Lennaert Snyder/X Ascending Channel Points to $124K and Beyond Jonathan Carter highlighted Bitcoin’s move within an ascending channel since May. BTC recently rebounded from channel support and climbed back above the 50-day moving average near $113,500, a level that had capped upside attempts. Resistance is at $117,000, and clearing it could pave the way for higher targets around $124,000 and $131,300. Carter wrote that the setup shows “strong buyer accumulation building,” adding weight to the bullish case. Liquidity Zones Define Short-Term Focus Daan Crypto Trades noted that a liquidity cluster has formed in the $118,000–$119,000 range, which also matches a past high-volume zone. A breakout above this level could help Bitcoin move out of its current consolidation phase. Support sits around $107,000–$108,000, which matched lows in August and September. $BTC The picture is clear from a liquidity perspective.

The capital infusion, structured as a loan, comes ahead of Thumzup’s pending acquisition of DogeHash and is designed to accelerate deployment of next-generation ASIC miners. According to the press release , with this funding, DogeHash plans to add over 500 new mining rigs, potentially increasing the total operational fleet to more than 4,000 by the end of 2025. This step signals Thumzup’s strategic commitment to scaling its presence in the Dogecoin ecosystem. Expanding Mining Capacity The fresh funding enables DogeHash to deploy cutting-edge mining hardware quickly, enhancing efficiency and production. The move also aligns with Thumzup’s broader vision of becoming a leading player in cryptocurrency mining. Beyond the immediate operational benefits, expanding mining capacity positions both companies to capitalize on potential Dogecoin market rallies. Robert Steele, Thumzup’s CEO, emphasized that this initiative reinforces their goal of building a premier Dogecoin mining operation. Parker Scott, CEO of DogeHash, noted that the early capital helps accelerate operations during a pivotal period. With more rigs online, the company can increase mining output and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving Dogecoin market. This expansion complements Thumzup’s other initiatives, including DOGE treasury purchases and the launch of its Crypto Advisory Board, creating a multi-faceted approach to digital asset growth. Market Conditions and Dogecoin’s Price Action Dogecoin has seen an increase in value alongside this development. The token is currently priced at $0.2427 , reflecting a 5.73% rise in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization now exceeds $36.6 billion, driven by a circulating supply of 150 billion coins. Market analysts are closely monitoring this movement, with short-term and long-term technical indicators pointing to possible breakouts.

Support lies at $0.226, while resistance is positioned at $0.238. Source: X Breakout above the resistance zone could propel the coin higher, while a failure may test $0.222 again. The compression pattern reflects falling volatility, which often precedes decisive price swings. Long-Term Outlook and $1 Speculation Another market analyst Maximalist, projects a much larger upside for Dogecoin . According to his analysis, the coin has already broken free from a multi-year descending trendline. Currently consolidating in the $0.23–$0.24 range, Dogecoin faces key resistance at $0.28 and $0.45.

Nasdaq-listed Tron Inc., a toy and souvenir manufacturer that has transitioned into a crypto treasury, has seen its shares collapse by 85% from a June 20 peak of $12.80, according to TradingView data. In September alone, the stock fell 55%, erasing much of the gains that followed its entry into the market. Strategy, the software company now known as the largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies, has also shed about 30% of its value over the last three months. The Ethereum treasury, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, is down 67% over the same period. DATs hype is fading fast, analysts warn According to some market analysts, the decline of these stocks is attributed to a familiar monthly cycle of hype, frenzy, and eventual cooling that new financial products experience during their initial launch. Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Research, said that the surge in valuations came from excitement rather than fundamentals. “It is common for hype and frenzy to take over when a new meta is introduced,” he said in a recent interview. “As cooler heads prevail, the asset tends to find a stable footing, leading to a decline in its valuation. This year it happened with Circle’s IPO, and it is happening with DATs.” Strategy’s Michael Saylor was the first to bring the idea to publicly listed institutions when he began converting the company’s corporate cash into Bitcoin in 2020. Saylor transformed the financial intelligence firm, then known as MicroStrategy, into a proxy for BTC exposure and inspired more businesses that had hoped to replicate its success. Some firms in 2025 executed reverse mergers to quickly list on exchanges, while others broadened exposure to other tokens, including Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Healthcare company KindlyMD raised $51.5 million through a private share sale and an additional $200 million via convertible notes to fund its bitcoin treasury launch. The company’s enterprise value-to-net asset value ratio dropped from 75 in May to just 0.7 over the past week, according to data from K33 Research. DAT stocks falling due to execution missteps and regulations Some industry watchers believe the treasury strategy has been poorly executed by most companies, who they reckon got into the business blindly. Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, asserted that many firms rushed to market without a fully sustainable business plan. “The recent drop in crypto treasury companies was a result of bad execution and rushing to the market without fully fleshing out their strategy,” Gregory said. Moreover, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have opened investigations into suspicious stock trades linked to more than 200 companies that announced crypto treasury strategies. Even stocks of firms tied to digital assets, such as Trump Media & Technology Group, which is majority-owned by President Donald Trump, shed 3.8% in September alone. Market saturation shadows US government pro-crypto fueled rally The surge in crypto prices earlier this year, combined with new US accounting rules and favorable regulatory signals from the Trump administration, pushed more companies to launch digital asset treasuries. “The majority of the market can’t hold bitcoin, but they can hold equities,” crypto investor and prominent businessman Kevin O’Leary explained. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows that more than 180 public companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets so far, holding a combined 4.7% of the total supply. Nearly half of them are considered imitators of Strategy, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research at Norway-based K33. “The performance of some of these stocks earlier this summer was just mind-blowing,” Lunde said. “It’s been just a very wild ride, and now the bitcoin treasury space is getting quite saturated.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This week crypto and Web3’s most influential figures gathered at the CV Summit in Zurich, Switzerland. At the summit, known as Switzerland’s most reputable fintech event, a variety of important topics were addressed, but perhaps none more critical than the “the Valley of Crypto” potentially “on the brink of losing its status as a global Web3 hub.” The stark warning comes from Ilya Volkov, CEO and co-founder of YouHodler, who also serves as a board member of Switzerland’s Crypto Valley Association. With Asia’s Token2049 in Singapore happening now and Dubai’s rapid rise, a global shift is taking shape. Will Switzerland continue to innovate and dominate, or will other regions take the reins as the new global crypto hub? Switzerland’s Crypto Valley: How It Became The Global Web3 Hub Switzerland’s Crypto Valley emerged in the mid-2010s as one of the world’s first purpose-built hubs for blockchain and digital asset innovation. Centered in Zug, it quickly earned the nickname “Crypto Valley” by combining Switzerland’s reputation for financial stability with its signature open regulatory attitude. From its inception in 2015 to 2021, regulators were heavily involved in shaping the ecosystem. As Dr. Mattia Rattaggi and Hans Kuhn reflected during the CV Summit panel, Switzerland struck a delicate balance in those formative years. Bold experimentation was encouraged while paying close attention to governance was paramount to avoid unacceptable risk. This combination of pragmatism and foresight gave Crypto Valley credibility at a time when most jurisdictions were still hesitant to engage with cryptocurrencies. Today, that credibility is reinforced by Switzerland’s dense network of industry associations. Jérôme Bailly of the Crypto Valley Association (CVA) and Adriano Bertini of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland (BAS) both underlined how the Valley thrives not just on companies, but on cooperation between associations. The benefits of belonging to the Valley extend well beyond branding. Companies gain access to a globally recognized ecosystem that signals credibility to investors, partners, and regulators. This fosters knowledge-sharing, talent recruitment, and capital flows that would be difficult to replicate elsewhere. For founders and innovators, being part of Crypto Valley meant instant legitimacy and a platform that connects them to the broader global conversation. Yet, while Zug and Switzerland pioneered this model, other regions are now racing to replicate and surpass it. Singapore and Hong Kong have positioned themselves as gateways to Asia’s massive digital economy, while Dubai and Abu Dhabi have leveraged capital inflows and regulatory agility to attract global talent. The very ecosystem that once made Switzerland unique has inspired challengers abroad—forcing Crypto Valley to ask whether it can still stay ahead in the race for global Web3 dominance. The Global Web3 Race: Competing Crypto Hubs Emerge From Washington to Zug, from Singapore to Dubai, global hubs are vying to set the rules, attract talent, and capture capital flows. Each region brings its own distinct strengths—and its own vulnerabilities. The question is no longer who is in the game, but who will lead it. United States: The Incumbent Power The United States remains the world’s financial heavyweight, backed by deep capital markets and the supremacy of its tech giants. Names like VISA, Mastercard, Google, Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenAI aptly illustrate the breadth of American influence across both finance and digital innovation. Yet, despite this strength, the US suffers from several challenges and hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty and the aggressive posture of agencies like the SEC have created an environment where innovation often feels under siege. High-profile lawsuits and uneven enforcement have left entrepreneurs questioning whether the US truly offers a safe home for Web3 projects. As Hans Kuhn noted during the CV Summit, the central question lingers: Is the highly welcome shift of US policy in crypto matters really long-term, or will this policy be rolled back by the next administration? European Union & Switzerland: At a Crossroads The situation across Europe is quite different than in the US. Switzerland, long celebrated for its financial strength and as an early pioneer in crypto regulation, now faces the risk of stagnation. Industry experts, including CVA Board Member Ilya Volkov, openly question whether the country has become “a victim of its own success.” Meanwhile, the European Union has moved forward with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. To some, MiCA represents a potential blueprint for regulatory clarity. To others, including Adriano Bertini and Mattia Rattaggi, it risks suffocating innovation before it scales. “ MiCA does not seem to have been drafted with consumer protection, and small businesses in mind, ” explained Adriano Bertini. “ It seems instead to dramatically raise entry barriers and costs for small ventures to the benefit of large incumbent financial institutions. Thus increasing centralisation and systemic risk in the European crypto market ,” he added. “ While I commend the attempt of the E.U. to create a workable framework for entities operating in crypto markets, the regulation lacks clarity and technical depth in critical aspects, with some key definitions being too broad (e.g. crypto custodian). The result is a regulation that penalises new ventures in Europe, and their abilities to thrive in an industry that is globally ever growing in size and scope. We look forward to European regulators engaging industry experts to improve the regulatory framework and build more sensible regulation more aligned with the needs of consumers and the market as a whole ,” Bertini concluded. “ When I read the first proposals back in 2020 it appeared to me that the nature and extent of the proposed requirements raised an issue of adequacy vis-à-vis the reality of an industry that was and still is to a larger extent constituted by projects and micro firms, and not by SMEs able to tackle the requirements. ” Mattia Rattaggi added. Asia: Momentum Continues to Build While the West wrestles with figuring out regulation, Asia is capitalizing on clarity and ambition. Singapore and Hong Kong have emerged as leading gateways into the region’s digital economy, while Thailand and Vietnam are quietly building grassroots adoption at scale. The ongoing Token2049 conference in Singapore underscores Asia’s momentum, rivaling the scale of leading Western events and attracting global investors, builders, and policymakers. As Jérôme Bailly observed, the region benefits from three critical advantages: government support, regulatory certainty, and a population primed for rapid digital adoption. Together, these factors make Asia one of the most formidable challengers to Switzerland’s early lead. MENA: The Dark Horse Challenger While Asia grabs headlines, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is rapidly positioning itself as a global contender. Cities like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, and Manama (Bahrain) are competing aggressively to attract fintech talent, capital, and infrastructure. Ilya Volkov highlighted the region’s “ huge and rapid growth ” as a sign that MENA should not be dismissed. With vast capital reserves and a strategic geographic position bridging East and West, the Gulf states are well placed to play a central role in the next phase of Web3 development. Addressing Switzerland’s Challenges Despite its role as a Web3 pioneer, Switzerland now finds itself at a critical crossroads. The anxiety within the industry was captured in the 12-point manifesto published in May by CVA, BAS, and SBF—a collective call for policymakers to restore the country’s balance between stability and innovation. The message was clear: Switzerland risks slipping from leadership if it overregulates while ignoring the broader need to foster sustained growth. As experts stated during the session: “ We drifted into micromanagement of small risks. We have to restore the balance—few strong rules for management of big risks, and freedom to innovate by taking on small ones, ”. This cautionary tale resonates with founders and investors who fear that excessive oversight will choke off necessary experimentation. Stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) represent another area of contention. As Hans Kuhn and Adriano Bertini noted, Switzerland faces a choice between maintaining its pragmatic, market-led model or aligning with more rigid global approaches. Too much divergence could isolate the country, but too much similarity could dilute its competitive edge. Here, associations like CVA, BAS, and SBF play a crucial role: setting principles and advocating for sensible regulation while ensuring the creative energy of the ecosystem is not stifled. Their ability to maintain this balance will determine whether Crypto Valley remains a beacon or becomes a relic. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Crypto Valley? What will Crypto Valley become over the next 15 years? Mattia Rattaggi suggested that the very term “Crypto Valley” might soon feel too narrow, as blockchain, Web3, and AI converge into a broader technology ecosystem. The Valley’s strength lies not in a single industry label, but in its ability to evolve alongside innovation. Hans Kuhn pointed to Switzerland’s banking sector as both an anchor and a test. Can it embrace digital assets as a complement to its legacy strengths, or will it remain a drag on innovation? Adriano Bertini and Jérôme Bailly emphasized that the future is not just blockchain, but the integration of Web3 with emerging technologies like AI coupled with improvements in cryptography research that provide privacy enhancing tools to the benefit of consumers. This unique convergence could provide Switzerland with a new edge. “ Switzerland’s strengths, stability and trust, built over centuries—are our edge,” Jerome Bailly stated. “Keep a few strong rules for the big risks and stop micromanaging the small ones. Say ‘yes’ to responsible innovation with clear rules, bank participation at scale, and the courage to ship, ” he added. Conclusion The Crypto Valley Summit left participants with a sobering question, posed by Ilya Volkov: Can Switzerland keep its Web3 crown? Asia and MENA’s rise deserves respect rather than rejection. Their rapid growth reflects ambition, clarity, talent and capital flows that cannot be ignored. “ But Switzerland has to understand its unique role—offering credibility, neutrality, and a legacy of financial trust ,” said Ilya Volkov. The global race for fintech dominance is no longer a debate—it is a reality. Switzerland must decide whether to lead, follow, or be left behind.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 13:57:34

In an announcement on X, the official Shiba Inu account welcomed Arlo to the ecosystem, adding that the two teams are “teaming up to enhance the security of Shibarium through artificial intelligence.” Shiba Inu Brings Solana Grant Winner To Shibarium Arlo framed the collaboration as a retail-safety initiative that will extend its live beta—currently available on Solana and Base—to Shibarium. “ARLO has teamed up with Shiba Inu to launch our AI intelligence engine on Shibarium to bring retail safety to Shibarium,” the project wrote, describing a system that can “analyze 100+ data points for any Shibarium token, including on-chain analysis, whale movements, token audits & safety, market trends, risk signals, & influencer activity.” The team also reiterated that “STAKE-TO-ACCESS [is] coming soon,” and clarified in a follow-up that Shibarium support is “not yet live” but “will be launching… soon,” while the tool remains in open beta on Solana and Base. Arlo’s positioning as a Solana Foundation grant recipient is independently corroborated by recent press materials and its website, which highlight the project as “backed by the Solana Foundation” and identify Arlo as an AI token-analysis tool that has received Foundation support. A September press release noted Arlo as “the only AI token analysis tool to receive a Solana Foundation grant,” and the company’s site presents the same backing alongside its Solana contract address. While neither party published technical documentation alongside the posts, the stated scope suggests Arlo intends to provide a machine-learning overlay for token due diligence on Shibarium—surfacing heuristics around liquidity quality, ownership distribution, trading anomalies, and cross-platform sentiment—areas where retail users frequently struggle to separate legitimate launches from high-risk deployments. In response to a community question about coverage, Arlo said its “AI system will work on all tokens on Shibarium… including BONE ,” the network’s gas token, indicating that the toolset is meant to be chain-wide rather than curated for a subset of assets. The move comes as the Shibarium team has faced renewed scrutiny over security and validator resilience following the network’s bridge exploit via a flash-loan-enabled attack to the tune of roughly $2.4 million–an incident that amplified community calls for more robust risk monitoring and faster incident response. For now, the partnership is framed as a phased rollout: open beta on Solana and Base is live, with Shibarium support “coming soon,” and access features tied to staking are on the roadmap. At press time, the Shiba Inu token traded at $0.00001188.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|SOL|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 14:00:19

Mainstream is on ETH’s bullishness, XRP grava inroads and the high-yield appeal of Fleet Mining . Ethereum (ETH) As a pillar of DeFi, ETH is projected to re-test the key technical support and make an attempt at $4,500 resistance. A breakout would clear the way for a fresh round of price discovery. ETH staking yields are strong, but pale in comparison to the parabolic returns of nascent ecosystems. Yet, ETH is still a bedrock cryptocurrency in the smart contract room. Ripple (XRP) With regulatory uncertainty resolved, the debut of an XRP spot ETF says it’s entering the world of traditional finance (TradFi). Despite positive news, price action remains conservative, currently consolidating. Now investors are weighing whether XRP requires regulation against the immediate revenue of high-interest staking.

The move comes as traders push back against selling pressure, with renewed optimism spreading across the market. For many, the rebound highlights Bitcoin’s resilience and its ability to bounce after testing key support levels. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Long: Bybit Traders Push BTC Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Above 24 Yet, not everyone feels convinced. Several analysts warn that despite the recent upside, Bitcoin may still face the risk of a deeper correction. The recovery looks promising, but the broader structure remains fragile, and cautious voices continue to dominate discussions. A failure to hold above $115,000 could once again expose the market to volatility and downside pressure. Adding another layer of concern, key data shows that Galaxy Digital’s Bitcoin sales remain ongoing. These sales, taking place even as Bitcoin rises, highlight the complex dynamics at play and temper the optimism around the recent rally. Galaxy Sales Weigh On Bitcoin Top analyst Darkfost shared fresh data that revealed a significant move in Bitcoin markets yesterday. According to him, 1,190 BTC were sent mainly to Binance, most likely to be sold. At current prices, that transaction represents more than $135 million worth of Bitcoin, underscoring that large-scale institutional selling continues even as bulls fight to sustain momentum above $115,000. Such transfers often signal that sellers, in this case Galaxy Digital, are actively reducing exposure, which can pressure the market during sensitive periods. While Bitcoin has managed to rebound from its recent lows near $108,000, these heavy sales create an overhang of supply that traders must absorb before a convincing uptrend can take hold. The timing adds even more weight, as Bitcoin enters a new stage marked by macro uncertainty. The looming US government shutdown now stands as one of the biggest risk factors for global markets. Political deadlock in Washington threatens to disrupt financial stability and could trigger volatility across equities, bonds, and digital assets. For Bitcoin, this situation creates both risk and opportunity: on one hand, fear-driven selling could drag prices lower; on the other, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge may attract inflows from investors seeking protection. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders At Cost Basis: SOPR At 1 Signals Mareket Equilibrium BTC Approaches Resistance After Strong Rebound Bitcoin is trading near $116,200 after a sharp rebound from last week’s lows around $109,000. The 8-hour chart highlights renewed bullish momentum, with price now pressing toward the key resistance zone at $117,500. This level has repeatedly capped rallies since late August, making it the line to watch for confirmation of a broader breakout. The recent move higher also pushed BTC back above its 50-period (blue) and 100-period (green) moving averages, both of which had previously acted as resistance. The price is now consolidating above these levels, showing that bulls are regaining short-term control. However, the 200-period moving average (red) sits just overhead near $115,000, and Bitcoin has only just cleared it — leaving the breakout unconfirmed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Retreats: 30D Change Falls To Lowest Level Since July Momentum remains constructive, but the market still faces a pivotal test. A decisive close above $117,500 could invite stronger buying pressure, opening the door for a run toward $120,000 and potentially retesting the yearly highs near $125,000. Conversely, rejection at this level could trigger profit-taking, dragging the price back toward $114,000 or even $112,000.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/big-xrp-whales-just-switched-sides-heres-what-happened/,"Whale activity often dictates short-term sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, and when a high-capital trader dramatically shifts position, the entire community pays attention. This week, a notable switch in XRP derivatives trading drew immediate reaction after STEPH IS CRYPTO revealed that a large market player had abandoned a multi-million-dollar bearish stance and pivoted aggressively bullish. The revelation has raised the question: is a broader reversal in motion, or is this simply another strategic maneuver in a volatile market? The Whale’s Position Flip According to Steph, a significant whale closed an XRP short position worth approximately $2.1 million before opening a long position totaling about $2.8 million. The transaction represents a net capital redeployment into a bullish outlook, highlighting the trader’s belief that downside risk may have diminished and that upside opportunity is preferable at this stage. Such a direct pivot, especially at scale, often draws comparisons to market turning points seen in other assets, where whale rotations have coincided with shifts in retail and institutional sentiment. The timing also coincides with XRP maintaining strength in the multi-dollar range, where leveraged plays can significantly influence price action. BREAKING: BIG #XRP WHALE JUST SWITCHED SIDES.

BULLISH REVERSAL SIGNAL? pic.twitter.com/KDgv4EkvkO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 1, 2025 Why This Is Seen as Bullish A trader’s move from short exposure to leveraged long positions suggests he believes the bearish trend is losing steam and an upward shift is imminent. For XRP, this could act as a catalyst by putting pressure on remaining shorts, potentially triggering liquidations that accelerate upward movement. Historically, similar whale-side reversals in crypto markets have preceded relief rallies or larger breakouts, especially when aligned with rising spot demand and tightening liquidity. At present, XRP futures and options markets report billions in open interest, meaning large position changes can ripple through the order book quickly. Steph’s disclosure of this switch, therefore, carries particular weight for those watching near-term price trajectories. The Derivatives Market Context A single whale trade does not exist in isolation. Broader market data shows active participation across exchanges, with open interest climbing and funding rates fluctuating between neutral and positive. These indicators suggest that sentiment may be gradually shifting toward bullishness after a corrective phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Still, professional analysts caution that the derivatives landscape is complex. Whales often rotate positions to manage exposure, pursue arbitrage opportunities, or hedge against correlated assets. This means not every position flip translates into straightforward directional conviction. A Note of Caution While Steph’s revelation has generated excitement, traders must remain cautious. Large actors are fully aware of how their movements are tracked, and sometimes their trades are designed to provoke reactions from retail participants. A dramatic short-to-long switch could be a genuine signal of confidence, but it could also represent a hedge against existing spot holdings or a short-term tactical play. The prudent approach is to treat this development as one input among many. Confirmation of a sustained bullish reversal will require follow-through in volume, stability in funding rates, and supportive on-chain data that reflects increased utility and adoption of XRP. The $2.1 million short closure followed by a $2.8 million long entry has placed XRP firmly back in the spotlight. Whether this sparks a broader rally or is a strategic move by large traders is uncertain, but it underscores the significant influence major traders have on market trends. For now, the community is watching closely to see if this switch truly marks the beginning of a bullish phase for XRP.

Some make headlines for their innovative features, while others fade quickly due to lack of vision or weak fundamentals. In October 2025, the conversation around presales has only grown louder. From memecoins drawing massive communities to utility-focused projects tapping into DeFi, the variety of opportunities is vast. Still, navigating this space requires more than just chasing hype. Understanding how to evaluate top crypto presales can mean the difference between joining the next memecoin to explode or falling into a trap. How to Avoid Crypto Traps and Choose the Best Presale Projects While excitement around cryptocurrency presales is natural, it often leads some to overlook risks. Many newcomers jump into a presale coin without proper research, only to discover that the project lacked direction or transparency. This is why due diligence is so important. The first step in avoiding traps is examining the project’s team and vision. A strong presale should show clear goals, consistent communication, and verifiable progress. Rushed promises or vague timelines are early warning signs that something may not be right. Another layer of research involves studying the community. Top presale projects usually maintain active, organic discussions rather than relying on bots or paid hype. A genuine following reflects long-term interest instead of short-term speculation. Finally, consider the tokenomics. Ask whether the structure allows sustainable growth or if it leans heavily on unrealistic promises. By slowing down and applying these checks, buyers can focus on the best crypto presales rather than getting caught in short-lived traps. Based Eggman Presale Update: A Top Pre Sale Set to Take Off in 2025 One of the most talked-about projects in the current crypto presale list is Based Eggman. With a presale raise of $207K already secured, the project has gathered significant attention in a short span of time. The combination of community enthusiasm and creative branding has helped it position itself among top presale projects worth following in 2025. What makes Based Eggman stand out is its blend of memecoin energy and practical use cases. Beyond its humor-driven culture, the project is working to integrate streaming and DeFi features that give its ecosystem more depth. This balance between entertainment and utility is exactly what many investors now look for in new crypto presales. Community has always played a decisive role in altcoin presales, and Based Eggman appears to be no different. The project’s social activity and ability to engage holders set it apart from presale coins that rely solely on speculative hype. If it continues to grow with this momentum, it could join the ranks of top crypto presales set to define 2025. The early results reflect not only excitement but also the willingness of participants to back creative teams that push beyond surface-level memes. For those studying the crypto presale 2025 landscape, Based Eggman offers insights into how a presale can build traction with both culture and function in mind. Conclusion: Where to Find the Next Memecoin to Explode and Top Crypto Pre Sales October 2025 is already shaping up as a busy season for presale coins. Projects like Based Eggman highlight how creative communities and practical features can combine to form the next memecoin to explode. At the same time, the crowded crypto presale list makes it vital to separate true innovation from projects that exist only to ride a trend. Whether you are looking for the best crypto presale or exploring new crypto presales on the rise, the key lies in research, patience, and smart decision-making. Take time to learn, verify, and then participate. If you are planning your next step, now is the right moment to explore the top crypto presales set to take off in 2025 before they close to early buyers.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-investors-hold-your-xrp-heres-why/,"The global payments industry is undergoing a seismic shift. SWIFT, the backbone of international banking for decades, is experimenting with blockchain technology to modernize cross-border transactions. For some, this raises doubts about XRP’s long-term role. But the reality is different: SWIFT’s move doesn’t erase XRP’s relevance; rather, it underscores it. Within this debate, Awaken X has stepped forward with a powerful message to the XRP community: stay the course. HOLD YOUR XRP MY PEOPLE …. #DiorSS26 #LeDefileLOrealxBecky #LISA #ParisFashionWeek #xrp pic.twitter.com/HKCuu2hvMI — AWAKEN 𝕏 (@RAGrubb2) September 30, 2025 Awaken X: XRP’s Value Is Still Intact Speaking directly to his followers on X, Awaken X tackled the growing anxiety head-on. “Is XRP done because Swift is now creating a cross-border system? I’m not the least bit worried, okay.” He explained that while SWIFT is enhancing infrastructure, its new system does not solve the biggest challenge in global payments: liquidity. “They have a liquidity issue. It ain’t Swift. XRP is on-demand liquidity. If anything, it makes me even that much more bullish about XRP.” Awaken X’s point is clear — SWIFT’s technology upgrades may improve efficiency, but XRP delivers something far more crucial: real-time liquidity that banks and financial institutions desperately need. What SWIFT’s Blockchain Initiative Really Means SWIFT’s blockchain pilots are focused on enabling tokenized asset transfers, improving transparency, and boosting interoperability between financial systems. It aims to keep pace with digital innovation while maintaining its central role in global banking. Reports confirm that the project enhances settlement rails but does not provide instant liquidity, leaving a gap that XRP continues to fill. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Competitive Edge: On-Demand Liquidity Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) was designed for the very problem SWIFT cannot solve. By using XRP as a bridge asset, ODL removes the need for pre-funded accounts, freeing up capital and enabling payments to settle in seconds. This distinction is critical. SWIFT may be modernizing the rails, but XRP provides the fuel that powers instant, cost-efficient cross-border transactions. Why XRP Holders Should Stay Confident The rise of tokenization and real-time settlement is expanding, not shrinking, the opportunities for XRP. SWIFT’s upgrades validate the direction of the industry but do not diminish XRP’s unique role. As Awaken X reminded the community, “If anything, it makes me even that much more bullish about XRP.” For investors, the message could not be clearer: XRP remains positioned to solve a problem that even the world’s largest financial networks cannot fix alone. As traditional finance increasingly adopts blockchain technology, XRP’s utility will play an even more critical role. The call to action is timely and direct: hold your XRP, my people.

""Long Solana (SOL), Short This Altcoin!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/analysis-firm-reveals-strategy-for-altcoin-etf-approval-long-solana-sol-short-this-altcoin/,"While the US government shutdown is on the agenda of the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, altcoin ETFs awaiting approval are also facing uncertainty. At this point, experts state that decisions regarding altcoin ETFs will most likely not be announced during the US government shutdown, and that approval is very unlikely. While uncertainty surrounding ETFs persists, Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, outlined his strategy for Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) should the SEC approve altcoin ETFs. Long on Solana, Short on Litecoin! At this point, Lunde noted that Solana is less likely to be affected by potential supply pressure from Grayscale compared to Litecoin. Lunde pointed to differences in the trading histories of Grayscale’s Solana and Litecoin trusts, noting that trading “long SOL and short LTC” could be tempting if altcoin ETFs were to launch. Grayscale's Solana trust, which began trading in 2023, holds only 0.1% of the circulating Solana supply and has never traded at a discount, according to Lunde. This means it may face minimal selling pressure after converting to an ETF. Multiple Solana ETF applications and large-scale demand for digital asset treasury strategies are further supporting the SOL price. But in contrast, the Grayscale Litecoin trust controls 2.65% of LTC’s circulating supply, and the trust has repeatedly traded at a large discount, similar to previous GBTC and ETHE conversions. Given the relatively small number of ETF applications for Litecoin compared to Solana, Lunde said he believes a “long Solana/short Litecoin” strategy would be quite attractive with the simultaneous listing of ETFs. “We believe long SOL and short LTC are attractive if the Solana and Litecoin ETF launches occur simultaneously. Given LTC's history of reacting strongly to positive news, we will wait a few days after launch before taking action.” *This is not investment advice.

According to Kalshi, a federally regulated prediction market, the current forecast implies the stoppage will last 12 days, up sharply in recent days as negotiations on Capitol Hill have stalled. Trading activity on Polymarket shows most participants believe federal operations won’t resume until October 15 or later, an outcome currently priced at 38 percent likelihood. Meanwhile, 23% of traders think a deal will emerge between October 6 and 9, while 22 percent anticipate an agreement in the October 10-14 timeframe. Just 14% expect Congress to reach terms in the next few days, specifically between October 3 and 5. Source: Polymarket Operations ground to a halt early Wednesday after President Donald Trump and senior lawmakers from both parties couldn’t agree on temporary funding legislation. The breakdown means hundreds of thousands of government employees face unpaid leave, while numerous federal programs and services have ceased operating. How long Washington stays shuttered carries real consequences As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, prolonged closure threatens an economy already showing signs of weakness and could unsettle financial markets currently trading near all-time peaks. Source: Kalshi Historical data from Bank of America shows government closures typically run about 14 days, dating back three decades. Stock prices, measured by the S&P 500, have generally risen 1% during past shutdowns, though analysts warn a lengthy standoff this time might shake investor confidence. The current crisis stems from a weeks-long battle between Republicans and Democrats centered on enhanced healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. This marks the first time the government has shut down since 2019. Politicians on both sides insist publicly and privately they won’t shoulder blame for the funding collapse. Republican leaders are pushing for a simple seven-week extension of existing spending levels. Democratic senators refuse to support any such measure without significant policy wins in return. Republicans vow daily votes on funding bill Lawmakers departed the Capitol Tuesday evening with no clear path forward. Accordind to CNN, the Senate plans another vote late Wednesday on the Republican proposal, which GOP leaders have promised to bring up repeatedly until enough Democrats cave and vote to restart government operations. But many Democrats have stated flatly they won’t back down, even as Trump and his budget office escalate warnings about using the shutdown to permanently shrink federal operations. Republicans hold majorities in both chambers and control the White House, but Senate rules require at least seven Democratic votes to advance spending legislation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demands any funding package include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, along with other Democratic priorities, before his caucus will provide support. What makes this shutdown potentially different is Trump’s approach. The president and the White House Office of Management and Budget have suggested agencies should eliminate positions in programs that have lost funding and don’t match administration goals, rather than simply putting workers on temporary leave. Some Democrats have already switched sides. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine reversed course Tuesday night to support the Republican bill. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania also backed the GOP measure and has criticized his party’s tactics. Two other Democrats, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, had lengthy discussions with senior party members on the Senate floor before ultimately voting against the Republican plan. Shaheen spoke privately with Senate Republican Leader John Thune immediately after casting her vote. She later explained her decision saying “I thought getting this done so that we can now hopefully get back to the negotiating table was the best approach.” Get seen where it counts.

MPU to Diversify DAT Strategy with Basket of Leading Stablecoins and Governance Tokens Mega Matrix Inc. (NYSE American: MPU) today announced a strategic update to its Digital Asset Treasury (“DAT”) strategy. The Company will transition from a single-asset approach focused on… pic.twitter.com/RIjR2Pz2aC — Mega Matrix Inc. (NYSE American: MPU) (@MegaMatrixMPU) October 1, 2025 In a press release shared with Cryptonews, the company said it was previously concentrated on Ethena’s governance token ENA. Under the revised strategy, it will also hold USDe, USDtb, and ENA from the Ethena ecosystem; USDH and HYPE from Hyperliquid; USDF and ASTER from Aster; and USDS and SKY from Sky Protocol. “Dual-Engine” Structure The updated treasury model is described as a “dual-engine” approach. Part of the portfolio will be held in stablecoins and allocated to low-risk decentralized finance (DeFi) activities such as staking and yield locking on platforms, including Pendle. This segment is intended to provide a steady income, even during periods of market volatility. The second part involves governance tokens from the same ecosystems. These holdings give Mega Matrix the ability to participate in protocol-level decision-making while also capturing potential value growth tied to the expansion of the platforms. Broader Stablecoin Market Context Colin Butler, executive vice president and global head of markets at Mega Matrix, said stablecoins have become an established asset class and noted the U.S. Treasury projections that the market could reach $2 trillion by 2028. Butler said that the company’s treasury shift moves away from reliance on a single-token strategy toward broader exposure across several digital asset networks. Stablecoins, typically pegged to fiat currencies, are increasingly viewed by corporations as liquid and relatively stable instruments within the broader crypto sector. The inclusion of governance tokens, however, adds a layer of exposure to sector-specific risks and potential upside. Corporate Shift Toward Digital Assets Mega Matrix, once a diversified holding company with activities ranging from Ethereum staking to media production, has been refocusing its operations around blockchain and digital asset strategies. Its decision to integrate a mix of stablecoins and governance tokens into its balance sheet reflects a wider corporate trend of experimenting with digital assets under regulated structures.

The jump from 2.0% in August came as service prices increased and energy costs fell at a slower pace. New figures from Eurostat showed the change matched forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. The report also confirmed that a key core inflation measure, which strips out food and fuel, held steady at 2.3%, even as services costs moved higher. The increase is already shaping how markets and policymakers view the ECB’s next steps. The central bank has held interest rates at 2% after a sharp cycle of cuts and now faces questions on whether the rise in prices will delay future moves. Data released Wednesday also noted the trend of steady core prices alongside stronger services inflation. The details point to a complex mix for policymakers ahead of their October 30 meeting, which will be the third straight session with rates on hold if no change is made. ECB weighs rate stance after September data The European Central Bank has spent four years trying to bring down inflation. Yet officials do not see this month’s rise as a sign of a new problem. They say broader trends still point to prices falling back toward and below the 2% target. ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday, “As we can model the future, the risks to inflation appear quite contained in both directions. With policy rates now at 2%, we are well placed to respond if the risks to inflation shift, or if new shocks emerge that threaten our target.” This signals that the bank is ready to act but is not panicking over one month’s figure. Some policymakers, however, are expected to use the September reading as an argument to hold off on further easing. This includes those who fear that cutting rates again could risk destabilizing price expectations. The ECB is almost certain to keep rates at their current level for a third straight meeting on October 30. Financial investors show a similar view. They see only a 10% chance of another rate cut later this year and a 30% chance of a cut by mid-2026. These market odds reflect comfort with the ECB’s current stance despite the uptick in headline inflation. Policymakers warn of inflation slipping too low Inside the Eurozone, the bigger fear for some officials is not high inflation but inflation staying too low. The ECB forecasts price growth dipping to 1.7% next year and holding under target for six consecutive quarters. This would be long enough for retailers and employers to change how they set prices and wages. Some policymakers argue this could entrench weak price growth, much like in the pre-pandemic decade, when the ECB slashed rates below zero and printed trillions of euros to spur the economy, but still could not lift inflation. This argument is backed by weak numbers for industry, investment, and household spending, which all point to a slowdown. The economy is also facing pressure from U.S. tariffs, which add another layer of risk. Yet the more hawkish side of the ECB says these fears are overstated. They believe the economy is strong enough to handle trade tensions, with industry rebounding, jobs staying solid, and defense spending rising to support growth. For now, the bank will wait and see before moving rates again. This comes after it already cut rates by two full percentage points in the year through June. The path ahead will depend on how quickly the picture clears up and whether inflation truly drifts back below target or proves stickier than expected.

Specifically, the assets are worth $37.7 billion, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins all backed at 100% or higher. The exchange reported 125,083 BTC in user assets, a 4,432 BTC addition from August’s numbers. In contrast, Ethereum holdings have reduced by 35,011, now standing at 1.7 million ETH. In addition, USDT balances were reduced by 248 million to 9.4 billion, representing a 2.56% monthly decrease. The most recent numbers show that all assets are fully backed by the exchange, which keeps a 105% Bitcoin reserve ratio. This indicates that OKX has 105 BTC in its wallets for every 100 BTC that users deposit. Bitcoin holdings surge as other assets drop The rise in Bitcoin holdings mirrors broader market trends in September. This change brought OKX’s total Bitcoin user assets to 125,083 BTC. This is split between 119,372 BTC held directly by the exchange and 12,458 BTC in third-party custody. The exchange’s 105% reserve ratio means OKX maintains 131,830 BTC in total wallet assets, keeping an extra buffer above user deposits. OKX has released its 35th Proof of Reserves (snapshot date: September 2). User BTC holdings stand at approximately 125K, up 3.67% from the previous report (August 18), with an increase of 4,432 BTC.

USDT… pic.twitter.com/mt8GPrJ6Ny — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 1, 2025 While Bitcoin holdings increased, other major assets on OKX saw small declines. Ethereum assets decreased by 2.01%, with the exchange maintaining a 103% reserve ratio. This means OKX holds 1.751 million ETH in wallet assets, divided between 1.65 million ETH on the exchange and 100,691 ETH in third-party custody. USDT holdings showed the largest percentage drop, reducing by 2.56%. The stablecoin maintains a 105% reserve ratio, with OKX holding 9.9 billion USDT in total wallet assets. Additionally, USDC holdings declined by 1.17% to reach $ 1.14 billion. The stablecoin holds a 100% reserve ratio. Among the cryptocurrencies that OKX accepts, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has the most coverage at 118% of user deposits; however, this is not the case for all of OKX’s supported cryptocurrencies. With reserve levels of 105% for Bitcoin, 103% for Ethereum, and 102% for Solana, the exchange’s risk management is clearly visible. Based on these percentages, OKX has between $102 and $118 in assets for every $100 that users deposit. Among other altcoins, XRP maintains 108% reserve ratios, ETC maintains 107% reserve ratios, while Dogecoin sits at 101%. This consistency in over-collateralization extends to smaller market cap assets, with most maintaining ratios between 100% and 105%. Custody distribution and security measures With the majority of its assets held directly on the exchange, OKX also makes use of third-party custody services. Out of all the Bitcoins in circulation, more than 90% are held directly by exchanges, while 10% are held by third-party custodians. In addition, 6% of Ethereum’s total external assets are in third-party custody, which is about the same as Bitcoin. Approximately 3.3% of USDT’s equities are held by third parties. Asset types determine the custody arrangement. Nearly all assets for OKX tokens, including APT, BCH, and LINK, are under direct exchange management. OKX introduces OKX Pay As reported by Cryptopolitan, OKX CEO Star Xu unveiled OKX Pay at the TOKEN2049 conference. It is a self-custodial, stablecoin-based payment service that is now live in Singapore. According to Xu, users can use QR codes to pay and earn approximately 4% APY and 3–4% cash back. The service, based on OKX’s X Layer Ethereum L2, will reintroduce peer-to-peer payments and establish stablecoins as the world’s primary payment system. Xu said that this mode of payment is cheaper and more efficient. For example, domestic card payments are very inexpensive, but cross-border transactions can cost 1–3%. Xu added that Stablecoins are global by design, and P2P transfer does not compromise security or compliance. “Our vision is that, within a few years, users will be able to travel freely worldwide with just stablecoins and the OKX app, enjoy yields higher than banks, and receive more cashback on every transaction,” he said.

According to Forbes, Barron’s net worth rose by $80 million in recent months alone, bringing his total fortune to $150 million. Most strikingly, he also holds nearly 2.3 billion WLFI tokens from the World Liberty Financial project, which could be worth more than $525 million if sold. This leap has already placed him ahead of Melania in personal wealth. How The Trump Family Is Riding The Crypto Wave Barron Trump’s push into the digital asset world was decisive. In late 2024, he persuaded the family to launch World Liberty Financial, a company designed to capitalize on the crypto boom. The project gained momentum quickly, and Trump family members followed suit, each building impressive fortunes. Donald Trump Jr. multiplied his wealth tenfold over the past year, reaching $500 million. Eric Trump reportedly expanded his wealth from $40 million to $750 million, boosted by crypto market moves and business in Qatar. Ivanka Trump now holds about $100 million, while Jared Kushner sits comfortably on a $1 billion fortune. The President’s Massive Crypto Payday Donald Trump himself turned out to be the biggest winner. Over the course of the year, he earned $3 billion, with $2 billion coming directly from crypto investments. By mid-August, his disclosed income from crypto projects stood at $2.37 billion, while in June 2025 he revealed more than $57 million in profits from WLFI token sales. Today, Trump’s total wealth has grown 70%, reaching $7.3 billion—pushing him to 201st place on the Forbes 400 list, a jump of 118 spots. Melania Joins The Crypto Craze Melania Trump hasn’t been left behind. She manages a $20 million crypto wallet funded by book sales, conference appearances, and documentaries. Beyond traditional inflows, she ventured into meme tokens, launching her own coin called MELANIA. The token, themed around internet memes, has gained traction on exchanges and is reportedly valued at around $200 million.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TOKEN SALE|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 15:21:58

The performance comes as traders turn their attention to October, which has historically been the asset’s strongest month. Since 2013, bitcoin has averaged 14.4% gains in October, with a median return of 10.8%. Out of 13 Octobers in that span, 10 ended in the green and only three closed lower. That track record makes October the most statistically favorable month for the asset, with gains often clustering in the second half. Such seasonality is a hallmark of financial markets, with markets tending to recede at the beginning of May before a spike in November. This is based on the belief that equity markets underperform during the summer due to lower trading volumes, reduced institutional activity, and historical returns data. Historically, U.S. stock markets have shown weaker performance from May through October than from November through April, leading to the strategy becoming a seasonal rule-of-thumb for some investors. Bitcoin also shows recurring seasonal patterns, often influenced by macro cycles, institutional flows, and retail sentiment. As such, past trading patterns show the first week of October can be choppy or negative, before stronger upside takes hold later in the month. In several years, bitcoin posted double-digit surges after Oct. 15, even when early price action was muted. The backdrop this year is similar. Bitcoin’s mixed performance through 2025 — including drawdowns in spring and uneven summer trading — contrasts with the resilience of recent weeks, adding weight to the idea that September’s strength may be a precursor to late-year momentum. Still, seasonality offers probabilities, not certainties. Macro catalysts, from U.S. inflation prints to shifts in risk appetite, have historically shaped October’s rallies. But with September’s performance ranking near the top and the odds favoring bulls in October, traders will be watching closely to see if history rhymes once again.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trading|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-01 15:30:05

In the midst of this fluctuating price action, on-chain activities on the ETH network are sharply booming, as evidenced by a notable surge in transactions. Sharp Boom In Ethereum Daily Transactions The price of Ethereum is building underlying strength for a possible upward move, as well as the network’s performance. In the past few days, the network has experienced a powerful resurgence, with daily transactions reaching levels not seen in many years. Darkfost, a market expert and author, reported that this sharp uptick in on-chain activity, underscoring a resurgence of investor interest, increased demand for decentralized apps, and a wider blockchain use across industries. It also indicates a growing sense of confidence in the ecosystem’s long-term scalability and value. According to the expert, ETH is booming, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is now growing rapidly, with the network naturally finding itself at the hub of this ecosystem. As a result, the number of transactions on the network is surging and has recently broken out of a four-year range. It is worth noting that Ethereum’s daily transactions during the previous four years have been roughly between 900,000 and 1.2 million, using a 14-day SMA to reduce noise. When ETH experienced a significant amount of FUD during the most recent downturn in late March, the daily average was already around 1.2 million transactions. Interestingly, this level was much higher than the number observed in January 2023, when the network barely reached 1 million transfers per day. However, the daily transaction count is hitting between 1.6 million and 1.7 million, marking the highest levels ever recorded on the Ethereum network . Darkfost noted that Ethereum’s rise in transactions has a real correlation with its price. In the meantime, the expert points to the importance of monitoring this data because this is where the truth lies, which has benefited those who utilized the data. ETH Funding Rates On A Downward Trend Lately, investors’ sentiment appears to have flipped bearish as Funding Rates move into a negative territory. This shift in sentiment coincides with ETH prepping up for a rally, signaling cooling momentum among leveraged traders and raising questions about the current uptrend. Crypto Summon revealed that Ethereum’s financing rates stayed negative throughout last week, which is similar to previous occasions. However, the market expert claims that the downward trend has stopped, and an ascending trend is emerging. This development hints at a potential bottom in ETH’s price action . According to the expert, it is common for bottoms to coincide with times when investors are frightened and either wager on additional declines or pay premiums to protect themselves. Current data from CoinMarketCap shows that ETH’s price has pulled back to $4,127, indicating a nearly 2% decrease in the last 24 hours. While its price has slightly dropped, its trading volume is also experiencing a bearish move, falling by more than 8% in the past day.",Ethereum|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Summon|decentralized finance|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Funding Rates|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum's Daily Transactions|ethusd|ETHUSDT|fud,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 15:30:15

On one hand, the long-awaited $33 billion initial public offering (IPO) of Grayscale could redefine crypto’s role in the stock market. On the other, lawsuits tied to Genesis, a bankrupt DCG subsidiary, still hover over him. According to the Financial Times , Grayscale’s IPO expected in 2025 has the power to mark the first time a major crypto asset management company enters the public markets. Market analysts already describe it as a potential turning point for institutional trust in digital assets. Frank Chaparro, Head of Content at GSR, even called it “a landmark debut” . Genesis Bankruptcy Casts A Long Shadow But Silbert’s ambitions are complicated by legal battles. Genesis, one of DCG’s most important subsidiaries, filed for bankruptcy in January 2023 after massive losses tied to loans with Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research. The fallout has been fierce. The Winklevoss twins, founders of Gemini, accused Silbert of undermining trust across the entire digital asset industry. While thousands of Gemini clients have already received full repayment, many other creditors only managed to claw back partial funds. In addition, regulators have pursued settlements totaling billions. Genesis reached agreements with both the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Securities and Exchange Commission, including a $2 billion settlement tied to fraud accusations. Meanwhile, lawsuits continue to allege that Silbert and DCG insiders knew of financial risks as early as 2021 but kept moving money to protect themselves. A Test For Silbert And Grayscale Despite the allegations, Silbert has reclaimed his position as chairman of Grayscale’s board while debuting fresh ventures, including a marketplace for decentralized AI models. He insists Grayscale’s IPO will open crypto assets to wider investors and “transform private trusts into public vehicles.” Critics, however, remain unconvinced. Some creditors accuse Silbert of betrayal, pointing to multimillion-dollar losses they believe could have been avoided. One investor told reporters he is still waiting for the return of $2.5 million lost through Genesis. Still, with investor enthusiasm for crypto heating up and political backing stronger in the US than ever, Grayscale’s IPO has the potential to cement Silbert’s influence—or bring his empire under even greater scrutiny.",News|Business,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 15:30:52

Already higher overnight, crypto prices rose further early in the U.S. session as fresh economic data suggested September's Federal Reserve rate cut won't be nearly the last this year. Private payrolls saw their largest decline in 2.5 years in September as companies in the private sector lost 32,000 jobs according to a fresh report from payroll processing firm ADP. August’s originally reported 54,000 gain was revised to a loss of 3,000 jobs. Traders would typically be far more focused on the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report due Friday, but the release will likely be delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown. Also on Wednesday, the ISM September Manufacturing PMI Survey was in line at 49.1, but the Prices Paid index showed some welcome inflation news, dropping to 61.9 from 63.7 in August and forecasts for 63.2. In equities, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were down slightly. Gold, which hit a fresh all-time high of $3,921 earlier on Wednesday, edged back to $3,888. A look at altcoins show gains across the board, with ether (ETH), Solana's SOL (SOL) and dogecoin (DOGE) up 5%-7% over the past 24 hours, outpacing bitcoin's advance. Amid uncertainty over upcoming data releases to guide monetary policymakers about the economy, market participants nevertheless universally expect the Federal Reserve to lower benchmark interest rates further at the upcoming October meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows 99% probability of a 25 basis point cut, up from 92% one week ago. October starts strong September has typically been a treacherous month for crypto, but little-noticed in the poor investor sentiment of late was bitcoin having one of its best Septembers in many years, gaining about 6% for the month. In the final two days of September, the spot bitcoin ETFs gathered $950 million of inflows, more than reversing the $900 million of outflows the previous week. ""The next quarter is likely to see the start of the crypto bull market,"" said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. Her outlook is driven by incoming macro tailwinds in the form of interest rate easing and other potential policy support such as yield curve control being in the cards to keep markets steady if the global economy turns sour. That environment should be positive for altcoins, too, she said, with new spot ETFs likely coming to market, turning investor attention to the sector. ""The coming quarter should bring the kickoff of 'alt-season', as attention starts to turn away from the 'majors' (BTC and ETH) and towards smaller, more volatile tokens.""",Markets|market analysis|Market Wrap|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-01 15:34:22

The Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS , a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Test networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet. The next two testnet runs are scheduled for Oct. 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch. “Holesky finalized! A great first step towards Fusaka on mainnet and to more blobs on Ethereum,” said Ethereum Foundation DevOps engineer Parithosh Jayanthi on X .

This week, the attention has turned to Zcash, Pudgy Penguins, and Sonic. Each token has advanced in recent sessions, supported by a mix of structural demand, community energy, and speculation. The market is not lifting all tokens equally. Instead, liquidity is concentrating where catalysts align with depth. Zcash has staged one of its strongest rallies in years, fueled by renewed attention to privacy networks. Pudgy Penguins builds on cultural and NFT crossover momentum. Sonic captures small-cap flows, with traders looking for speculative opportunities while liquidity broadens. Together, they represent three distinct entry points for altseason activity. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Trade Reignited Zcash is currently trading around $90 , up more than 35% in the past 24 hours. Market capitalization now stands near $1.5 billion, with daily volume exceeding hundreds of millions across major exchanges. when innovation comes along… it can change everything! pic.twitter.com/Oizh9Fwnwb — Zcash (@Zcash) September 30, 2025 This surge has been linked to renewed institutional commentary on privacy assets, combined with technical triggers. Analysts note that ZEC broke through multiple resistance levels in the $70–$75 range, which invited momentum traders back into the market. Shielded transaction counts on the network have also increased modestly, reinforcing the perception that user activity is ticking higher. Zcash has spent long periods outside of traders’ focus, but when altcoin season rotations include privacy themes, it tends to re-enter screens quickly. The scale of this week’s move suggests that narrative is back in play. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Community Strength Supports Price Pudgy Penguins is priced near $0.031, with a 13% gain in the past day. The market capitalization is now around $2 billion, while the 24-hour volume is tracking above $400 million. PENGU Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) PENGU’s rise continues a series of moves tied to brand expansion. The project has leveraged its NFT identity into wider distribution, and partnerships have kept community engagement high. Trading activity shows strong retail participation, particularly on centralized venues where liquidity has been building. The token’s dual nature as both a meme-linked asset and part of a recognizable NFT brand differentiates it from other culture coins. During altcoin season, that combination of visibility and depth has allowed PENGU to maintain turnover while other meme tokens fade quickly. Sonic (SONIC): Speculation in Small-Cap Rotation Sonic is now trading around $0.274 , up about 10% in the past 24 hours. Market capitalization remains relatively small compared to Zcash or PENGU, but daily turnover has expanded as more exchanges list the token. Sonic’s performance this week has been tied to listings and staking announcements, which created a short-term demand spike. Traders also point to rising open interest in perpetual contracts, suggesting leverage is contributing to price action. These features make Sonic a classic example of a small-cap benefiting from altseason spillover, where new capital looks for higher-beta exposure after large tokens rally. Altcoin Season Outlook The moves in Zcash, Pudgy Penguins, and Sonic underline the uneven nature of altcoin season. ZEC is showing how legacy tokens can surge when narratives return. PENGU demonstrates how culture and community projects sustain volume. Sonic represents the speculative tail where smaller assets absorb late-stage flows. For traders, the key will be whether ZEC can hold above its new breakout, whether PENGU sustains its cultural push, and whether Sonic builds liquidity beyond short-term speculation. If those conditions persist, this rotation can deepen, marking the next stage of altseason.

Our Emorya Finance price prediction expects the EMR price to record a maximum price range of $0.07-$0.1 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the EMR price to surpass the $1 milestone. Emorya Finance is building an ecosystem where sports, fitness, and blockchain technology converge to create a solid user experience. Through the Emorya mobile application, individuals can track calories burned, monitor daily activity, and receive rewards in the form of $EMRS tokens, which can be converted into the ecosystem’s main token, $EMR. This not only promotes physical well-being but also introduces users to the dominating blockchain industry, particularly the MultiverseX blockchain, known for its scalability, security, and efficiency. Emorya’s dual-token system, $EMR and $EMRS, supports a deflationary model with transaction fees that sustain long-term growth while rewarding loyal holders. Beyond crypto rewards, the Emorya Sports Program integrates NFTs that transform with a user’s real-world achievements, unlocking exclusive features, premium challenges, and even interactions with licensed trainers and global athletes.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the Emorya Finance price from an immediate surge.

EMR/USDT Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Emorya Finance price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.0028719, resulting in a correction to $0.0020763. Is Emorya Finance A Good Investment? Emorya Finance shows strong potential as it attracts investors with its fitness rewards, NFTs, and blockchain innovation. Its dual-token system ($EMR and $EMRS), deflationary model, and integration with the MultiverseX blockchain give it technological strength and long-term utility. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries volatility and risk. While some believe the EMR price prediction 2025-2031 could approach $1, investors should conduct their research before committing. Why is the EMR Price down today? Following the overall selling pressure in the market, EMR price failed to maintain its buying demand above $0.004. This resulted in a surge in liquidation and EMR price lost its immediate support channels. Will EMR Recover? If buyers push above the key price levels at around $0.0035, we might see a strong recovery toward $0.006. Will EMR Reach $1? Many investors are wondering whether the Emorya Finance (EMR) price can realistically hit the $1 mark. Based on the project’s solid adoption model, the answer is yes and EMR could easily hit $1 within 2030-2031. Unlike many crypto projects that rely only on hype or slow utility adoption, Emorya has no adoption limits. The platform prepares to onboard millions of Web2 users, all of whom must use EMR to monetize their calories. With only 5% of the total supply currently circulating, it creates strong potential for a massive bull run in the EMR token price Will EMR Reach $10? Looking further ahead, many wonder if the Emorya Finance (EMR) token could ever reach $10. While this is a longer-term target, the growth potential is very real. The Emorya Finance model is built on mass onboarding and mandatory EMR usage, which ensures steady demand for EMR tokens. If Emorya Finance successfully scales to millions of active users, EMR could realistically sustain the momentum to approach or even surpass the $10 mark over time. Comparable projects like StepN and Pi Network showed how massive user onboarding can fuel strong token demand long before listing on major exchanges. With the same scale of adoption, the Emorya Finance price prediction of $10 is a realistic milestone. Is EMR a Good Long-Term Investment? EMR token has shown a strong performance over the past few years. The roadmap and features are promising, making it a good long-term investment. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable opportunity for sustained growth. Recent EMR News/Opinions Emorya Finance has officially started announcing its B2B partnerships, beginning with Domocos Fitness as its first fitness partner in the UK. https://twitter.com/EmoryaApp/status/1966559358025703923 EMR Price Prediction October 2025 Over the last few weeks, EMR token price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below Fib levels. However, the overall market sentiment is recovering and the BTC price aims for a recovery above $120K in October. This might push the EMR token price toward August highs. According to technical analysis, we might see the EMR price to record the maximum level of $0.0063 and minimum price of $0.0036, with an expected average trading price of $0.005 throughout October. Emorya Finance Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Emorya Finance Price Prediction October 2025 $0.0036 $0.005 $0.0063 Emorya Finance Price Forecast 2025 EMR has already recorded a 10x rebound from its 2024 bottom. A continued trend, combined with new fitness partnerships and exchange listings, could support higher cent levels even before 2026. As a result, Cryptopolitan predicts the EMR price to record a minimum price range of $0.003-$0.01, with a base price range of $0.015-$0.05 and a maximum price between $0.07-$0.1 in a bullish case. Emorya Finance Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Emorya Finance Price Prediction 2025 $0.003-$0.01 $0.015-$0.05 $0.07-$0.1 Emorya Finance Price Prediction 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2026 0.01 0.05 – 0.15 0.35 2027 0.02 0.10 – 0.25 0.6 2028 0.02 0.20 – 0.40 0.7 2029 0.05 0.30 – 0.50 0.85 2030 0.06 0.40 – 0.60 0.9 2031 0.1 0.50 – 0.70 1.00+ Emorya Finance Price Prediction 2026 With a limited circulating supply and growing user traction from the Emorya Sports App and NFT ecosystem, a break into multi-cent territory appears plausible. In 2026, Emorya Finance is expected to have a minimum price of around $0.01 under conservative conditions. The highest it might go is $0.35 in a bullish scenario, while the average price could stay near $0.05–$0.15 in a base case. Emorya Finance Price Prediction 2027 If adoption scales across fitness communities in Europe and Asia, and EMR secures stronger partnerships, this mid-term horizon could see EMR move into the high-cent range. For 2027, the minimum price is predicted at $0.02, while the maximum value might reach $0.60 if market adoption accelerates. The average closing price is expected to hover around $0.10–$0.25. EMR Token Price Forecast 2028 Based on analysis, Emorya Finance could trade at a low of $0.02 in 2028 under bearish pressure. It may rise to a maximum of $0.7, with the average value stabilizing near $0.2–$0.4 depending on market sentiment. Emorya Finance Price Prediction 2029 In 2029, the lowest expected price is $0.05, while the token might climb to a high of $0.85 in a bullish cycle. The average could hover near $0.30–$0.50. EMR Price Prediction 2030 By 2030, Emorya Finance could reach a minimum of $0.06 in a conservative path. The highest forecast is $0.9, while the average price is expected around $0.40–$0.60 as adoption deepens. Emorya Finance Price Prediction 2031 Looking at 2031, the minimum projected price is $0.10, with the maximum potentially breaking $1.00+ in a bullish case. The average trading price is likely to remain near $0.50–$0.70 in the base scenario.

Emorya Finance Historical Price Sentiment EMR Price History: Coinmarketcap Emorya Finance’s journey since December 2023 has been nothing short of turbulent. When the token first appeared in late 2023, it traded around $0.014, with occasional spikes above $0.02, before dipping slightly by year’s end. The start of 2024 brought a surge of positive hope. In January, EMR almost doubled from its lows, climbing close to $0.02. February pushed even higher, briefly touching above $0.04, before the momentum quickly faded. By spring, the token entered a steep downtrend, with prices sliding steadily month after month. April and May saw EMR fall below a penny, and by June 2024 it collapsed further to just a fraction of a cent. After such a steep decline, the market attempted several recoveries in the summer of 2024. July and August saw small rebounds, and September offered a stronger rally, but these gains proved short-lived. The end of the year was marked by weakness, with the token closing 2024 under $0.002. The momentum shifted dramatically in early 2025. March and April sparked explosive rallies, with EMR surging over 300% in April alone, reaching highs not seen in nearly a year. But just as quickly, the token gave back much of its value, with steep drops in May and June. July brought another massive jump of over 70%, though August cooled slightly again. By the end of August, EMR price surged toward $0.0063 but later it declined below $0.005 in early September. EMR continued to consolidate below $0.0035 throughout September.",Crypto Price Predictions|Emorya Finance|EMR,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-01 15:48:59

According to CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán, there’s a fundamental divide in Bitcoin (BTC) whale behavior that is creating a market pulled between steadfast conviction and short-term speculation. The Whale Divide: Calm Accumulation vs. Aggressive Trading In his latest assessment, Alemán noted that not all Bitcoin whales operate with the same strategy. The market’s largest holders, those with over 1,000 BTC, are split into two distinct groups with opposing influences on price action. On one hand are long-term holder (LTH) whales, who have kept their Bitcoin for more than 155 days, and are currently in possession of about 3.72 million BTC acquired at an average price of only $41,887. According to the expert, this group’s behavior is typically calm, characterized by strategic accumulation with little reaction to moderate price declines. On the other hand, short-term holder (STH) whales have around 1.07 million BTC bought at a much higher average cost of $111,299. This cohort, often made up of institutions and other newcomers to the market, usually displays more aggressive trading patterns, frequently repositioning during pullbacks to lower their average costs, injecting considerable short-term volatility into the market in the process. This difference in behavior is creating a structural tension beneath Bitcoin’s price movements. “The distinction between LTH and STH Whales is key because their different behaviors directly impact market volatility,” wrote Alemán. “When STH Whales become more active, their higher cost basis often translates into sharper short-term moves. In contrast, the steady accumulation of LTH Whales provides stability and price support.” The performance is also occurring against a complex backdrop. As reported previously by CryptoQuant, there has been a sharp drop in Taker Buy Volume across major exchanges like Binance, indicating weakening demand for the OG cryptocurrency from aggressive buyers. Historically, the pattern has preceded extended consolidation or notable pullbacks. Still, the blockchain’s fundamental health appears solid. Data from the tail-end of September confirmed Bitcoin’s hashrate reached a record 1.441 zettahashes per second, viewed by observers as a sign of strong miner confidence and increased network security. Market Outlook Hinges on Demand and Momentum Bitcoin’s immediate future appears to hinge on which group of heavyweight investors will gain the upper hand and whether broader market demand can rebound. While the stability offered by LTH whales, with their low cost basis, provides a solid foundation of price support, the constant activity of STH whales, who are more sensitive to price swings due to their higher entry points, makes sharp short-term moves more likely. In the meantime, traders will be watching key technical levels. A clean break above the $115,000 resistance could confirm the bullish technical setup and potentially trigger a new push upwards. However, the presence of a CME futures gap near $110,000, a level the price has tended to revisit, means there is still the possibility of a short-term dip.

Andrew Bailey, the guy at the top of the UK’s central bank, now says the future of money might not run through commercial banks anymore. Writing in the Financial Times , Andrew said it would be “wrong to be against stablecoins as a matter of principle,” giving a clear nod to crypto’s growing role in payments. That’s not something you hear every day from a central banker whose job is to keep the old system alive. Stablecoins, according to Andrew, can push innovation forward, especially in payment systems, both inside the country and across borders. This is a big change from the same man who once treated crypto like a ticking time bomb. Now, he’s cracking open the door, signaling that these coins might play a real role in the economy, not just in the crypto casino. But there’s a catch: public trust has to come first. Bailey targets stablecoins used for real-world payments Andrew said he’s only interested in stablecoins that actually do something in the real economy. Not the ones you use to hop in and out of trading platforms or meme coins. He wants coins that are used at scale for everyday payments and settling financial stuff, not tokens just floating around for fun. Those don’t count as money in his book, and he made that crystal clear. For any stablecoin to be taken seriously, Andrew said the assets backing them must be risk-free. No debt, no shaky loans, no gambling with interest rates. He’s talking zero exposure to credit or exchange rate swings. If the value isn’t stable, it’s not a stablecoin. And that’s not even the whole story. He warned that even risk-free assets can’t stop cyber attacks. So, if these coins want trust, they’ll need their own kind of insurance system, just like bank deposits have. And if something goes wrong, their users should be treated like priority creditors in any blowup. That means no rug pulls, no back-of-the-line drama. The law should back them. He also called out the current way many stablecoins work. Their terms of exchange? All over the place. Some depend on sketchy crypto exchanges, with users left at the mercy of confusing fine print. Andrew said that has to change. People must know exactly how to cash in and out, and those terms should be the same for everyone, every time. BoE plans full stablecoin regime and questions lending model Andrew took it further. He said the UK needs to rethink how money and credit are tied together. Right now, banks hold deposits and use them to hand out loans. That system, known as fractional reserve banking, means your money doesn’t just sit there; it fuels lending across the economy. But if stablecoins start handling the money part, who’s going to handle the lending? He said it’s possible to separate money from credit. Let stablecoins focus on payments, and let non-banks step up on loans. That’s not how the system works today, but Andrew said it could happen. Still, he warned that this shouldn’t be rushed. The UK needs to study how this plays out, especially during economic ups and downs. That’s the only way to avoid crashing the system while trying to improve it. Andrew admitted the technology behind stablecoins is new, but the question isn’t. He said the Bank of England has always asked how to keep money and lending connected. Without that link, economies don’t run. To move forward, the Bank of England is putting together a consultation paper. It’ll drop in the coming months and will lay out the rules for any stablecoin that wants to operate at scale. That includes daily payments or settling tokenized financial markets. One major idea: giving big-name UK stablecoins access to BoE accounts. That would make them look and act more like money backed by the state. Andrew said this will be a critical part of building a new system, one that lets the UK use what stablecoins offer without tearing apart the whole structure. The balance?

Analysts Note Interesting Rotation Toward Cheaper Crypto at $0.035 and With Better Tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-cardano-ada-price-crashing-analysts-note-interesting-rotation-toward-cheaper-crypto-at-0-035-and-with-better-tech/,"Cardano (ADA) is under more selling pressure, with massive whale outflows and waning ecosystem traction driving it lower. This decline is less to do with Cardano (ADA) specifically, and more to do with the growing demand for far more advanced competition which is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at a mere $0.035 in phase 6 of its well over 50% presale sellout, Mutuum Finance is being hailed as a next-generation DeFi platform that outshines older blockchains like Cardano both in utility and innovation. With more than 16,670 holders already on board and more than $16.6 million raised pre-launch, whales and early adopters are now rotating into Mutuum Finance as the brighter, more forward-thinking choice. Legacy alts like ADA are being undermined by projects that are bringing real world financial solutions, and Mutuum Finance is leading the charge. Cardano (ADA) at Greater Downside Risk as Key Support Levels Come into Play Cardano (ADA) is under significant selling pressure, with its value now testing a major demand zone at $0.78. While a short-term relief rally into the $0.87–$0.89 supply zone appears certain, analysts warn that any failure of the retest could see sellers in control pushing the token down to the next major demand zone at $0.64. Traders are closely following this reversal of support/resistance, as a definitive break could spell further correction and long-lasting bearish trend. As ADA’s technical market worsen, investors are considering alternative prospects in the market, including newer project Mutuum Finance that is showing better growth potential and more advanced utility. Mutuum Finance Registers Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains popular during Phase 6 of its presale, where it has onboarded more than 16,670 investors, and over $16.6 million. Such heightened activity is evidence of the burgeoning faith in the long-term vision of the project and the promise of shaping the future of decentralized finance. In a continued commitment to security and openness, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Developers and security engineers are invited to find vulnerabilities in four levels of severity, critical, major, minor, and low. This is part of Mutuum’s broader efforts to secure its infrastructure and gain the trust of its expanding community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Optimized Efficiency Mutuum Finance protocol is a real-time, algorithmic floating interest rate system that adapts dynamically to liquidity levels. Borrowing expenses are lowered during times of high liquidity to incentivize lending and new capital inflows. Borrowing expenses increase when there’s low liquidity, in turn incentivizing new deposits and loan repayments. This process of self-equilibrium discourages over-leveraging and promotes overall ecosystem balance. Efficiency is supplemented by collateral optimisation, particularly for correlated assets. Positions that are well-collateralised have higher borrowing power and improved Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, while reserve factors act as a buffer against market uncertainty. More volatile assets possess higher reserve requirements to limit exposure to volatility, while lower-volatility assets allow more borrowing with less liquidation risk. LTV ratios and liquidation points are dynamically determined according to each token’s own volatility profile, spreading the risk evenly across the platform. With its strong presale success, advanced risk management mechanism, and unshakeable commitment to security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming a reliable and sustainable platform for long-term adoption, growth, and prosperity in the decentralized finance space. Why Smart Money Is Placing Its Bets in MUTM Over Cardano Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is among the leading next-gen DeFi projects in 2025, having raised more than $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and selling more than 50% of Phase 6 presale for $0.035 per token. With Cardano (ADA) facing selling pressure and declining whale demand, MUTM offers real-world utility through its dual lending platform, dynamic LTV mechanism, and secure oracle-driven infrastructure, attracting the attention of retail and institutional investors. Those looking for high-upside, utility-focused crypto exposure should invest in MUTM tokens before the presale ends.

Currently available at just $0.0015, despite a Batch 30 price of $0.03, it offers an attractive entry point for investors asking what crypto to invest in. Beyond presale strength, BlockDAG is capturing attention with its sponsorship of the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team, a strategy that connects blockchain with global sports, fan culture, and media exposure. In contrast, VeChain continues to expand enterprise utility through its “Renaissance” roadmap, targeting governance, staking, and cross-chain upgrades. This article compares the two approaches to help identify the best crypto to buy now. BlockDAG: Sponsorship as Strategic Differentiation BlockDAG’s partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team provides it with a visibility advantage that few Layer-1 protocols can match. Formula 1® is broadcast to hundreds of millions worldwide, cutting across cultures and markets, and aligning with Alpine places BlockDAG at the center of a sport built on precision and innovation. This deal is not just about putting a logo on a car. It brings blockchain into live experiences like fan engagement zones, interactive racing simulators, and on-site activations that let audiences explore decentralized technology in a tangible way. Beyond the spectacle, BlockDAG is using the partnership to showcase its technical strengths. Web3-powered fan zones, digital applications, and developer hackathons keep blockchain utility front and center, reinforcing that the project is more than marketing. It is delivering cultural branding and technical credibility in a single package. For investors deciding what crypto to invest in, this combination matters. Many popular crypto coins rely solely on speculative hype, while BlockDAG is anchoring its narrative to both presale momentum and mainstream visibility. With nearly $415 million raised and 26.5 billion coins sold, the project has already demonstrated scale. The Alpine collaboration adds global trust, positioning BlockDAG as a standout growth story heading into 2025. VeChain: Enterprise Utility & Roadmap Execution VeChain has long been associated with enterprise solutions, particularly in supply-chain management. Its recently unveiled “Renaissance” roadmap sets the stage for network improvements, including governance upgrades, staking enhancements, refined economic design, and stronger cross-chain interoperability. These updates are intended to solidify VeChain’s role as a blockchain partner for businesses seeking efficiency and transparency. While VeChain’s enterprise focus remains relevant, its price action tells a different story. VET has been range-bound around US$0.023–0.025, showing only modest monthly gains. Technical analysts suggest that a breakout will require stronger catalysts, such as new global partnerships or significant media attention. For now, VeChain’s growth story is rooted in incremental progress rather than the wide-scale visibility that sponsorships like BlockDAG’s Alpine partnership can deliver. Among popular crypto coins, VeChain remains a utility-driven option, but investors seeking rapid narrative traction may find it less compelling than sponsorship-backed rivals. Sponsorship vs Enterprise Utility: Two Strategic Paths The contrast between BlockDAG and VeChain underscores two very different strategies in blockchain growth. BlockDAG is using sponsorship as a multiplier, bringing its brand to millions of sports fans, strengthening mainstream credibility, and linking blockchain with performance culture. This strategy prioritizes visibility, trust, and adoption through media reach and experiential marketing. VeChain, by comparison, is continuing to refine its enterprise-ready technology stack. Its strength lies in utility and roadmap execution rather than consumer-facing branding. While this provides long-term value, it does not generate the same immediate attention that sponsorship deals bring. For investors considering what crypto to invest in, the choice depends on whether one values exposure and momentum or enterprise partnerships and stability. Conclusion BlockDAG and VeChain illustrate two different strategies for blockchain adoption. BlockDAG is leveraging its BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team sponsorship to build visibility, trust, and cultural relevance while pairing that with major crypto presale traction. Having raised nearly $415 million, sold 26.5 billion coins, and delivered a 2900% ROI since Batch 1, it has quickly become one of the popular crypto coins with clear upside potential in 2025. VeChain, supported by its Renaissance roadmap, continues to focus on enterprise-grade blockchain use cases across supply chains and institutional adoption. However, its modest price action and limited mainstream visibility keep it from commanding the same attention. For investors weighing what crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG’s mix of presale strength and global branding stands out.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data The move added roughly $1 billion to Tether’s holdings and pushed the firm’s Bitcoin stash to about $9.8 billion based on the market price. It was one of the biggest single top-ups to its BTC balance this year. Quarter-End Buying Pattern Based on reports, the timing of the buy was not random. Blockchain records show Tether has made similar quarter-end additions in September 2024, December 2024, and March 2025. Analysts say the pattern points to a deliberate effort to bolster reserves ahead of public attestations. Tether’s second-quarter attestation listed close to $9 billion in Bitcoin. The next official report is expected in late October and will show whether recent purchases are reflected on paper. A One-Time Transfer And Wider Moves The transfer from Bitfinex highlights close ties between the exchange and the company behind USDT. Activity like this has drawn attention because of the size and the source. In June, Tether also routed roughly $1.4 billion worth of BTC to Twenty One Capital, which is run by CEO Jack Mallers. That deal fed talk that Tether might reallocate some reserves into other assets, including gold, but CEO Paolo Ardoino pushed back on those claims and said Bitcoin remains central to the company’s plan. US Push And New Stablecoin Tether is also expanding in the US. The firm has set up a domestic branch led by Bo Hines, who previously advised the White House on crypto policy. Reports say Tether is planning a federally compliant stablecoin called USAT as part of that effort. The move suggests the company wants a bigger foothold inside US regulatory frameworks while keeping its global operations intact. USDT Growth And Market Role Crypto trackers show USDT’s circulating supply at roughly $175 billion, a 10% rise over the last quarter. That growth underscores the stablecoin’s role as a go-to dollar proxy for traders and DeFi users. With more USDT in circulation, exchanges and liquidity pools rely on it heavily during sharp market moves.

Attestations are meant to build confidence, but critics still press for clearer transparency on how reserves are managed. Markets will be watching the late-October report closely. If Tether’s filings match on-chain activity, that could calm some concerns. If they do not, scrutiny is likely to grow.

This move has already sparked talk about whether history is about to repeat itself with another “Uptober.” Over the past four years, October has been Shib’s best month, averaging a massive 213% gain. With that track record, many are wondering if this month’s Shiba Inu price prediction could play out the same way. Back in 2021, SHIB exploded more than 833% in just one month , setting one of its wildest runs ever. While moves like that are rare, October still stands out as a strong month, with a median return of +8.2%. By contrast, September usually closes in the red, and November can be shaky too. Source: Shiba Inu Monthly Returns / CryptoRank Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Drops to $0.0000118, Lowest Level Since June SHIB price hit $0.0000118 in August, the lowest level since June, before bouncing again, and is currently trading at 0.00001231 at the time of writing. It’s showing initial signs of a potential bullish reversal after a decline below a major support level in a false breakdown. Source: SHIBUSD / TradingView Shiba Inu (SHIB) is finally pushing for a breakout from its falling channel after weeks of grinding lower. Kicking off October with a 5% pump, price is now testing the $0.0000123 zone right at the channel’s upper trendline. If SHIB pulls it off and history repeats, momentum could carry it toward $0.0000136 and $0.0000159, with the bigger bullish target sitting near $0.0000180. The RSI has already climbed above 60, MACD is flipping positive, and trading volume is up 20% with a market cap of around $200M. All signs point to a solid setup, and Shiba Inu still holds its spot as one of the most recognizable meme coins out there. Did SHIB Lose Steam And Already Have Its Time? Maxi Doge Has the Answer With all these downsides over the years, SHIB still holds the crown as the second biggest memecoin in the market. Many challengers like Pepe, Bonk, and even the official Trump memecoin have tried to take that spot, but none have managed to surpass Shiba’s market cap. The problem is that Shiba Inu’s massive market cap limits price prediction and the kind of gains investors can realistically expect, and unlike Dogecoin, it has been slipping to lower levels year after year since 2021. Dog-themed memecoins tend to spark big hype and often lead the market, but traders usually chase the fresh plays instead of sticking with the OGs. That’s exactly where Maxi Doge comes in. Its presale has already smashed past $2.6M, bringing a jacked-up “gym bro” Doge vibe to the scene while keeping things simple with meme-first culture. Add staking at up to 128 % APY, community contests, and no insider allocations, and Maxi Doge is shaping up as the next big dog-theme coin that traders are eyeing.

52524418,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85011,1759334725,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s What Price History Says about XRP In Q4,https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-price-history-says-about-xrp-in-q4/,"When it comes to cryptocurrency markets, certain patterns emerge that shape investor sentiment and trading strategies. For XRP, one quarter in particular stands out above the rest: the final three months of the year. Time and again, Q4 has delivered some of the asset’s most dramatic rallies, leaving a lasting imprint on its historical performance. Understanding why this quarter has proven so significant offers valuable insight into XRP’s price behavior and its broader market dynamics. XRP’s Historical Quarterly Pattern A recent chart shared by Xoom on X provides a comprehensive breakdown of XRP’s quarterly returns in USD from 2013 through 2025. The data reveals a striking tendency for outsized gains in Q4 compared to other quarters. While XRP has experienced positive and negative swings across all timeframes, the year-end period consistently stands out, marked by several explosive rallies that dominate its price history. Historically speaking, XRP has had its biggest gains in Q4. pic.twitter.com/WLNHFvEoVB — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) September 30, 2025 The evidence is clear: although volatility defines XRP across all quarters, the fourth quarter has been the scene of its most memorable surges, with some years recording triple- and even quadruple-digit returns. Outliers That Define the Narrative Upon closer examination of the data, it’s clear that Q4’s reputation is disproportionately influenced by a handful of standout years. For example, XRP posted a staggering 1,064% return in Q4 2017 and an even larger 426% gain in Q4 2014. These outliers significantly raise the average performance for the quarter. However, averages alone can be misleading. In some years, like 2018 and 2020, XRP’s Q4 performance resulted in losses, highlighting the quarter’s unpredictability. This means that while Q4 is capable of generating blockbuster gains, not every year follows the same pattern. The median performance paints a more balanced picture, showing that big winners are less frequent but powerful enough to shape perceptions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Q4 Matters for XRP Several factors help explain why Q4 has been so impactful for XRP. First, year-end market behavior often reflects institutional portfolio adjustments, tax-related trading strategies, and liquidity cycles. In crypto specifically, Q4 has historically coincided with periods of heightened retail interest, speculative rallies, and major industry announcements. For XRP, Ripple’s quarterly disclosures, ecosystem milestones, and global payment-related developments have often landed toward the end of the year, fueling momentum. The alignment of macro market activity with project-specific catalysts helps explain why XRP tends to see its largest price shifts in this window. What Investors Should Take Away The data from Xoom underscores a valuable lesson: history shows that Q4 has been XRP’s most promising quarter, but these gains are not guaranteed. Traders and investors should avoid assuming that past rallies will automatically repeat. Instead, the seasonality should be used as context — a reminder that significant moves are possible, but risk management remains essential. In conclusion, XRP’s history proves that Q4 is a quarter of opportunity, defined by both its greatest rallies and sharp corrections. As the final quarter of 2025 unveils, Xoom’s chart serves as a reminder of its price volatility and potential for significant movement. While past results do not dictate future performance, the data makes one thing clear: when it comes to XRP, the last quarter of the year is the one to watch.

This is the first government shutdown since 2018, and the second under President Donald Trump’s presidency. The last shutdown in the U.S. lasted a record 35 days — from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. The Republican Party controls both chambers of Congress, but 60 votes are required to pass a bill in the Senate, so a resolution was impossible without Democratic support. According to NBC News , the two sides were unable to agree on a bipartisan compromise: senators rejected both the Republican and Democratic versions of the legislation just hours before the deadline. It’s unclear how long the government shutdown will last. Democrats are demanding increased healthcare funding, including continued Obamacare subsidies, while Republicans insist they won’t allow themselves to be held “hostage,” the publication noted. As a result, according to the Congressional Budget Office, approximately 750,000 federal workers are being furloughed without pay, while others, including Transportation Security Administration agents, air traffic controllers, federal law enforcement officers, and military personnel must continue working without pay. All are expected to receive compensation once the government reopens. Covering salaries during the shutdown is estimated to cost taxpayers about $400 million. Trump previously hinted that he might fire “many” federal employees during the shutdown. The White House is counting on Democrats to shoulder responsibility. “It will be difficult for Democrats to explain why they won’t agree to a ‘clean’ bill to keep the government open,” an administration official said. At the same time, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans: “Republicans are plunging America into a shutdown—by rejecting bipartisan negotiations, pushing a partisan bill, and risking the American healthcare system above all else. They must sit down with Democrats to pass a bipartisan bill.” The official order to suspend federal operations was issued by White House Budget Director Russell Vought. In a memorandum, he noted: “ It’s unclear how long Democrats will maintain their unacceptable position, making it difficult to predict the duration of the shutdown .” Furthermore, a New York Times/Siena poll found that 26% of Americans blame Trump and Republicans, 19% blame Democrats, 33% blame both parties, and 21% were undecided. According to Marist University, 38% blame Republicans, 27% blame Democrats, and 31% blame both parties. What Triggered The Shutdown The immediate trigger was the Senate’s 60‑vote threshold for a continuing resolution, which neither party’s proposal could clear after hours of negotiations and failed votes. Democrats pushed for additional healthcare funding, including Affordable Care Act subsidies, while Republicans sought a clean stopgap without policy riders. With both partisan plans failing close to the deadline, the Office of Management and Budget initiated contingency plans: furloughs for non‑essential personnel and unpaid work for essential staff, with back pay expected after reopening. How Long Will It Last The duration depends on whether leaders pivot to a narrow, date‑certain continuing resolution that omits contentious policy riders and can attract at least 60 votes in the Senate. Historically, shutdowns have ranged from brief pauses to multi‑week standoffs, and longer gaps compound service delays, backlogs, and broader economic costs. Early impacts include widespread furloughs, essential staff working without pay, and escalating operational disruptions until a bipartisan bridge can be passed.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 16:12:24

Meanwhile, XRP and Solana stood out as they were among the few altcoins that recorded net inflows. Institutions Dump Bitcoin And Ethereum For XRP And Solana A CoinShares report revealed that Bitcoin and Ethereum funds experienced net outflows of $719 million and $409.4 million, respectively, last week. Meanwhile, XRP and Solana recorded net inflows of $93.1 million and $291 million during the same period, highlighting a notable trend among institutional investors . The inflows for XRP and Solana increased from last week, when these assets recorded inflows of $69.4 million and $127.3 million, respectively. Notably, the rotation from Bitcoin and Ethereum to XRP and Solana comes just ahead of the potential approval of spot ETFs for these in the U.S. The SEC is expected to approve the pending XRP and Solana ETF filings, as both altcoins meet the predetermined requirements under the recently approved generic listing standards . Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the approval odds for these funds are now 100% as the generic listing standards leave fund issuers waiting for a green light from the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. The potential approval of the XRP and Solana ETFs is expected to have a positive impact on the XRP and SOL prices, which explains why institutional investors may be looking to gain exposure to these assets ahead of the SEC’s approval. It is worth mentioning that Bitcoin and Ethereum have recorded significant gains since their respective spot ETFs launched in the U.S. last year, which provides a bullish outlook for both XRP and Solana ahead of their ETFs’ launch. Market experts, such as Nate Geraci, have already suggested that the XRP and Solana ETFs could experience significant demand. He also believes that people are severely underestimating the investor demand for XRP and SOL ETFs. SOL May Be The First To Gain Approval Balahunas revealed that the final deadlines for the Solana ETFs come up on October 10, just before the deadline for the XRP ETFs on October 17. As such, the SOL ETFs could get approved before the XRP ETFs , although the SEC may also approve these funds simultaneously. Meanwhile, Geraci alluded to a report stating that next week could be a realistic timeframe for the approval of Solana ETFs. However, Geraci noted that the U.S. government shutdown could “throw [a] wrench in [the] process.” The U.S. government has already shut down, which affects the SEC’s operations and could delay a potential approval if the funding bill isn’t passed soon. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had also earlier warned about the shutdown and how it could complicate the approval process.",Solana|Altcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Eric Balchunas|Ethereum|James Seyffart|Nate Geraci|solana|Solana price|Solana Spot ETFs|US SEC|XRP|XRP Spot ETFs,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|XRP|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 17:00:12

While the bulls are aggressively defending support and pushing toward the $117,000 resistance area, the yet-to-be-filled CME gap hangs over the market. This historical pattern suggests that although the price action is bullish, a mandatory downside move may be required to reset the chart before the target can truly be breached. Gap-Filling Before The Next Big Rally Ezy Bitcoin, in a recent short-term market outlook shared on X, explained that Bitcoin may need to close an existing gap before it can build momentum for its next major rally. However, such a move should not be seen as a weakness but rather as a healthy reset, one that could set the stage for a stronger push upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Higher – Clears Resistance, But Next Barrier Still Looms He referenced the Bitcoin CME Futures chart, where the CrossX indicator highlights unfilled gaps that often act like magnets for price action. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to revisit these areas before resuming its climb, making them a key part of the near-term structure. Over the last five months, Ezy Bitcoin has noted every single gap has been filled, while maintaining a flawless 100% success rate. This consistency adds weight to the likelihood of a short-term retracement before another rally begins, reinforcing his expectation that the pattern will hold. With that in mind, he concluded that a minor pullback could create a valuable opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. Rather than fearing a dip, traders and investors might see it as an entry point before the next strong upward move. Bitcoin Bulls Eye Recovery Momentum Despite Market Pressure According to the latest update from Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin demonstrated a rapid recovery after experiencing a sharp drop. The price briefly fell below the $113,000 mark but quickly managed to bounce back. This swift bounce from this level signals that buyers remain active and willing to step in at key zones, preventing any deeper correction for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $90,000 Level Holds Key To Preventing A New Bear Market, Top Analyst Says Currently, the price is moving upward again, and the immediate challenge is defined by a narrow resistance zone between $114,600 and $114,800. This range is acting as a local ceiling where selling pressure is likely to be concentrated. Overcoming this level is crucial for the continuation of the bullish move. Looking ahead, Crypto VIP Signal emphasized that a successful breakout above the $114,600–$114,800 resistance will open up the path to significantly higher targets between the $116,000 and $117,000 area. A move into this range would solidify the positive momentum and confirm that the recent drop was merely a brief shakeout, allowing the rally to continue.

The token has gained more than 8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 7% over the week. Analysts and traders are watching closely as the network prepares to integrate a new stablecoin. USD1 Stablecoin Launching on Aptos The Aptos Foundation announced that World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin will go live on October 6. The press release, shared with CryptoPotato , confirmed that Aptos will become the first Move-based blockchain to support USD1, a design that stems from Meta’s Libra project and is built for large-scale financial use. At launch, USD1 will be supported across Aptos DeFi protocols such as Echelon, Hyperion, Thala, and Tapp. Wallets and exchanges, including Petra, Backpack, OKX, OneKey, Bitget Wallet, Nightly, and Gate Wallet, will also enable access. Liquidity pools and incentive programs are set to go live at the same time, ensuring that both institutional and retail users can transact immediately. Price Tests Key Resistance Analyst Lennaert Snyder noted that APT is approaching $4.7 resistance, a level that has capped the price during its long downtrend. He stated, “If we break that, we confirm the reversal on a very long downtrend,” adding that $6.77 is a realistic target with multiple take-profit levels in between. $APT is pumping to key $4.70 resistance as mentioned couple days ago.

They remarked that it is “ getting ready for the massive bullish rally ,” though patience is still required. Their chart projects a potential rally toward the $9.7–$10 range if the wedge breaks. Support remains near $3.9–$4, an area that has repeatedly held during prior pullbacks. On-Chain Metrics Point to Steady Activity Data from Artemis shows daily active addresses on Aptos close to 1 million, within a recent range of 700,000 to 1.2 million. During times of price strength, the address activity has managed to rise. Thus, the latest rise in user and token price activity stands as evidence of renewed interest in the network. Source: Artemis According to DefiLlama, Aptos had its total value locked (TVL) around $739 million and decentralized exchange trading volume above $170 million, as of October 1. Despite declining from those mid-2025 heights, both things are still above all-time lows set in 2023, thus offering evidence of why the ecosystem is being sustained. Source: DefiLlama APT’s test at the $4.7 resistance level comes in unison with increasing on-chain activity and the slated USD1 launch. A breakout in favor of APT would hence indicate the fading away of a long-term downtrend, setting $6.77 and above as the traders’ next engagements.

52526074,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85017,1759338303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple (XRP) Just Gained Bullish Recognition in the United States,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-just-gained-bullish-recognition-in-the-united-states/,"A recent technical move by the SEC has unexpectedly sparked intense discussion throughout the cryptocurrency community. While the agency’s action was a staff-level decision rather than a sweeping rule change, it has opened a crucial door for institutional participation. For Ripple and the XRP ecosystem, the implications are significant enough that many observers are calling the move outright bullish. What Changed: A Crucial SEC Clarification The SEC’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter stating that investment advisers can now use state-chartered trust companies as “qualified custodians” for crypto assets. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, advisers are required to safeguard client assets with a qualified custodian, traditionally, banks or nationally chartered trust companies. This new guidance extends that recognition to state-chartered trust entities, provided advisers conduct proper due diligence and determine the arrangement is in the best interest of their clients. BOOM! Ripple ( $XRP ) just got recognized as a qualified U.S. custodian under new SEC staff guidance Alongside Coinbase, BitGo, and others. The gates are opening. Banks, funds, institutions, come on in. BULLISH ON $XRP ! LFG! https://t.co/bdDzqHFk7A — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 30, 2025 This adjustment may sound narrow, but it resolves a longstanding point of uncertainty. State trust companies were not universally accepted as eligible custodians for crypto, leaving many advisers in limbo. The SEC staff has now offered clarity, reducing friction for custody arrangements without compromising investor protections. Who Benefits: Ripple Among the Recognized Custodians The immediate winners from this clarification are firms that already operate state-chartered trust platforms. Coinbase Custody, BitGo Trust, and Ripple’s Standard Custody & Trust Company now fall squarely within the definition of acceptable custodians. Ripple entered this space through its acquisition of Standard Custody, giving the company a direct foothold in the U.S. institutional custody market. With this recognition, Ripple is now on the same regulatory footing as other established players, a milestone that industry observers believe could dramatically expand its institutional relevance. Why It Matters: Unlocking Institutional Flows For institutions, custody is not optional — it is the regulatory gatekeeper for market access. Registered investment advisers, funds, and exchange-traded products cannot hold crypto assets without a qualified custodian. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 By explicitly acknowledging state-chartered trust companies, the SEC staff has effectively widened the pool of service providers, creating a clearer path for institutions to custody crypto assets at scale. This is why commentators like X Finance Bull highlighted Ripple’s position, framing the development as “bullish” for XRP. With Standard Custody under its wing, Ripple now sits among the limited set of firms positioned to serve as custodians for institutional crypto flows. That recognition strengthens its infrastructure role in the U.S. market and could accelerate adoption. Important Caveats: Guidance, Not a Green Light It’s essential to note that the SEC’s move is staff guidance, not a new law or blanket approval. Advisers still carry the responsibility of vetting custodians and ensuring client protection. The SEC can also revisit or refine its position. This development removes uncertainty, making it easier for institutions to engage, but it doesn’t automatically grant Ripple or other custodians a license. The Bottom Line The SEC’s no-action letter may not grab headlines like a landmark court ruling, but its practical effects are significant. Reducing custody barriers gives firms like Ripple a clearer runway to serve institutional clients. This development is a significant acknowledgment of XRP’s legitimacy in the U.S. market, leading many, including X Finance Bull, to view it as a major bullish signal for Ripple and XRP.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/jpmorgans-mining-report-bitcoin-mining-companies-reach-record-market-value-here-are-the-details/,"According to a report published by JPMorgan, the total market value of 14 publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies in the US reached a historic high of $56 billion in September. JPMorgan: US Bitcoin Mining Companies Market Value Hits Record $56 Billion This marks the first time the sector has surpassed the $50 billion threshold. The report revealed a 43% month-over-month increase in market value. According to the data, 12 of the 14 companies examined outperformed Bitcoin's own price in September. During the same period, the Bitcoin network's average hash rate rose by 9% to 1,031 EH/s. This suggests that while the network's security has strengthened, mining competition has also intensified. However, increased competition has negatively impacted miners' profitability. According to a JPMorgan report, miners' daily block reward revenue decreased by 10% in September compared to the previous month. Miners' gross profit also fell by 17%. Experts say this rapid growth in mining companies' market capitalization reflects investor interest, but the pressure on revenues could pose a sustainability risk.

It holds over $421 million in SOL, ranking as the third-largest public Solana treasury. Its positions have already yielded a 156% return, translating into a 140% surge in share price. The move underscores a broader corporate shift, with institutions increasingly adopting crypto treasury strategies, positioning SOL for deeper adoption as digital assets enter mainstream balance sheets. Something which could accelerate in the coming weeks with the U.S. CLARITY Act, which stands to unlock sidelined capital from institutions waiting on regulatory clarity. Solana Price Prediction: Could Institutions Push Solana to $500? While Upexi’s expansion alone may not spark major demand, ongoing institutional support could give Solana the strength to break free from a 6-month ascending wedge pattern, now nearing its apex. The latest retest of wedge support has prompted a sharp bounce, with momentum indicators pointing toward renewed strength. SOL / USD 1-day chart, rising wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. The RSI has made a sharp recovery, reclaiming the neutral line at 50, an indication that buyers are controlling the current market move. The MACD histogram adds weight to the move, tracking towards a golden cross above the signal line, often an early sign of a lasting uptrend. The key threshold for a breakout sits around $300 , Solana’s early-year high. Flipping this level into support would validate a potential 130% rally to $500 . As the bull market matures further, macro and regulatory catalysts could add fuel to the move. With potential spot ETFs on the table this month and U.S. interest rate cuts fueling risk appetite, the Solana price could rally as high as $1,000 , a 350% gain from current levels.

Among the new apps that will be supported are WhatsApp and X. The company said WhatsApp users will be able to use not just SMS and MMS messages in remote locations, but even live voice and video chats. T-Mobile President of Marketing, Innovation and Experience Mike Katz said, “Now we’re taking it up a notch and bringing essential phone apps and services into the mix – giving people access to the apps they need most, in places they’ve never had a signal before. It’s a game-changer for safety, peace of mind, and the freedom to stay connected virtually anywhere.” It started with texting. Now, we're leveling up: T-Satellite is powering apps people rely on — WhatsApp, AllTrails, AccuWeather, Google Maps, X & more — outside coverage areas on most modern cell phones. This is the next phase of connectivity! — Mike Katz (@Mike_Katz) October 1, 2025 Previously, T-Satellite, which was launched in July, supported apps such as Google Messages, Apple Music, Weather, Fitness, and Samsung’s Weather app. Now it has added WhatsApp, X, AccuWeather, and AllTrials, among others. The network is included at no extra charge For T-Satellite customers, the phone automatically switches to the satellite network the moment a terrestrial signal drops. When customers open a satellite-ready app, it will provide critical services rather than full data-heavy experiences. The network is included at no extra charge with T-Mobile’s new “Experience Beyond” plan . For others, including AT&T and Verizon, the service can be added for $10 a month. According to Jeff Giard, Vice President of Strategic Partnerships and Product Innovation, the framework for the App Store and the Play Store now enables apps to adopt SAT mode through an application programming interface. T-Mobile is working to get more app developers to activate it. “I think people are excited about the fact that the phone in their pocket can actually connect to outer space and that they get basically a satellite phone without having to buy extra equipment,” Giard said. Besides applications, T-Mobile announced that it is set to support the satellite mobile data feature on 17 additional devices, including several Samsung Galaxy phones. A spec sheet from the carrier shows the models included. But Jeff Giard, T-Mobile’s VP for Strategic Partnerships, said more models will receive access once their manufacturers properly roll out the required software updates. Spacecoin delivers data into space to compete with Starlink. In other news, the US startup Spacecoin has said that it has successfully sent secured information through space in what it said was a first for the industry, as the firm tries to show it can offer an alternative to Starlink’s satellite internet service. Tae Oh, the founder of Spacecoin, stated that the company aims to reach people in areas where internet access is slow, blocked, or prohibitively expensive. However, unlike Starlink, which is owned by SpaceX and has a single entity controlling the network, Spacecoin aims to build a decentralized system that anyone can join. Oh said that the test was meant to show that data on a blockchain, which is the protected record behind cryptocurrencies and other digital services, could leave Earth, go through an orbiting satellite, and come back without any damage. In the test, which was done with Bulgarian microsatellite maker EnduroSat, Spacecoin’s data went more than 7,000 km by satellite from Chile to the Azores. “Beyond end users, we are also targeting builders – such as developers, telecom companies, NGOs, and infrastructure partners,” Oh said. He added, “For people using the internet, this means the information or payments they send through the network can’t be faked, changed, or intercepted by bad actors.” The US bank J.P. Morgan was the first to test blockchain payments between satellites, but Spacecoin’s is the first exchange to bypass terrestrial internet entirely. However, compared to Starlink’s 8,000 satellites, Spacecoin is still a very small player.

While XRP’s price is stuck around significant levels of support and its bullish targets are greatly dependent on regulatory milestones and institutional onboarding, Mutuum Finance is grabbing investors’ attention with a completely different value proposition. Sold out over 50% presale at the low price of just $0.035 in phase 6, the project is building a full decentralized lending ecosystem. With over 16,670 holders already on board and over $16.6 million raised in presale, whale activity around Mutuum Fnance is on the rise. This initial momentum, along with practical utility and a deflationary token economics framework, is fueling projections that MUTM is likely to outperform XRP returns substantially, and perhaps redefine DeFi investment approaches in 2025. XRP Price Experiences Bearish Setup as Market Awaits Decisive Breakdown or Rebound As Ripple (XRP) remains at the forefront of cross-border payments, the short-term direction of its price is being ever more closely held. Technical analysts warn a bearish descending triangle chart pattern is forming, which indicates possible near-term bear pressure. A close below $2.70 could trigger a large sell-off, and panic buying would propel the price potentially to the $2.00 support zone. For bulls to pick up momentum, XRP must recapture resistance levels of $2.95 and $3.05, though frailty in wider altcoin and Bitcoin markets indicates comeback will not be easy. And even though long-term fundamentals are strong, short-term uncertainty is leading investors to seek alternative opportunities, with utility-driven project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly on the radar as part of diversified 2025 strategies. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Surges Mutuum Finance is generating increasing hype and momentum around its presale, with the platform already having raised over $16.6 million with over 16,670 investors participating so far. The project is now at Stage 6, with MUTM tokens being priced at $0.035 per token. As a bonus for early adoption, Mutuum Finance is conducting a $100,000 giveaway, where 10 users will each get $10,000 of MUTM tokens. As part of continuous security and transparency efforts, Mutuum Finance collaborated with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. This program rewards white-hat hackers and security researchers for discovering bugs in the protocol’s codebase. Bugs are marked by severity as minor, low, major, or critical, and respective rewards are paid out to contributors. The protocol is designed to maintain a dynamic floating interest rate regime that distributes liquidity optimally. During periods of excess liquidity, low interest rates compensate for borrowing and ecosystem activity and increased demand and higher interest rates compensate for loan repayment and new capital inflows. Fixed interest mechanisms do best when liquidity is stable, automatically responding to broader market forces. Being a fully decentralized system, Mutuum Finance grants governance powers to MUTM token holders. Lending and borrowing are isolated from the rest of the system, supported by an interest rate mechanism that optimizes long-term efficiency, promotes portfolio diversification, and grows in proportion to growth in the overall DeFi market. Accurate asset valuation is required for effective profitable lending, borrowing, and liquidation. To this end, Mutuum Finance integrates Chainlink oracles to access real-time USD and leading crypto asset information such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform enhances the accuracy of data with fallback oracle methods, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages derived from decentralized exchanges to ensure accurate valuations in the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. With a rapidly growing community, strong presale performance, and focus on good security and risk management, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the leading players of decentralized finance in the future. High-Upside Opportunity for 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up pace in 2025, raising more than $16.6 million from 16,670+ investors, with Phase 6 more than 50% sold at $0.035 per token. With peer-to-peer and pooled lending, a USD-backed stablecoin, and solid risk management, MUTM presents real utility and high-upside potential. Lock in your tokens now before presale closes.

The advisory emphasized caution and asked users to avoid any prompts originating from the account during the incident window. Update: CZ later said access was restored and estimated the attacker’s take at about $13,000, noting that security teams were still probing potential know‑your‑customer factors. He added that the attacker exposed themselves to criminal liability for relatively limited gains compared with building legitimate products. Phishing Mechanics And Account Recovery The attackers posted messages with phishing links urging users to connect their wallets via WalletConnect, a common lure in social engineering campaigns against crypto communities. BNB Chain reiterated, “ Do not connect your wallet ,” as teams coordinated with X to restrict access, remove malicious content, and submit takedown requests for associated phishing domains. One widely circulated post featured “$4 for a meme,” a wallet address, and an image of CZ—an example of how low‑effort baits can still drive high‑risk clicks when paired with brand trust and urgency cues. A Broader Pattern Of Social Media Compromises The incident adds to a run of account takeovers targeting high‑profile organizations. In 2024, the MicroStrategy account on X was used to push a fake airdrop; later that year, multiple popular accounts were hijacked to advertise a scam token that reportedly failed to generate profits. OpenAI’s press office account was also compromised to promote a fake token. In January 2025, a Nasdaq account was used to promote the STONKS coin, whose market cap spiked to tens of millions before collapsing—illustrating how briefly viral promotions can trap unsuspecting users. Practical takeaways: never sign messages or connect wallets from social posts; verify announcements via official sites or multiple trusted channels; and assume urgency or giveaway framing is a red flag. For brands, enforce hardware‑key authentication, least‑privilege access, 24/7 alerting, and pre‑authorized takedown pathways with platforms to compress incident response times.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|REGULATION|AIRDROP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 17:30:47

Trader EtherNasyional, followed by more than 26,000 users on X, shared a chart revealing that DOGE may be repeating the same setup seen before its 2017 and 2021 breakouts . If history repeats, the next major rally could already be underway. The parabolic run of $DOGE is inevitable. Dogecoin hasn't actually pumped up in the current cycle yet. pic.twitter.com/uy0rHaXTrx — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) September 29, 2025 After months of downward pressure, Dogecoin has broken out above a key trendline, signaling a confirmed reversal that has historically preceded major rallies and new all-time highs. This breakout has already occurred during the current cycle, opening the door for DOGE to explore uncharted price territory in the weeks ahead. What’s more, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appears to have bottomed out – just like it did before previous explosive runs – setting the stage for the next leg up in Dogecoin’s bullish trajectory. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Volumes Rise After Trend Line Support Bounce In the past 24 hours, DOGE has delivered a 6% gain, and trading volumes have jumped to 7% of the token’s circulating supply at $2.6 billion. This uptick comes after the token bounced off a key trend line support that is in confluence with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). This increases the technical relevance of this level while trading volumes confirm that buying pressure has increased. As a result, DOGE could soon retest the upper bound of its rising wedge pattern near $0.32. But if EtherNasyonal’s historical pattern analysis plays out, a sharper rally toward $0.40 could follow – with $1 firmly on the horizon. This sets up a potential 322% gain for Dogecoin in the near term. Beyond DOGE, top meme coins and early-stage presales could offer even greater upside now that altcoin season is underway. One standout is Maxi Doge ($MAXI), which has already attracted over $2 million in funding and is being positioned by investors as a 10X contender this cycle. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Plans to Leverage Its Way Out of Mom’s Basement Meet Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an Ethereum dog-themed meme coin that fully embraces the energy that bull markets bring along. Instead of promising utility, this Shiba Inu uses 1000X leverage to turn its retail budget into a bazooka that can compete with whales’ firepower. Holding $MAXI also allows holders to participate in a thriving community where traders can share strategies , signals , and ideas to earn attractive rewards and some bragging rights. Up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will be deployed into the most promising tokens of this cycle. These leveraged positions will yield some extra income to the $MAXI community and will boost the token’s value once they start to pay off. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the Maxi Doge official website and connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

The Supreme Court has refused Trump’s demand to remove her now, choosing instead to hear full arguments next year. This delays what the former president hoped would be an instant firing, and leaves Lisa sitting in a powerful seat he wants to take control of. Trump’s Department of Justice tried to rush it. On September 18, they filed an emergency request to throw out a federal court’s block on Lisa’s removal. That block came earlier this month from U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb. Cobb said Trump’s claim, that Lisa committed mortgage fraud, didn’t meet the Federal Reserve Act’s “for cause” requirement for firing someone from the Fed. And that word “cause”? It’s of course pretty vague. The law says Fed governors serve 14-year terms unless they’re removed “for cause,” but it doesn’t spell out what that means. Courts have taken it to mean clear things like inefficiency, neglect, or corruption, not political beefs. The White House isn’t letting it go. They appealed Cobb’s ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, hoping for a reversal. No luck. On September 15, in a 2–1 decision, the appeals court also sided against Trump. So, blocked twice. Trump admin pushes fraud claim to get back at the Fed A White House spokesperson allegedly said on Wednesday that “President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.” He added, “We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.” Lisa is fighting back. She told the Court last Thursday that letting Trump remove her now would do serious damage, not just to her, but to the Fed itself. Her lawyers wrote in a filing: “Granting the President’s request for immediate relief to alter the status quo would sound the death knell for the central-bank independence that has helped make the United States’ economy the strongest in the world.” They also warned that unless the president’s powers are checked, “any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed.” In other words, no one would be safe. Lisa, who was appointed by President Biden, is still doing her job. She showed up at the Fed’s policy meeting last week, cast her vote, and helped approve a 25 basis-point rate cut. She’ll likely be present at the next two meetings in late October and December unless the Court suddenly changes course, which is unlikely before January.

General Motors matched rival Ford’s quarterly performance but credited its results to a mix of gas-powered and electric vehicles rather than hybrids. General Motors said its pickup trucks, like the Chevrolet Silverado, and its full-size SUVs, such as the GMC Yukon, drove much of the increase and are on pace to lead the auto industry by the end of 2025. The company also highlighted a surge in electric vehicle demand before the expiration of the federal EV tax credit. General Motors recorded 66,501 electric vehicles sold in Q3, which is more than double Ford’s EV total in the same period. Its year-to-date U.S. EV sales hit 144,668, up 105% from a year ago. The automaker stated that the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the bestselling non-Tesla electric vehicle in the country for Q3. Cadillac contributed three of the ten top-selling luxury EVs in the U.S. so far this year. General Motors drives EV sales while gas vehicles hold ground General Motors is also working to preserve the federal EV tax credit for leased vehicles by having its finance unit sign deals on existing inventory and passing the savings to customers. The company confirmed it is using this method to maintain affordability for buyers while moving more electric vehicles ahead of tighter tax credit rules. The automaker’s Q3 data shows strength across more than just electric cars. Its crossovers posted record numbers, with the GMC Terrain, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Traverse, and Buick Envista all achieving their best Q3 sales ever. General Motors senior vice president and North America president Duncan Aldred said, “We have the best lineup of ICE and EV vehicles we’ve ever had, and our brands have grown market share with consistently strong pricing, low incentives and inventory.” General Motors also noted its incentives were below the industry average and its inventory levels were on track to meet year-end goals. This indicates that buyers are still turning out for the company’s products even without heavy discounts. The company stands apart from Ford in one major way: it does not sell hybrid vehicles, while Ford reported selling a record 55,000 hybrids. This means General Motors is betting on pure gas-powered models and electric vehicles rather than hybrids, which remain a major part of Ford’s strategy. Unlike Ford, General Motors manufactures more vehicles outside the United States, which makes it subject to a 25% auto sector tariff on those imports. The company has not released specific details on how these tariffs affect profits, but confirmed it will share more about tariffs, its product portfolio, and its financial outlook when it reports full Q3 results on October 21.

It was stated that the funds were transferred to different addresses via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash, and then deposited into Tornado Cash through five instant exchanges. ZachXBT stated that the transfers showed signs of similarity to attacks previously linked to North Korean hacker groups, raising the possibility that the incident was carried out by North Korean-linked hackers.

The global phenomenon Solo Leveling is breaking new ground by coming onchain via Story. In a move that bridges a blockbuster franchise with blockchain, Solo Leveling is exploring the issuance of a tokenized real-world asset (RWA), exploring an entirely new flavor of tokenized RWAs that differs from money market funds, equity offerings, and treasury vehicles that are typically represented in web3. Solo Leveling is working with Story to initiate steps toward onchain representation of select IP elements. This approach is intended to enable onchain programmability for select integrations, opening the door to future fan-driven remixing, blockchain-based experiences, both digital and real world, and next-gen licensing deals. The announcement cements Solo Leveling’s status as a cross-media juggernaut, and as a pioneer in its industry by moving its IP to Web3. Before its Web3 debut, Solo Leveling has already proven itself a cultural titan across multiple formats: Webnovel & Webtoon: Originating as a web novel and adapted as webtoon in Korea, Solo Leveling amassed over 14+ billion views worldwide, 175+ million readers, an unprecedented achievement that solidified it as a flagship Korean series with global influence. It is also the highest grossing webtoon and Korean webnovel in history. Comic Book: The comic adaptation has been a breakout print hit, reaching #1 on the New York Times Graphic Books bestseller list and selling over 10 million copies globally. Anime (Streaming): Solo Leveling’s anime adaptation stormed streaming platforms, becoming the most-watched anime in the history of Crunchyroll and ranking in Netflix’s weekly Top 10 in 11 countries upon debut (and clinching the #1 spot on Amazon Prime Video in Japan). Anime (Awards): The series swept the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards with 9 honors at the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards, including the coveted Anime of the Year, a historic first for a manhwa-based show. Game: The mobile RPG Solo Leveling: ARISE turned the franchise into an interactive experience, grossing approximately $70 million in its first month and attracting 50 million players within five months of launch. The game was number 1 in downloads in 141 countries; number 1 in revenue in 21 countries; and number 1 in App Store popularity rankings across 78 countries. Live Action Series: Netflix is producing a live-action series adaptation of the global phenomenon “Solo Leveling,” with rising star Byeon Woo-seok attached to lead the project as protagonist Sung Jinwook. These feats illustrate Solo Leveling’s unrivaled multi-format success and passionate worldwide fanbase. Now, by venturing onto the blockchain, Solo Leveling is poised to redefine how a modern franchise can engage its community and unlock new value with its content. Webnovel and Webtoon to Web3 Solo Leveling is collaborating with Story, the world’s first blockchain network purpose-built for intellectual property, to begin steps toward onchain IP representation for select elements. Story tokenizes IP and makes it programmable, enabling new models of ownership, remix, and monetization for creators and fans. By onboarding Solo Leveling, Story is effectively aiming to demonstrate onchain representation for one of the world’s highest-value franchises. In practice, this means select elements of the Solo Leveling IP (e.g. characters, universe, and content rights) could be represented onchain and managed through smart contracts. Once on Story, Solo Leveling’s IP would become machine-readable and enforceable onchain, allowing developers and fans to build with it under preset rules. For example, a creator could remix a Solo Leveling character into a game mod with automated royalties flowing back to the IP holders. Licensed merchandise could be tied to onchain provenance, and any third-party game or media using Solo Leveling content could seamlessly implement programmable licensing and revenue splits. In short, Solo Leveling’s move to Story unlocks a playground for community-driven innovation around the franchise, all secured by blockchain. “Korea has always been a global launchpad for intellectual property. Beyond early unique cultural IP from K-pop, K-drama, Korea is leading the way in gaming, webtoons and Hollywood heavy-hitters such as Squid Games and Parasite. Solo Leveling is a perfect example of how Korean IP can transcend borders, dominate every format, and build massive global fandoms. IP shouldn’t just be watched or read, it should be programmable. That means IP that can be tokenized, composable, and monetized across games, AI models, and consumer applications”, said SY Lee, co-founder and CEO of Story. “Registering Solo Leveling’s IP onchain, would unlock the next level of engagement, loyalty, and monetization enabling remix culture, fan-powered economies, and token-native formats that weren’t possible before.” Official Solo Leveling IP-backed Memecoin on the Horizon In a bold crypto-native twist, the Solo Leveling team also revealed plans for an official IP-backed memecoin tied to the story’s universe and characters . This upcoming token (details and launch date TBA) will be directly backed by Solo Leveling’s characters and lore, making it one of the first memecoins anchored by a blockbuster franchise’s IP. Fans will effectively get to “own a piece” of the Solo Leveling saga in token form, a concept that could transform community engagement and fandom in Web3. Unlike typical memecoins that often emerge from internet jokes with no ties to creators, this Solo Leveling coin will be authorized and supported by the IP owners. Built on Story’s infrastructure, it aims to align the token’s value with the franchise’s success: the more the story and its memes spread, the more both fans and creators can benefit. This approach follows a growing recognition that memes and viral content drive immense value (the memecoin market tops $100B), yet creators historically capture little of it. An official Solo Leveling coin would flip that script by channeling cultural hype into a token model designed to align fan engagement with the franchise’s success “Solo Leveling has always been about leveling up, and now we’re looking to level up the franchise with Web3. With Story, we hope to see the IP expand beyond the series itself, which could allow fans and creators to join Solo Leveling’s next chapter in new ways.” – Jungsook Jang, CEO at Redice Studio. Bringing Solo Leveling onchain could mark a watershed moment for Story and the broader concept of tokenized IP. Solo Leveling is exploring phased registration of select IP elements, reflecting how one of the highest-value franchises is beginning to approach blockchain representation. For Story, this is a massive validation of its network’s vision: to become the go-to infrastructure for the $80 trillion IP industry in the age of AI and crypto. The Solo Leveling partnership is expected to drive significant activity to Story’s ecosystem including new user onboarding (millions of fans curious about crypto) to developers building ecosystem dApps leveraging the IP. With Solo Leveling’s fanbase and content now connected to Story’s purpose-built IP-blockchain, the stage is set for groundbreaking experiments at the intersection of fandom and web3. Community-created art, games, NFTs, and story expansions can bloom under clear rights and royalty rules. Memecoin enthusiasts can rally around a token that has real narrative backing. And IP owners (like Solo Leveling’s creators) have a template for how to extend their works into Web3 while retaining control and revenue share. About Story: Story is a layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for intellectual property. It provides a decentralized registry for creators to tokenize their IP and set programmable licensing terms, enabling fair attribution, remixing, and monetization of creative works onchain. The network’s native $IP token powers transactions and governance. Backed by leading investors (including a16z Crypto), Story is building an AI-native infrastructure to unlock the full value of the $80T IP asset class story.foundation . About Solo Leveling / Redice Studio: Solo Leveling is a South Korean fantasy franchise that began as a webnovel by Chugong and became a smash-hit webtoon illustrated by Redice Studio. Since its 2016 debut, Solo Leveling has grown into a global IP spanning comics, animation, games, and more – garnering over ten billions of reads and a massive international fandom. Redice Studio is renowned for its stunning visuals and has been instrumental in expanding Solo Leveling’s universe. Together with its partners, Redice continues to explore innovative ways (like Story) to expand the franchise and engage fans worldwide.

The price of the highest Game Pass subscription tier, called Ultimate, will rise by $10 to $30 a month. Subscribers will get access to more than 400 games, a broader selection of titles on release day and better cloud streaming quality. Prices for the service’s other two tiers, renamed Essential and Premium, will remain the same while they receive upgrades. Game Pass had 34 million subscribers in 2024 and sales of nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2025 Xbox is focusing on Game Pass as it de-emphasizes the importance of its console amid shrinking sales. Xbox’s goal is to distribute its expanding network of content and services across multiple devices, including PCs, smartphones and smart TVs. Its new advertising campaigns invite gamers to play wherever they can, and especially through Game Pass. Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023 for $69 billion was seen as a way to bolster Game Pass with a large library of new games. Microsoft increases console prices for the second time this year Cryptopolitan reported previouly Xbox consoles are also about to cost more in the U.S., and Microsoft says it’s not random. Starting this month, the company is bumping up the retail prices of all major Xbox models. Gamers outside the U.S. won’t feel a thing. The company said that prices in other countries will stay the same. Accessories like controllers and headsets also won’t change. But if you’re in the U.S., and you’re planning to buy a new console, you’ll need to pay more. The hike affects every model. And this isn’t the first time, Microsoft already raised U.S. Xbox prices earlier this year. The Xbox Series S is now $399, up from $379. The 1TB version costs $449. The Xbox Series X Digital model moves to $599, while the version with a disc drive is $649. If you want the 2TB option, you’re looking at $799. That one’s up $70 from its previous price of $729. These changes were quietly posted in a PDF on Microsoft’s official site. Industry-wide price increases follow tariff policy Sony and Nintendo have also raised prices in the U.S. around the same time, right after Trump’s tariff policy took effect again. It’s not a coincidence. Trump, who’s now back in the White House, reimposed tariffs this year on multiple countries. The goal was to bring manufacturing back to America. However it is resulting in more expensive gaming hardware for Americans. On its site, Microsoft said, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration.” Still, for buyers, it means spending more, again. Last year, the US Federal Trade Commission raised concerns over price increases to Microsoft Corp.’s video game subscription service in an appeals court filing. This followed Microsoft’s announcement that it will raise the price of its Game Pass Ultimate to $20 a month from $17. It’s also discontinued its $11-a-month Console Game Pass, which forced players to either pay 81% more to switch to Game Pass Ultimate or accept a “degraded product,” the FTC said in a filing Thursday with the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco. “Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation, combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,” the FTC wrote. This time Microsoft is not spelling out Donald Trump’s name, but they’re making it clear “changes in the macroeconomic environment”, set in motion during his first term, are behind the move.

What changes now? Most SEC reviews and non-emergency actions are on hold, limiting new approvals. Operational systems will run in modified mode with an extremely limited number of staff. Solana (SOL) ETF timelines expected to slip; electronic filings remain accepted but unreviewed. SEC shutdown crypto: Funding lapse halts SEC ETF reviews and enforcement, likely delaying approvals. Read steps issuers and investors should take now. (150-160 characters) In addition to restrictions on enforcement actions and ongoing litigation, the agency will likely stop reviewing crypto ETF applications. What exactly can the SEC do for crypto during a shutdown? The SEC shutdown crypto operations means the agency will limit activities to excepted functions only. Non-excepted staff are secured, most litigation is paused except emergencies, and non-emergency rulemaking and reviews — including many crypto ETF approvals — are suspended until appropriations resume. How will this affect pending crypto ETF approvals? Pending crypto ETF applications, including several Solana (SOL) ETF filings, face likely delays because the SEC has stated it will not engage in routine application reviews during a funding lapse. The agency’s electronic filing system will continue to accept submissions, but processing and review timelines will be extended. Source: Kristin Smith When will SEC operations return to normal? The SEC’s plan allows employees to return on the next regularly scheduled workday after appropriations legislation is enacted. Timing depends on Congressional action; at publication there was no deal in place and no set end date to the funding lapse. Will enforcement and litigation stop entirely? The SEC said it will not engage in ongoing litigation, except for emergency matters or cases involving imminent threats to property. This indicates most enforcement actions against crypto companies will be paused, though urgent cases may still proceed under excepted authorities. How should issuers and investors respond? Issuers should continue filing required materials because electronic submissions remain accepted, but they should not expect prompt reviews. Investors should factor procedural delays into timing assumptions for ETF launches and monitor official SEC notices and congressional developments. What authoritative signals support this assessment? COINOTAG reports that the SEC’s contingency plan, posted publicly by the agency on social platforms, outlines the limited staffing and program suspensions. Market analysts and exchange filings referenced in public statements also indicate anticipated delays for crypto-linked ETFs. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@graph"": [ { ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""headline"": ""SEC shutdown pauses reviews and enforcement — what it means for crypto ETFs"", ""description"": ""In addition to restrictions on enforcement actions and ongoing litigation, the agency will likely stop reviewing crypto ETF applications."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-shutdown-crypto-etf-impact-2025-10-01"" }, ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a0b9-8662-78ab-acee-e9cfcebcb21d.png"" ], ""wordCount"": ""720"" }, { ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will the SEC approve crypto ETFs during a government shutdown?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Most routine approvals are likely paused; the SEC accepts filings but will not conduct non-emergency reviews until funding is restored."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are enforcement actions against crypto firms halted during the shutdown?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Non-emergency enforcement and litigation are paused, but the SEC may pursue emergency actions where there is an imminent threat to property or investors."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How can issuers minimize disruption during the shutdown?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Issuers should continue timely electronic filings, document readiness for expedited review once operations resume, and communicate transparently with stakeholders."" } } ] }, { ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to prepare for SEC shutdown impacts on crypto ETF timelines"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step actions issuers and investors can take during an SEC funding lapse."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-shutdown-crypto-etf-impact-2025-10-01#step1"", ""name"": ""Monitor official notices"", ""text"": ""Track SEC public statements and congressional funding news to anticipate resumption dates."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-shutdown-crypto-etf-impact-2025-10-01#step2"", ""name"": ""Continue filings"", ""text"": ""Submit required documents electronically; filings will queue for review when staffing returns."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-shutdown-crypto-etf-impact-2025-10-01#step3"", ""name"": ""Prepare stakeholder communications"", ""text"": ""Inform investors and counterparties about likely delays and contingency timelines."" } ] } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How long will crypto ETF approvals be delayed? Delay length depends on how quickly Congress enacts appropriations. If funding is restored within days, reviews resume rapidly; a protracted shutdown could push approvals weeks or longer beyond prior expectations. Can issuers still file ETF registration statements? Yes. The SEC’s electronic filing system continues to accept submissions, but filings will not be reviewed until non-excepted staff return to normal duty status. Key Takeaways Immediate pause: Most SEC review and non-emergency enforcement actions are suspended during the funding lapse. ETF timelines delayed: Crypto ETF approvals, including Solana-linked products, are likely to be delayed despite ongoing filings. Actionable steps: Continue filings, monitor official SEC notices, and communicate updated timelines to investors. Conclusion The SEC shutdown crypto pause creates a clear operational freeze: non-emergency reviews and enforcement will be limited until appropriations are restored. Issuers and investors should treat timelines as provisional, keep filings current, and watch congressional developments.

The global phenomenon Solo Leveling is breaking new ground by coming onchain via Story. In a move that bridges a blockbuster franchise with blockchain, Solo Leveling is exploring the issuance of a tokenized real-world asset (RWA), exploring an entirely new flavor of tokenized RWAs that differs from money market funds, equity offerings, and treasury vehicles that are typically represented in web3. Solo Leveling is working with Story to initiate steps toward onchain representation of select IP elements. This approach is intended to enable onchain programmability for select integrations, opening the door to future fan-driven remixing, blockchain-based experiences, both digital and real world, and next-gen licensing deals. The announcement cements Solo Leveling’s status as a cross-media juggernaut, and as a pioneer in its industry by moving its IP to Web3. Before its Web3 debut, Solo Leveling has already proven itself a cultural titan across multiple formats: Webnovel & Webtoon: Originating as a web novel and adapted as webtoon in Korea, Solo Leveling amassed over 14+ billion views worldwide, 175+ million readers, an unprecedented achievement that solidified it as a flagship Korean series with global influence. It is also the highest grossing webtoon and Korean webnovel in history. Comic Book: The comic adaptation has been a breakout print hit, reaching #1 on the New York Times Graphic Books bestseller list and selling over 10 million copies globally. Anime (Streaming): Solo Leveling’s anime adaptation stormed streaming platforms, becoming the most-watched anime in the history of Crunchyroll and ranking in Netflix’s weekly Top 10 in 11 countries upon debut (and clinching the #1 spot on Amazon Prime Video in Japan). Anime (Awards): The series swept the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards with 9 honors at the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards, including the coveted Anime of the Year, a historic first for a manhwa-based show. Game: The mobile RPG Solo Leveling: ARISE turned the franchise into an interactive experience, grossing approximately $70 million in its first month and attracting 50 million players within five months of launch. The game was number 1 in downloads in 141 countries; number 1 in revenue in 21 countries; and number 1 in App Store popularity rankings across 78 countries. Live Action Series: Netflix is producing a live-action series adaptation of the global phenomenon “Solo Leveling,” with rising star Byeon Woo-seok attached to lead the project as protagonist Sung Jinwook. These feats illustrate Solo Leveling’s unrivaled multi-format success and passionate worldwide fanbase. Now, by venturing onto the blockchain, Solo Leveling is poised to redefine how a modern franchise can engage its community and unlock new value with its content. Webnovel and Webtoon to Web3 Solo Leveling is collaborating with Story, the world’s first blockchain network purpose-built for intellectual property, to begin steps toward onchain IP representation for select elements. Story tokenizes IP and makes it programmable, enabling new models of ownership, remix, and monetization for creators and fans. By onboarding Solo Leveling, Story is effectively aiming to demonstrate onchain representation for one of the world’s highest-value franchises. In practice, this means select elements of the Solo Leveling IP (e.g. characters, universe, and content rights) could be represented onchain and managed through smart contracts. Once on Story, Solo Leveling’s IP would become machine-readable and enforceable onchain, allowing developers and fans to build with it under preset rules. For example, a creator could remix a Solo Leveling character into a game mod with automated royalties flowing back to the IP holders. Licensed merchandise could be tied to onchain provenance, and any third-party game or media using Solo Leveling content could seamlessly implement programmable licensing and revenue splits. In short, Solo Leveling’s move to Story unlocks a playground for community-driven innovation around the franchise, all secured by blockchain. “Korea has always been a global launchpad for intellectual property. Beyond early unique cultural IP from K-pop, K-drama, Korea is leading the way in gaming, webtoons and Hollywood heavy-hitters such as Squid Games and Parasite. Solo Leveling is a perfect example of how Korean IP can transcend borders, dominate every format, and build massive global fandoms. IP shouldn’t just be watched or read, it should be programmable. That means IP that can be tokenized, composable, and monetized across games, AI models, and consumer applications”, said SY Lee, co-founder and CEO of Story. “Registering Solo Leveling’s IP onchain, would unlock the next level of engagement, loyalty, and monetization enabling remix culture, fan-powered economies, and token-native formats that weren’t possible before.” Official Solo Leveling IP-backed Memecoin on the Horizon In a bold crypto-native twist, the Solo Leveling team also revealed plans for an official IP-backed memecoin tied to the story’s universe and characters . This upcoming token (details and launch date TBA) will be directly backed by Solo Leveling’s characters and lore, making it one of the first memecoins anchored by a blockbuster franchise’s IP. Fans will effectively get to “own a piece” of the Solo Leveling saga in token form, a concept that could transform community engagement and fandom in Web3. Unlike typical memecoins that often emerge from internet jokes with no ties to creators, this Solo Leveling coin will be authorized and supported by the IP owners. Built on Story’s infrastructure, it aims to align the token’s value with the franchise’s success: the more the story and its memes spread, the more both fans and creators can benefit. This approach follows a growing recognition that memes and viral content drive immense value (the memecoin market tops $100B), yet creators historically capture little of it. An official Solo Leveling coin would flip that script by channeling cultural hype into a token model designed to align fan engagement with the franchise’s success “Solo Leveling has always been about leveling up, and now we’re looking to level up the franchise with Web3. With Story, we hope to see the IP expand beyond the series itself, which could allow fans and creators to join Solo Leveling’s next chapter in new ways.” – Jungsook Jang, CEO at Redice Studio. Bringing Solo Leveling onchain could mark a watershed moment for Story and the broader concept of tokenized IP. Solo Leveling is exploring phased registration of select IP elements, reflecting how one of the highest-value franchises is beginning to approach blockchain representation.

The agency acknowledged that corporations can disregard unrealized gains and losses on their digital asset holdings when determining their tax parameters. Strategy now believes it will no longer be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The Bitcoin accumulation firm adopted accounting standards in January that required it to include the fair value of its BTC holdings in its earnings. According to Strategy’s filing, it had an $8.1 billion unrealized gain on its BTC holdings for the six months ending June 30. At the time of publication, the company holds around 604,031 Bitcoin worth roughly $74.6 billion. “As a result of Treasury and IRS interim guidance issued yesterday, Strategy does not expect to be subject to the Corporate Alternate Minimum Tax (CAMT) due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings.” – Michael Saylor , CEO of Strategy Strategy and Coinbase sent a joint letter in May to the Treasury calling for the exclusion of unrealized crypto gains. Both companies argued that it was unfair that digital assets should receive different tax treatment from traditional stocks and bonds. According to the letter, the duo warned the IRS that taxing paper profits could force companies to sell Bitcoin to pay taxes. They added that it would put U.S. firms at a disadvantage versus foreign competitors and even raise constitutional concerns over taxing income that doesn’t exist. The Senate Finance Committee is holding a hearing today on ‘Examining the Taxation of Digital Assets’ that started at 10:00 AM. The Senate is expected to discuss the IRS’s interim guidance on corporate crypto tax rules. Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo will lead the hearing, with the participation of Coinbase Vice President of Tax Lawrence Zlatkin and Coin Center Policy Director Jason Somensatto. CAMT was approved under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed into law by former President Joe Biden. Notice 2025-46 and Notice 2025-49 of the latest interim guidance are intended to reduce compliance burdens and provide clarity on complex areas of the CAMMT until final regulations are in place. U.S. recommends policies for regulating crypto The U.S. President Donald Trump’s Working Group on Digital Assets released a report in July that outlined policy recommendations for regulating crypto in the U.S. The group recommended that Congress establish a custom-tailored tax policy for digital assets that accounts for the unique features of the asset class, including staking. The report recommended introducing legislation that treats digital assets as a new class of assets, subject to modified versions of tax rules applicable to securities or commodities for federal income tax purposes. SEC Chair Paul Atkins argued that a rational regulatory framework for digital assets is the best way to catalyze American innovation and protect investors from fraud. On Monday, Strategy purchased 196 Bitcoin for $22.1 million, which pushed its holdings above 640,000 BTC. The company bought the digital assets at an average price of $113,048 per BTC.

Analysts Point to $0.00001150 as Key Support Renowned crypto analyst Coinvo recently highlighted that Shiba Inu is approaching a decisive level. While describing the move as a “major resistance test,” Coinvo’s chart actually emphasized $0.00001150 as the most critical support zone for 2025. The data shows that this level has repeatedly halted sell-offs and spurred recoveries. In March, SHIB tested the zone before rebounding to around $0.000014. A similar trend unfolded in April when the token climbed back toward $0.00001550. More recently, in late June, Shiba Inu once again fell to the same level during heightened volatility sparked by the armed conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite the geopolitical pressure, buyers stepped in, driving SHIB back toward $0.00001570 in July. Source: X With the token once again hovering near this level, analysts argue that a strong bounce could reignite bullish momentum. However, if $0.00001150 fails to hold, Shiba Inu could face accelerated sell-offs, opening the door to deeper declines. Declining Reserves Ease Selling Pressure The bearish outlook has been tempered by a sharp drop in SHIB’s exchange reserves . According to market data, reserves recently fell to 84.49 trillion tokens, marking a two-year low. At the time of writing, the figure had dipped further to 84.34 trillion SHIB. This decline signals reduced selling pressure, as fewer tokens remain available for trading on exchanges. Analysts suggest that this factor could support Shiba Inu’s ability to maintain its critical support level, reducing the likelihood of a steep breakdown. Meanwhile, community commentator Shib Spain speculated that the long-awaited altcoin season could begin this month. He pointed to October’s historical performance as a potential indicator. Data shows that Shiba Inu posted gains of 833% in 2021, followed by 10.4% in 2022, 6.04% in 2023, and 2.46% in 2024. As October 2025 begins, the token has already risen 0.56% within the first hours of the month. Whether this modest start turns into a broader rally will depend heavily on SHIB’s interaction with its support zone.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 17:52:19

The authority will be collecting detailed information from market participants to determine how much Russians are invested in crypto assets and derivatives. Russian central bank to carry out massive crypto survey The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is going to conduct a large-scale survey of the Russian crypto assets market, media reports unveiled, citing official documents. Russia’s main financial regulator plans to study cryptocurrency investments and lending in the sector in early 2026. Commenting on the matter, the bank elaborated: “The survey is being conducted to assess the investments of supervised organizations in cryptocurrencies, including for risk hedging purposes, as well as the volume of their lending to crypto companies as of Jan. 1, 2026.” The study is scheduled to take place in January and February, according to the materials quoted by the news agencies TASS and Interfax, as well as the Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media. Banking and financial institutions are expected to submit the data required by the monetary authority by Feb. 1. The CBR clarified that it will determine the group of participants in the upcoming survey after gathering all the necessary information. Meanwhile, the central bank is also examining investments in digital financial assets ( DFAs ) with returns tied to the prices of cryptocurrencies, Interfax noted in its report. Responsible entities are obliged to submit this type of data on a monthly basis, no later than the 10th working day of each month following the surveyed period. Under a dedicated law, which went into force in early 2021, Russia defined DFAs as representing tokenized real-world assets. Issued on private rather than public blockchains, and only by CBR-authorized platforms, they are different from decentralized cryptocurrencies but can be based on their value. Russia’s regulated crypto market remains reserved for a few investors The Bank of Russia, a long-term opponent to crypto legalization, allowed in March a limited group of “ highly qualified ” investors to access and transact with cryptocurrencies within the framework of an “experimental legal regime.” Both companies and wealthy Russians can fall into that category. To obtain the status, private individuals need to prove investments in securities and deposits exceeding 100 million rubles, or annual income from the past year of at least 50 million rubles (over $1.2 million and $600,000, respectively). Then, in May, the regulator permitted financial institutions to offer the same investors derivatives providing indirect exposure to crypto assets. Established market players, including Russia’s giant Sberbank and the Moscow Exchange, were quick to tap into the new market. In September, the regulator signaled its intentions to let investment funds acquire crypto derivatives in 2026, admitting capital management companies to the growing industry, which is currently dominated by brokers. For now, cryptocurrencies and crypto-based instruments remain legally available only to financial firms and rich Russian citizens. The CBR wants to keep it that way, presumably to protect ordinary Russians from the risks of crypto . However, the Ministry of Finance, which has maintained a more liberal stance on the matter, recently suggested easing the requirements for qualified investors in order to widen the regulated access to crypto assets and derivatives. The proposal is yet to be approved by the central bank. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Here’s What Traders Need to Know,https://cryptonews.com/news/why-did-tether-just-move-1b-in-bitcoin-heres-what-traders-need-to-know/,"On September 30, blockchain data showed Tether transferring 8,888.889 Bitcoin into its reserve wallet. At the time of the move, the transaction was valued at approximately $1 billion. The coins came from a Bitfinex hot wallet, a connection that has been noted in previous reserve operations. Both firms are under the same parent company, which strengthens the link to Tether’s balance sheet strategy. This action follows a policy introduced in 2023. Tether stated that it would allocate up to 15% of its net profits each quarter to Bitcoin purchases. While the company rarely discloses details about timing or execution, the consistency of its actions has made these transfers easier to track. Reserve Structure and Associated Risks On social media, Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino offered only a brief confirmation, replying “yeah” to an account that flagged the transaction. That minimal response was enough for market watchers to connect the event to the firm’s established Bitcoin reserve plan. Yeah https://t.co/YhSFseaHud pic.twitter.com/xvx93WoXSv — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) September 30, 2025 Estimates now suggest that Tether’s holdings are near 109,410 Bitcoin. At current market prices, that puts the value of its treasury exposure to Bitcoin at over $12 billion. Tether has built its reputation on the claim that USDT is fully backed by reserves. For much of its history, those reserves have been described as a mix of cash, cash equivalents, and short-dated U.S. Treasuries. Reports earlier this year indicated that the company held more than $97 billion in Treasury bills. Adding Bitcoin to this reserve pool introduces both diversification and volatility. Bitcoin is liquid, but its price can swing sharply. That creates new challenges for a company whose product is meant to remain stable at one dollar. The central issue is how those Bitcoin reserves are managed during stress events. If redemptions require conversion to dollars when the Bitcoin market is under pressure, sales at unfavorable prices could amplify market volatility. Critics argue that this structure creates exposure that cannot be easily hedged. Market and Strategic Impact It is also unclear whether the $1 billion move represented new purchases in the open market or a reallocation of assets already under Tether’s control. The address links to Bitfinex suggest an internal shuffle, yet even that raises questions about transparency and record-keeping. Without a full audit, it is difficult for outside observers to verify whether such moves change the quality or stability of the overall reserve mix. For Bitcoin markets, the addition of $1 billion in demand by a major corporate player matters at the margin. Daily trading volume is large enough that a single purchase will not dictate price trends, yet coordinated buying on quarter-end dates can affect liquidity. Some traders see this as a supportive factor for Bitcoin’s medium-term price floor. Tether’s approach may also shape how other issuers think about reserves. If it can hold more volatile assets while still maintaining the dollar peg of USDT, others may feel encouraged to pursue similar blends of risk. In addition, that possibility has drawn attention from regulators who are already studying stablecoin backing and disclosure rules in multiple jurisdictions. Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin For now, the impact is twofold. On one hand, Bitcoin gains another committed corporate holder with a programmatic buying policy. On the other hand, USDT users are indirectly exposed to the performance of Bitcoin in ways that are not always easy to measure. The open question is not whether Tether will continue buying Bitcoin, but how that strategy interacts with its obligations during future redemption cycles. The experiment is underway, and markets will be watching closely to see how the firm manages growth in its dual role as a stablecoin issuer and Bitcoin holder.

Could this new development drive ADA's price to $2.50? The potential influence of institutional investors looms large, making this a key moment for the cryptocurrency. This article delves into which digital currencies are poised for growth amidst these shifting dynamics. Cardano's Price Climb Hints at Potential Upside Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between $0.75 and $0.88. It has shown a steady increase, gaining over 28% in the past six months. The nearest resistance is at $0.95, while support is at $0.69. Should it break the resistance, ADA could climb to the next level of $1.08, marking a potential rise of around 22% from its current high. The 10-day moving average slightly surpasses the 100-day, suggesting ongoing upward momentum. With an RSI of 64.08, it indicates the asset is nearing the upper edge of neutral ground, hinting that the bullish trend might continue if market conditions remain favorable. Conclusion ADA's addition to the Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF could attract more institutional investors. This new interest might push the price upwards. Reaching the target of $2.50 is possible if the buying pressure continues. The inclusion suggests growing confidence in ADA’s potential. However, actual price movement will depend on broader market trends and investor sentiments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This resiliency has ignited debate among analysts. While Bitcoin has shown strength, XRP has been unable to regain the $3 mark and has kept investors apprehensive about short-term momentum. The differing trajectories of these two assets are writing a new narrative in the market, one where Bitcoin represents the anchor of institutional confidence, while XRP is still dealing with phases of regulatory noise and consolidation. Yet beyond these known names, retail traders are probing elsewhere for explosive growth. The chatter that dominates the crypto forums, Telegram groups, and social media spaces isn’t just all about the resilience of Bitcoin or the stall of XRP. Rather, there has been a shift in favour of high-reward altcoins where the idea of 50X multiples gets the imagination. Historically, in the end, as majors consolidate, speculative effort shifts to meme coins, pre-sales, and small-cap tokens. It is here that MAGACOIN FINANCE appears more often, as an even speculative addition to the blue-chip stars. Bitcoin’s capacity to trade above $116K strengthens its position as a hedge in uncertain markets. Institutional traders still lean on it as the “safe” crypto allocation, especially during increased volatility. The fact that Bitcoin is still stable despite these liquidations suggests whales are defending key levels, and derivatives activity suggests renewed conviction in its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Anchors Institutional Confidence For investors, Bitcoin’s stability is a source of reassurance – but it also means smaller explosive gains. While it remains the asset of choice of institutions, retail investors are often left looking elsewhere for exponential upside. XRP’s Ongoing Struggles Under $3 The failure of XRP to pull $3 back is metaphorically speaking of its person. Regulatory transparency has been enhanced, and the use in cross-border finance remains promising, but price behavior is underperforming. Analysts suggest that whales are still cautious and prefer to accumulate only during heavy dips. In contrast, retail holders seem impatient, moving into meme-inspired opportunities where the returns seem more immediate. XRP might once again recover greater heights, though in the meantime, its convergence stands in the disparity between institutional tolerance and the desire of retail to hold faster-paced assets. Traders Chase 50x Altcoin Narratives Wherever majors stall, retail speculation looks for new frontiers. Over the last day, analysts have trailed high-level activity in Telegram channels and X discussions around low-cap pre-sales and meme-driven altcoins. These narratives promise multiples in the 50x or higher, though often with a high degree of risk. The psychology behind that is simple: retail investors see Bitcoin as secure yet slow, XRP selling uncertainty, and altcoins as the path to outsized rewards. With each cycle, speculative tokens climb from obscurity into the spotlight, propelled by community hype and a play of scarcity. The 50X chase isn’t irrational; it represents the desire to achieve transformative returns in a market known for asymmetry. Bitcoin is steady above $116K while XRP is battling under $3, leaving traders searching for sharper upside. The focus has moved toward presales with exponentially larger multipliers possible. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gradually being mentioned in these talks, with predictions of 46x-54x multipliers provided, as listing momentum matches the presale pace. Its scarcity-driven mechanics exacerbate FOMO as each stage is sold at a higher price. Analysts suggest that during cycles where majors slow down, presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE tend to attract speculative flows. For those watching Bitcoin stagnate and XRP falter, this token is being pitched as the higher-risk, higher-reward alternative. Institutional Patience vs. Retail FOMO The contrast between institutional and retail behaviour is what defines the current market. Institutions keep pouring into Bitcoin and less enthusiastically into XRP for its payment potential. Retail, however, turns toward speculative stories, all pursuing presales and meme communities. This is a good divergence: it guarantees liquidity along lines, and that the development of crypto is multi-layered. Investors moderating between the two extremes have an opportunity in sorting out portfolios incorporating anchors like Bitcoin, and speculation bets anticipated by tactical token investments like MAGACOIN FINANCE. This combination gives security without losing the chance of exponential returns should hype crystallize. Conclusion The consistency of Bitcoin above $116K proves that it provides the anchor of the market, and the drops of XRP below 3 points underline the necessity of the longer way to recover. Yet the current narrative is the shift retail is making to 50x shopping altcoins. When majors are put on hold, traders are again proving that speculative energy is turning in other directions. MAGACOIN FINANCE perfectly fits in this story, being an audited, scarcity-based, community-driven cryptocurrency and already catching the eye as a speculative complement. For those holding Bitcoin and watching XRP consolidate, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of high-risk, high-reward allocation that characterizes retail’s quest for generational gains.

Based on this, he predicted that the altcoin could record a rally of up to 500%, reaching $15 in the process. XRP Eyes Rally To $15 As Price Flips Green In an X post, Mikybull Crypto predicted that XRP could rally to between $5 and $15. This came as the analyst noted that the altcoin has flipped green on the quarterly chart for the first time since 2017. He suggested that the rally of up to 500% may already be underway, noting that XRP has already broken above the resistance, just as it did in 2017. In a follow-up X post, Mikybull Crypto doubled down on his bullish sentiment towards XRP, stating that the altcoin’s big move is incoming as it is heading for a mega breakout. His accompanying chart indicated that the key was for XRP to successfully flip the $2.90 level again into support and decisively break above the psychological $3 level. Related Reading: XRP Price Is About To Close A 3M Candle Above This Major Region, Here’s What It Means For Price Meanwhile, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has made a more bullish forecast for XRP, predicting that it could rally to as high as $33. Like Mikybull Crypto, the analyst also alluded to the 2017 bull cycle as the reason why XRP could witness a parabolic surge to this ambitious price target. However, although he is bullish on XRP in the long term, Egrag Crypto stated that he believes there might be one more flush out before the altcoin rallies to new highs. The crypto analyst further remarked that there is about a 70% chance for a flush before the XRP uptrend continues, which he noted is healthier from a structural point of view. He added that there is a 30% chance of an immediate pump but warned that it will eventually lead to a sharp correction. Egrag Crypto expects XRP to drop to at least $2.65, with the possibility of a further decline to the fair value gap between $2.35 and $2.40. Bearish Divergences Hint At Further Drop Before The Breakout Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that XRP’s bearish divergences hint at lower support levels before a potential breakout to the upside. She noted that the downside tests remain valid, with $2.79 and $2.58 as the key support levels to watch out for as the altcoin remains below $3. The analyst added that a test of $2.58 could still support a much larger bullish move to new highs. Related Reading: XRP Price Final Low: Here’s The Target To Watch For Next Recovery However, CasiTrades warned that a break below $2.58 would invalidate the bullish market structure and threaten the macro outlook. Meanwhile, she told market participants that when XRP is truly ready to begin wave 3, the macro resistance levels at $2.79, $3, and $3.25 should break cleanly and without hesitation. If XRP continues to hesitate, she believes that further downside testing may be necessary first. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.8, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

52527753,594500,1759341640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52527753.jpeg,Whales Keep Stacking Aster: Data Reveals 8% Controlled By Two Wallets,https://bitcoinist.com/whales-keep-stacking-aster-data-reveal-8-controlled/,"Aster is cooling off after a week of explosive gains, losing more than 35% of its value since hitting an all-time high just days ago. The sharp correction has triggered caution among traders, but it also reflects natural profit-taking after such a rapid surge. Despite the retracement, sentiment in the market remains constructive, with many investors still anticipating further upside in the coming weeks. One of the main drivers behind this optimism is whale activity. Onchain data shows that large holders continue to accumulate Aster during the dip, a signal that often strengthens confidence in the asset’s long-term outlook. Their consistent buying suggests conviction in the project’s fundamentals, even as price action cools in the short term. Meanwhile, excitement around Aster continues to build. The platform has generated strong traction, and community interest has yet to fade despite the recent pullback. This combination of whale accumulation and growing DEX momentum highlights why many see the correction as an opportunity rather than the end of the rally. Whale Accumulation Strengthens Aster’s Position Fresh on-chain data highlights that whales continue to build significant exposure to Aster. According to Lookonchain, wallet 0xFB3B withdrew another 3.19 million ASTER — worth approximately $5.27 million — from Gateio just six hours ago. Combined with another large holder, the two wallets now control 132.78 million ASTER, valued at $218 million. This concentration represents 8.01% of the circulating supply, underscoring the confidence whales have in its long-term trajectory. Such activity comes at a time when the broader market is buzzing with what many call “DEX season.” Decentralized exchanges have drawn increasing attention as traders seek alternatives to centralized platforms and look for more transparency, control, and composability. Perpetual DEXs in particular have surged in popularity, with projects like Hyperliquid and Avantis capturing strong user interest. Aster, however, is positioning itself firmly in this competitive landscape. Despite recent volatility and a 35% pullback from its all-time high, the project continues to attract capital and community engagement. Whale accumulation suggests that sophisticated investors see Aster as one of the contenders capable of holding its ground alongside leading perpetual platforms. Its growing liquidity base and active ecosystem make it well placed to capture a share of the demand fueling the current decentralized trading boom. In short, while short-term price action remains choppy, whale activity and the ongoing DEX narrative provide strong tailwinds. If Aster sustains momentum and continues to scale, it could solidify itself as a serious competitor in the battle for dominance among next-generation perpetual DEXs. Aster Rebounds After Sharp Correction Aster is trading around $1.72 after a steep decline from last week’s all-time high above $2.60. The 2-hour chart highlights the intensity of the recent correction, with price falling more than 35% in just a few days before finding support near the $1.55 zone. This level acted as a short-term floor, triggering a rebound as buyers stepped back in. Currently, ASTER is attempting to reclaim ground above its short-term moving average (blue), but momentum remains fragile. Volume spikes during the sell-off show that profit-taking dominated market activity, while the rebound so far has come with lighter volume, suggesting that conviction among buyers has not yet fully returned. The $1.80 level now stands as the first key resistance. If bulls can push through it, the next challenge lies around $2.00, where the 100-period moving average (green) is converging. On the downside, failure to hold $1.60 could invite another wave of selling, potentially dragging ASTER toward $1.40. Despite this short-term weakness, the broader trend remains fueled by whale accumulation and rising interest in Aster’s DEX ecosystem. If momentum stabilizes, the rebound could evolve into a stronger recovery in the coming sessions.

As the month of October ushers in bullish trends, many are questioning whether ETH can hit the coveted $5,000 mark before year's end. This article delves into which cryptocurrencies are poised for growth and what factors might drive Ethereum's continued ascent. Ethereum Eyes Growth as Prices Hover Near Resistance Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently between $3829 and $4460. The coin shows potential to climb, bouncing off a strong support near $3513. It faces resistance at $4775, but if it pushes through, the next target is around $5405. Recent growth is promising; the coin rose about 3.7% in the past week. Over six months, it skyrocketed by over 137%. While the one-month dip of 1.69% suggests caution, the overall upward trend could mean more gains. Indicators like RSI and stochastic suggest Ethereum is nearing overbought territory, yet momentum remains strong. Keep an eye on the resistance levels as these are key for further growth. Conclusion ETH is riding a strong rally this October. The big question now is whether it can hit $5,000 before the end of the year. The current trends look promising. Other major coins like BTC, ADA, SOL, and BNB are also on the rise. The market sentiment is positive, and these gains could push ETH to reach new heights. If this momentum continues, ETH might indeed meet the $5,000 target. Investors are keeping a close eye on how these coins perform in the coming weeks.

A notable example occurred this week when David Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer with a long tenure, stepped down from his active position . The news triggered a flood of appreciation from the XRP community, who were quick to highlight his invaluable role in shaping both Ripple and the XRP Ledger. But what followed next turned the spotlight back onto Schwartz in a way only he could manage. A Retirement That Sparked Praise On the day of his announcement, Schwartz, better known in crypto circles as JoelKatz, was met with an outpouring of respect and admiration. Supporters, fellow developers, and long-time XRP holders praised his technical leadership and his enduring commitment to building the infrastructure that underpins Ripple’s vision for faster, more efficient global payments. Schwartz is moving to an emeritus role at Ripple, ensuring his expertise stays accessible as he passes on day-to-day duties to senior leaders in engineering. For many, it marked the end of an era while also offering reassurance that his influence on XRPL’s future is far from over. Hey everybody, save the kind words for when I die. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 1, 2025 The Unexpected Follow-Up Just as the community settled into celebrating his career, Schwartz returned to X with a tongue-in-cheek remark that instantly shifted the tone. “Hey everybody, save the kind words for when I die,” he posted. The remark, made in his signature blend of dry humor and candor, quickly became the focal point of discussion, sparking another surge of responses across the XRP community. Instead of discouraging supporters, the post actually strengthened the strong connection Schwartz has with them. It was a reminder that, even at a moment of transition, he remains deeply engaged and unafraid to speak in a way that is both relatable and disarmingly human. XRP Community Reacts The XRP army wasted no time in responding with the mix of wit and warmth it is known for. Influencer JackTheRippler reassured him with the words, “Legends don’t die, David.” Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO offered a lighter take , saying, “Hope to live long mate. Attract positive vibes.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Others leaned into the playful side of the conversation. Mr Owl teased , “Will there be a switch and 589 on the stone then? Lol” while Taylor Wells asked, “Will you have a programmable Trust to trade from the grave?” Each comment highlighted the community’s affection for Schwartz, blending admiration with the humor that has long defined their interactions. What This Means for Ripple and XRPL Schwartz’s transition marks a significant shift for Ripple but not an abrupt departure. By retaining an advisory presence, he ensures continuity while giving the next generation of technical leaders room to step forward. For XRP holders and developers, the move signals stability rather than disruption. The latest episode also underscores something deeper: the XRP community is more than just investors watching a price chart. It is a culture built around personalities, shared jokes, and a sense of collective history. And at its center, David Schwartz remains both architect and friend, willing to deflect reverence with humor while continuing to shape the ledger he helped build. At a time when many expected only solemn tributes, Ripple’s outgoing CTO reminded everyone that he is still very much here — steering the conversation, inspiring his supporters, and leaving the XRP army with yet another unforgettable moment.

Captain Faibik projects a target near $140,000, with October–November 2025 flagged as likely months for a breakout based on ascending channel structure, volume confirmation, and flag-pole measurement. Bitcoin forms a bullish flag; target near $140K projected Volume spikes and trendline support confirm breakout bias; dips present entry opportunities. BTC trading inside an ascending channel above key supports; current price and consolidation range tested by multiple bounces. Bitcoin bullish flag signals potential $140K breakout; read our technical summary and trading steps for Q4 2025 momentum—act with risk controls. What is the Bitcoin bullish flag and is $140K realistic? Bitcoin bullish flag is a continuation pattern where a strong prior rise (the pole) is followed by a tight, downward-sloping consolidation (the flag). If the flag resolves upward with confirming volume, the measured target—based on the pole height—can point to roughly $140,000 as a realistic technical objective. How does Captain Faibik’s chart project $140K for BTC? Captain Faibik’s BTCUSDT chart measures the flag’s pole from the preceding leg up and projects that height from the breakout point. The projection aligns with volume confirmation: notable volume spikes occurred at both breakout attempts and support retests. Price action inside an ascending channel and a consolidation range between $106,000 and $120,000 create the technical structure supporting a $140K target. Bitcoin forms a bullish flag with Captain Faibik projecting $140K as traders prepare for October and November strength in Q4 2025. Bitcoin shows a bullish flag pattern with traders eyeing $140K as Captain Faibik highlights October and November momentum. BTC holds firm above key supports with volume confirming breakouts as dips offer entry points before a potential rally to $140K. Faibik’s chart projects $140K as consolidation ends and ascending channel strength signals continued bullish momentum into Q4 2025. Bitcoin traders are closely watching the market as Captain Faibik signaled another bullish rally ahead. On X, the analyst stated: “$BTC is getting Ready for Another Bullish Rally.. I think October & November are gonna be Bullish Months.. Before the Breakout, if we get a dip, that would be a very good opportunity..” His chart of BTCUSDT shows a bullish flag structure with a projected target near $140,000. Why did Bitcoin move from downtrend to breakout? Early 2025 price action showed a descending channel with lower highs and lower lows. Mid-year, Bitcoin broke above descending resistance and transitioned into an ascending channel. That shift produced higher lows and higher highs, lifting price above $120,000 and forming the flag-pole for the current bullish flag continuation setup. Source: Captain Faibik After the pole formed, BTC consolidated between $106,000 and $120,000. Multiple bounces tested both support and resistance inside that range, which created the flag body. The current breakout attempt shows price trading around $114,481.83, a small intraday dip, while volume spikes at key levels support the directional conviction. How do technical signals support a $140K target? Measured-flag methodology projects the target by adding the pole height to the breakout price. Support within the ascending channel and converging trendlines strengthens the technical case. Volume confirmation—spikes on breakouts and breakdowns—adds reliability, while the consolidation serves as a base for renewed upward momentum. How should traders approach the setup? Traders can: 1) watch for a decisive breakout above the flag with increasing volume; 2) use dips near channel support as defined entry zones; 3) set stop-losses below the consolidation low to manage risk. Maintain position sizing discipline and favor trades aligned with the dominant trend. Quick comparison: Key levels and signals Item Current Key Level/Signal Price $114,481.83 Above ascending channel support Consolidation range $106K–$120K Flag body / base for breakout Projected target $140,000 Flag-pole measurement Confirmation Volume spikes Breakout with follow-through How to trade the Bitcoin bullish flag safely Confirm breakout: Wait for price and volume confirmation above the flag resistance. Use defined entries: Consider entries on pullbacks to the breakout level or channel support. Set stops: Place stop-losses below the consolidation low or below the ascending channel support. Manage risk: Size positions to risk a controlled percentage of capital and monitor liquidity. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is a bullish flag in Bitcoin technical analysis?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A bullish flag is a continuation pattern where a sharp rise (pole) is followed by a tight, often downward-sloping consolidation (flag).

Flags are widely used by technicians because they measure continuation off a strong prior move. Reliability increases with volume confirmation and clear support inside an ascending channel; combine with risk controls for better outcomes. What should I watch during October–November 2025? Monitor breakout volume, price action around $120K resistance, and retests of the consolidation low near $106K. Increased volatility in October and November could produce decisive moves that confirm the projected trend. Key Takeaways Pattern: Bullish flag suggests continuation if breakout holds. Target: $140K is a technical projection based on the flag pole and breakout level. Action: Wait for volume-confirmed breakout, enter on defined pullbacks, and use stops below consolidation support. Conclusion This technical update explains why the Bitcoin bullish flag and Captain Faibik’s projection point toward a potential $140,000 target if the ascending channel and volume confirmations hold through October and November 2025. Traders should combine measured targets with disciplined risk management and monitor price/volume signals closely for confirmation.",Analysis|Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 18:06:56

To that end, the FTC will not assist US citizens in blocking spam calls, and it will not grant early merger approval during the shutdown. “The FTC is closed during the government shutdown. This means we won’t be able to answer your questions on X. Consumers cannot report fraud or register for do not call during this time,” the agency’s Office of Technology said in a post on X. FTC and market arms face delays during the shutdown The federal government shut down today after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a funding bill, halting key operations across multiple agencies. Consumer advocates charge that the shutdown will compound existing rollbacks in consumer protections and leave millions of Americans exposed to risks. Now the agency that enforces laws against anticompetitive and deceptive business behavior will leave consumers unprotected for at least a month. Besides that, about 780 workers will stay home, while the other 400 will work without pay until after the shutdown. According to the agency, the FTC’s fraud reporting website and national registry, which allows individuals to opt out of telemarketing, will not be available during the shutdown. In addition, Wall Street dealmakers can still file for clearance for mergers and acquisitions. But the agency will stop granting early clearance to deals that do not pose a threat to competition during the shutdown. The FTC’s shutdown plan under President Donald Trump is similar to the one the agency put in place under Joe Biden’s presidency. During Biden’s era, the agency had stopped granting early clearance entirely. Meanwhile, the FTC is suing Zillow and Redfin, two of the biggest names in real estate, saying they unfairly worked together to reduce competition in the online multifamily rental listing market. The FTC says that the companies broke federal antitrust laws earlier this year when Zillow paid Redfin $100 million to re-host Zillow’s multifamily rental ads on Redfin and its sites. A survey reveals that only 12% go to FTC after scams In a survey conducted by the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, respondents said they are almost daily victims of scams, and those who do fall victim lose more than $1,000 on average. Most of the people who answered the poll from the US said that they regularly fall for scams. In fact, 77% of those people said that scammers try to trick them once a day on average. 70% of US citizens report being scammed in the last 12 months. More than 20% of those who were impacted lost money to scams. On average, they lost $1086.70. 74% of people who fell for a scam reported it, but 57% say they didn’t see the platform take any action about it. Similarly, 82% of Americans who were scammed reported the incident to their payment service, but only 44% were able to recover at least some of the stolen money. However, 38% were unable to recover any money at all. Without a doubt, there is a big gap between settlement and restitution. Additionally, the study found that when Americans report scams, 25% first go to business organizations, while only 12% go to consumer protection officials like the FTC. Still, many believe reporting is pointless. 18% of non-reporters say they didn’t bother because they assumed nothing would be done. Additionally, 80% of scams originate from digital platforms that facilitate direct messaging. Text messages, emails, and phone calls are the most common methods scammers use to contact people. People said that X, Snapchat, and Telegram were the slowest to react to scam reports. Gmail, Facebook, and Instagram were most often linked to scams. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Below we review the most notable platforms of 2025 and compare their strengths, weaknesses, and approach to Tether (USDT) banking. Tether (USDT) as a Sportsbook Banking Option Tether has become the go-to stablecoin for bettors who want crypto speed without exposure to volatility. Deposits and withdrawals usually clear in minutes, fees are negligible, and balances retain their dollar value. Sportsbooks increasingly display account balances in both USDT and fiat equivalents, making it easy to track bankrolls. Tether vs. Fiat in Sports Betting Compared to fiat, Tether offers faster transfers, lower costs, and global accessibility. Players can deposit and withdraw 24/7 without relying on banks. The trade-off is reduced consumer protection: fiat sportsbooks usually fall under stricter regulatory oversight, while many Tether books operate under looser or offshore licenses. For those prioritizing speed and privacy, USDT is a clear winner; for players wanting full legal recourse, fiat betting may feel safer.

Deposit to the sportsbook: Copy the cashier address, send USDT, and wait for confirmation. Stay safe: Protect seed phrases, use 2FA, and test small amounts first if new. Final Thoughts In 2025, the crypto sportsbook landscape is broadening fast. Dexsport stands out for its transparency, Web3-native model, and audits, making it the top Tether betting platform. Behind it, licensed operators like Vave, Jackbit, and Thrill balance innovation with regulatory safeguards, while BetPlay and Cryptorino offer speed and bonuses at the cost of weaker oversight. For players, the choice boils down to priorities: privacy and speed with USDT, or regulation and fiat-like protections. Either way, Tether is cementing itself as the stablecoin of choice for sports betting.

However, traditional stablecoins, backed by assets like cash and US Treasury bonds, still dominate the market. The leading stablecoin, Tether (USDT), has a market capitalization of $174.7 billion. However, there are those who keep their distance from USDe because it could cause a crisis similar to the LUNA crisis. “We see ourselves as ecosystem builders, not passive investors,” said Leo Zhao, Investment Director at MEXC Ventures. *This is not investment advice.

What started as a techie rebellion has become a full-blown right-wing pivot that’s cracking open the crypto industry’s carefully-built political neutrality in Washington. Ever since Trump announced that he was pro-crypto on the campaign trail last year, the twins quickly turned MAGA. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known mostly for their Harvard feud with Mark Zuck, have gone all-in on Trump. They’re now major influencers inside the GOP, pushing appointments, sabotaging nominations, and deciding what crypto’s image is gonna be on the Hill. Tyler and Cam’s influence was on full display in July when Trump, after a private chat with the brothers, pulled his nominee for CFTC chair. The nominee, Brian Quintenz, was seen as a solid pick across party lines, but not MAGA enough for the twins. His refusal to “atone” for past regulatory action against Gemini, their crypto exchange, didn’t sit well, as Cryptopolitan widely reported. Crypto’s bipartisan mask is slipping Until now, the crypto world has tried to play both sides. Democrats may have hit the sector hard with regulations, but bipartisanship was always the goal. That way, no matter who controls Congress, crypto has a seat at the table. Now the Winklevoss twins gave $1 million each in bitcoin to Trump, backed pro-Trump PACs, and steered over $5 million in donations solely to Republicans this cycle. Their new favorite toy is the Digital Freedom Fund PAC, a MAGA-friendly vehicle they’re using to bankroll Trump’s crypto agenda. Tyler and Cam used to support Democrats, by the way, specifically in 2018 when all their political cash literally went to the left. Even in the 2024 cycle, they sprinkled donations across both parties, contributing to Fairshake, a major bipartisan crypto super PAC. Not anymore. They’ve ghosted Fairshake, even as it loads up with another $140 million for 2026, and now they’re running their own shop, picking ideological loyalty over broader coalition-building. But I mean, the Biden administration did take a hammer to crypto. The twins’ company, Gemini, got slapped with lawsuits from the SEC and the CFTC. They paid $5 million to settle one of them. The crackdown pissed them off, and now they’re firing back, dollar by dollar. But while Trump is grinning, the rest of the industry is sweating. No one wants to be tagged a Republican project when Congress needs both sides to pass real crypto laws. Backlash inside and outside the party Some Republicans are thrilled. People like Sen. Cynthia Lummis have been cozying up to the Winklevoss twins, even consulting them on policy. She doesn’t hide her belief that Democrats have done little to help the crypto industry. But not everyone’s clapping. Former Democratic Rep. Wiley Nickel called out the dangerous tilt, warning that crypto becoming a right-wing talking point is a fast track to political irrelevance. Even within the industry, people are getting nervous. Insiders admit off-record that making crypto a GOP-only issue is a bad gamble. Once the pendulum swings back to Democrats, and it will, the industry risks getting frozen out. Some of the same Democrats the Winklevoss brothers are ignoring are pushing to shape the next big crypto bill. Burning those bridges now could wreck everything the sector has tried to build in D.C. Still, the twins aren’t slowing down. Trump loves them. They’re in his ear, and their checkbook’s always open. And while most of the crypto crowd is still begging for bipartisan cover, the Winklevoss brothers are writing their own playbook—and dragging the industry into the red along with them.

A new DeFi project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is, nonetheless, grabbing attention for bigger potential price rises. For sale at $0.035 during its current presale phase, Mutuum Finance has already raised significant capital and is building a dual-lending platform of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending strategies. Mutuum Finance could be worth $1.75 or more by 2026, a 50x return from levels today. Whereas DOGE is dependent on hype, Mutuum Finance’s presale momentum, early-stage utility, and tokenomics are building anticipation that it can offer upside far exceeding meme standards. Dogecoin Nears Critical Breakout Point as Buyers Anticipate Next Giant Move With $0.23 as key support, Dogecoin bulls are hoping to see pressure build to a $0.28 retest, and a clean break above this level would open the door to a rally to $0.43. But a breakdown on current support might send DOGE back to the $0.17–$0.15 demand zone, where buyers might attempt to stage a comeback. As players anticipate DOGE’s next giant leap, the vast majority of long-term players have already set themselves up in early-stage ventures with far higher potential, a trend that is opening plenty of eyes to emerging DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Momentum Keeps Gathering Speed MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.035 in Presale Round 6, a 16.17% increase over the previous round. Interest from investors remains very high, with over 16,670 investors providing over $16.6 million to date. To further enhance platform safety, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers are invited to report bugs. There are four levels of severity in bugs, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, so that problems could be found and resolved promptly. The protocol is built on sound collateral management to protect both the ecosystem and its participants. Some of the key safety features include unlimited collateral ratios, caps on deposits, and caps on lending. Undercollateral positions are closed immediately, and remediation fees and penalties stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the heart of Mutuum Finance’s architecture. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and taking on overcollateralized positions, the protocol achieves maximum capital utilization with robust guards. Reserve requirements serve as a shock absorber for market fluctuations, with overlying reserves being able to be used in higher-risk assets to hedge volatility. Mutuum Finance is restructuring decentralized finance on three critical dimensions: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable borrowing and lending platform is making DeFi accessible to retail and institutional investors alike. In celebration of its growing community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway set to reward 10 winners $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. The action highlights the platform’s intent to recompense early adopters as well as generate greater awareness on the project vision. While DOGE May Multiply 5x, MUTM Could Grow 50x Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most promising high-potential DeFi projects of 2025 after raising well over $16.6 million from over 16,670 investors and offloading more than 50% of its Phase 6 presale for $0.035 per token. Even though Dogecoin (DOGE) offers a maximum of 5x, MUTM’s dual lending system, dynamic LTV, and tight security measures, including a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, are set for potentially 50x growth by 2026. Early birds also have a $100,000 community giveaway and decent ecosystem rewards. Long-term, utility-based profit seekers should lock in MUTM tokens before the presale deadline.

Specifically, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) launched on September 18 at $25.83. By press time, it was trading at $24.15, a decline of about 6.5% since launch. XRPR price chart. Source: TradingView This pullback mirrors a common trend seen with newly listed crypto ETFs, where early liquidity, market-making activity, and initial trading flows often create short-term volatility. Notably, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF received expedited approval due to its unique regulatory structure. Unlike traditional spot crypto ETFs, which can take up to 240 days for SEC review under the Securities Act of 1933, REX-Osprey was structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, shortening the review to around 75 days. The SEC’s recent adoption of generic listing standards for commodity-based ETFs on major exchanges like Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca further streamlined approvals, eliminating the need for individual applications under Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Despite the slow start, XRPR’s listing marks a milestone for U.S. markets, offering mainstream access to XRP through traditional brokerage accounts. Before the U.S. launch, both Brazil and Canada had already introduced spot XRP ETFs in 2025. Brazil’s Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fund began trading in April on the B3 exchange, becoming the world’s first regulated spot XRP ETF. In June, Canadian issuers such as Purpose Investments and Evolve followed suit with launches on the Toronto Stock Exchange, giving investors earlier exposure through regulated products. Pending U.S. spot XRP ETFs The REX-Osprey fund is not the only XRP ETF in the works. Several major asset managers have pending applications with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), with decisions expected in the coming weeks. Broader approvals could significantly expand institutional access to XRP, echoing the effect seen when spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs won regulatory clearance. If more U.S. spot XRP ETFs are approved, alongside potential derivatives such as futures and options on CME, analysts expect stronger inflows that could support long-term price growth. However, short-term performance may remain volatile, as shown by XRPR’s initial 6.5% decline. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.93, up about 3.5% over the past 24 hours, though down 0.68% on the week.

Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, fell below the $110,000 threshold to a market price of $108,500 during the week. This week, the market has experienced a moderate turnaround from its downtrend, with prices rebounding. According to the latest weekly report from crypto exchange Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency market is currently consolidating rather than capitulating. For this reason, the market has remained relatively stable compared to its movement from the past week. Why a Consolidation? As of last week, anyone studying the market charts could easily speculate that the crypto market was en route to a capitulation. For context, a market capitulation occurs when investors rapidly sell their digital assets, even at a loss, out of fear that market prices will not recover. However, this week’s metrics have moved Bitfinex’s analysts to believe that a market consolidation is ongoing. In its latest issue of Bitfinex Alpha, the exchange’s experts highlighted reasons behind the claim. Consolidation occurs when the prices of crypto assets revolve around a specific range of support and resistance levels, following a significant price change. This phase is often characterized by low trading volume, indicating that investors are currently at a stage of market indecisiveness as they remain calm and wait for a price breakout or breakdown. The Bitfinex analysts emphasized that major cryptocurrencies have undergone a similar price movement within the past week. Among the factors that fueled the sudden market movement was the aftereffect of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut on September 17. Capital Inflow Continues Despite the downtrend, the report revealed that investors have continued to scout for cryptocurrencies with promising returns. “Yet, selective rotation into speculative altcoins persisted, reflecting investorsʼ continued search for higher-beta opportunities even as total market capitalisation contracted 5.9 percent on the week to $3.7 trillion, down 12.6 percent from recent highs,” the report stated. This continued capital inflow shows “the structural cycle of the current bull market.” The Bitfinex report highlighted that the ongoing crypto market cycle has outperformed that of the past cycle. Alongside the increased adoption, more countries have allowed companies and investors to delve into crypto. Some governments, like the U.S., have adopted a crypto-friendly stance.

The incident adds to a growing list of high-profile cyberattacks attributed to North Korea’s state-backed cyber units, which have stolen billions of dollars from the digital asset sector in recent years. The breach was first flagged by blockchain analyst ZachXBT, who identified suspicious outflows from SBI Crypto wallet addresses on September 24, 2025. Source: ZachXBT SBI Crypto Theft Adds to $2.2B Stolen by North Korean Hackers in 2025 According to his analysis, approximately $21 million worth of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, was drained from company-linked addresses. The funds were routed through five instant exchanges before being deposited into Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer frequently associated with laundering operations. On-chain records show that the compromised wallets, including addresses beginning with “0x40d7” and “bc1qx0a2k,” were systematically emptied and funneled through laundering channels. Source: ZachXBT ZachXBT noted that the tactics and digital fingerprints used in the SBI Crypto theft closely resemble other intrusions carried out by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) cyber units, commonly known as the Lazarus Group. SBI Crypto is a mining pool and wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Group, one of Japan’s largest financial services conglomerates. Despite the scale of the theft, SBI has not yet publicly disclosed the incident. The use of Tornado Cash in the laundering process has drawn renewed scrutiny. The mixer was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022 due to its role in processing illicit funds, including those linked to North Korea. Earlier this year, however, a U.S. court lifted restrictions on the platform , sparking concerns that state-backed hackers would once again exploit the service to conceal stolen assets. The SBI incident is the latest in a string of North Korea-linked cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, projects, and users. Data compiled by blockchain forensics firms show that North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024 alone. In the first half of 2025, they stole an estimated $2.2 billion, showing the growing sophistication and frequency of these operations. North Korean Crypto Campaigns Expand From Hacks to Fraudulent Employment Schemes Investigations into DPRK cyber campaigns have revealed that they extend far beyond hacking wallets and exchanges. On August 13, ZachXBT published evidence of a covert North Korean employment scheme involving five operatives who posed as blockchain developers. ZachXBT exposes 5 North Korean workers running 30+ fake identities to target crypto projects as anonymous source compromises DPRK IT worker devices, revealing $680K Favrr exploit. #NorthKorea #Lazarus https://t.co/ZmPCIZmVpW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 These operatives allegedly created more than 30 fake identities using government-issued identification, purchased Social Security numbers, and set up accounts on professional networks such as Upwork and LinkedIn. Files obtained included meeting schedules with targeted projects, Google Drive exports, Telegram conversations, and expense spreadsheets listing purchases of VPNs, AI tools, and fake professional accounts. One of the wallets linked to the fake developer ring was tied to the $680,000 exploit of the crypto project Favrr in June 2025, further connecting the group’s activities to financial crimes. The exposure of these tactics has triggered heightened concern in the cryptocurrency sector. In several cases, projects discovered that developers and decision-makers in their teams were, in fact, North Korean operatives using false identities . ZachXBT links North Korean IT workers to over 25 crypto hacks and extortion schemes beyond simple employment fraud. #NorthKorean #Crypto https://t.co/728cysIs5X — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 While some companies, such as Kraken, have successfully identified and blocked suspected North Korean applicants, others have been less successful, with millions lost to fraudulent employment schemes and phishing attacks disguised as job offers. Beyond employment fraud, North Korea has been linked to highly sophisticated malware campaigns. In June, cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos documented the “PylangGhost” campaign , in which Lazarus Group operatives created fake coding tests and video interview platforms designed to infect blockchain developers’ devices. The malware targeted over 80 browser extensions, including popular crypto wallets like MetaMask and Phantom. U.S. law enforcement has responded with seizures and arrests tied to DPRK-linked operations. In June, authorities confiscated $7.7 million in cryptocurrency allegedly earned through covert North Korean IT worker networks. Earlier, the FBI dismantled fake companies such as Blocknovas LLC in South Carolina and Softglide LLC in New York, which had been set up to create legitimate corporate fronts for infiltration campaigns. Binance founder @cz_binance issued urgent warnings about North Korean hackers infiltrating crypto companies through fake job applications, urging companies to 'screen candidates carefully.' #CZ #NorthKorean #Hackers https://t.co/jMdd2aYDjg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 18, 2025 Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also issued a warning in September, stating that North Korean hackers were increasingly infiltrating crypto firms through fake job applications, bribery of contractors, and malware hidden in interview links.

Traders should watch volume and rejection at $117.5K for the next directional signal. Short accumulation concentrated at $115K–$125K, raising near-term downside pressure. Key support at $107.5K; a sustained break risks a slide to $92.5K (approx. 20%). Current price: $116,338 (2.06% daily gain); volatility likely near resistance at $117.5K. Bitcoin price nears $117K as shorts pile in; watch resistance and support levels closely — read analysis and trade implications now. What is driving Bitcoin’s price near $117K? Bitcoin price is approaching a critical resistance band after a July–September rally, with traders accumulating heavy shorts between $115K and $125K. Short positioning and repeated rejections at ~117.5K are increasing volatility and making the next directional move highly conditional on volume and support tests. How are shorts influencing Bitcoin’s near-term outlook? Short accumulation by prominent traders has concentrated selling pressure in the upper $100Ks. Doctor Profit publicly disclosed heavy shorts between $115K–$117K, stating that further short entries may be added if price revisits higher levels. This creates a resistance zone where short liquidation or continuation could amplify moves. What are the key technical zones for Bitcoin? Technical levels are clear: resistance is defined between $115,000 and $125,000 with notable rejection near $117,500. Immediate support sits at $107,500; failure there would target a next zone near $92,500. Price history shows consolidation between $107.5K and $115K across August–September, confirming those levels’ significance. How likely is a 20% pullback if support breaks? Historical pullbacks from failed range breaks often reach prior consolidation lows. A breach of $107.5K would expose a mechanical downside path to $92.5K, roughly a 20% decline from current levels. Risk-management plans should account for increased volatility and set stop-loss levels consistent with account sizing. Bitcoin nears $117K with heavy shorts piling in as traders eye resistance at $115K–$125K and key support at $107.5K for next moves. Bitcoin faces mounting shorts as Doctor Profit targets the $115K–$125K range while bulls struggle to clear $117.5K resistance. Support near $107.5K holds firm but a drop could trigger a 20% slide toward $92.5K, raising downside risks for traders. Market sentiment remains split with consolidation signaling a decisive breakout or breakdown as volatility intensifies near resistance. Bitcoin’s recent rally toward $117,000 has triggered renewed caution. On X, trader Doctor Profit confirmed concentrated short entries between $115,000 and $117,000 and indicated readiness to accumulate further shorts if the market revisits higher levels. The live Bitcoin price is $116,338, up 2.06% on the day, and price action now sits at a technical inflection point. Doctor Profit clarified: “Most of short accumulations been taken from 115-117k so far which I consider as enough. Eyeing for higher if market allows to visit to accumulate more shorts to have an overall higher average short entry.” That public positioning increases the probability of layered resistance and potential short squeezes if momentum shifts. What does market sentiment say about the next move? Volume analysis shows strong green candles during July’s advance, then consolidation during August–September. Currently, range-bound trading suggests traders are seeking confirmation before committing. A decisive breakout above $117.5K with rising volume would favor bulls, while a break under $107.5K would validate the downside scenario. Source: Doctor Profit Frequently Asked Questions What immediate levels should traders watch for Bitcoin? Watch resistance at $115K–$125K (near-term ceiling) and support at $107.5K (key floor). A close above 117.5K with volume favors continuation; a break below 107.5K risks a move toward 92.5K. How can traders manage risk with heavy shorts present? Use size limits, staggered stop losses, and defined risk-reward plans. Monitor on-chain flows and options open interest for signs of short covering or forced liquidations. Key Takeaways Short concentration : Heavy shorts between $115K–$125K create meaningful resistance. Critical support : $107.5K is the primary support; loss of this level exposes a ~20% decline to $92.5K. Actionable insight : Traders should wait for confirmation (volume and decisive close) before initiating directional trades.

The rally attracted significant trader attention and pushed trading volumes to nearly three times their normal levels. The token's price climbed from $0.000009138 to $0.000009652 at the time of writing. Technical analysis data shows volatility expanded by more than 7% during the move. Trading volume reached 5.61 trillion tokens, substantially exceeding the daily average of 1.89 trillion tokens. The price breakthrough pushed PEPE through established resistance levels. The token maintained its position above $0.000009600 by the end of the rally. Market participants viewed the sustained price action as a signal of continued buying pressure. Whale Activity Signals Confidence in PEPE Data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen reveals strategic accumulation by large holders preceded the price surge. The top 100 non-exchange Ethereum addresses increased their PEPE holdings by 3.4% over the past 30 days. Exchange wallets showed contrasting behavior during the same period. These addresses experienced a 2% decline in PEPE holdings. The pattern suggests investors moved tokens from exchanges to private wallets for longer-term holding. This shift in token distribution typically indicates reduced selling pressure. Whales removing assets from exchanges often precedes price appreciation. The accumulation pattern developed gradually before the recent breakout occurred. Large holders demonstrating confidence in an asset frequently influence retail trader sentiment. The whale activity provided support for the token before broader market participation drove the rally. Technical Levels and Market Structure Current support for PEPE sits near the $0.00000900 level. This price point represents a key zone where buyers previously entered the market. Traders will monitor this level for signs of demand if prices retreat. Resistance has formed around the session high of $0.000009681. Breaking above this level could open the path to further gains. The token showed consolidation patterns toward the end of the rally. Price consolidation after a strong move often precedes another directional push. Traders analyze these patterns to anticipate potential breakouts or reversals. The current structure suggests the market is digesting recent gains. Volume patterns during the rally indicated genuine buying interest rather than speculative spikes. Sustained high volume typically supports continued price movement. The surge exceeded typical daily activity by a significant margin. Futures Market Shows Growing Interest Open interest in PEPE futures products has climbed steadily. CoinGlass data shows futures open interest now approaches $600 million. This metric tracks the total value of outstanding futures contracts. Rising open interest alongside price increases confirms growing market participation . Traders use futures products for both speculation and hedging strategies.

The selected participants will receive $12,000 in stablecoins. Coinbase and GiveDirectly will join forces for a new pilot testing a form of universal basic income. Selected New York residents will receive a no-strings-attached grant, with one condition- it would be paid out in USDC crypto tokens. The program has picked 160 low-income residents of New York, who will receive $12,000 spread over five months. The grant will launch with a lump sum of $8,000 to encourage larger investments in housing or education. Recipients will then receive five more smaller deposits of $800, testing the hypothesis that a lump sum at the beginning of the grant can lead to better outcomes. The new program arrives around two years after Coinbase abandoned its GiveCrypto program . The remaining $2.6M in the program was sent to GiveDirectly, to seed the New York program. The Coinbase program does not limit the way of spending the USDC grant Each participant will receive the tokens in a Coinbase wallet, with the ability to withdraw to a bank account, move to another wallet, or spend via a crypto card. The program will be administered by GiveDirectly, with the funds supplied by Coinbase. There are no limitations on the way of spending the funds, though the UBI experiment will track the outcomes. The initiative is part of the UBI movement, testing its main thesis that no-strings-attached donations are a better tool for life improvement than targeted grants. The funds were distributed via applications and a lottery to pick the final 160 participants. One of them, Luis Acero, has already lost thousands in crypto, reported Bloomberg. The New York program, dubbed Future First, will explore the potential of stablecoins to be spent in a way that benefits the recipients. The program will track for improvements in housing situations or educational options. Can crypto solve UBI? Multiple crypto projects have attempted to build a form of UBI, including a token with the same ticker. Some have tried airdrops or referral-based distribution. David Sachs denies the possibility that crypto can bring UBI, stating it’s a fantasy that will never happen. Volatile crypto is also limited in its ability to support charity. The one possibility is the expansion of stablecoins, linked to the growing DeFi economy. The US Genius Act has set expectations for the creation of corporate stablecoins, offering a more controllable vehicle for UBI. Crypto holds additional complexity and some limitations on wallet usage. USDC is a fully regulated and transparent token that behaves as close as possible to cash, though the holders may still need to pay transaction fees. The main fear for the Future Forward program is that the funds may be used for further risky bets on crypto. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

52529728,593008,1759345212,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Ex-Ripple Exec Reveals How CBDC Development Could Affect XRP’s Growth,https://bitcoinist.com/ex-ripple-exec-cbdc-xrp-growth/,"A former Ripple executive is speaking out about how the firm’s previous work with central bank digital currencies, also known as CBDCs, may help XRP’s growth . Welfare also pointed out that the next step is making CBDCs, stablecoins, and other forms of digital money work together. If this happens, XRP could benefit and play a bigger role in the market. Ripple’s CBDC Pilots Shaped XRP Ledger Development In a post shared on X, Anthony Welfare, who worked as an adviser for the fintech company, explained that Ripple’s CBDC trials between 2021 and 2024 had a significant impact on the XRP Ledger. The first trials began in 2021 with Bhutan and Palau. By 2023, Ripple had also formed partnerships with the central banks of Montenegro and Colombia. In the same year, the company announced a platform designed for central bank digital currencies, built on top of the XRP Ledger . According to Welfare, the lessons from this period directly shaped the XRP Ledger’s ability to support stablecoins, which are now gaining popularity, as well as new forms of digital payments that people and businesses increasingly want each day. He said the experiments were not a waste, even though Ripple is no longer speaking as much about CBDCs. CBDC Lessons Drive Current Focus On Stablecoins By 2025, Ripple’s public approach began to change. In February this year, the company redesigned its website and made no mention of CBDCs, a move that fueled speculation it was pulling back from that area. Still, Welfare insists that even with Ripple’s 2025 website update, which leaves out any mention of CBDCs, it does not mean the earlier work has no value. The knowledge gained during those years has prepared the XRP Ledger to support stablecoins , which are now growing at record speed. In December 2024, Ripple entered this space with the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD), its own institutional-grade stablecoin, on both the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain, indicating that the fintech company could be targeting a broader range of use cases. According to Welfare, the reason Ripple could move into stablecoins so strongly is because of the lessons it had learned during the CBDC years, which he says laid the groundwork for the growth of stablecoins that the market is now experiencing. Welfare said XRP’s future depends on interoperability, where CBDCs, stablecoins, and tokenized deposits can work together. He explained that networks capable of connecting different types of digital money will lead the way, and that Ripple’s earlier CBDC pilots had prepared the XRP Ledger for this future. In his view, CBDCs, stablecoins, and tokenized deposits must work in tandem so that users can easily transfer money between them. He suggested that the XRP Ledger is already well-positioned for this future due to the foundation Ripple laid in its CBDC pilots.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|WALLET|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 19:00:12

This momentum has positively impacted major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB), which have seen average increases of around 3% in what may signal the onset of a new altcoin season. Crypto Prices Surge Amidst US Government Shutdown The surge in crypto prices coincided with political developments as the US Senate’s failure to pass a temporary funding bill resulted in a government shutdown shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep Such uncertainty often leads investors to seek alternatives to the US dollar, and cryptocurrencies are increasingly viewed as a hedge against economic instability. On Wednesday, the dollar remained stable against a basket of other currencies, further bolstering the appeal of digital assets. Historically, October has been a favorable month for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency finishing in positive territory 10 out of the past 12 years. Joel Kruger from LMAX Group also noted that Q4 has consistently been the strongest seasonal period for cryptocurrencies, adding to the bullish sentiment. However, not all analysts share the same optimistic outlook. Extended Bull Cycle For Bitcoin? Ash Crypto expressed caution, suggesting that the current rally might be a precursor to a more significant downturn, predicting a potential drop that could see Bitcoin retrace to around $106,000 and Ethereum to near $3,800. This anticipated correction, he argues, could liquidate overly optimistic positions, particularly among retail investors. He forecasts that this phase of uncertainty could persist until mid-October, potentially leading to a market rebound when bearish sentiment peaks.

The general sentiment remains that if the market can navigate through the short-term fluctuations, a substantial rally could occur, potentially driving Bitcoin to prices between $150,000 and $180,000, with Ethereum reaching between $8,000 and $12,000. According to Davis, such a scenario, in which could result in a major 53% and 200% for BTC and ETH respectively, could catalyze a significant altcoin season, with some assets potentially increasing in value by 10 to 50 times within just a few months. When writing, Bitcoin trades at $117,130, further posting gains of nearly 8% on the monthly time frame.

The move comes after weeks of tight consolidation that began in July, a period marked by choppy trading and indecision. Now, with momentum showing signs of returning, many analysts believe the next breakout could be aggressive, setting the tone for the final quarter of the year. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Long: Bybit Traders Push BTC Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Above 24 The reclaim of $115,000 has reignited bullish sentiment, with traders closely watching whether Bitcoin can build a base above this threshold and aim for the next major resistance at $117,500. Historically, prolonged consolidation phases have often preceded strong directional moves, and the current setup suggests that volatility could soon accelerate. Adding weight to the bullish narrative, fresh data reveals that Metaplanet has expanded its Bitcoin treasury once again. The firm added 5,268 BTC to its holdings, bringing its total stash to 30,823 BTC. This significant purchase highlights growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin, even as prices remain locked in a range. Metaplanet Becomes 4th Largest Bitcoin Holder Top analyst Maartunn highlighted that Metaplanet’s latest purchase has further cemented its position among the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. With the addition of 5,268 BTC this week, Metaplanet’s treasury now stands at 30,823 BTC. This accumulation places the firm as the 4th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only industry giants such as Strategy (prev. MicroStrategy) and a few other leading institutions. The move underscores the growing appetite for Bitcoin among companies looking to diversify reserves and position themselves ahead of what many see as a long-term adoption cycle. This development comes at a crucial time for the market. Bitcoin has recently reclaimed the $115,000 level, sparking fresh optimism after months of consolidation. Analysts point out that institutional moves like Metaplanet’s provide strong underlying support, reinforcing the argument that Bitcoin remains attractive even at elevated prices. The coming days will be critical, as several analysts expect Bitcoin to continue pushing upward through October. Historically, this month has delivered some of the strongest rallies for BTC, earning the nickname “Uptober” within the community. If the pattern repeats, Metaplanet’s accumulation could prove to be well-timed, fueling further confidence in the asset.

On the daily chart, the price has reclaimed both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, signaling renewed strength from buyers. This rebound has put Bitcoin within striking distance of the $117,500 resistance zone, highlighted in yellow, which has repeatedly capped rallies since July. A decisive breakout above this level would represent a major shift in momentum, potentially opening the path toward $120,000 and retests of the late-summer highs above $125,000. The fact that BTC has recovered so quickly from last week’s weakness underscores strong demand at lower levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Retreats: 30D Change Falls To Lowest Level Since July However, the market is not free of risk. The $117,500 level remains a critical barrier, and failure to clear it could invite profit-taking that pulls the price back toward $114,000 or even $112,000. The 200-day moving average (red), currently trending near $105,000, continues to provide a deeper layer of support that reinforces the broader uptrend.

The Fusaka hard fork, which arrived just a few months after the Pectra update, aims to make Ethereum more affordable, especially for enterprise users. Prominent among the innovations is PeerDAS, which allows validators to control only a portion of data blocks (a “blob”) rather than entire blocks. This approach will reduce costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Related News: The Big Day Has Arrived: Collapsed Exchange FTX to Distribute $1.6 Billion to Creditors! Here Are the Details Holesky was a critical testnet launched in 2023, with a validator structure similar to the Ethereum mainnet. However, the network has experienced reliability issues in recent months and will be shut down after the Fusaka update. Following Fusaka's activation on the mainnet, Holesky will be shut down within two weeks. The next rounds of testing will take place on October 14 and 28. Once these phases are completed, the developers will announce the final decision on Fusaka's mainnet launch date. “Holesky is complete!

Pundit Discusses Possibility,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-skyrocket-starting-in-october-pundit-discusses-possibility/,"As October begins, all eyes are on XRP . The digital asset has historically shown strength in the final quarter of the year, and excitement is building over whether 2025 will repeat that trend. Traders are debating if XRP is positioned for a dramatic rally, with some analysts pointing to fresh catalysts that could fuel a surge. Although progress is expected, the journey ahead may involve fluctuations before significant upside potential materializes. Where XRP Stands Now XRP entered October trading just below $2.90 , after weeks of steady performance. According to some analysts, there’s a risk of short-term weakness before a rally can take hold and build. Popular crypto commentator Austin Hilton addressed this in a recent video, saying, “Right now XRP is trading sub $2.90, we might see some retracement back to $2.50, we could even see two dollars because they’re still on the table.” Will XRP skyrocket starting in October? Let’s talk about if this is even a possibility. pic.twitter.com/IuvobFchhK — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 30, 2025 Hilton described these potential dips as part of a broader setup rather than a long-term concern. “I think that is the last flush if it happens towards the middle [and] end of October, I think we see XRP skyrocketing,” he explained. What Could Spark a Rally Much of the bullish case for XRP rests on wider market momentum and regulatory progress. Hilton emphasized that XRP’s performance will not happen in isolation, stating, “It is tied to Bitcoin, XRP’s not gonna go to $20 by itself, it has to go up in the context of an overall general crypto bull run.” Among the potential catalysts are upcoming regulatory decisions in the United States and the possibility of new exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals. Hilton directly connected these developments to his price outlook: “We’ve got some stuff coming up in October, a lot of XRP ETF approval, so forth and so on.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, Ripple’s growing role in cross-border payments , ongoing acquisitions, and the anticipated transition away from legacy systems such as SWIFT add weight to the long-term bullish narrative. These fundamental drivers could enhance the impact of a market-wide rally if conditions align. The Price Projections Hilton has set out bold targets for XRP. He described $10 by the end of 2025 as essentially inevitable, calling it “a done deal.” But he believes the upside could be far greater, adding, “I think it’s more likely to see XRP go to 15 or 20 dollars by the end of the fourth quarter.” Such a move would represent a gain of five to seven times from current levels. Risks to Watch Despite the positive outlook, significant risks remain. If Bitcoin stalls below key resistance levels, XRP is unlikely to sustain momentum. A lack of regulatory clarity or delays in ETF approvals could also cool investor enthusiasm. Hilton himself acknowledged that the rally depends on “the context of an overall general crypto bull run.” In conclusion, whether XRP skyrockets starting in October will depend on how these factors unfold. A Bitcoin-led surge, combined with favorable regulatory outcomes, could send XRP into its strongest quarter in years. As Hilton summed it up, “Can XRP skyrocket? Yeah, if the cards play as they should.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to a report from the Financial Times , Bailey described stablecoins as a technology that could separate money holding from credit provision, potentially reducing the role of commercial banks in the economy. The governor believes that this shift would require careful management to preserve the link between money and credit creation that underpins economic activity. His intervention coincides with the Bank of England’s preparation to publish a consultation paper on its systemic stablecoin regime, which will set standards for tokens used at scale for everyday payments or for settling tokenized financial markets. Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England (Source: Semafor ) BoE Proposes Access to Central Bank Accounts Amid Deposit Drain Concerns Bailey explained that Britain’s financial system currently combines money holding with credit provision through fractional reserve banking, where commercial bank deposits directly support lending to households and companies. He noted that stablecoins could allow a different arrangement where money and credit provision are partially separated, with banks and stablecoins coexisting while non-banks carry out more lending activity. The central bank has also proposed ownership limits of £10,000 to £20,000 for people and £10 million for businesses on systemic stablecoins. Sasha Mills, the Bank’s executive director for financial market infrastructure, said the limits would “mitigate financial stability risks stemming from large and rapid outflows of deposits from the banking sector” . Bailey particularly stressed that backing assets for stablecoins must be free of credit, interest, and exchange rate risk to ensure value stability, and must be accompanied by insurance schemes and statutory resolution arrangements similar to bank deposits. He added that exchange terms must be known , consistent, and directly convertible into other forms of money rather than dependent on crypto exchanges and their business terms. The governor acknowledged that the technology behind stablecoins is new but poses an old central banking question about ensuring the link between money and credit creation. Crypto Industry Pushes Back Against the Proposed Stablecoin Cap Tom Duff Gordon, vice-president of international policy at Coinbase, told the Financial Times that “imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for UK savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling” and that no other major jurisdiction has deemed caps necessary. Similarly, Simon Jennings, executive director of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council , argued that “limits simply don’t work in practice” because stablecoin issuers cannot monitor token holders in real time. UK’s central bank wants to cap how much stablecoin people can hold, but crypto groups are fighting back, warning the move could choke innovation and leave Britain trailing rivals. #bankofengland #stablecoins https://t.co/lSNMQrEp7z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 He warned that enforcing caps would require costly new systems such as digital IDs or constant coordination between wallets. Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi, director of policy at The Payments Association, also said, “just as there are no limits on cash, bank accounts, or e-money, there is no reason beyond scepticism to impose limits on stablecoin ownership” . The criticism threatens to deepen tensions between the Bank of England and the Treasury after Chancellor Rachel Reeves committed in her Mansion House speech to “drive forward developments in blockchain technology, including tokenised securities and stablecoins.” Given the ongoing criticism, the Bank of England has clarified that its proposed limits could be “transitional” as the financial system adjusts to the growth of digital money. The global stablecoin market has grown to $298 billion and received a major boost after Congress passed the GENIUS Act in July, introducing a regulatory framework expected to embed stablecoins as a key part of the U.S. financial system. Meanwhile, Coinbase has forecast that the stablecoin market could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028 and has recently published research titled “Beyond the Deposit Debate,” challenging the banking industry’s claims that stablecoins threaten traditional financial stability. The exchange called the “deposit erosion” narrative a myth designed to protect banks’ $187 billion annual payment processing monopoly. Coinbase argues that banks currently park $3.3 trillion in Federal Reserve reserves, earning $176 billion risk-free annually, rather than extending additional loans. Coinbase published a defense against banking claims that stablecoins threaten financial stability, calling the ""deposit erosion"" narrative a ""myth"" protecting banks' $187 billion monopoly. #Coinbase #Stablecoin https://t.co/Kpshr7e1K2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 The post Bank of England Governor Says Stablecoins Could Reduce UK Reliance on Commercial Banks – Could It? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|CBOE|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-01 19:05:37

IBIT led daily ETF inflows and held 3.84% of circulating Bitcoin. Total U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold ~6.6% of supply, strengthening bid-side pressure. Options Open Interest Delta hit $10.65B with IBIT controlling ~95% of that delta. BlackRock IBIT drives Bitcoin momentum — see ETF flows and options data; read analysis and key takeaways for investors. Learn more. How is BlackRock’s IBIT driving Bitcoin’s momentum? BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest driver of institutional Bitcoin demand, contributing the biggest share of daily spot ETF inflows and controlling a disproportionate share of options open interest. This concentration has pushed ETF holdings to roughly 6.6% of circulating BTC and reinforced bullish price pressure. What do ETF inflows and options activity reveal about institutional demand? ETF inflows show steady accumulation: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $429.96 million in 24-hour inflows, with IBIT contributing $199.43 million. Options metrics are equally telling — Total Open Interest Delta reached $10.65 billion and the Call/Put Ratio climbed to 4.4, indicating heavy bullish positioning. A closer look showed that IBIT could impact Bitcoin more. Source: Eric Balchunas/ X IBIT options volume surges — what does the derivatives market show? The options market displayed a pronounced bullish tilt. Total Open Interest Delta reached $10.65 billion at press time, with the Call/Put Ratio near 4.4 — more than four times neutral — signaling that calls far outnumber puts. IBIT controlled over 95% of this Open Interest Delta, valued near $10.45 billion. By comparison, Grayscale’s exposure stood close to $200 million, according to SosoValue. Source: SosoValue Why does IBIT’s ETF dominance matter for price discovery? IBIT accounted for more than 50% of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market and represented 3.84% of the circulating Bitcoin supply. High concentration in a single product can magnify price moves as large inflows require executing through underlying markets. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas described the scale as unprecedented, noting that an equity ETF would need roughly $2.2 trillion to match similar ownership of its underlying assets for comparison. In the past 24 hours, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $429.96 million in inflows, with IBIT contributing $199.43 million. That reinforced its role as the leading driver of institutional demand. Source: SosoValue When could broader market data confirm sustained upside? CryptoQuant data showed the Funds Market Premium flipped positive at a 0.24 reading, reflecting stronger bid pressure. Total ETF holdings hovered near 1.3 million BTC, and daily trading volume topped $4.6 billion. At press time, Bitcoin traded near $116,228, with $120,000 within reach if momentum persisted and ETF-driven bids continued to absorb available supply. Source: CryptoQuant Frequently Asked Questions How much of Bitcoin does IBIT hold? IBIT holds approximately 3.84% of circulating Bitcoin, making it the single largest institutional holder among U.S. spot ETFs and a material force in price formation. Are ETF inflows driving the current rally? ETF inflows are a major contributor: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs added roughly $430 million in 24 hours, and institutional products like IBIT are absorbing available supply and supporting higher bids. What do options metrics imply about near-term risk? A high Call/Put Ratio (about 4.4) and elevated Open Interest Delta ($10.65B) indicate strong bullish bets; however, concentrated positioning can increase short-term volatility on any surprise flows or option expiries. Key Takeaways IBIT dominance : IBIT led inflows and controls a disproportionate share of ETF and options exposure. Institutional accumulation : U.S. spot ETFs now represent ~6.6% of supply, with combined institutional holdings adding to price support. Watch derivatives : Options Open Interest Delta and Call/Put ratios signal bullish sentiment but raise volatility risk around expiries. Conclusion BlackRock’s IBIT has become a central force in Bitcoin’s current move, combining large ETF inflows with dominant options exposure to concentrate institutional demand. Market indicators from CryptoQuant and SosoValue suggest a supportive backdrop, though concentrated positioning can amplify short-term moves. Monitor inflows and derivatives data for confirmation of sustained upside. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/blackrock-ibit-bitcoin-momentum"" }, ""headline"": ""BlackRock’s IBIT Dominance Fuels Bitcoin Rally as ETFs and Options Drive Demand"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2GJrLoW0AA0xnp.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T11:30:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T11:30:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""BlackRock’s IBIT led ETF inflows and dominated options activity, holding 3.84% of circulating BTC and driving institutional accumulation across markets.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How is BlackRock's IBIT influencing Bitcoin's price?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""IBIT is influencing price by leading large spot ETF inflows and controlling a big share of options open interest, which concentrates institutional demand and supports higher bids."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What do options metrics like Call/Put Ratio indicate?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A high Call/Put Ratio and elevated Open Interest Delta point to bullish positioning; they indicate market participants expect upside but can also raise short-term volatility around expiries."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much Bitcoin do U.S. spot ETFs hold collectively?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs hold about 6.6% of the circulating supply, with total ETF holdings near 1.3 million BTC."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor IBIT-driven Bitcoin momentum"", ""description"": ""Steps to track ETF flows, options activity, and market premiums to assess IBIT's impact on Bitcoin."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track daily ETF inflows"", ""text"": ""Check daily U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and IBIT's share to see how quickly supply is being absorbed."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor options open interest"", ""text"": ""Watch Total Open Interest Delta and the Call/Put Ratio for signs of concentrated bullish or bearish bets."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch market premium and holdings"", ""text"": ""Use funds market premium readings and total ETF holdings to gauge bid pressure and supply constraints."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess volatility around expiries"", ""text"": ""Be cautious during large option expiries, which can produce outsized price moves if positioning is heavily skewed."" } ]}",Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 19:08:04

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to increase to a maximum level of $0.3195 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. In 2025, Pi Network is entering a crucial stage, despite market sentiment remaining cautious; on-chain activity and ecosystem growth continue to develop. Notably, Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.2234 on September 22, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. The Passkey Update introduced stronger wallet security through Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN authentication ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. Meanwhile, the Pi Hackathon 2025 has reached its halfway point, with developers showcasing projects that could expand the Pi ecosystem. At the same time, Pi has drawn attention from a partnership with Sign Protocol, backed by Binance’s venture arm, fueling speculation of a potential Binance listing. Adding to the momentum, co-founder Chengdiao Fan is scheduled to deliver a keynote at TOKEN2049 in Singapore, a high-profile event expected to influence investor confidence. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031.

Pi shows signs of short-term recovery, but momentum remains weak. Resistance stands at $0.28–$0.30, while support holds near $0.26–$0.25. On October 1, 2025, Pi Network price analysis shows a bullish recovery, with PI trading at $0.2718, up 2.80% from the last 24-hour close at $0.2644. The rebound signals improving market sentiment after recent weakness, as buyers pushed the price higher in the day session. Pi now faces resistance near $0.30–$0.32, where selling pressure is expected to intensify unless momentum strengthens further. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart shows that Pi is trading at $0.2718, posting a 2.80% gain in the last 24 hours. The recovery comes after a recent downtrend, but the market still trades below the key $0.30 resistance zone, keeping sentiment cautious. The RSI is at 37.56 (average line at 37.44), which is still in bearish territory below 50, indicating that Pi remains close to oversold conditions but with a slight improvement in momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD line is –0.0285, just above the signal line at –0.0315, with a small green histogram of 0.0030. This indicates bearish momentum is fading, and a moderate bullish crossover may be developing. This suggests that bearish momentum is fading, though buyers are not yet strong enough to confirm a strong reversal. Immediate resistance is now seen at $0.30–$0.32, while support holds near $0.25–$0.26. A move above $0.28 would improve the short-term outlook, but failure to sustain above current levels could invite another retest of support. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading at $0.2716, down 0.88% in the latest session. Price action reflects weakness as sellers keep pushing below $0.28.The RSI stands at 47.94, with the average line at 52.97. This is just below the neutral 50 level, showing fading momentum and a tilt toward bearish sentiment. The MACD line is at 0.0008, equal to the signal line at 0.0008, while the histogram is slightly negative at –0.0001. This reflects a flat trend with no clear momentum, signaling indecision in the market. Immediate resistance is seen near $0.28–$0.30, while support remains strong at $0.26. A breakdown below $0.26 could expose $0.22, but if Pi can regain $0.28, it may retest the $0.30 zone.

Pi price is likely to stay in consolidation, with resistance at $0.28–$0.30 and support around $0.26–$0.22. A move above $0.28 could signal short-term bullish momentum, while a drop below $0.26 may trigger further downside. Confirmation of trend direction will depend on RSI breaking above 50 or a stronger MACD crossover. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today mainly due to whale accumulation, with a single wallet buying over 331 million PI (~$148.5) since May, reducing sell pressure. Optimism is also supported by anticipation of the 2025 Open Network update, which could improve utility and liquidity. Short-term technical indicators show a bullish rebound above key moving averages, adding momentum to the rally. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and continuous token unlocks, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network co-founder Dr. Chengdiao Fan is set to deliver a keynote address at TOKEN2049 Singapore, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency conferences.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. As of October 1, 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-01 19:09:53

In a report published Wednesday, research analyst Will Owens argues that the sector has matured into a cultural and economic force in its own right. Galaxy estimates digital assets tied to memes now represent a meaningful share of trading activity and investor interest, extending well beyond Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. A cultural and trading phenomenon Owens wrote that memecoins “capture attention and capital” by blending humor with financial speculation, making them uniquely effective at onboarding new participants into crypto. Galaxy’s research cites the growing number of users interacting with memecoins not only as traders but also as community members who build narratives, memes and digital identities around the tokens. On the trading side, Owens notes that memecoins consistently generate some of the highest liquidity and fee volumes in the industry, rivaling mainstream assets. Their volatility, he added, has turned them into a reliable revenue source for exchanges and liquidity providers. Pump.fun and infrastructure shifts One of the most striking developments highlighted in the report is the rise of Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform that lets anyone launch a memecoin in minutes. Galaxy said the service has turbocharged activity in 2025, creating thousands of new tokens and contributing to record-high fee generation on Solana. While many of these tokens fade quickly, Owens argued the platform illustrates how memecoins are reshaping crypto’s infrastructure. He believes that by driving experimentation in token issuance, liquidity bootstrapping and trading mechanics, memecoins are helping to pressure-test blockchain ecosystems at scale.

A disagreement between Senate Republicans and Democrats over healthcare spending resulted in the rejection of last-minute budget proposals, and the government was officially shut down today. The shutdown means hundreds of thousands of federal employees and active-duty military members will be without their paychecks, and the operations of institutions like national parks and the Smithsonian will be thrown into limbo. While services like Social Security payments and passport applications will continue, there may be delays. How Has Bitcoin Been Affected Before? Historical data suggests that government shutdowns don't directly negatively impact crypto markets. For example, during the longest government shutdown, which lasted 35 days between 2018 and 2019, the price of Bitcoin fell approximately 6%, trading sideways in the $3,575-$3,800 range. During this period, BTC was already trading within a narrow range following a 50% pullback in the previous months. Related News: A Major Exchange Announced It Has Increased Its Investment in a Surprise Altcoin Analysts state that government shutdowns are not a decisive catalyst for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the short term, with global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory processes, and investor risk appetite determining the direction of the market. The length of this shutdown is uncertain. While historically government shutdowns lasting longer than two weeks are rare, they have become increasingly frequent over the past 30 years. The 2018 shutdown cost the US economy approximately $3 billion in GDP. This time, Congress has failed to pass budgets for any of its agencies, potentially complicating the process even further. *This is not investment advice.

While Nvidia has led this market, major cloud computing companies, including Microsoft, have started creating their own specialized chips. During a fireside discussion at Italian Tech Week moderated by CNBC, Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer, explained the company’s approach to AI chips. Currently, Microsoft relies mainly on Nvidia and AMD chips in its data centers. The company’s priority has been selecting the right semiconductors that deliver “the best price performance” for each chip. Scott says they’re flexible about chip choices. Nvidia has simply offered the best performance for the price over the years. They’re willing to look at any supplier to make sure they have enough capacity for the demand. Meanwhile, Microsoft has already started incorporating some of its own chips into its operations. The company introduced the Azure Maia AI Accelerator in 2023, built for AI workloads, along with the Cobalt CPU. Reports indicate the company is developing its next batch of semiconductor products. Just last week, Microsoft revealed new cooling technology that uses “microfluids” to address chip overheating problems. When questioned whether Microsoft’s long-term goal is to use mostly its own chips in company data centers, Scott responded: “Absolutely,” noting that the company already uses “lots of Microsoft” silicon currently. Custom chips are just the beginning According to Scott, the chip strategy is part of a broader plan to eventually create a complete system for data centers. Scott explains that it goes beyond just the hardware. The focus is on networking, cooling systems, and having the flexibility to make choices that best match computing power to whatever tasks are being run. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are all creating custom chips, not only to reduce their dependence on Nvidia and AMD, but also to better tailor the hardware to their specific requirements. Major technology companies, including Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, have pledged over $300 billion in capital expenditures this year, with a large portion directed toward AI investments as they attempt to keep up with surging AI demand. Severe Computing Shortages Persist Scott pointed out that computing capacity remains in short supply. Scott says calling it a massive shortage of computing power doesn’t even capture the full scale. Since ChatGPT’s launch, building capacity quickly enough has been nearly impossible. Microsoft has been expanding capacity through new data centers , but the CTO cautioned that it still falls short of meeting demand. Scott mentioned that even their most aggressive predictions keep falling short. They’ve rolled out huge amounts of capacity recently, and the expansion will be even bigger in the next few years.

Data from SoSoValue shows ETFs recorded $429.9 million in net inflows on September 30, marking the second consecutive day of gains and driving October’s early momentum. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $199.43 million, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB at $105.74 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $54.7 million, bringing the total value traded to $3.26 billion. Bitcoin $116K Push Paints a “Squeeze Fakeout” as Analysts Warn of CME Gap and Bearish Reversal Traders are now closely watching two key liquidity clusters, one lower near $107K, where billions of dollars in long positions could still be liquidated, and another higher around $118K, where shorts could be forced to cover. Crypto trader TradeWithThanos argues that the recent pump to $116K was designed to spark euphoria, setting a new monthly high before selling off to close the CME gap. He expects resistance between $117,500 and $119,000, with a potential move lower toward the $111K–$112K range, where liquidity and an unfilled CME gap remain. Another analyst described the move as a “squeeze fakeout” on the daily timeframe, where a breakout with strong volume quickly reverses, trapping traders before establishing a new trend.

Historically, $BTC prices have risen in October for 10 out of the past 12 years. pic.twitter.com/wTXKWKnENT — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 1, 2025 In the short term, professional trader Ezy Bitcoin pointed out the importance of CME futures gaps. Using the CrossX indicator , he noted that gaps remain below $112K and emphasized that every gap in the past five months has been filled. “ So, if we get a small pullback here, I see it as a solid opportunity to accumulate more before the next big move ,” he said. This view suggests that while a correction may come first, the next upward leg could be far stronger, with Fibonacci projections pointing as high as $155,000 . Is it #Pumptober again?

Data from CryptoQuant shows that August and September tend to post flat or negative returns (−0.54% and −4.16% on average), while October (+29.9%), November (+37.5%), and December consistently deliver outsized gains. The MVRV ratio , which tracks how far BTC’s market price has diverged from its average on-chain cost basis, also supports this bullish narrative. Historically, MVRV hovers near 1.8 most of the year, but climbs above 1.9 in October and approaches 2.0 by December, reflecting stronger demand and investor profitability. Is it #Pumptober again?

Even if Bitcoin retests the $111K–$112K zone, analysts say it could form the base for a stronger rally into the year-end. Further supporting this thesis, Lookonchain noted that Bitcoin closed September with a 5.35% gain, which is historically a precursor to bullish Octobers. Is it #Pumptober again?

Glassnode identifies $122,000 as the first “ heated zone ” where profit-taking could intensify, and $138,000 as the “ overheated zone ,” a level often associated with cycle peaks. Elliott Wave Outlines Bitcoin’s Path Toward $125K Before $150K Target On the technical front, the daily chart reveals an Elliott Wave structure combined with key support and resistance zones following the move above $116K. The “ Important Demand Zone ” around $96,000–$98,000 formed the foundation for the current rally, while the “ Critical Bullish Support Level ” near $106,000 has acted as a defensive line for sustaining momentum.

Elliott Wave counts suggest Bitcoin has completed waves A, B, and C in a corrective phase, followed by an impulsive five-wave advance. If this structure holds, BTC could see corrective action in the $120,000–$125,000 range before testing whether sufficient demand exists to extend toward $145,000–$150,000.

Zcash surged 63% in 24 hours to ~$121. Zcash gained 107% over seven days and hit a three-year high. Zcash market cap is > $1.8B; still ~96% below its 2016 all‑time high near $3,193. Zcash rebound: privacy-driven surge to ~$121; 63% daily gain and 107% weekly — read the reasons and key takeaways. Learn more from COINOTAG. What caused the Zcash rebound and sudden surge? Zcash rebound was triggered by renewed demand for privacy primitives and public endorsements from notable crypto figures. Market participants cited Zcash as “insurance” against Bitcoin’s transparency, pushing buyers into the token and producing a rapid price move to levels not seen since April 2022. How large was the price move and what are the key metrics? The price climbed to about $121 , a 63% increase in 24 hours and roughly 107% over seven days , per CoinGecko data reported by market observers. Zcash is currently the 82nd largest digital asset with a market cap above $1.8 billion . Why are market observers calling Zcash “insurance against Bitcoin”? Privacy concerns drive the narrative: Bitcoin’s transparent ledger can be surveilled, while Zcash offers shielded transactions via zero-knowledge proofs . Prominent voices framed Zcash as a fallback should surveillance or restrictive policy make transparent chains undesirable for some users. Notable commentary: Entrepreneur Naval Ravikant wrote, “Bitcoin is insurance against fiat. ZCash is insurance against Bitcoin.” Ex-Coinbase engineer Mert Mumtaz argued that “a world where crypto succeeds but privacy doesn’t is a dystopian nightmare,” emphasizing private money’s necessity. How does Zcash protect transaction privacy? Zcash uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to encrypt transaction metadata while still validating transactions on-chain. This allows the network to prove transaction validity without revealing sender, receiver, or amount on public ledgers, offering an opt-in privacy model. What role do CBDCs and regulation play in this price move? Concerns about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and regulatory surveillance are part of the context. Observers argue that as CBDCs and centralized offerings expand, demand for private, decentralized instruments like Zcash may increase. Political statements and policy actions have further amplified the privacy narrative. How does Zcash compare to Bitcoin and CBDCs?

Zcash rose about 63% in 24 hours to roughly $121 , becoming the top 24‑hour performer among major digital assets. Observers attribute the move to privacy demand and influential public commentary. How does zero-knowledge proof technology work for privacy coins? Zero-knowledge proofs let one party prove a transaction is valid without revealing the transaction details. Zcash implements zk-SNARKs to hide sender, receiver, and amount when users choose shielded transactions. Key Takeaways Zcash rebound: Price hit a three-year high after large daily and weekly gains. Privacy demand: Market commentary framed Zcash as “insurance” against Bitcoin transparency and regulatory surveillance. Investor action: Assess technical privacy, regulatory context, and volatility before allocating capital. Conclusion The Zcash surge reflects a renewed market focus on privacy as a core value in digital money. With endorsements from prominent figures and a notable 24‑hour performance, Zcash has re-entered investor conversations.

The court's decision marks a setback for President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly unsuccessfully appealed to the courts to remove Cook from office. Trump has cited Cook for “mortgage fraud,” alleging he made false statements on mortgage applications for two homes in Michigan and Georgia, as grounds for impeachment. Cook denies the allegations, and no formal charges have been filed. Trump's first attempt to remove Cook came in August after he pressured longtime Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other board members to lower interest rates. In September, the Fed cut the policy rate by a quarter-point despite Trump's objections. Cook voted yes, while Trump's new appointee, Stephen Miran, voted for a more aggressive half-point cut. The Supreme Court ruling rejected Trump's request to allow Cook to be fired immediately, and suspended the process until oral hearings in January 2026. The court also announced that a timetable would be set for interested parties and external stakeholders to submit written comments. Related News: Big Bull Arthur Hayes Claims Crypto Rally Could Be Triggered - Here's His Argument The Trump administration argues that Cook's dismissal constitutes “good cause” under the Federal Reserve Act. The Justice Department, in previous filings, has characterized the lower court's decision restricting Trump's impeachment authority as “improper judicial interference.” Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, welcomed the Supreme Court's decision, saying, “This decision allows Cook to continue in his position. We expect the process to proceed in accordance with the court's rulings.” White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended Trump's decision as legal and expressed confidence that they would win a “final victory” at the hearing to be held in January. The Supreme Court's decision allows the Fed to continue operating normally through the end of the year. Cook will continue to vote at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings in October and December. *This is not investment advice.

White House withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination for CFTC chair after seven months of delay. The CFTC now has a tenuous leadership gap with acting chair Caroline Pham as the sole confirmed official.

The White House withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after seven months on the table, citing internal reconsideration following reported opposition. This withdrawal leaves the CFTC without a confirmed chair while acting chair Caroline Pham covers agency duties. Why was Brian Quintenz’s nomination withdrawn? Reports indicated influential donors and supporters pushed for reconsideration, and the White House removed the nomination amid stalled Senate action. Advocacy groups across crypto and blockchain had publicly endorsed Quintenz, calling him “exceptionally well-suited” to lead the agency. Multiple trade associations — including the Crypto Council for Innovation, Blockchain Association, Decentralization Research Center, DeFi Education Fund, The Digital Chamber, Satoshi Action Fund and Solana Policy Institute — urged the Administration to keep the nomination. How does this affect CFTC leadership and crypto regulation? The withdrawal deepens a leadership shortfall at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. With several commissioner departures in 2025 and acting chair Caroline Pham as the only remaining commissioner since Sept. 3, the agency’s near-term regulatory direction is uncertain. Who else is reportedly being considered to fill the role? Reported prospective candidates include Michael Selig (SEC Crypto Task Force counsel), Tyler Williams (Treasury counselor), former commissioner Jill Sommers, NCUA chair Kyle Hauptman and Milbank partner Josh Stirling. Names circulated in press reports but no formal nomination has been publicly announced. When will a new nomination be expected? Timing is unclear. The US government shutdown and a stalled Senate calendar complicate confirmation prospects. The White House has not announced a replacement, and political considerations may delay a formal nomination. What are the immediate operational risks at the CFTC? Short-staffing could delay rulemaking, enforcement actions and cross-agency coordination with the SEC and Treasury. The SEC itself has vacant seats, adding pressure to regulatory clarity for commodities and crypto markets during a sensitive policy window. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why was Brian Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination withdrawn?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The White House withdrew the nomination after months of delay and reported opposition from influential stakeholders; no replacement has yet been formally named."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who is leading the CFTC now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham is the sole remaining commissioner following recent departures; she is managing agency duties until a confirmed chair is named."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will the withdrawal affect crypto regulation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The withdrawal increases short-term regulatory uncertainty; delayed nominations and confirmations can slow policy-making and enforcement related to commodities and crypto markets."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions What caused the CFTC to be short-staffed in 2025? The agency saw multiple commissioner departures in 2025, culminating with Kristin Johnson leaving on Sept. 3. These exits, combined with pending nominations and withdrawals, reduced the CFTC to a single acting commissioner. Will the Senate confirm a new CFTC chair during the shutdown? Senate confirmations typically require a functioning appropriations and legislative schedule; a government shutdown makes timely confirmation less likely and could prolong the vacancy. Key Takeaways Nomination withdrawn : The White House removed Brian Quintenz’s nomination after months of delay and reported opposition. Leadership gap : Acting chair Caroline Pham is the lone confirmed commissioner, raising short-term regulatory uncertainty. Next steps : New nominees have been reported, but Senate timing and a government shutdown complicate confirmation prospects.

The incident, which occurred earlier today, led to losses of around $13,000 in user funds, though CZ assured that victims will be fully reimbursed. Binance Restores Account, Confirms Limited Losses In multiple X posts on Wednesday, CZ explained that after gaining control of the BNB Chain account, the attacker had posted links to fake “Wallet Connect” prompts designed to trick users into signing harmful approvals. The former Binance head also urged users to avoid clicking any of the links from the compromised social media handle, warning: “The @BNBCHAIN X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account.” He added that the exchange had already contacted X to suspend the account and launched takedown requests for the phishing domains. “Always check the domains very carefully, even from official X handles. Stay SAFU!” CZ cautioned. In his latest update, the crypto entrepreneur revealed that the hacker only netted $13,000, a small sum compared to past phishing campaigns that drained millions. “He could have made more by building,” he noted, adding that Binance’s security teams are still tracking the culprit, who may be linked to a verified identity through KYC. The quick recovery and limited damage stand in contrast to earlier cases, including one reported previously by security firms PeckShield and Scam Sniffer, where a user unintentionally approved a bad transfer, resulting in a phishing attack that cost them over $3 million. Because they mimic genuine Uniswap swaps or wallet connection prompts, these scams are extremely clever, putting even people who know a lot about crypto at risk of falling for social engineering tricks. Ironically, the attack happened right when BNB Chain was getting more network traffic than its competitors. On September 28, data showed that daily fees on the blockchain shot up to $1.4 million after the launch of the decentralized exchange Aster. For three days in a row, they were higher than those on Solana. The platform also handled a record 16.5 million transactions a week earlier, demonstrating its growing popularity. Price Reaction Despite the breach, the price of BNB has stayed pretty stable. At the time of writing, the token was worth $1,011.84, about 1.5% less than the day before. It also fell slightly by 0.5% in the last seven days, but it is still up 5.4% over the last two weeks, which could mean that investors were not overly worried about the phishing scare. In the past 30 days, BNB has jumped 18.3%, and over the last year, it has gone up 76.5%, which is better than most large-cap tokens during a time when there has been mixed market sentiment.

While SOL’s fundamentals remain strong, many traders are now turning to other alternatives with better near-term growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a front-runner. Prevalently priced at just $0.035 in its stage 6 presale, Mutuum Finance is building one of the most ambitious decentralized finance ecosystems of 2025, with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, without sacrificing asset custody. The stage is already over 50% sold out. The project’s novelty has already attracted more than 16,670 holders and more than $16.6 million worth of presale investments, a testament to growing confidence among crypto whales as well as retail investors alike. With both high-upside tokenomics and early-stage momentum along with real-world utility, analysts believe that MUTM could report much stronger Q4 returns compared to industry titans like Solana. Solana Tests Crucial Support, Can Bulls Regain Control Before Year-End Solana (SOL) trades at around $202.48, testing a critical rising trendline that can determine its next move. Having both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages is offering support, with the primary Fibonacci retracement levels between $214 and $223 determining short-term momentum. A decisive breakout above the range could pave the way for upside objectives at $253, $274, $301, and even $331, representing a strong bullish follow-through to Q4. However, failure to hold current levels and breakdown below $175 could accelerate losses towards $158 or $140, further constricting pressure on market sentiment. As traders gaze upon these key levels, investors already have their eyes on new prospects with better near-term upside, and that’s progressively turning heads to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Hits New Heights Mutuum Finance is dominating the DeFi space with its presale, garnering over 16,670 investors and raising over $16.6 million up to now. The presale has progressed to Phase 6 and is 50% through, with the MUTM tokens costing $0.035 apiece. As a token of gratitude to its initial supporters, the team has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway , distributing 10 winners $10,000 of MUTM tokens each. At the forefront of decentralized finance innovation, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to enable safe exchange, lending, and settlement for USD-backed tokens, as well as extremely liquid tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform ensures robust data integrity with multiple defense layers, including fallback oracle guards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages, providing accurate and reliable price data even with brutal market conditions. Mutuum Finance also introduces a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that fall apart in bear markets, the token is overcollateralized and non-algorithmic, designed to provide price stability even during market downturns. The platform possesses a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism where each asset has an associated collateral ceiling attuned to its risk profile. This maintains lending in balance and at bay. In addition to the security of users during periods of volatility, the protocol features a buffer reserve mechanism where riskier assets are assigned increased reserves as additional collateral and to cover the ecosystem. With its record-breaking presale, innovative risk management, and commitment to transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its reputation as a secure, robust, and visionary DeFi platform. Why Whales Are Switching to MUTM Instead of SOL Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to become one of the hottest DeFi projects of 2025, raising over $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. While Solana (SOL) journeys through volatility below $210, MUTM’s peer-to-peer lending and collective lending platform, USD-backed stablecoin, and sound risk management system are attracting serious attention from both retail and whales. Those seeking high-upside utility-focused crypto plays must lock in MUTM tokens prior to the presale event being complete. Join now.

As the crypto market evolves, BTC is changing the narrative of how businesses and investors view cryptocurrencies as these companies continue to hoard the flagship asset. A Unique Innovation Of The Digital Age Over the years, Bitcoin has been labelled as digital gold due to its transformative potential and its notable value growth. Recently, Eric Schmidt, the former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Google, dropped a bombshell on BTC’s historic foray into the market and uniqueness in an interview. In the interview, the former CEO praised BTC as a remarkable cryptographic achievement, underscoring the ground-breaking creativity that went into its creation. Schmidt’s statement points to the safe, trustless network and decentralized design of Bitcoin, which marks a significant advancement in cryptography. Bitcoin, being hailed as a remarkable cryptographic achievement, is supported by its uniqueness compared to other major digital assets . Following the statement, the former CEO notes that Bitcoin is unique and cannot be duplicated, thereby strengthening its position as a leader in the cryptocurrency market. “The ability to create something which is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value,” Schmidt stated. Sharing insights on its utilization, he stated that BTC is incredibly useful, especially for multiple computer applications. Given BTC’s unique architecture and the inability to replicate the digital asset, the former Google CEO foresees a wave of individuals and corporations building on the network in the future. Overall, Schmidt’s acknowledgment outlines how far BTC has come from being a specialized digital experiment to a worldwide recognized financial asset . The asset is currently attracting the interest of tech and finance leaders due to its technological foundation, allowing it to go mainstream. Bitcoin To Serve Individuals In The Next Decade With Bitcoin gaining ground in the financial landscape, Jack Dorsey , the CEO of Square, has voiced his conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. According to the Square CEO in an interview with Michael Saylor , the leading crypto asset will continue to serve individuals over the next decade. Despite being slower than most networks, such as Ethereum , Dorsey believes that this is one of BTC’s key strengths, as it allows for longevity and predictability. Furthermore, it enhances security, better uptime, and usability, placing it ahead of other major chains. Dorsey highlighted the potential for BTC to become the major internet currency, and he is confident that the asset will stick around in the long run. By declaring that BTC will serve billions of people in the next decade, the CEO is declaring that the asset is beyond just an investment; rather, it is the foundation of a more transparent and inclusive global financial system.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Eric Schmidt|Google|Jack Dorsey|michael saylor|Square,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 20:00:15

The European Union has completed three separate free trade agreements since Trump won re-election in November. The bloc finalized deals with Mercosur, a South American trading group, along with Mexico and Indonesia. Officials in Brussels are now working toward a fourth agreement with India before the year ends. Other nations have followed a similar path. Mercosur completed a trade deal with the European Free Trade Area, which includes four countries, and restarted discussions with Canada after those talks had been stuck since 2021. India and New Zealand began negotiating again after waiting ten years to resume their conversations. The United Arab Emirates signed three separate trade agreements on the same day in January. Trump tariffs reshape European strategy European officials have made it clear these partnerships are their answer to what they call unfair American tariffs. The U.S. has placed roughly 15% duties on European goods. Brussels also wants protection from Chinese flooding of markets and limits on important minerals that Europe requires for switching to cleaner energy. The recent trade deals might not completely make up for reduced business with an increasingly protective America. Still, competing economies have started moving quickly to respond. Maros Sefcovic, who handles trade matters for the EU, told lawmakers during a conversation about the one-sided tariff agreement with the U.S. from late July that America accounted for 17% of European trade last year. He said the United States was not the only option available. “We also need to take care of the other 83%. That means continuing our efforts to diversify our relations,” Sefcovic explained. As reported by Cryptopilitan previously, top officials from China and the European Union met to discuss ways to work together as both face mounting pressure from American trade policies. EU and China’s officials stress on cooperation in the face of tariffs. Countries that previously resisted opening their markets appear to be changing their minds. Both India and France, which had opposed the EU-Mercosur agreement, seem to have relaxed their positions. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who leads the World Trade Organization, has welcomed this development as long as the agreements follow WTO rules. “Members negotiating more agreements with each other, that helps to diversify trade, it supports the WTO. It’s not in competition because most of these agreements are built on our platform,” she said last month as mentioned in a Reuters report. Benefits won’t come quickly However, experts warn that new partnerships will not quickly replace losses from American tariffs. U.S. duties take effect right away, while benefits from fresh trade agreements remain years down the road. Approval processes can drag on, and tariff reductions typically happen gradually over five to ten years. Companies might start investing to take advantage of new opportunities sooner than that. Looking further ahead, the picture remains uncertain. New trade deals will add small amounts to economic growth, measured in decimal points. European exports to both the United States and China, where demand for European products has dropped, represent roughly 4% of EU GDP. Not all of that business will disappear. Niclas Poitiers, who researches economics at the Bruegel think tank, estimates that Trump tariffs could reduce EU exports enough to lower the bloc’s GDP by 0.2% to 0.3%. He notes that uncertainty might hurt corporate investment even more than the direct effects of the tariffs themselves. The current situation shows how quickly international commerce can shift when major economies change their policies. While the full impact of both the tariffs and the new trade agreements will take years to understand completely, nations are clearly racing to secure alternative markets rather than relying on traditional partners.

While many often compare SWIFT’s role to Ripple due to its XRP-linked payment solutions, this new plan is not a direct challenge to the fintech company, but rather part of a much larger trillion-dollar race to define the future of digital money. SWIFT Partners With Consensys To Build Blockchain Network According to the announcement, SWIFT is collaborating with Consensys, the Ethereum development company founded by Joe Lubin, to create a shared digital ledger that supports faster, cheaper, and more efficient international transactions. Related Reading: Early Bitcoin Investor Reveals Biggest Regret After Years In The Market SWIFT is still keeping its blockchain ledger in the prototype stage, but leading banks are already testing it. JP Morgan in the United States and Deutsche Bank in Europe are among the major institutions participating in these early trials. SWIFT and its partners design the new infrastructure to support regulated stablecoins as well as tokenized assets. The shared ledger links directly to private blockchains that organizations use internally and to public blockchains open to the general public. By connecting the two, banks and financial companies in different regions will be able to join the platform without having to abandon the systems they already use. Ripple, long known for linking its XRP token with cross-border solutions, has been in this space for years. However, the announcement notes that SWIFT’s strategy differs. Instead of relying on a single cryptocurrency, it is creating a network that works directly with banks and established institutions. Trillion-Dollar Stablecoin Threat Pushes SWIFT Into Blockchain Race SWIFT’s move to launch its own blockchain could be part of a much bigger trillion-dollar battle in the payments world. Stablecoins, which are digital assets tied to fiat currencies, are now used in transactions worth trillions of dollars. The rise of stablecoins could challenge SWIFT’s long-established role in global payments. If banks begin to settle transactions directly with stablecoins, they may no longer depend on the global messaging network for cross-border transfers. Related Reading: XRP Price May Not See An Explosive Rally In October As Expected, Here’s Why The rapid growth of stablecoins could prompt banks to bypass SWIFT altogether, and if banks opt to use new digital payment systems instead, SWIFT’s role could shrink significantly. The global messaging network for financial institutions is now building the blockchain ledger within its framework to reduce this risk and prevent banks from migrating to rival providers. The move does not mean SWIFT is going head-to-head with Ripple alone. As stablecoins and tokenized money gain wider adoption, SWIFT is developing its own blockchain ledger to maintain its central position in the international payments market. The global financial messaging giant may be working to strengthen its leading position and prepare for the trillion-dollar race that could shape the international money transfer market.

But Ripple’s leadership believes the system’s inefficiencies have left room for disruption — and they’ve never hidden their ambition to step into that space. A recent clip shared by Digital Asset Investor has reignited this conversation, highlighting Ripple’s co-founder, Chris Larsen, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, outlining nothing short of a takeover strategy. Chris Larsen’s Vision In the video circulated by Digital Asset Investor, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen described the company’s work as “a replacement for SWIFT in correspondent banking.” According to Larsen, Ripple’s approach centers on connecting payment providers and wallets through ILP, using XRP to provide on-demand liquidity. By doing so, financial institutions could avoid maintaining pre-funded accounts across multiple jurisdictions — a system Larsen criticized as inefficient. “We think that’s a winning kind of killer app,” he added, positioning Ripple’s solution as a direct challenge to the current correspondent banking model. I'm confused by all the Swift FUD. Ripple never said they were going to partner with Swift. They said they were going to replace or take it over. https://t.co/9VqGiCEbyC — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) October 1, 2025 Brad Garlinghouse: From Competing to “Taking Over” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reinforced this bold positioning, famously remarking in earlier interviews that Ripple is “taking over SWIFT.” In the same vein, he highlighted the company’s traction with global banks, pointing out that Ripple had already signed up over 100 financial institutions. This language makes clear that Ripple sees itself less as a complementary partner to SWIFT and more as an outright competitor seeking to displace it. The Technology Behind Ripple’s Ambition At the core of Ripple’s strategy is ILP, a protocol designed to bridge disparate payment networks. Unlike SWIFT, which primarily functions as a secure messaging system for banks, ILP aims to route actual value across ledgers. When paired with XRP as an on-demand liquidity asset, this infrastructure promises faster settlements and reduced reliance on nostro/vostro accounts. Still, while ILP’s technical framework is sound, scaling it across thousands of global financial institutions remains a monumental challenge. Adoption depends on regulation, institutional confidence, and a willingness by banks to shift away from decades-old systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Adoption, Regulation, and Reality Check Ripple has actively pursued steps to bolster its legitimacy in the financial sector, including applying for a U.S. national bank charter. These moves indicate a long-term plan to further integrate with traditional banking systems. However, while Ripple frequently cites its growing list of partners , independent verification of the scale of XRP-based transaction volumes remains limited. Analysts note that while Ripple has achieved notable pilot programs and partnerships, replacing SWIFT — with its network of over 11,000 institutions worldwide — is a marathon, not a sprint. The gap between bold executive statements and verifiable market dominance remains significant. The Road Ahead Ripple’s leaders have made it clear: their mission is not to work alongside SWIFT but to offer a superior alternative. Digital Asset Investor’s resurfacing of Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s words underscores just how ambitious that mission is. The real test, however, lies in execution. Verified bank adoption, transparent transaction data, and regulatory approvals will determine whether Ripple’s “killer app” evolves from vision to global reality. Until then, the debate around whether Ripple can truly replace SWIFT will remain one of the most-watched storylines in the fintech and crypto landscape.

CAMT exclusion clarified Strategy will follow IRS/Treasury guidance and does not expect CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond. Strategy’s Bitcoin unrealized gain is nearly $28 billion on $47.4 billion invested (current valuation cited in company filings). Strategy CAMT clarified: IRS/Treasury exclude unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT calculations — learn what this means for corporate Bitcoin holders. Read on for details. What is the impact of the CAMT clarification on Strategy? Strategy CAMT clarification removes the need to include unrealized gains or losses on digital assets when determining liability for the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). Strategy now says it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings” for 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. How did the IRS and Treasury change CAMT guidance for digital assets? The IRS and Treasury issued a 71‑page guidance document stating firms are not required to factor unrealized gains or losses on digital assets into CAMT calculations. This clarification explicitly excludes mark‑to‑market changes on cryptocurrencies from the CAMT base for corporations. Tax and market analysts, including TD Cowen (analyst Lance Vitzanza), said the guidance removes a significant potential overhang on Strategy’s stock and avoided a possible multi‑billion cash tax liability that could have begun in 2026. Why does this matter for corporate Bitcoin holders? Front-loading the effect: companies holding large Bitcoin positions were at risk of an unexpected CAMT liability as crypto appreciated. With the clarification, unrealized appreciation will not automatically trigger CAMT, improving cash‑tax planning and reducing potential forced liquidations or capital redeployments tied to tax needs. How much unrealized gain does Strategy hold and what changed in market reaction? Strategy has spent approximately $47.4 billion acquiring Bitcoin and currently carries an unrealized gain close to $28 billion based on its filings. Following the IRS/Treasury guidance and Strategy’s confirmation, Strategy shares rose about 5% in intraday trading; the stock has advanced roughly 10% over the past six months. Strategy Bitcoin holdings — key figures Metric Reported Value Amount spent on Bitcoin $47.4 billion Current unrealized gain ~$28 billion Company-reported Bitcoin stockpile value $75 billion (approx.) Recent share movement Up ~5% on guidance; +10% past six months When did Strategy change its CAMT outlook and where was it disclosed? Strategy disclosed the change in outlook in an SEC filing following the IRS and Treasury guidance. The company previously indicated in June that it expected CAMT liabilities; after the guidance, Strategy stated it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings.” What did analysts and market data report? TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitzanza said the IRS action removed a significant potential overhang, noting Strategy could have faced substantial cash tax liabilities if unrealized gains were included.

This guidance sets a precedent: corporations holding digital assets should not include unrealized gains or losses in CAMT computations. Companies will continue reporting holdings per SEC and accounting standards and will reference the IRS/Treasury guidance for tax planning. Does this remove all tax risk associated with corporate crypto holdings? No. The clarification addresses CAMT treatment of unrealized gains. Corporations still face ordinary tax rules on realized gains, withholding regimes, state taxes, and evolving regulatory or legislative changes; firms should continue robust tax and compliance reviews. Key Takeaways Immediate relief : The IRS/Treasury clarified that unrealized digital‑asset gains are excluded from CAMT, easing potential tax pressure on large holders. Strategy outlook : Strategy stated it no longer expects CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. Next steps for firms : Corporations should update tax models, maintain disclosure transparency, and monitor official guidance and accounting interpretations. Conclusion The IRS and Treasury clarification materially reduces the near‑term tax uncertainty for Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin holders by excluding unrealized gains from CAMT calculations. Companies should incorporate the guidance into tax planning and public disclosures while continuing to monitor rulemaking and accounting guidance. COINOTAG will update this report if further official guidance or company disclosures emerge. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How corporate Bitcoin holders should respond to CAMT clarification"", ""description"": ""Steps for tax and finance teams to implement following IRS/Treasury guidance excluding unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification"", ""name"": ""Review official guidance"", ""text"": ""Obtain and review the IRS and Treasury guidance document to confirm the scope and effective dates."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification"", ""name"": ""Update tax models"", ""text"": ""Revise corporate CAMT projections and cash tax forecasts to remove unrealized digital‑asset gains from the CAMT base."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification"", ""name"": ""Disclose changes"", ""text"": ""Prepare public disclosures and investor communications reflecting updated tax positions and potential impacts on liquidity and capital allocation."" } ], ""totalTime"": ""PT2H""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification"" }, ""headline"": ""IRS/Treasury Clarify CAMT Treatment for Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings"", ""description"": ""Strategy CAMT clarified: IRS and Treasury exclude unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT calculations, easing potential multi-billion tax exposure for Strategy."", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z""} By COINOTAG — Published: 2025-10-01 — Updated: 2025-10-01",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 20:08:55

Blockchain Association Calls on Congress for Crypto Momentum According to a thread posted on the Blockchain Association’s official X account, the digital asset organization encouraged Congress to “keep the momentum going” and work “across the aisle as they have so often done with crypto policy.” 1/ Bipartisan momentum is building in Washington around digital asset policy. For the first time in our industry’s history, lawmakers, regulators, and industry are working together to create clear rules of the road. pic.twitter.com/k4RwnTKumI — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) October 1, 2025 “Momentum around digital assets has never been stronger,” Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger said in a statement. “From bipartisan leadership in Congress to historic collaboration between the SEC and CFTC, we are seeing a true whole-of-government approach.” “To secure America’s place as the crypto capital of the world, we must keep our foot on the gas,” she added. Government Shutdown Stalls Crypto Progress The U.S. government officially entered a shutdown early on October 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on government spending bills. On Wednesday, the two opposing parties once again failed to agree on a vote that would have quickly ended the government shutdown. “…The president has directed his cabinet, and the Office of Management and Budget is working with agencies across the board to identify where cuts can be made, and we believe layoffs are imminent,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said . Mersinger’s commentary comes just days after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hosted a joint roundtable in Washington, D.C. The landmark event saw the two digital asset watchdogs come together to explore regulatory harmonization priorities and featured appearances by several key players in the cryptocurrency sector. However, with no end to the government shutdown in sight, it remains unclear just how the blockchain sector and crypto policy as a whole will be impacted.

Key point 1 — 61,000 BTC seized in 2018, linked to a Chinese investment fraud The Crown Prosecution Service has opened civil recovery in the High Court; a hearing is scheduled for January.

UK seized Bitcoin is currently held under civil recovery proceedings after convictions tied to a Chinese investment fraud; the High Court will decide whether victims receive proprietary claims to BTC or compensation in fiat, and whether the U.K. state retains any surplus following legal distribution rules. How can victims claim compensation for the seized Bitcoin? Victims can apply under Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to make proprietary claims to frozen assets. Courts will apply equitable tracing and flexible trust principles to establish entitlement. Legal precedent such as Robb v The National Crime Agency guides proportional distributions (pari passu) and valuation methods. Who are the key parties and what are the stakes? The Crown Prosecution Service is pursuing civil recovery. Defendants include Zhimin Qian (recent guilty plea) and earlier-convicted assistant Seng Hok Ling. Rough figures: around 61,000 BTC seized, over 120,000 alleged victims, and reported losses near £640 million. The potential market value swing means distribution method critically affects outcomes. How might the High Court distribute the frozen Bitcoin? Courts may adopt one of three practical approaches: pari passu proportional distribution, compensation in fiat at time-of-loss values, or permitting the state to retain surplus value. Each approach has legal and fairness implications for claimants and for public finance considerations. Comparison of potential distribution outcomes Approach What victims receive Impact on state Pari passu Proportional BTC or equivalent value based on each investor’s share State role limited to administering distribution Fiat valuation Compensation equal to amount lost in GBP State may retain appreciation in BTC value State retention Victims may receive limited or no recovery State gains from market appreciation When is the next legal step in the case? The Crown Prosecution Service has initiated proceedings and the High Court will hear the next stage in January. Civil litigation could continue into 2027 depending on tracing complexity and the number of claimants. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How victims can pursue claims on seized Bitcoin"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to submitting a civil recovery claim for frozen Bitcoin held by the UK."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Collect evidence"", ""text"": ""Gather records of payments, account details, and communications proving investment and loss."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Submit claim under Proceeds of Crime Act"", ""text"": ""File an application under Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to register a claim on frozen property."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Seek legal representation"", ""text"": ""Engage solicitors experienced in asset tracing and civil recovery to present proprietary or equitable tracing arguments."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Attend hearings"", ""text"": ""Participate in High Court civil recovery hearings and any distribution determinations."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can the UK government legally keep seized Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The UK government has initiated civil recovery but retention is not guaranteed; courts may award victims proprietary claims or fiat compensation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 depending on tracing and precedent."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much Bitcoin was seized in 2018?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Approximately 61,000 BTC was seized in connection with an investment fraud linked to Zhimin Qian and associates."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What legal precedent affects distribution?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Robb v The National Crime Agency and equitable tracing principles inform proportional distribution (pari passu) and valuation choices in civil recovery cases."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Can victims recover Bitcoin or only fiat compensation? Victims may recover proprietary interests in BTC if they can trace funds to the seized assets. Courts sometimes award compensation in GBP equal to losses instead, which can leave the state with appreciation in BTC value. What legal tools are victims using to claim recovery? Claimants use Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, equitable tracing, and trust law arguments. London-based law firms represent many victims and coordinate cross-jurisdictional claims. Key Takeaways Seized amount: ~61,000 BTC taken in 2018 tied to an investment fraud. Legal path: Civil recovery in the High Court will determine rightful recipients under established tracing and distribution principles. Impact: Distribution method (pari passu vs fiat valuation) will decide if victims receive market gains or only original losses. Conclusion The dispute over the UK seized Bitcoin centers on competing legal principles: victims’ proprietary claims versus the state’s civil recovery prerogative. Upcoming High Court hearings and established case law will shape whether victims regain BTC value or receive fiat compensation.

Multiple lenders are anticipated to take part in the transaction, according to Bloomberg’s sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of ongoing talks. EA, the video game maker, is going private through an acquisition led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake Management, and Affinity Partners, which is run by Jared Kushner. The buyers announced the deal on Monday. JPMorgan served as the sole debt underwriter for the $55 billion purchase, marking the biggest debt commitment a single bank has ever made for this type of transaction. Several major banks are now reaching out and hoping to secure their position in the deal over the next few weeks, people close to the matter said . Investment banks eye lucrative fees from EA deal Banks are eager to play a role in what stands as the largest leveraged buyout in history , hoping to collect some of the most profitable fees available in investment banking. Financial institutions have grown increasingly anxious to supply funding for any of the uncommon buyouts that have emerged since the Federal Reserve began increasing interest rates in 2022. The EA transaction adds to a recent increase in merger and acquisition activity, with traditional Wall Street banks currently gaining an advantage over their private credit competitors. The projected $500 million fee comes from an average underwriting rate on leveraged buyouts of roughly 2.5 percent, insiders explained. Banks will divide that sum based on how much of the deal each one takes on. Debt distribution strategy takes shape The strategy involves a worldwide group of banks eventually selling dual-currency leveraged loans and high-yield bonds to investors, following standard buyout financing procedures, sources said. The sale will probably take place in 2026, some of the people indicated. How the transaction ultimately gets structured will depend on what market conditions look like when it launches, they added. JPMorgan has served as one of EA’s primary lenders for quite some time and headed up a $500 million revolving credit facility for the company in 2023, based on information gathered by Bloomberg. Other banks involved in that credit line included Bank of America, BNP Paribas, and Citigroup. Several of these same lenders also have experience working alongside Silver Lake, which is based in Menlo Park, on massive buyout transactions. Back in 2013, the private equity company took Dell private in a $24 billion deal that was supported with large-scale debt financing led by banks including Bank of America, Barclays, RBC Capital Markets, and UBS Group.

Nasdaq filed to list BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF under the commodity-based trust rule. The fund will combine spot Bitcoin and IBIT holdings with covered calls and FLEX options to generate yield. SEC review is underway; BlackRock expects compliance with generic listing standards by Q1 2026. BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF — income-focused Bitcoin ETF details, yield strategy, and SEC review. Read the filing summary and next steps. Nasdaq has filed to list BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, designed to generate yield from Bitcoin-linked covered call strategies. Nasdaq has filed with the SEC to list the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF under the commodity-based trust rule. The ETF will generate income through covered call strategies while holding Bitcoin, IBIT, cash, and exchange-listed FLEX options. BlackRock positioned the ETF as an income-focused alternative to IBIT, expanding its digital asset product lineup while aiming to reduce volatility. Nasdaq has formally submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The application was filed under the commodity-based trust rule on September 30. The SEC has acknowledged the submission and noted that the ETF meets the requirements under its general listing standards. What is the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF? The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF is an income-focused exchange-traded fund structured to hold spot Bitcoin and shares of IBIT while generating yield through covered call writing and exchange-listed FLEX options. The fund is positioned as an alternative to pure spot exposure, aiming to deliver income and potentially lower volatility. How will the ETF generate income and manage exposure? The ETF will primarily invest in spot Bitcoin and the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), maintain cash reserves, and sell call options on IBIT or indices that track spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products. The filing states the fund may also use exchange-listed FLEX options to fine-tune exposure and enhance yield. These option-based strategies generate premium income but can cap upside participation. Why is Nasdaq listing the ETF under the commodity-based trust rule? Nasdaq used the commodity-based trust rule because the fund’s principal asset is spot Bitcoin and related ETP shares. The commodity-based trust framework aligns the listing process with existing commodity-backed products and ensures Nasdaq’s review focuses on custody, market surveillance, and listing standards compliance. Regulatory and market context The SEC has opened a public comment period on the proposed rule change that would allow Nasdaq to list the ETF. BlackRock registered the trust in Delaware the prior week and has informed regulators the product will comply with the generic listing standards that apply beginning Q1 2026. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas (plain text) described the ETF as a sequel to IBIT in market commentary. At the time of writing, Bitcoin maintained a trading range above $114,000, with daily lows at $112,740 and highs at $114,746. Market conditions and investor appetite for yield-oriented crypto products may influence the SEC review and eventual investor demand for the income-focused ETF. How should investors evaluate an income-focused Bitcoin ETF? Evaluate the fund’s holdings, option-writing frequency, counterparty and custody arrangements, fee structure, and tax treatment. Consider how covered call strategies reduce upside during rallies and how FLEX options affect liquidity. Review BlackRock’s filing and audit/custody statements for detail on mechanics and risk controls. Frequently Asked Questions Will the ETF hold physical Bitcoin? Yes. The fund is structured to hold spot Bitcoin as its principal asset while also holding shares of IBIT and cash reserves to support option strategies and liquidity needs. When will Nasdaq and the SEC complete the review? The SEC’s public comment period is ongoing and the timeline depends on regulatory feedback; BlackRock has said the product will comply with generic listing standards from Q1 2026, which frames expectations for potential timing. Key Takeaways Income focus : The ETF seeks yield through covered calls and FLEX options while holding spot Bitcoin and IBIT. Regulatory review : Nasdaq filed under the commodity-based trust rule; the SEC is soliciting comments. Investor considerations : Covered calls can reduce upside; assess custody, fees, and option counterparties before investing. Conclusion BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF adds an income-oriented option for digital-asset investors, blending spot Bitcoin exposure with option-based yield strategies. The SEC review will determine listing timing; investors should review the filing details and evaluate trade-offs between yield and upside participation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/blackrock-ibp-income-etf"" }, ""headline"": ""Nasdaq Files to List BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF to Generate Yield from Covered Calls"", ""description"": ""BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF — income-focused Bitcoin ETF details, yield strategy, and SEC review.

Alphractal stated that billions of dollars worth of ETH have left central exchanges in recent months, causing a serious contraction on the supply side. Related News: One of Japan's Largest Financial Companies May Have Had Its Cryptocurrency Wallets Hacked - Here Are the Details The company's particular focus was on the Exchange Flow Balance metric. This metric measures the net balance of inflows and outflows on exchanges.

According to Alphactal, this indicator has turned negative for the first time, suggesting that both institutional and retail investor demand for Ethereum has reached record levels.

52534322,594524,1759352450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52534322.jpeg,Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-remains-bullish/,"XRP’s price action in the final days of September was turbulent, with the cryptocurrency slipping below the $2.80 zone in a market-wide pullback. Despite the sharp drop, XRP managed to defend a key support level near $2.72, bouncing from that mark on September 26. This recovery, though modest, has led to new analysis suggesting that as long as this support holds, XRP could be positioned to lead the next rally in the market. $2.72 Support Is The Line In The Sand Technical analysis of XRP’s weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency’s outlook is now bullish after holding up above an important level. This analysis, which was shared on the social media platform X, predicted that as long as this support holds, XRP could be positioned to lead the next rally for the entire crypto market. The analyst noted the importance of the $2.72 level as an important support level that XRP has held up. This is in relation to how the XRP price broke below $2.8 last week. After crashing below $2.8, XRP managed to hold above $2.72, rebounding on it on September 26. Now, this move is what made XRP to be bullish. According to the analyst, the successful defense of this support, followed by a close back above $2.80, has created the conditions for a slight bullish divergence. The weekly chart supports this view, showing that XRP has consistently rebounded on higher lows while maintaining a broader ascending structure. Holding $2.72 prevents a breakdown of this pattern and keeps the longer-term uptrend intact. XRP’s Strength Against The Market Even in the face of the recent correction, the analysis pointed out that XRP is one of the stronger performers in the market. The chart comparison with XRP dominance (XRP.D) indicates that the token may have already bottomed in relative terms. According to the analyst, the XRP dominance bottoming means that the crypto can only start going up from here. This dominance means that XRP could play a leadership role if the broader crypto market begins to trend higher again. Although the bullish case is worth noting, the analyst also warned against complacency among bullish traders. The start of a new week and month often brings volatility, and October could also start with some sort of volatility. As such, the XRP price could still experience a flush lower before any meaningful rally takes hold. However, this capitulation moment could be the final shakeout before XRP begins a stronger leg upward. The $2.72 support has become the line that separates the continuation of XRP’s bullish structure. As long as that level holds, the cryptocurrency’s outlook is bullish. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.85, meaning that it has effectively registered a bullish close above $2.8.",XRP|Broader Ascending Structure|ripple|XRP Dominance|XRP news|XRP price|XRP.D|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 21:00:50

A crypto analyst argues that the real test lies at $0.33, a resistance level that could determine whether DOGE begins its next major rally and extends its momentum into the broader altcoin market. Golden Cross Forms On Dogecoin Price Chart Crypto analyst Cas Abbe recently highlighted in an X social media post Dogecoin’s bullish momentum, noting that the meme coin is about to complete another Golden Cross. In technical terms, a Golden Cross signals the potential start of an extended bullish cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Skirts Potential Demand Zone, What Happens If It Hits Right? Cas Abbe emphasized the significance of this chart setup, pointing out that every time Dogecoin rallies, the broader altcoin market tends to follow suit. According to him, if DOGE manages to break decisively above key resistance levels, it could trigger a massive bullish surge, marking the beginning of a strong altcoin season. The analyst’s chart illustrates Dogecoin’s upward trajectory, with the price steadily climbing after bouncing from support levels around $0.21. His projection shows the meme coin advancing toward the upper resistance channel, where $0.33 sits as the key battleground. Cas Abbe predicts that a breakout beyond this threshold would push the Dogecoin price to $0.37, representing a roughly 60% surge from current levels around $0.23. Adding to the bullish narrative, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also shared his perspective on Dogecoin’s Golden Cross formation. He focused on the 12-hour chart, where the MACD indicator flashes the bullish chart signal. According to him, the histogram has already turned green, a clear sign of rising buying pressure. Additionally, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis suggests that bulls are beginning to take control of the market, with his chart predicting a potential surge toward the $0.32 – $0.33 zone. Expert Says Dogecoin To Reach $1 Next A crypto market expert identified as ‘Solid’ on X has drawn attention to a broader structure forming on Dogecoin’s weekly chart. His analysis reveals a broad consolidation area that could serve as the foundation for a parabolic rally. Based on this technical formation, Solid has forecasted that a golden bull run is imminent—one that could propel the DOGE price to the $1 milestone in the long term. This would reflect a massive price increase of approximately 334%. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs In the chart, Dogecoin’s current price action started as part of a larger consolidation phase that began after the 2021 peak. Now with bullish momentum starting to resurface after months of suppression, Solid’s analysis suggests that a strong upward breakout is becoming increasingly likely. The curved trajectory drawn on his chart envisions the meme coin riding steadily through 2025, ultimately accelerating past previous resistance levels and entering uncharted territory around $1 by 2026.

During the Token2049 event, which is taking place in Singapore, Zach Witkoff said that WLFi is actively working on integrating tokenized assets. Witkoff, who is the CEO of World Liberty Fi, expressed his thoughts and said, “I think commodities are a really interesting area for us, whether it be oil, gas, things like cotton, timber, all of those things, frankly, should be traded on chain.” He confirmed that the WLFi wants to tokenize such assets and link them to USD1 because RWAs require trustworthy and transparent stablecoins. Witkof added, “We’ve not only thought about it, we’re actively working on it.” Trump Jr. believes stablecoins preserve the dollar Donald Trump Jr. believes the rise of stablecoins strengthens the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He explained that the growing demand for dollar-backed tokens supports US Treasuries at a time when conventional buyers such as China and Japan have reduced their exposure. “Crypto is actually going to be the thing that preserves dollar hegemony around the world,” said Trump Jr. in Singapore during a meeting. The GENIUS Act, which was passed in July, boosted confidence among stablecoin issuers and investors. Cryptopolitan reported that the stablecoin market has expanded to a new all-time high (ATH) of almost $300 billion. And around 99% of this money is in US dollar pegged stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. According to Trump Jr, this concentration shows that stablecoin users worldwide are reinforcing demand for the dollar itself. USD1 ranks sixth among other stablecoins USD1 has grown to become the sixth-largest stablecoin based on data from CoinGecko. The token has a market cap of $2.68 billion and is trading on various networks, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The majority of the USD1 token supply is available on the BSC chain. World Liberty Financial also has WLFI, a governance token that empowers users. Together, USD1 and WLFI form the core of its ecosystem. The team is planning more products. A debit card is expected to launch between late 2025 and early 2026. A mobile app and wallet system are also in development. The Trump family continues to expand in the crypto space. Recently, Trump Jr, along with his brother Eric, launched a mining company called American Bitcoin. The company trades on Nasdaq under the ticker ABTC. Its stock closed at $7.20, up 6.82%.

Bitcoin is holding key levels, Ethereum’s upgrade cycle is building anticipation, and meme tokens are leading a fresh round of viral rallies. Conversations are shifting from “what’s safe” to “what’s next,” and new meme coin projects are pulling attention away from the usual heavyweights. Every scroll through trading apps shows whales stacking, and participants debating whether to grab bags or stay sidelined. At the center of this growing buzz, MoonBull ($MOBU) is being called the boldest entry of the season. MoonBull ($MOBU) launched with mechanics designed to cut through the noise and deliver serious conviction. Alongside other projects like Dogecoin, which remains the meme market pioneer, and BullZilla, a beast that refuses to be ignored, these names are setting the pace for October’s meme run. With a unique structure, community-first tokenomics, and a rising tally in its presale, MoonBull is carving out its lane as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that participants refuse to overlook. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) Headlines the Meme Market With Strong Presale Surge MoonBull isn’t just a playful ticker; it’s a project engineered with scarcity and sustainability in mind. In its 4th presale stage, the token is priced at $0.00005168, already pulling in over $200,000 from more than 600 holders. For early buyers, the ROI from stage entry to its projected listing price of $0.00616 already exceeds 11,800%, while those who joined from the earliest stages secured a 106% gain. With the next stage marking a 27.40% increase, the design leaves little room for hesitation. Every stage is more than just a number, it’s an acceleration point built to reward conviction. The mechanics backing MoonBull ensure stability doesn’t just depend on market chatter. Through 2% liquidity injections, 2% passive reflections, and 1% permanent burns, the contract transforms selling pressure into fuel for the system. Community members aren’t simply waiting for pumps; they’re rewarded every step of the way. Its staking program, kicking off with a massive 95% APY pool, makes holding more than just a bag—it makes it a growth machine. Tied to Ethereum’s secure ERC-20 base, and governed by its own community vote from Stage 12, MoonBull is positioning itself as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that blends meme culture with formal mechanics like no other. 2. Dogecoin Holds Its Meme Crown in Q4 2025 Dogecoin continues to stand as the face of meme coins, a name that refuses to fade even when new entrants flood the market. In Q4 2025, trading activity remains consistent, driven by its presence across nearly every exchange and wallet. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven value, its memes still circulating as hard as its transactions. While the price doesn’t mirror the wild rallies of its early days, its stability and recognition keep it a trusted pick among community members who want a familiar coin with historic credibility. October sees Dogecoin leaning further into mainstream integration, with merchant adoption campaigns making headlines again. The loyal Doge army has turned memes into markets, keeping Dogecoin firmly within the conversation. While new coins pop up daily, Dogecoin’s mix of longevity and relatability keeps it in the spotlight, proving that even the oldest meme projects can thrive when community belief refuses to die. 3. BullZilla Roars Into October as a Top Meme Coin to Buy Now BullZilla has gained traction by branding itself as the monster coin of 2025. Its design merges humor with power, positioning it as a meme coin that refuses to stay in the shadows. In October, BullZilla’s narrative has been fueled by rising mentions across online communities, particularly among those chasing fresh meme picks. The project thrives on virality, tapping into larger-than-life branding that makes it hard to ignore in a crowd of smaller tokens. Beyond the memes, BullZilla has leaned into strong liquidity injections and gamified community incentives. By rewarding active holders with access to limited events and unique engagement bonuses, it builds an identity that stretches beyond trading charts. As one of the top meme coins to buy now , BullZilla carries the meme market energy of 2021 into 2025, proving that fresh branding and consistent community backing can turn a playful name into a coin worth watching. 4. Shiba Inu Pushes Forward With Ecosystem Expansion Shiba Inu has been more than just Dogecoin’s rival; it’s been building its own sprawling ecosystem. In Q4 2025, Shiba Inu is pushing updates around its Shibarium layer-2 solution, strengthening the coin’s utility and making it more than just a meme ticker. For community members, this signals long-term vision, where memes meet infrastructure. Its decentralized exchanges and staking pools keep liquidity flowing, ensuring Shiba Inu’s role isn’t sidelined by new projects. October finds Shiba Inu benefiting from renewed excitement in decentralized applications and cross-chain compatibility. The coin is leveraging its branding strength while offering serious tools for holders. Participants recognize that SHIB continues to balance meme culture with expanding utility, cementing its place as a project that stays relevant while many meme tokens burn out. 5. Pudgy Penguins March Into 2025 With Viral Momentum Pudgy Penguins has transformed from a quirky NFT collection into a cultural meme asset that carries real trading power. In 2025, it’s no longer just about cute artwork, but about a community-first token that thrives on cultural presence. October showcases Pudgy Penguins with new partnerships and global merchandise drops, reinforcing its branding both on-chain and off-chain. This evolution has kept it trending in markets where meme value and real-world recognition collide. Community enthusiasm fuels Pudgy Penguins’ strength. From viral Twitter campaigns to consistent secondary market activity, this project holds staying power that new entrants often fail to replicate. As 2025 unfolds, Pudgy Penguins proves that meme-driven tokens backed by strong identity and consistent innovation can command real attention, blending viral traction with long-term cultural positioning. Conclusion: Is MoonBull ($MOBU) the New Upcoming Crypto in 2025? The projects highlighted for October—MoonBull, Dogecoin, BullZilla, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins—represent the mix of heritage, virality, and structured presale strength that defines Q4 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold strong through history and ecosystem growth. BullZilla and Pudgy Penguins bring energy through community branding and cultural expansion. Yet MoonBull’s mechanics, from reflections to burns, from staking to governance, create a design that directly rewards those who step in early. With its presale already in Stage 4, MoonBull stands as a rarity among meme tokens, offering structured scarcity alongside cultural power. Participants chasing presale hype tokens with limited supply are recognizing that this isn’t just another ticker; it’s a community-first system engineered for sustainability. MoonBull’s early access rewards and smart mechanics ensure it doesn’t just ride a trend—it builds one. For those seeking the next meme coin boom in 2025, the MoonBull presale is shaping up as the definitive entry.

According to reports, a proposal to require companies to pay billions of dollars in taxes on unrealized Bitcoin gains under the Biden-era Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) will be withdrawn as of October 1. The CAMT requires large companies to pay a tax of at least 15% on their reported income. Currently, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to “account at market value” for crypto assets. This means that when the price of Bitcoin rises, companies are forced to record their paper gains as income. This poses a huge tax burden for Michael Saylor's company, Strategy, which holds approximately $73 billion in Bitcoin reserves. However, unrealized gains on traditional assets like stocks are exempt from taxation. Related News: Daha Önceki ABD Hükümet Kapanmalarında Bitcoin (BTC) Fiyatı Nasıl Tepki Vermişti? İşte Mutlaka Bilinmesi Gerekenler Strategy and Coinbase, opposing this differential treatment, sent a joint letter to the Treasury Department last May requesting that cryptocurrency profits be exempted. The companies argued that taxing paper profits would force companies to sell Bitcoin just to pay taxes, making it difficult for American companies to compete globally and potentially creating constitutional issues due to the “tax on non-existent income.” *This is not investment advice.

The number was confirmed at 3:30 p.m. Eastern by Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires tracker, making Elon $150 billion richer than Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who now sits in second place after temporarily beating the ‘DogeFather’ just a few weeks ago, as Cryptopolitan reported . This record comes less than a year after Elon passed the $400 billion line in December, making this a new all-time high for personal wealth, and putting him halfway toward becoming the world’s first trillionaire. This happened after Tesla’s stock surged by nearly 4% the same day. That one-day surge added about $9.3 billion to Elon’s fortune. Back in April, Elon told investors on Tesla’s earnings call that he would step down from his government position under President Donald Trump to refocus on Tesla. He had been serving as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Since then, Tesla stock has nearly doubled in value, bringing the company’s total market cap to within 10% of its highest-ever valuation. As of now, Elon’s 12% stake in Tesla is valued at $191 billion, and it doesn’t even include the massive performance-based stock options package from 2018, which would be worth another $133 billion today, but sadly, a Delaware judge voided the award last year. Elon has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court, though, and while the case plays out, Forbes is discounting that part of his wealth by 50%. Tesla board proposes $1 trillion pay package amid court appeal While the 2018 stock grant remains stuck in legal limbo, Tesla’s board of directors introduced a new pay plan for Elon in September. This proposed package could give him stock worth up to $1 trillion, before taxes and share unlocking costs, if Tesla reaches extreme growth milestones. The plan includes a target for Tesla to multiply its market cap more than eight times over the next ten years. “It’s not about ‘compensation’, but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots,” Elon said on X. “If I can just get kicked out in the future by activist shareholder advisory firms who don’t even own Tesla shares themselves, I’m not comfortable with that future.” But Tesla alone isn’t what made the $500 billion number possible. Elon also owns a huge share of SpaceX, the rocket company he started in 2002. In August, SpaceX’s private valuation surged to $400 billion, up from $350 billion in December after a new tender offer. Elon holds 42% of SpaceX, and that stake is now worth $168 billion according to Forbes at press time. On top of that, there’s xAI Holdings, Elon’s AI startup that he merged with X (formerly Twitter). The combined entity is valued at $113 billion, and Elon owns 53%, which equals $60 billion more in his pocket. Elon was worth $24.6 billion just five years ago, in March 2020, but by August of that same year, Tesla’s stock rally had made him the fifth person to hit $100 billion. In January 2021, Elon became the world’s rich list after reaching $190 billion, then he became the third person to cross $200 billion in September 2021, after Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault. Then came $300 billion in November, and finally $400 billion in December 2024. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Rumors surrounding the XPL token suggested that the team was “made up of former Blast employees,” that “Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino invested only $50,000,” and that “the team sold 800 million tokens.” Plasma founder Paulie Punt denied these allegations one by one in his statement: No token sale: Punt stated that no team member sold XPL, all investor and team tokens are locked for 3 years, and there is a cliff for the first year. Team history: Punt said there are approximately 50 people on the Plasma team, but explained that only three of them previously worked at Blur or Blast. He also argued that the team comes from companies like Google, Facebook, Square, Temasek, Goldman Sachs, and Nuvei, adding, “If we were to describe our team as 'ex-Blast,' we should equally call it 'ex-Google' or 'ex-Goldman Sachs.'” No connection to Wintermute: Punt stated that they have never worked with Wintermute and have never engaged in any market-making activities. He added that they have the same information about Wintermute's holdings on the XPL as the public.

State entities that are not federally chartered banks, which were generally not allowed to accept deposits, may now be responsible for the safety of investors’ crypto assets. The no-action letter addresses uncertainty about whether state trust companies qualify as “banks” under the Acts for purposes of holding crypto assets and related cash. Greenlight For Crypto Companies The SEC will not recommend enforcement action against registered investment advisers or regulated funds that treat state trust companies as qualified custodians for crypto assets, subject to meeting specific conditions. The conditions include annual due diligence, custody agreements, risk disclosures, and best interest determinations. “This additional clarity was needed because state-chartered trust companies were not universally seen as eligible custodians for crypto assets,” Brian Daly, Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, told Crypto In America host Eleanor Terrett. “This is a staff letter, so at some point, this topic could be addressed by future rulemaking. We believe the market will benefit from having this guidance for today’s products, today’s managers, and today’s issues.” Terrett explained that this “opens the door for more players in the crypto custody market as well as broader access for funds to custody crypto.” Players such as Coinbase and Ripple with custody through Standard Custody, BitGo, or Wisdom Tree, and others, “will be recognized as qualified custodians.” Under the new @SECGov no-action letter, investment advisors can use Trust companies like Gemini as qualified custodians for crypto assets. Amazing awaits! — GeminiTrustCo (@GeminiTrustCo) September 30, 2025 SEC Chair Paul Atkins unveiled “Project Crypto” in July to dramatically lower regulatory burdens for the US crypto industry and to accelerate innovation and the integration of digital assets within the economy. The Pushback Begins SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw strongly criticized the staff letter on state trust company crypto custody. She claimed that the relief weakens investor protections by allowing state trust companies, which don’t meet traditional custody standards, to hold crypto assets, creating a dangerous precedent without proper justification or process. “The statutes and rules regarding custody are what stand between American investors, on the one hand, and the risk of theft, loss, or misappropriation of their assets, on the other.” Crenshaw, who has been vehemently anti-crypto in the past, argued that the relief lowers standards, creates unfair competition, crypto exceptionalism, and improper process. “With limited factual support or legal analysis, this action bores a troubling hole in that regime – and I fear investors’ assets may fall through the cracks,” she concluded.

Shorter unstaking on Solana reduces redemption risk for staking ETFs. Ethereum’s long exit queue and recent spikes in pending withdrawals create potential liquidity and cost challenges for ETF issuers. Onchain data shows Ethereum’s exit queue measured in millions of ETH, increasing average exit times and pressure on fund redemptions. Solana staking ETF advantage: Solana’s faster unstaking can ease ETF redemptions ahead of October SEC decisions — read analysis and implications now. What gives Solana an edge over Ethereum for staking ETFs? Solana staking ETF proponents argue the network’s shorter unstaking period lowers redemptions risk, enabling issuers to return assets faster. That operational difference matters for ETFs that must meet redemption timelines and reduces reliance on costly liquidity solutions. How do unstaking periods affect ETF redemptions? Unstaking periods determine how quickly an issuer can convert staked assets back to liquid tokens for investor redemptions. Ethereum’s exit queue has grown substantially — early September saw an entry queue peak near 860,369 ETH, while exit backlogs exceeded two million ETH, producing average wait times measured in weeks. By contrast, Solana’s unstaking typically clears faster, lowering the probability of delayed redemptions and the need for expensive credit facilities or complex liquidity overlays. Onchain data and issuer statements highlight these operational differences as a major consideration for product design and investor protection. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana’s shorter unstaking window may give it an advantage over Ethereum for staking ETFs"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a0c5-8814-7f83-a167-1aff2a62caf5.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the staking ETF race as the SEC readies October rulings.""} Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the race for staking ETFs, as US regulators prepare key decisions in October. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, pointing to Solana’s design as more favorable for issuers who must meet tight redemption timelines. Speaking at Token2049 in Singapore, Horsley emphasized that Solana’s quicker unstaking window can materially reduce delays. He noted that Ethereum’s withdrawal queue recently reached new highs and that extended exit backlogs create meaningful operational challenges for ETF issuers. “It’s a huge problem,” Horsley said. “The ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Staking requires locking tokens to secure a network and earn rewards. Locked assets face withdrawal timing constraints that vary by protocol and network demand. These constraints directly affect an ETF issuer’s ability to honor redemptions without maintaining large liquidity buffers. Horsley explained that Ethereum-based products can use alternatives — for example, credit facilities to fund redemptions or liquid staking tokens such as stETH — but those workarounds carry costs and capacity limits. He cited Bitwise’s European Ethereum staking ETP approach that uses a credit facility to preserve redemption liquidity as an example of necessary mitigation. Horsley’s remarks follow onchain metrics that tracked the Ethereum staking entry queue near 860,369 ETH in early September and showed the current ETH staking queue at 201,984 ETH with an average wait of about three days for entry. The exit queue has been longer, with figures indicating more than 2 million staked tokens awaiting withdrawal, translating into average exit times measured in weeks. When will the SEC decide on SOL and ETH ETFs? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to make decisions on multiple pending Solana and Ethereum ETF filings in October. Several asset managers amended S-1 filings to include staking provisions as they prepare for regulatory review. Notable proposals referenced in filings include applications from Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale Investments, Canary Capital, and VanEck for Solana ETFs with staking features. The SEC delayed decisions on certain Ether staking approvals to late October; BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust staking approval was pushed to Oct. 30. Source: Nate Geraci Why do issuers consider credit facilities and liquid staking tokens? Issuers use credit facilities to bridge redemptions while staked assets remain illiquid, but these facilities increase cost and create capacity constraints. Liquid staking tokens — such as popular liquid derivatives in the market — offer another workaround by giving holders tradable claims on staked positions. Both approaches are practical but imperfect: credit facilities add financial overhead; liquid staking tokens can introduce basis and protocol risk. Regulators and issuers must weigh these trade-offs in product approvals and disclosures. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess unstaking risk for staking ETFs"", ""description"": ""A short procedure to evaluate protocol unstaking timelines and ETF redemption risk."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check unstaking windows"", ""text"": ""Review the network’s documented unstaking and exit queue behavior and average wait times."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Examine onchain metrics"", ""text"": ""Use onchain data to measure current entry and exit queues, pending withdrawals, and recent spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Evaluate liquidity overlays"", ""text"": ""Assess the issuer’s planned liquidity facilities, costs, and capacity constraints for redemptions."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Consider liquid staking alternatives"", ""text"": ""Determine the role and risks of liquid staking tokens or derivative products in the ETF structure."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs? Typically yes: Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities. However, product design, liquidity arrangements, and market stress scenarios will ultimately determine practical redemption speed. How long are Ethereum exit queues currently? Onchain data showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH in early September, an active queue around 201,984 ETH for entry, and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, producing average exit waits of several weeks. Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk? No. Issuers can mitigate but not erase redemption risk. Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens lower near-term exposure but introduce cost or basis risks that must be disclosed to investors. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities, though issuer design and market stress will determine actual redemption speed."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How long are Ethereum exit queues currently?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Onchain data in early September showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, with average exit waits measured in weeks."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Issuers can mitigate but not eliminate redemption risk; options like credit facilities and liquid staking tokens reduce near-term exposure but add cost and other risks."" } } ]} Key Takeaways Shorter unstaking helps : Solana’s faster unstaking can reduce ETF redemption delays and operational risk. Ethereum trade-offs : Ethereum offers scale and liquidity but faces longer exit queues that can strain ETF redemptions. Issuer mitigation : Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens are practical workarounds but carry costs and risks. Conclusion As the SEC weighs staking features for SOL and ETH ETFs in October, operational factors like unstaking periods are central to issuer planning. Solana’s shorter unstaking window presents a clear operational benefit for staking ETFs, while Ethereum-based products must address longer withdrawal queues through liquidity solutions. Market participants should monitor regulatory outcomes and onchain metrics closely.",Analysis|Ethereum|News|ETH|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|SOL|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 21:34:42

Watch Out for Gold,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/01/when-could-bitcoin-break-out-to-new-highs-watch-out-for-gold,"Stocks printed fresh records and gold is on a tear crossing $3,900, but the last leg higher in traditional markets left bitcoin (BTC) behind. The largest crypto, often touted as digital gold, has been stuck in a $100,000–$120,000 range for nearly three months after setting new highs in July and August. The lag fits a pattern. Over the past couple of years, gold and bitcoin have taken turns: when gold breaks out, bitcoin tends to consolidate; when gold cools, BTC often resumes the advance. From January into April, BTC plunged about 30% while gold kicked off its next leg, rising roughly 28% to $3,500 at the height of the global tariff tantrum. Gold then stalled into August, and bitcoin took the baton, rallying about 60% from trough to peak to notch fresh records. Bitcoin to catch up when gold tires ""Gold likes low rates and a weak economy, whereas bitcoin likes them firm,"" said Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report . ""Because bitcoin likes a super strong economy, and low rates are associated with economic slumps."" He added that the BTC–gold relationship is loose: the 90-day correlation has averaged around 0.1 — ""basically zero."" Right now, gold is in a lockout rally toward $4,000, up about 17% across a seven-week winning streak. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still ranging below $120,000. If the recent rhythm holds, a pause in gold, or even a sideways drift, could be the tell for BTC’s next break out of the range and another run at records.

Officials from the Home Office have sent what is known as a technical capability notice to Apple, specifically targeting encrypted cloud backups of British citizens. This represents a scaled-back approach from an earlier attempt that sought global access to user data from anywhere in the world, which had sparked tensions with Washington. According to reports from the Financial Times published on Wednesday, the new notice focuses solely on data from UK-based customers rather than users worldwide. When asked about the matter, a Home Office representative declined to confirm or deny whether such notices exist, citing operational security. The spokesperson stated that the department would take whatever steps needed domestically to protect UK citizens. Apple pulled its advanced data protection service for new British customers in February following the initial dispute. The company informed existing users they would eventually need to turn off the security feature. Other communication tools like iMessage and FaceTime continue to offer encryption by default. US officials weigh in on dispute Last August, Tulsi Gabbard, who serves as director of national intelligence in the United States, indicated that British authorities had stepped back from their initial demands concerning American customer information. President Donald Trump had previously compared the access request to practices associated with China. While Apple did not directly address the story, the company expressed deep disappointment about being unable to provide advanced data protection to British customers. The firm stressed it would not create any backdoor access to its systems under any circumstances. “Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom. As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,” the company stated. Apple’s legal challenge continues Apple challenged the original technical capability notice through the investigatory powers tribunal, which examines whether domestic intelligence agencies have operated within the law. Specifics about what the notice contained were not disclosed, and current law under the Investigatory Powers Act prevents recipients from acknowledging these notices exist. According to the Financial Times, the first notice went beyond just advanced data protection and also covered the standard iCloud service that more people use. The advanced data protection feature relies on encryption that only allows account holders to unlock their files, including documents and photos. Even Apple cannot access this encrypted material. Apple has been strengthening its encryption capabilities across its services to protect user privacy. The situation points towards the broader concerns about data privacy and government surveillance that tech companies face when operating across different jurisdictions. “The resulting vulnerability can be exploited by hostile states, criminals and other bad actors the world over,” the organization said.

Nomination sent to Senate Banking Committee for consideration Hill previously issued guidance encouraging banks to engage with digital assets under risk controls Senate scheduling uncertain amid federal government shutdown; nomination timing is pending Travis Hill FDIC nomination: Trump nominates Hill as FDIC chair, urging bank guidance on crypto. Learn implications and next steps — read now. What is Travis Hill’s FDIC nomination? Travis Hill’s FDIC nomination is the presidential submission to the Senate to confirm Hill as Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for a five-year term. The nomination was transmitted to the Senate Banking Committee and awaits scheduling for hearings and a committee vote. How has Hill signaled FDIC policy toward crypto? Hill has publicly encouraged the FDIC to issue additional guidance on tokenization and digital assets. In March, he wrote to financial institutions clarifying that digital-asset activity can be a permissible activity when conducted under appropriate safety and soundness controls. Why does the nomination matter for banks and crypto firms? Confirmation could shift supervisory clarity: a confirmed chair advocating clearer guidance may reduce perceived debanking risk and help banks design compliant crypto services. Industry stakeholders and banks are watching for formal FDIC guidance and exam standards tied to digital-asset exposure. When will the Senate consider the nomination? The nomination is with the Senate Banking Committee, but hearings have not been scheduled. Congressional records show the referral; however, a federal government shutdown has delayed many committee calendars and may postpone consideration. Who did Hill replace and why is the chair vacant? Martin Gruenberg, the prior Senate-confirmed FDIC chair, resigned in January as part of the transition between administrations, leaving the position to be filled by a new nominee to serve a full term. Frequently Asked Questions Will Hill’s nomination change FDIC crypto exam priorities? If confirmed, Hill is likely to prioritize clearer guidance that frames crypto-related activities as permissible when banks maintain safety and soundness protections; this may lead to updated exam language over time. Can banks immediately expand crypto services under Hill’s guidance? Banks can consider digital-asset activities where permitted, but must align with existing regulatory risk-management expectations and consult legal and supervisory guidance before expanding services. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is Travis Hill’s FDIC nomination?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Travis Hill’s nomination is the president’s submission to the Senate to confirm him as FDIC chair for a five-year term; the Senate Banking Committee will schedule hearings and votes."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How did Hill describe banks’ ability to engage with digital assets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Hill stated banks may engage in digital-asset and tokenization activities as a permissible activity when they maintain safety, soundness, and appropriate risk controls."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When will the Senate vote on the nomination?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No hearing date has been set; the timeline depends on the Senate Banking Committee schedule, which may be affected by ongoing funding and government operations."" } } ]} Comparative summary: leadership status and crypto stance Item Previous Chair Travis Hill (Nominee) Confirmation status Resigned (January) Nominated; awaiting Senate consideration Public crypto stance Cautious, supervisory focus Supports clearer guidance; views crypto activity as permissible with controls Key Takeaways Nomination filed : The president sent Travis Hill’s FDIC nomination to the Senate Banking Committee for a five-year chair term.

Myriad users give Ethereum a 62% chance of reaching $5,000 before dropping to $3,500, while Solana has a 52.4% chance of not making a new ATH by year-end. These odds reflect both current price distances to ATH and shifting trader conviction since last week. How do the price distances compare? Ethereum trades near $4,144.89 and needs roughly a 13.8% gain to hit a $4,954–$5,000 target. Solana trades near $210.95 and requires about a 34.12% rally to reach $295.11, making SOL mathematically harder to push to ATH without a strong catalyst. How does the technical chart setup favor Ethereum? Ethereum’s weekly indicators show momentum and trend strength. RSI at 62 signals room to run. ADX at 32 confirms an established trend. The 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA provides continued support and a bullish bias during pullbacks. What are the key ETH levels to watch? Immediate support: $4,000 (psychological) Strong support: $3,500 (visual consolidation) Immediate resistance: $4,500 ATH target: $4,954–$5,000 Why does Solana look riskier despite upside potential? Solana’s ADX at 17 suggests weak directional conviction, implying choppy price action. Despite RSI near 59 and price above both key EMAs, Solana’s momentum is less certain, and a larger percentage is required to reach prior highs. What could change Solana’s trajectory? Approval of Solana-focused ETFs or favorable institutional flows would be a major catalyst. Market commentary from industry analysts and institutional ETF issuers (reported in mainstream financial outlets) suggests approvals are possible soon, creating asymmetric upside for SOL. When might each coin reach a new ATH based on Fibonacci fans? Fibonacci fan timing places ETH’s potential ATH between next week and December, depending on momentum. Solana’s fan projection stretches from late October 2025 to February 2026, reflecting a longer time horizon for a larger percentage move. Metric Ethereum (ETH) Solana (SOL) Current price $4,144.89 $210.95 Percent to ATH ~13.8% ~34.12% RSI (weekly) 62 59 ADX (weekly) 32 17 Fibonacci fan ATH window Weeks → December Late Oct 2025 → Feb 2026 Frequently Asked Questions Does prediction-market probability guarantee which coin hits ATH first? No. Prediction markets reflect participant sentiment and odds but are not guarantees. They are useful inputs combined with technicals and catalysts. Could an ETF approval make Solana beat Ethereum to an ATH? Yes. An ETF approval or major institutional flows can rapidly compress timeframes and close the percentage gap, producing faster upside than chart-based projections anticipate. Key Takeaways Prediction markets favor ETH : Myriad shows ~62% for ETH hitting a new ATH first. Technical edge for Ethereum : Stronger ADX, favorable EMA alignment, and cleaner weekly momentum. Solana is a wildcard : Larger percentage needed but ETF catalysts could produce fast asymmetric gains. Conclusion Ethereum currently holds the statistical and technical advantage to reach a new all-time high before Solana, driven by smaller upside required and clearer trend strength. However, Solana’s ETF narrative and compressed volatility keep it in play as an asymmetric candidate; traders should weigh momentum, event risk, and position sizing carefully.

52535791,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=825153,1759355450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52535791.jpeg,"DOGE canceled 384 federal leases, cutting $140 million in costs but hitting real estate hard",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musks-doge-cuts-haunt-real-estate/,"As the 2025 government shutdown kicks off with no end in sight, the damage from Elon Musk’s DOGE project is already hitting property markets across the country. DOGE was Elon’s brainchild during his short stint in federal office, and it’s still tearing through the real estate industry even after he walked away from Washington. As Cryptopolitan reported , the program has cancelled 384 government leases so far, and the DOGE website claims these cancellations saved around $140 million, but that so-called “savings” is crashing headfirst into a financial mess. The federal government used to be the safest possible tenant. Cameron LaPoint, who teaches finance at Yale, said government leases always came with a polite little cancellation clause, but no one actually used it. Landlords saw it as symbolic, not a real threat. DOGE changed that. “If you and I are renting an apartment and cancel the lease, there is a penalty of several months’ rent,” Cameron said. “But when the government cancels a lease, the landlords are left high and dry.” Now it’s happening all over, with cities, towns, blue states, red counties, you name it. DOGE’s calculations assume every lease would’ve been renewed, which isn’t always true. Some of those offices were probably going to close anyway due to agency downsizing or moves. But the volume of closures, and how fast they’ve happened, has made things worse. The government has pulled out of properties big and small, from an 845,000-square-foot building in D.C. to a 250-square-foot Secret Service office in New York City. Landlords lose tenants, lenders lose confidence Commercial loans across the country are now at risk. Cameron said the ripple effect touches “thousands of loans” because the commercial lending system depends on big tenants like the federal government. Banks package those loans and sell them as securities. When the anchor tenant disappears, the whole deal can fall apart. With the government out, those loans lose value and raise risk nationwide. A GSA spokeswoman says DOGE has saved $113 million for taxpayers, but no one at GSA is talking about what happens to buildings that now stand empty and worthless to lenders. In Florida, real estate broker Alexi Morgado, who runs Lexawise, says he’s already seeing a chain reaction. “The availability of supply does not always lead to immediate demand,” Alexi said. Buildings with canceled leases are sitting empty, losing money, and becoming harder to refinance. In some cases, owners are thinking about converting them into apartments or mixed-use space. But it takes planning and resources, and not every landlord has either. In California, Mark Besharaty, senior VP at Arbor Financial Group, says landlords are going to have to chop up their big government offices into smaller spaces just to stay afloat. “To mitigate what I see happening in most cases, the owners of these properties will have to reconfigure the properties to fit a different kind of tenant base,” Mark said. When banks can’t bundle the loans and offload the risk, they hike up interest rates, which hurts more deals across the country. “This is a national-scale issue,” he said. “It’s not just D.C., it’s throughout the country.” Rural towns brace for more federal walkouts Smaller towns are getting hit even harder. Unlike big cities, rural areas don’t get included in most bundled securities. When their leases get canceled, there’s no safety net. Cameron pointed out that 57% of leases eligible for early termination are outside the ten most populated states, and 63% are outside the biggest 100 counties. DOGE has already sent termination letters to 61% of those rural offices. In Marquette, Michigan, Mayor Michelle Hanley said the IRS office closure won’t matter much because no one’s actually worked there since the pandemic. But she’s pissed about DOGE targeting the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Baraga and the tribal health center in Sault Ste. Marie. Indigenous communities in northern Michigan make up five times more of the population than the state’s lower peninsula. “The cuts would hit hard,” Michelle said. Tom Whalen, who chairs the business department at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, says the federal pullback echoes Keynesian theory. Government spending stimulates economies. But when Washington starts pulling money out, things slow down. “With lower rental income and the loss of jobs, there is lower economic stimulus,” Tom said. “This has a ripple effect across the local economy.” Meanwhile, President Trump’s administration is threatening job cuts across agencies. Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, told House Republicans that layoffs could start within 48 hours. Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, confirmed during a briefing that federal workers will be fired “very soon.” Betting platforms think this shutdown will last at least two weeks.

Through its digital assets arm SG-Forge, the bank announced the rollout of two stablecoins – USDCV and EURCV – pegged to the U.S. dollar and euro. Both will operate on the Ethereum blockchain and serve as the foundation for upcoming lending and borrowing protocols. It’s happening now: a bank regulated as a G-SIB (global systemically important bank) has officially entered decentralized finance. SG-Forge, the blockchain subsidiary of @SocieteGenerale , now allows its euro (EURCV) and dollar (USDCV) stablecoins to be traded on @Uniswap , and… pic.twitter.com/xa3YxxKPG2 — Louis Tellier | Blockstories (@Louis_Tellier) September 30, 2025 The bank selected Morpho to power its lending services and chose Uniswap as the spot trading platform for USDCV and EURCV. Both stablecoins are fully compliant with MiCa regulations in Europe and can be redeemed for their fiat equivalents directly on-chain at any time. Backed by cash reserves held at Bank of New York Mellon and Societe Generale itself, USDCV and EURCV will also expand to the Solana blockchain soon. This move highlights a growing institutional shift toward blockchain – with Ethereum standing out as the go-to network for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Sets Course to $7K After Trend Line Bounce Ethereum is on a clear ascending trajectory and has formed a price channel that could serve as a blueprint for traders to establish a path for the token for the next few months. The token bounced off the lower bound of the channel almost perfectly in the past few days upon hitting the $4,000 threshold and could now be heading to $7,000 if the market continues to respect this pattern. If the price action follows this pattern after a brief retest, we could see ETH jump toward $9,000 . Today’s news favors a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum as institutional adoption is accelerating. This trend could boost top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), whose layer-2 scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain has received millions from investors at this early stage. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises Nearly $19M to Launch Its Solana-Powered Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve the biggest roadblocks that prevent the Bitcoin blockchain from scaling further by launching the first true Bitcoin Layer 2. Instead of capping out at 7 transactions per second, Bitcoin Hyper processes transfers with low latency, making asset transfers faster, cheaper, and more scalable. On top of that, it opens the door for smart contracts and dApps to finally run natively on Bitcoin’s ecosystem. All of this is possible through a Solana-powered solution that leverages the power and efficiency of this blockchain to kick off a new era where BTC holders can finally earn yield on their assets. The presale gives early buyers a chance to reap the highest returns. Starting at just $0.013005, $HYPER could deliver sizable gains once top wallets and exchanges embrace the protocol. To buy $HYPER, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and link a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You could either swap crypto for this token or use a bank card to invest.

52535516,594645,1759356006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52535516.jpeg,Bitcoin Spot Liquidity Shrinks: Stablecoin NetFlows Turn Negative Despite ETF Inflows,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-liquidity-stablecoin-netflows-negative/,"Bitcoin is pressing higher, pushing above the $115,000 level and edging closer to critical resistance. Momentum has returned to the market, with many traders anticipating a bullish move that could test all-time highs and extend the ongoing bull trend. Optimism is building as Bitcoin’s resilience at elevated levels fuels speculation of another aggressive breakout. However, not all analysts are convinced that the path ahead is clear. Some caution that risks remain beneath the surface, pointing to worrying signals from liquidity data. Top analyst Axel Adler shared fresh insights showing that the average Stablecoin NetFlow to centralized exchanges has gone negative and has been declining since September 22. This trend suggests that fewer stablecoins are entering exchanges to provide spot liquidity, even as Bitcoin trades at elevated prices. Declining liquidity can weaken market structure and increase vulnerability to sharper moves, particularly if selling pressure resurfaces. While ETF inflows and strong institutional demand continue to support Bitcoin, the imbalance between reduced stablecoin flows and rising price levels highlights a fragile dynamic. For bulls, holding above $115,000 is essential, but the market’s next phase will depend on whether liquidity returns to sustain a lasting rally. ETF Inflows Support Bitcoin, But Uptober Needs More Fuel Top analyst Axel Adler noted that institutional flows remain one of the strongest factors supporting Bitcoin’s price at current levels. Over the last couple of days, ETFs recorded inflows of $947 million, a sizable addition of fresh capital that has provided critical support for the market. These inflows demonstrate that institutional demand for Bitcoin remains robust, even as broader liquidity indicators, such as stablecoin flows, show signs of weakness. Adler emphasized, however, that while ETF inflows are encouraging, they are not yet sufficient to power a full-fledged Uptober rally. Historically, October has been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, often marked by outsized gains and aggressive breakouts. But for that momentum to unfold again, Adler argues that the market needs broader confirmation, including stronger spot flows and renewed liquidity entering exchanges. Without that added layer of support, rallies risk losing steam against persistent resistance levels, such as the $117,500 zone that has capped upside moves since the summer. The timing adds to the importance. With Q4 now underway, investors are looking ahead to what could be a defining stretch for Bitcoin’s bull trend. A breakout above resistance, paired with sustained inflows, would fuel optimism of retesting all-time highs. On the other hand, failure to gather momentum could prolong consolidation and keep traders cautious. Bitcoin Tests $117,500 Resistance as Q4 Begins Bitcoin is trading around $116,200, showing strength after recovering from lows near $112,000 earlier this month. On the 3-day chart, price action reveals a series of rebounds that continue to press against the $117,500 resistance zone, highlighted in yellow. This level has been a defining barrier since July, repeatedly rejecting attempts to break higher and marking it as the key level to watch heading into Q4. The structure still reflects consolidation within a broad range, with $110,000 acting as a firm support base. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average (blue) is providing short-term guidance, showing Bitcoin holding above it for the first time since the September pullback. The 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) averages remain comfortably below spot price, reinforcing the long-term bullish trend. For momentum to continue, Bitcoin must decisively clear $117,500 and hold above it, which could open the path toward $120,000 and eventually retests of the summer highs near $125,000.

This strategic transformation is inextricably linked to the dominance of Stablecoins and the explosive growth of Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs). Network Effects Of Stablecoins And RWA On Ethereum In a recent post on X, the Token Terminal highlighted a key insight focusing on why Stablecoins and RWAs matter for the Ethereum market cap. To date, Stablecoins and RWAs are crucial for ETH, as the market capitalization of tokenized assets on ETH acts as the floor for ETH’s market cap. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Next Milestone: November Fork Targets Scalability And Efficiency – Details The reasoning is that as more assets are tokenized on the ETH blockchain, including the massive market of stablecoins and the growing sector of RWAs, the total value locked and secured by the network increases, and the more Ethereum’s market cap benefits. A Host and Producer of The Edge_Pod, known as DeFi_Dad, has reflected on how rewarding it feels to finally see stablecoins cementing credibility for Ethereum and the decentralized finance (DeFi). For years, explaining crypto in real life carried negative associations, which were often tied to price speculation or hype. Meanwhile, the narrative has shifted, and stablecoins have provided a clear, relatable entry point, with investors focused on investing in digital money applications using Stablecoins. However, the expert pointed out that the stablecoins are now so mainstream in the media that even government officials and traditional media are taking them seriously. Unlike Bitcoin, which many people only associate with volatile price action, stablecoins provide practical utility and a way to earn 5–10% yields on-chain. According to DeFi_Dad, most of it is built on ETH and stablecoins, which are like Fundstrat and the ChatGPT moment for crypto, a breakthrough product that clicks instantly for the masses. From there, stablecoins would become the stepping stone into DeFi yield and broader digital asset exposure. A Stronger Foundation For Future Development Amid the Ethereum advancements, the new Go-Pulse v3.3.0 has officially been released, a major rebase that is going to make the ETH network even faster and more robust. Richard Heart mentioned that the update from the old Go-Ethereum (GETH) v1.13.13 has gone all the way up to the new v1.16.3, which would deliver substantial performance and efficiency improvements. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Bloodbath: Rugs And Scams Erode Retail Confidence, What To Know Heart credited ETH’s role in the process, noting that the Ethereum mainnet serves as the ultimate testing ground.

(FDIC) acting chair Travis Hill to spearhead the agency during his second term in the White House, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill Officially Nominated To Position According to the October 1 report, an anonymous source confirmed to the media outlet that Trump nominated Hill to formally serve as chair of the FDIC . Hill, who has been serving as acting chair of the FDIC since January, is largely seen as a favorable choice for allowing banks to engage in crypto-related activities . Prior to his time leading the FDIC, Hill served as the organization’s deputy to the chairman for policy and senior adviser to the chairman. Crypto Community Reacts As Government Shutdown Continues Several key players in the digital asset space took to social media following news of Hill’s nomination on Wednesday. “We congratulate Travis Hill on his nomination to serve at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,” Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger said in a October 1 statement. “His extensive background in financial regulation and public service uniquely positions him to contribute to the stability and modernization of our financial system.” Chairman @SenatorTimScott issued the following statement regarding Travis Hill’s nomination to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of @FDICgov : pic.twitter.com/i36YOLzU7b — U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP (@BankingGOP) October 1, 2025 Crypto-friendly Senator Tim Scott also praised Hill in a Wednesday statement, saying the former policy adviser possesses a “commitment to fairness in our financial system.” “I look forward to continuing to work with him to strengthen our financial system, protect consumers, and ensure fairness, access, and accountability,” Scott added. Meanwhile, Hill’s nomination coincides with the beginning of a U.S. government shutdown after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on key government spending bills. A Wednesday vote that would have effectively ended the shutdown also failed, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hinting at “imminent” layoffs. Ultimately, Trump’s choice of Hill shows the administration’s regulatory priorities —though whether such moves withstand Washington’s dysfunction during yet another government shutdown remains far from clear.

The motion, titled “A Swedish Bitcoin Strategy” (Motion 2025/26:793), calls on the government to investigate how a strategic Bitcoin reserve could be built and to determine which authority would be best suited to manage it. A first step for #Bitcoin in Sweden. On Sept 24, @DennisDioukarev hosted a Bitcoin seminar featuring talks from @satmojoe and @bitcoin_advies . This marks a key moment as Bitcoin enters Sweden’s political stage and strengthens Nordic cooperation for adoption. pic.twitter.com/DkplLDTj1v — JAN3 (@JAN3com) October 1, 2025 The motion also asks the government to confirm that it does not plan to alter the legal definition of tender or introduce a central bank digital currency under the Riksbank Act. Proposal Urges Sweden to Treat Bitcoin Like Gold as a Store of Value The lawmakers argue that Sweden’s central bank already maintains a gold reserve and foreign exchange reserves, and Bitcoin could serve as a complementary asset. They point to developments in the United States, where a national Bitcoin reserve framework was recently advanced through the bipartisan GENIUS Act . Other countries, including the United Kingdom and Finland, have accumulated Bitcoin through seizures, while the Czech Republic, Latvia, and Poland are reportedly weighing similar strategies. The Swedish proposal outlines several reasons for adding Bitcoin to state reserves. These include diversification, given that Bitcoin’s value is not tied to the monetary policies of any single country; inflation protection, as the cryptocurrency’s supply is capped at 21 million; and liquidity, with Bitcoin trading continuously and at low transaction costs compared to fiat currencies. The lawmakers also frame Bitcoin as a signal of digital innovation, describing it as an asset now comparable in scale to silver and larger than companies such as Tesla, Meta, and Amazon. To avoid additional spending, the motion suggests a budget-neutral approach in which law enforcement agencies transfer seized Bitcoin to the Riksbank or another designated authority instead of auctioning it off. The debate over a national Bitcoin strategy has been building in Sweden throughout 2025. In April, MP Dennis Dioukarev wrote to Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson urging her to consider adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserves, drawing comparisons to gold as a store of value. Swedish lawmakers propose adding Bitcoin to national reserves, highlighting its role as digital gold and a safeguard against economic uncertainty. #BitcoinReserve #Sweden https://t.co/1nVJdLpotl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 15, 2025 MP Rickard Nordin echoed the call in a separate letter dated April 8 , arguing that Bitcoin could safeguard financial sovereignty amid growing global uncertainty. Both lawmakers cited the example of the United States, which has formalized its approach to Bitcoin holdings after years of building reserves through seizures. Despite these appeals, Swedish authorities have maintained a cautious stance toward the crypto sector. Regulators have taken a strict line on exchanges and miners in recent years, citing tax and compliance risks. The proposal now before parliament will be reviewed by the Finance Committee on October 15, where lawmakers will debate whether Sweden should join the growing list of nations actively exploring state-level Bitcoin reserves. If approved, Sweden would position itself among a small but expanding group of governments treating Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. Sweden Balances Bitcoin Adoption With Tougher Seizure Laws Sweden is seeing a growing convergence between crypto adoption and tougher state oversight. Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer instructed authorities to step up asset seizures under a new law targeting unexplained wealth, which took effect in November 2024. The measure allows confiscation of cash, crypto, and luxury goods if owners cannot justify their income. Sweden’s Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has ordered local authorities to intensify efforts to seize assets like cryptocurrency. #sweden #crypto https://t.co/tdJMk4mIWG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 5, 2025 So far, over $8.3 million has been seized. The law has sparked controversy, with critics warning of risks to civil liberties after cases such as a woman losing $137,000 and a Rolex at Gothenburg airport. At the same time, Swedish firms are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Health technology company H100 Group AB disclosed a 4.39 BTC purchase in May , calling it a “long-term” balance sheet strategy. @H100Group cross-lists on Frankfurt Exchange becoming 44th largest public Bitcoin treasury with 510.28 $BTC accumulated through aggressive July purchases. #Bitcoin #Sweden https://t.co/R4EfLBR6tK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 22, 2025 In July, digital commerce firm Refine Group AB followed with a $1 million Bitcoin reserve funded through a share issue. Both companies said they plan to expand holdings. Nations and States Eye Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as Inflation Hedge Massachusetts is set to debate the creation of a state-backed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), with lawmakers scheduled to hold a hearing on October 7. Supporters frame the measure as a hedge against inflation and a step toward diversifying assets, while critics cite volatility and regulatory uncertainty. The Massachusetts Joint Revenue Committee sets hearing on Bitcoin Strategic Reserve bill for Oct 7, examining crypto’s role in state asset strategy. #Bitcoin #Massachusetts https://t.co/yMIwJw9DUY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 29, 2025 If advanced, Massachusetts would be the first Democratic-led state to seriously consider a Bitcoin reserve. Similar measures have already passed in Texas and Utah, while Wyoming and Michigan are considering bills that would allocate a portion of state funds to Bitcoin. Momentum is also building abroad.

52535667,https://cryptonews.com/?p=431156,1759356180,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52535667.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 1 October – XRP, PUMP, Plasma",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-1-october-xrp-pump-plasm/,"With the market surging to a cap of $4.086 trillion today, the crypto price prediction for XRP, PUMP and Plasma has just become very interesting. All three of these coins have made significant moves in the past 24 hours, with PUMP boasting one of the best returns in the market today, at 24%. But with a wave of altcoin ETFs are about to launch in the coming weeks, we may see even bigger gains in the final months of the year. We forecast where the three coins above are likely to be in the next few weeks and by the end of the year, using their technicals and fundamentals to arrive at price predictions. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Technicals and ETFs Position Altcoin for Major End-of-Year Rally Boasting a 3% gain in the past 24 hours, the XRP price has risen to $2.94, which also means that it has risen by 2% in a week and by 4% in a month. XRP has also posted an annual return of 367%, making it one of the best-performing major tokens over the last 12 months. Such gains have followed from Ripple’s increasingly bullish position, with the company expanding rapidly following the final conclusion of its legal case with the SEC in August. This has boosted bullishness for XRP, and given that more than ten XRP ETFs are in line to launch by the end of the year, the coin’s price could very soon burst. If we look at its chart, we see that it has just begun a breakout, following a period of overselling. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) are beginning to rise again after being in negative positions, while its price looks as though it’s about to break out of a bullish pennant. Now may be a perfect time to buy XRP, just before it reclaims $3 and potentially breaks its ATH of $3.65, which it recorded in July. And as we head towards the end of the year, XRP could even rise towards $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Pump.fun ($PUMP) – Launchpad Growth Could See New Alt Smash All-Time High If there’s one top-100 token that has truly pumped today, it’s Pump.fun, which at $0.006771 has rallied by 25% in the past 24 hours. This price also marks a 12.5% gain in a week and a 96% increase in the last 30 days, with the token rallying hard on the back of the Pump.fun launchpad’s recent growth . Pump.fun is now one of the largest dapps running on Solana and in the crypto ecosystem as a whole, with most new coins launching on its platform. This is extremely bullish as far as PUMP’s price is concerned, and its chart today suggests that we may see more gains in the near and medium term. Source: TradingView Its indicators are rising from oversold positions, while its price is also bouncing up from the bottom of a channel in which it has been trading since late August. As such, the crypto price prediction for PUMP looks very promising, with the alt on course to retake its ATH of $0.008819 (set in mid-September) in the next few weeks. From there, it could easily rise beyond $0.020 in the final month of the year, and rise even higher if the wider market is bullish enough. Crypto Price Prediction: Plasma ($XPL) – New Stablecoin Platform Ready to Break Out of Channel At $1.04, new token XPL has actually dropped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, while it’s also down by 38% since hitting a record high of $1.68 three days ago. However, as the native token of Bitfinex-backed stablecoin platform Plasma, it has very strong fundamentals, and is likely to return to growth after its current correction plays out. Plasma already has a total value locked in of $5.67 billion , making it the sixth-biggest layer-one network in the crypto ecosystem. This is hugely encouraging for such a young platform, and it bodes well for XPL’s future price action. Despite today’s fall, XPL’s indicators have bottomed out and begun to rise again, suggesting that a recovery is on its way. It has also been trading within a falling channel over the past week or so, implying that it could make a big move very soon. Assuming favorable market conditions, it could potentially break out towards $2 in the next week or so, before rallying higher in the coming weeks. From there, it could pass $4 or even $10 by the end of the year. PEPENODE Raises $1.5 Million in Presale: Could the Mine-to-Earn Token Surge on Launch? As far as newer tokens go, there are several interesting presale coins currently available to investors, with some showing potential for big things. One of these is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $1.5 million in its presale, which it opened only a few weeks ago. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 This figure is an encouraging sign for PEPENODE’s future, with the token generating hype on the back of its plans to become the market’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that it will enable its holders to develop their own virtual mining rigs, through which they can earn rewards in other tokens, such as PEPE and FARTCOIN. Users can spend PEPENODE to buy more virtual mining nodes, with a higher number of nodes providing greater rewards. This should incentivize greater PEPENODE accumulation, as should the fact that holders can also stake the token, earning staking rewards on top of virtual mining rewards. This promises to make the coin one of the more intriguing launches of the year, with investors able to join its sale by going to the PEPENODE website . The token currently costs $0.0010831, although this will continue to rise for as long as the sale runs.
