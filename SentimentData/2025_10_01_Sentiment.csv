Poland’s New Crypto Law Faces Pushback,https://bitcoinist.com/too-tough-polands-new-crypto-law-faces-pushback/,"Poland’s lower house has approved a wide-ranging crypto bill that would put the country’s entire virtual asset market under stricter state control. Based on reports, the measure — known as Bill 1424 — passed the lower house of Poland’s national parliament, or Sejm , with 230 votes in favor and 196 opposed. The law would give the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, KNF, sweeping powers over exchanges, issuers and custodians operating in or serving customers in Poland. What The Law Requires According to coverage, the draft compels all Crypto Asset Service Providers to obtain a KNF license to operate in the market. It would set detailed rules on capital, internal controls, anti-money-laundering safeguards and risk management. Penalties are heavy: operating without a permit could draw fines up to 10 million złoty (about US$2.8 million) and, in some versions, criminal liability including up to two years in prison for serious breaches. Existing firms would get a six-month window to apply for authorization once the law takes effect. Sejm głosami ekspertów takich jak pani Skowrońska przyjął ustawę o zniszczeniu blackchaina i stabletcoinów w Polsce. Teraz senat, potem konieczne weto @NawrockiKn i można składać projekt ustawy rozwijający a nie zwijający rynek krypto aktywów w Polsce. pic.twitter.com/LgeSdNB4aD — Tomasz Mentzen (@TomaszMentzen) September 26, 2025 Supporters Say It Brings Clarity Backers argue the move will align Poland with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets rules and give clearer rules to investors and businesses. Clarity is meant to reduce scams and make large players feel safer about doing business in Poland. Some observers say stronger oversight could attract institutional money that has been wary of unclear local rules. Concerns From Industry And Lawmakers But many in Poland’s crypto community warn the bill goes further than EU minimums and could burden smaller players. Reports point to concerns about high costs and heavy paperwork that might push startups to move operations abroad. There is also worry the KNF’s review process could be slow; some sources claim decisions might take as long as 30 months, creating an uncertain climate for firms that need speed to survive. Artists, small issuers and hobbyist projects fear that strict rules will squeeze out low-budget activity. Transparency And Blocking Powers The draft would also require more disclosures from issuers and service providers. Regulators could maintain a register of unpermitted domains and use tools to block access. Supporters say this helps fight fraud. Critics say it risks overreach and could limit legitimate users’ access to services. Based on reports, after clearing the Sejm the text is moving to the Senate for review. President Karol Nawrocki has been reported to consider a veto unless certain provisions are softened, particularly those that introduce criminal penalties and broad supervisory powers. Lawmakers and industry groups are pressing for amendments that would narrow the scope of some requirements and ease costs for smaller operators.

The announcement marks a major milestone, as $MET is expected to serve as a governance and utility token, enabling voting on protocol decisions, staking for rewards, fee discounts, and participation in liquidity incentives. $MET 23.10.2025 The ignition point of our manifesto has arrived.

See you then. pic.twitter.com/xEjFn2bnX8 — Meteora (@MeteoraAG) September 30, 2025 When is the upcoming TGE for the $MET token? The vibes in the Solana ecosystem got a shot in the arm earlier today after Meteora’s announcement about its upcoming airdrop, which will target users who farmed points in Seasons 1 and 2 via liquidity provision and trading on the platform. The announcement post included a date — 23.10.2025 — presumed to be the exact day the TGE will happen. “The ignition point of our manifesto has arrived,” the post caption read. “We’re onboarding the next wave of the LP Army and powering token launches. $MET will fuel opportunity, innovation, and community. See you then.” Several days before the announcement on September 10, Meteora shared a five-part update that outlined the road to launch. It revealed how aggressively the team has been building in the background, which has led to the release of DBC and DAMM V2, which have been powering major launchpads like Believe, Bags, and DAOs.fun. The airdrop allocation is to be determined by a points allocation that the community has been accumulating over the past year. At the time that the team shared the update, it revealed its infrastructure is being scaled by up to 10x to handle user demand. As for the claim process, Meteora said in its September 10 post that users will be able to claim $MET (and potentially future airdrops) seamlessly via the Meteora interface. It has even been confirmed that eligible participants will enjoy a few of such drops prior to the official mMeteora token launch, so there is even more to look forward to in the coming days. The team has also outlined “Met-ober” updates, including TGE goals, Jupiter staker integrations (with extra rewards), and launch pool strategies to power new token launches on the platform. Other DeFi airdrops to watch out for The $MET TGE and airdrop is only one of the DeFi-focused drops slated to drop in the fourth quarter of this year. Other similar projects that Degens are staking include the Abstract Chain, Pump.fun, Kamino Finance, Solayer, LayerZero, Backpack and Hyperliquid, to name a few. Among these projects, some like LayerZero, Hyperliquid , and Kamino Finance, have already launched previous airdrop campaigns and are just rewarding users for another season of engagement. However, the likes of Solayer, Abstract Chain, Pump.fun, and Backpack are airdropping tokens to eligible users for the first time. All the projects listed above are expected to airdrop this Q4, except for Backpack, which reportedly has plans to launch in the first quarter of 2026. Between the $MET token and the remaining drops for the year, observers claim up to $500M+ could get injected into the crypto industry.

This is coming at a time when criticisms of him and his company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy have gone up a few decibels. In a recent conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Saylor compared Bitcoin to historic breakthroughs such as fire, electricity, and oil, calling it property, capital and energy in cyberspace. Saylor’s trillion-dollar Bitcoin endgame Saylor envisions Strategy building its Bitcoin treasury to $1 trillion and moving far beyond that. Strategy has already become the most prominent corporate Bitcoin holder since it pivoted in 2020 from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. Strategy now holds 640,031 BTC , purchased through a mix of cash reserves, convertible debt, and repeated equity issuance. It announced the acquisition of 196 Bitcoins for $22.1 million when the token dipped below $110,000, as Cryptopolitan reported on Monday. Saylor insists the model is only beginning to take hold. He notes that while only a handful of listed firms held Bitcoin in 2020 when Strategy went all in on the cryptocurrency, more than 180 do today. He predicts this will grow to thousands as companies shift their balance sheets toward digital assets. Saylor also believes that tech giants such as Apple, Google and Microsoft will eventually embed Bitcoin into their operating systems and hardware. For Saylor, the stakes go beyond corporate profits. He frames Bitcoin as a foundation of economic integrity, decentralization, and energy efficiency, a financial system that can transfer value across time and space. Skeptics question the model Critics, however, remain unconvinced. There is also a very vocal group speaking about the “impending doom” that awaits Saylor’s Strategy and the people and institutions who have invested in them. In June this year, veteran short-seller Jim Chanos described parts of Saylor’s valuation logic as “ financial gibberish ,” questioning why Strategy trades at a premium to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Peter Schiff, chief economist and strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, also shared similar sentiments in an X post last week, calling Saylor’s business strategy “harebrained” and pointing out that Strategy (MSTR) has been “down 45%” since its November 2024 high. A recent report showed that Strategy’s stock, which for years traded well above the net asset value of its Bitcoin stash, has lost some of its luster. Saylor has brushed off the trend, saying he is unbothered. Analysts warn of dilution risk, since Strategy funds purchases largely by issuing stock or convertible notes. While the strategy boosts the Bitcoin treasury, it also leaves common shareholders with a smaller slice of the company. Saylor’s struggle to defend his vision is perennial Saylor dismisses such concerns, likening criticism of Bitcoin to historic resistance against electricity or nuclear power. Each new price milestone, he argues, brings a new wave of skeptics, yet adoption continues to expand. He also rejects the notion that corporate buying crowds out retail investors, pointing to the estimated $1.8 trillion in gains enjoyed by individuals since companies such as Strategy and BlackRock entered the market. The scale of his ambition, however, raises questions of feasibility. To reach a trillion-dollar Bitcoin reserve at current prices, Strategy would need to hold around 9 million BTC, close to half of the total supply that will ever exist. Even if Bitcoin rises sharply, the capital required would dwarf the company’s present means. However, the symbolic power of Saylor’s claim may be as important as its literal execution. In his telling, Bitcoin offers not just a speculative hedge but a chance to power a global system of trust. According to him, Strategy’s model will be remembered as a paradigm shift in corporate treasury management.

This makes it the first bank in Qatar to extend its network into blockchain for real-time USD settlements, eliminating the multi-day delays common in traditional systems. JPMorgan’s Expanding Network A Bloomberg report shows that the Kinexys system allows corporate clients to execute transactions in minutes, even on weekends or outside business hours. Kamel Moris, QNB’s Executive Vice President for Global Transaction Banking, described this as “a treasurer’s dream,” noting that transaction timeframes can be reduced to just two minutes, a major advantage for companies operating with tight liquidity. It also eliminates many of the inefficiencies in conventional payment networks by directly programming deposit accounts onto blockchain rails. These rails reportedly process $3 billion in daily payments across connected banks, making it easier for treasury teams to automate liquidity flows. JPMorgan has been steadily scaling Kinexys across the Middle East. The platform builds on the bank’s earlier blockchain initiatives, including the Onyx division and projects tied to Quorum, its enterprise blockchain. For the financial institution, QNB’s entry adds to a growing list of regional adopters. Companies such as Emirates NBD and Saudi National Bank have already joined the network, showing how Gulf lenders are prioritizing speed, transparency, and always-on settlement options. What This Means for the Banking Industry Studies show that local corporate payments depend on correspondent banks, with the structure causing delays due to time zone variance, business-hour restrictions, and other manual checks. Kinexys, on the other hand, allows payments to move directly on blockchain rails, which bypasses these traditional frictions. Large financial institutions worldwide are accelerating their use of distributed ledger technology, viewing it as a tool to simplify complex back-office processes. While banks have tested these systems for over a decade, few have been able to scale or achieve commercial viability. Earlier this year, Reuters also announced a partnership between India’s Axis Bank and JPMorgan to extend Axis clients’ access to 24/7 dollar transfers. This collaboration allowed the firm to streamline its liquidity management and unlocked advanced treasury capabilities such as multi-bank cash concentration. The technology provides more than just speed, offering lower costs and greater transparency. Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys, said in an interview that opening the network to such firms allows it to reach companies that are not direct clients of the bank. “This is institutional-grade scale,” he said.

The SEC's Division of Investment Management issued a so-called no-action letter on Tuesday , a document that assures that the regulator doesn't intend to pursue any enforcement actions by those engaging in the specific activity — in this case, that SEC-registered advisers and funds can park digital assets in state trusts. Such qualified-custodian questions had represented a policy battleground during the tenure of former SEC chairs Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, the former having led the agency to introduce a later-abandoned proposal that would have constrained what kinds of companies could handle the crypto of regulated investment advisers. Gensler made it clear he specifically meant to muscle out exchanges such as Coinbase. But the SEC's new management — most notably Chairman Paul Atkins — is pursuing a crypto-forward campaign, with Atkins saying earlier this week that establishing industry policies is the agency's top priority (as assigned by pro-crypto President Donald Trump). While Tuesday's no-action letter isn't a formal agency rule, it carries enough weight to free firms from short-term compliance worries. Specifically, the document said the SEC ""would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under the custody provisions against a registered adviser or regulated fund for treating a state trust company as a 'bank' with respect to the placement and maintenance of crypto assets."" The earlier argument from Gensler was that crypto firms weren't safe and sufficiently regulated to qualify as risk-free enough for registered investment advisers to keep their customers' assets. ""Even though it was never adopted, the proposal has created problems for investment advisers through its assertion that most crypto assets are likely to be funds or crypto asset securities covered by the current rule, and thus must be maintained with a qualified custodian,"" Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech in Singapore on Tuesday. She argued that the agency ""should consider updating the rules governing permissible custodians for registered investment advisers and investment companies,"" adding that maybe technologically adept companies should be permitted to custody assets themselves. But Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who was allied with Gensler on this point two years ago, issued a statement opposing the no-action treatment , saying the SEC is effectively treating crypto as something apart from the rest of the financial sector. And it's ignoring the efforts of firms pursuing federal chartering from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ""Rather than create a level playing field, we leave investors and the markets to gamble in an unnecessary game of 50-state regulatory roulette – just to accommodate crypto,"" she said. ""Executing a shift of this magnitude via no-action relief without public comment and without any economic analysis is ill-advised for many reasons, not least of which because it likely violates the Administrative Procedure Act, though this has become commonplace by this commission."" The SEC has been pursuing a number of crypto policies under Atkin's recent Project Crypto, and the chairman has set an agenda to issue formal crypto rules in the coming months. Meanwhile, Congress has made extensive progress on legislation to more completely regulate the U.S. digital assets markets.",Policy|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Hester Peirce|Paul Atkins|Regulations|Custody|Trusts|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-30 22:18:16

Bitcoin still trades roughly 10% below its record high (ATH) of $124,128 reached last month. Meanwhile, its market share is slipping, as enthusiasm shifts toward top-performing altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have posted ATHs in the past year. The spark for this resurgence can be traced to two pivotal policy moves in Washington. First, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. framework specifically regulating stablecoins. Shortly after, the SEC rolled out Project Crypto , a modernization effort to adapt securities laws to the digital asset era. With confidence rebounding, the spotlight is on XRP, Solana, and Pepe as prime candidates for dip-buying ahead of what could be the next bullish cycle. Ripple ($XRP): The Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse and 2025’s Leading Altcoin Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) jumped to an all-time peak of $3.65 on July 18, coinciding with the passage of the GENIUS Act and eclipsing its previous 2018 record of $3.40. It has since eased back to around $2.85, roughly 22% off that high. XRP’s strength lies in its role as a low-cost, high-speed solution for global money transfers, positioning it as a modern challenger to systems like SWIFT. Its credibility has been bolstered by recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund and growing acceptance in the U.S. financial sector. Ripple’s regulatory influence was highlighted earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse took part in a White House crypto policy discussion. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, underscores its ambition to secure a piece of the fast-expanding stablecoin market. Momentum also picked up after a landmark 2023 ruling confirmed that XRP’s retail sales were not securities, a turning point in its long-running legal fight with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has rocketed 346%, leaving Bitcoin trailing with a still notable 77.5% gain over the same period. After rallying in July, it found support near $3 before a seasonal dip in September drove prices lower. Currently, XRP’s RSI sits near 45 and uptrending, hinting at the potential for more near-term price growth. Although rate cuts and approval of the first spot XRP ETF failed to trigger a breakout, likely due to being priced in, the appearance of three bullish flag patterns on its price chart, along with a swathe of pending ETF decisions due in mid-October, could quickly drive XRP above $6 or higher. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Biggest Rival and This Month’s Standout Large-Cap Performer Solana ($SOL) continues to prove itself as one of the fastest and cheapest blockchain platforms. Its market cap now exceeds $112 billion, with over $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama, showcasing its strength in decentralized finance. Excitement is growing around the possibility of Solana spot ETFs gaining approval in the U.S. next month, potentially unlocking institutional capital, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs did. After bottoming at $100 in April, SOL has surged back to $207. Chart watchers saw cup-and-handle formations throughout August and early September, reflecting recent bullish sentiment. Its 6% decline over the past week looks more like a healthy pullback than a cause for concern. With regulators moving to shape clearer rules for digital assets, Solana could stand to benefit significantly. It maintains a cool RSI at 45, signaling that the correction has given investors a solid entry point. Key support is around $150, with very sticky resistance near $250, although breaching it could provide bulls with the impetus for a breakout. A retest of its ATH of $293.31, or even a climb up to $400, appears well within reach before the end of 2025. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Phenomenon Still Packed With Potential Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly became one of the top meme tokens by market cap, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s iconic frog character. Its rapid rise triggered a flood of copycats, though none matched its success. With a valuation near $4 billion, Pepe has captured global attention; Elon Musk even used its logo as his profile picture on X briefly. Currently priced at about $0.000009192, PEPE is down 67% from its late-2024 high of $0.00002803, as broader macroeconomic concerns weigh on crypto market sentiment. Still, October has historically been a strong month for crypto, and if the “Uptober” pattern holds, Pepe could be testing new highs as early as November, potentially even granting 3.5x gains by 2026. At present, its RSI sits at 38 and continues trending lower, suggesting further short-term declines before the weekend may open attractive entry points. Backers argue that a more favorable macro climate and growing optimism could propel PEPE into uncharted territory later this year. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): How a Bitcoin Layer 2 Became One of the Best Crypto Presales This Year Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the most promising presales heading into 2025, aiming to merge Bitcoin’s security with Layer-2 scalability while riding the momentum of meme culture and community governance. The project’s mission is to expand Bitcoin’s functionality with faster payments, smart contract capabilities, and decentralized decision-making. To date, its presale has raised more than $19.3 million, with analysts forecasting potential gains of 10× or more after launch. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers ultra-low-cost smart contracts and supports a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers, as well as dApps, meme tokens, and payments. A recent audit by Coinsult reported no vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token powers the ecosystem via staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early investors can currently earn staking rewards of up to 61% APY while gaining voting privileges once governance goes live.

The $2 trillion market leader Bitcoin is just 9% down from its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 and is likely to set a new high watermark through the historically strong month of “Uptober”. US Policymakers are also accelerating a potential bull run. In July, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first nationwide U.S. legislation focused on stablecoins, mandating full reserve requirements. Shortly after, the SEC announced Project Crypto , a framework aimed at modernizing securities laws to better fit the digital asset era. With stronger regulatory oversight, the next altcoin rally will eclipse the 2021 boom, fueled by regulatory clarity. If Claude AI’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Cardano, and Ethereum could be the leaders of this surge. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Sees Potential Gains of 700%+ Toward $24 Claude AI projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $24 by late 2025, a jump of more than 739% from its current price near $2.85. Source: Claude AI XRP has already shown resilience this cycle. On July 18, it hit $3.65, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40, before pulling back roughly 22% amid macro headwinds. Ripple’s payment network continues to expand globally and has received notable endorsements. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund recognized XRP as an affordable remittance tool for emerging markets. Its years-long dispute with the SEC was resolved in early 2025 when the agency dropped its lawsuit, following a 2023 ruling confirming XRP’s retail sales do not meet the definition of securities. Claude AI suggests that a sustained move back above the July high could open the door to $4–$5, with a more aggressive bullish scenario placing upside potential anywhere between $7 and $24. Technical indicators have flagged three bullish formations across support and resistance zones in the past year, hinting at a possible rapid breakout in Q4. While markets largely shrugged at recent Fed cuts and the launch of the first spot XRP ETF, the SEC’s decisions on additional ETF applications expected next month, along with new federal crypto laws, could be major catalysts. Over the past year, XRP has surged 346%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 77.5% gains and delivering six times Ethereum’s 58% performance. Cardano ($ADA): Claude Predicts 8X Gains for the Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) has been regaining traction, in part due to growing political visibility. Most notably, U.S. President Trump recently floated the idea of including ADA in a federal crypto reserve, sourced entirely through enforcement seizures instead of market purchases. Created by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Cardano is unique for its academic, peer-reviewed development model and its strong focus on sustainability and scalability. With a market cap of over $28.8 billion, Cardano is steadily competing with Ethereum and closing the adoption gap with Solana. Claude forecasts ADA could hit $6.10 by year-end, a nearly 8X gain from its current level of $0.7934. From a technical perspective, ADA has been trading in a descending wedge since late 2024, facing resistance near $1.10. A strong Uptober push it to $2 by late Q4, but a bull run is likely the only thing that could drive it higher. Claude’s $6.10 target implies ADA would need to more than double its 2021 ATH of $3.09, a feat achievable only with the onset of rapid adoption, something that US regulators would need to cultivate with a framework. Ethereum ($ETH): Claude AI Predicts a Strong Push Higher for the Leading Smart Contract Network Ethereum ($ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized applications and DeFi, boasting a market capitalization above $502.4 billion. With more than $87.75 billion in total value locked (TVL), ETH’s role in smart contracts ensures its long-term relevance and adoption. Claude projects Ethereum could reach $6,925 by year’s end, a 66% increase from its current price of $4,169. Continuous improvements, whether from the Ethereum Foundation or Layer-2 scaling projects, reinforce ETH’s outlook. The introduction of spot ETFs has also brought in substantial and sustained institutional investment, as TradFi piggybacks off the price rises with regulated exposure to ETH. Additional upside could materialize if President Trump advances comprehensive crypto reforms, offering the regulatory certainty needed to spark further gains. Chart signals align with this view. After consolidating in a falling wedge, ETH rebounded from $1,800 to $2,412 in May, showing renewed whale accumulation. Coming into October, a bullish expanding triangle pattern lines the way to a potential run-up to $6,000 or beyond. If markets struggle to hold $4,000, ETH still has strong support around $3,500–$3,700. A recovery rally could see $5,000 as soon as mid-October, with $6,900 being the Christmas target. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New High Volatility Degen Play for Risk-Tolerant Meme Coin Heads For those chasing higher-risk meme coin plays beyond Claude AI’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) markets itself as Dogecoin’s wild gym bro cousin, leaning into high-volatility plays and degen meme culture as part of its brand identity. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream token, Maxi Doge embraces the satirical community-driven ethos of Dogecoin’s yesteryear. Its presale has already raised more than $2.6 million in just two months. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes grassroots community growth through Telegram and Discord activity, trading competitions, and cross-project partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion minted tokens, about 25% are set aside for the “Maxi Fund” to finance marketing and collaborations. Staking is available with yields currently around 129% APY, though rates will taper as more holders participate. The presale price sits at $0.00026, with incremental increases locked in as the presale advances through funding stages.

While these three tokens have actually taken hits today, the combination of their oversold technicals and the market’s recovering momentum should prime them for big rallies soon. We predict their future paths in this article, unpacking their indicators while also explaining why their fundamentals set them up nicely for some big gains in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Altcoin Ready to Break ATH on Back of Strong Fundamentals XRP has suffered a 1% decline in the past 24 hours, with its drop to $2.86 also marking a 5% decline in the last 14 days. Despite these dips, XRP remains in a very strong position, having risen by 340% in the past year. And if we look at its chart, we see that it may have bottomed out after two months of stop-start declines. Its relative strength index (yellow) has risen close to 50 again after dropping below 40 a few days ago, and this indicator has remained in a weak position for too long now. Source: TradingView We could say something similar about XRP’s MACD (orange, blue), which is still in a negative position, and which therefore should be coming up – along with the coin’s price – soon. More fundamentally, there’s every reason to be bullish about XRP, which could enjoy a massive boost in the next few weeks, as upwards of ten XRP ETFs begin launching . At the same time, Ripple itself is growing aggressively, having signed numerous partnerships , made acquisitions, and expanded into new territories . This expansion will increase adoption of and demand for XRP, which could set a new ATH (currently $3.65) by November or December. Crypto Price Prediction: Aster ($ASTER) – High-Momentum DEX Token Preparing for Another Breakout One of the newest coins in the top 100, ASTER has plunged by 7% in the past 24 hours, to $1.79. This price represents a 25.5% decline in relation to its ATH of $2.41, which it set last week. However, ASTER is also up by 1,700% over its lowest-recorded price (by CoinGecko) of $0.09971, underlining its credentials as one of the most exciting new alts in the market. It’s the native token of decentralized exchange Aster, which runs on BNB Chain and which already has a total value locked of $2.26 billion . Its fall today is arguably a necessary correction en route to longer-term gains, with its indicators moving in oversold positions that will eventually demand a rebound. Source: TradingView Also bullish is the fact that Aster’s price has been forming a pennant ever since reaching an all-time high earlier in September. As such, it’s getting very close to a big move, which its recent history of falls should mean will be a big rally. It could potentially reach $2 in the next few weeks, before climbing above $3 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Grayscale ETF Now Has ‘100% Chance of Approval’ ADA has fallen to $0.7878 today, marking a 4.5% drop in a week and a 9.5% decline in the past fortnight. Cardano is also down by 4.5% in the last 30 days, yet as with the other tokens in this article its falls mean that it’s now overdue a significant rebound. There are also fundamental reasons to expect ADA to do well very soon, with Grayscale still waiting on the potential approval of its ADA ETF. Bloomberg analysts have now given this and other altcoin ETFs a 100% chance of approval , and if it does go live, it will result in a big influx of money into ADA. Such an influx is also likely to boost the growth of Cardano’s ecosystem, which remains in the top 20 in terms of TVL . It continues to undergo development and expansion, yet institutional money could help it grow exponentially, in turn boosting the crypto price prediction for ADA. Source: TradingView The coin’s indicators remain in an oversold position, while also showing that the token could be very close to bottoming out. Its MACD has flattened out after falling into a negative position over the past few days, while it also seems the RSI has halted a recent decline. As such, we may be close to a big rally for ADA, which could rise above $1 before October is done, and then pass $3 in December. Mine-to-Earn Token PEPENODE Raises $1.5 Million in Presale: Could It 100x? Assuming that most altcoin ETFs do gain approval, the end of 2025 could bring a substantial bull market, pushing prices higher across the board. But it won’t be only major coins that benefit, with small-cap tokens having the potential to post exponential gains, given that they start from low bases. This is especially the case with presale coins, with one of the most interesting presale tokens right now being PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 crypto that recently opened its ICO. Your nodes are everything. Upgrade them, flex them, earn with them pic.twitter.com/LFohrFWmf7 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 26, 2025 It has already raised just over $1.5 million in this sale, with the project quickly winning over new investors and supporters. Its appeal lies in the fact that it’s the market’s first-ever ‘mine-to-earn’ token, enabling its holders to develop and earn from building their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy virtual mining nodes, users can earn greater rewards, which will be paid out in established coins such as Pepe and FARTCOIN. This mechanism means that PEPENODE could experience huge demand, while holders of the token can also stake it for a passive income. Investors can join PEPENODE’s sale by going to the project’s official website , where it currently costs $0.0010788. This price will rise later today and will continue to rise throughout the sale, so newcomers should act sooner rather than later.

At first glance, the move spooked market watchers. But beneath the surface, this sudden shift may be part of a much bigger play – one that could fast-track approvals and open the door to a wave of new crypto ETFs. And if that’s the case, SOL could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Who's ready for Cointober? Spot crypto ETF Deadlines start this week! Litecoin and Solana up first. Should be a wild month.. @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/K2m5pNBCbU — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert from Bloomberg, emphasized that October could become ‘Cointober’ – a month when most of these pending applications will finally get the green light from the SEC. The agency has recently approved spot ETFs linked to top altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH). Thus far, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana have already gotten their first spot vehicles listed, while Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) could be next in line. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Eyes Surge to $450 as Institutional Interest Grows Solana (SOL) has formed a similar structure to Ethereum (ETH) a few weeks ago, before it broke above the $4,000 resistance. In this case, the key level to watch is $270 . The token has been respecting its trend line support lately and could be about to make a strong move above this mark if positive momentum gains traction. The approval of new spot ETFs will likely draw more and more interest from institutional players. Paired with the launch of corporate treasuries, the stage could be set for SOL to reach a new all-time high like ETH did recently. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gains this cycle may come from early-stage presales like SUBBD ($SUBBD), which is already generating serious buzz. Investor demand has been strong, with over $1.2 million raised in a matter of weeks, signaling that this project could be one of the breakout stars of 2025. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Presale Merges AI + Web3 for Content Creation SUBBD ($SUBBD) aims to give creators a smarter, faster, and more flexible way to get their content out there. Instead of juggling multiple apps to produce AI-generated pieces, editing, and uploading, SUBBD puts everything into one platform.

According to the announcement, Thumzup is supporting DogeHash Technologies in expanding its fleet of crypto miners by 500 ASIC mining rigs. This addition will bump DogeHash’s fleet to 4,000 crypto mining rigs by the end of this year. Thumbzup stock jump by 3.80% Thumzup Media’s stock, with the ticker TZUP, has jumped by 3.80% based on data from Yahoo Finance. The stock closed trading today at US$5.19 and has a year-to-date (YTD) return of 45.77%. TZUP began trading on the Nasdaq exchange after a successful public offering in October of last year. The Trump backed company raised US$8.2 million, pricing its shares at $5 at the time. The CEO of Thumzup, Robert Steele, said , “We are enthusiastic about all the recent developments in the Dogecoin ecosystem and are looking forward to working with DogeHash to build a premier Doge mining company together.” Earlier in September, Cryptopolitan reported that Thumzup Media had purchased about US $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC), and expressed intentions to expand its holdings in ETH, DOGE, XRP, SOL, LTC, and USDC. Thumzup also announced its plans to acquire DogeHash Technologies and operate its miners. On September 24, Thumzup approved a US$10 million stock buyback plan, which will run until the end of next year. The digital ads company announced a similar buyback plan before, but with a US$1 million budget. It has bought back 212,432 shares of its common stock at an average price of $4.71 per share. Currently, Thumzup holds 19.106 Bitcoins and around 7.5 million Dogecoin worth a total of ~ US$4 million. The digital ads company is authorized by its board to hold cryptocurrencies worth US$250 million. Dogecoin trades sideways Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at US$0.27. The memecoin has seen better days during the last bull run in 2021, thanks to Elon Musk’s push. At that time, DOGE, which was trading in cents, jumped to an all-time high of US$0.7316, almost touching the US$1 point . Elon Musk continues to endorse Dogecoin. He created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with the blessings of his buddy Donald Trump. However, this move did not propel Dogecoin to reach USD$1. At the time of writing, Dogecoin (DOGE) is down by 68.2% from its all-time high. The memecoin has a market cap of US$35.19 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of US$1.97 billion based on aggregated data from CoinGecko. This crypto market cycle is powered by institutional money and ETFs. Around fourteen days ago, Rex-Osprey announced the listing of the first US based Dogecoin ETF, with ticker symbol DOJE, on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Other Dogecoin ETF applications from Grayscale and Bitwise are still pending. Analysts believe that Dogecoin ETFs will propel the memecoin to new highs, but the truth is that markets are unpredictable.

The exchange, which followed Swift’s announcement at Sibos that it will launch a blockchain-based ledger, quickly crystallized two very different theories of “value capture” in crypto: a native asset securing and settling an L1 network versus a utility token powering oracle middleware. Weisberger set the stage with a direct challenge to the XRP community: “Can someone from the XRP army (@xrpmickle) explain how XRP is more than TEN times LINK’s value, when LINK has a REAL partnership with SWIFT, AND a clear path to revenue to be shared with Token holders…” The prompt referenced Chainlink’s post congratulating Swift on adopting “blockchains and oracle networks as a key next step,” and emphasizing that Chainlink and Swift “have collaborated across numerous initiatives” to connect financial institutions to blockchains using existing infrastructure and standards. Why Is XRP 10x More ‘Valuable’ Than LINK What followed was equal parts token-economics debate and culture clash. Weisberger, who later clarified “To be clear, I hold both,” added that he thinks “XRP bulls are delusional in their calls,” while conceding that such delusion does not preclude outperformance versus traditional assets. His framing invited two lines of reply: the “volume and adoption” argument and the “different problem, different TAM” argument. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Support as Institutions Accumulate and ETF Filing Sparks Debate On the data front, one respondent, @baggins_cc, asserted that “The XRP token has a $172B market cap, while LINK has $14B (1/10th). And when looking at the last 24h, by volume, XRPL has processed $4.9B in revenue, compared to LINK, which only has processed $641M. Marketcap is absolute when it comes to ranking, and Volume is empirical & objectively a fact, when it comes to real world adoption.” Weisberger pushed back with a counterexample intended to decouple throughput from token value: “What is the value of XRPL to XRP when TRX processes more than 500 TIMES USDT by value and is 1/5th the market cap?” The thrust: raw settlement or messaging volume does not automatically translate into superior price performance or capitalization for a token. The second, more structural line of response came from former Ripple engineer Matt Hamilton. In a succinct distinction, he wrote: “Trying to compare their value is sort of meaningless. Link is a protocol, the XRP Ledger is an actual network. XRP is the native asset of that entire network. Link is just the token used within the link protocol.” In other words, the two assets occupy different positions in the technology stack: XRP is the base-layer currency of an L1 that provides security, fee payment, and liquidity for its ledger; LINK is the work token for an oracle protocol that sits above execution layers to deliver data and cross-chain services. That stack-positioning argument was amplified by the XRP army member “Ripple Bull Winkle,” who reframed the comparison in terms of addressable markets: “Because XRP isn’t competing with LINK — it’s solving a different problem on a much larger scale. LINK = middleware for data feeds. XRP = bridge asset for global settlement. One secures oracles, the other settles value between banks, CBDCs, tokenized treasuries, & stablecoins. The TAM for cross-border payments dwarfs oracle revenue. And by the way — Ripple has been partnered with SWIFT participants for years. This isn’t XRP vs LINK, it’s XRP in the heart of the plumbing that moves the actual money. That’s why the market values it 10x higher.” Related Reading: Everyone’s Wrong About XRP: Here’s Why, Says Top Analyst Other replies took aim at investor narratives themselves. When a commenter criticized Weisberger’s “lazy ask,” he volleyed back with a reminder that many were “talked into XRP based on SWIFT, despite no clear token economics and no definitive use case,” nodding to years of marketing-driven expectations that official banking rails would one day require XRP. In the end, the thread does not “prove” why XRP is worth ten times LINK or vice versa; instead, it exposes a fundamental split in crypto investing frameworks. One camp prioritizes native-asset economics of base layers and their role as neutral settlement media; the other prioritizes revenue-bearing middleware whose services are indispensable to a tokenized financial system. As the Swift news resets expectations about how legacy rails will interface with blockchains, the core question for markets remains unchanged: which designs actually trap value, and how verifiably do those mechanics funnel real-world usage into persistent demand for the token itself? On that score, the debate is far from settled. At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

The analysis points to two possible short-term outcomes , yet both lead to the same bullish conclusion in the long run. Bullish Technical Analysis For XRP XRP has spent the past week moving around $2.80, with repeated tests of both higher levels at $2.88 and lower levels at $2.71 failing to deliver a decisive breakout. The most recent three-day candlestick chart shows how XRP has created three consecutive bearish candlestick while support has held close to $2.72. This period of consolidation comes after months of volatility that saw the token retrace back below $3 in September. Against this backdrop, a new technical analysis posted on the social media platform X shows two possible short-term scenarios for XRP, both of which point to the same long-term bullish outcome. The analyst noted that the altcoin closed just over $2.80 in the latest three-day candlestick session, and this coincided with the appearance of hidden bullish divergence on the chart’s relative strength index (RSI). This divergence is a signal of underlying strength in spite of the most recent price downtrend. According to the analyst, this setup is consistent with its behavior ever since it broke away from the $0.50 price zone. As it stands, the altcoin is now forming a structure that precedes a strong bullish move, although the next move depends on the weekly close. Two Possible Paths In The Short Term Looking at the candles and support zones drawn on the chart above, the analysis outlines two different bullish possibilities. The first is what the analyst calls an April 7th moment. On April 7th earlier this year, XRP experienced a sharp dip that saw it lose the stable $2 support level back then before finally settling at $1.79. This sharp dip brought the price down to retest its ascending support line before bouncing strongly higher in the weeks that followed. A similar move now would see the asset retreat toward the trend line. This time, the price target is around $2.40, which is highlighted with the pink circle in the chart above. This will effectively reset momentum before launching into the next leg of the rally. The second outcome, however, would play out without the need for that deeper correction. If the $2.72 support zone continues to hold, XRP could turn higher from its current price and begin reclaiming levels above $2.90 and $3.00 much sooner. This scenario would represent a more direct continuation of the bullish trend, with buyers stepping in aggressively to defend current support. Both outcomes differ in their immediate impact on price action, but each route ultimately leads to the same destination: higher levels for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.88.",XRP|relative strength index|ripple|RSI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-30 23:00:53

That expectation took a significant hit this week after SWIFT revealed plans to implement its own blockchain ledger, making it clear that the organization intends to modernize its infrastructure without relying on XRP. SWIFT Introduces a Blockchain-Based Ledger At its annual conference in Frankfurt, SWIFT announced the development of a blockchain-powered shared ledger designed to enhance cross-border payments. The initiative has gained backing from over 30 major global financial institutions, including JPMorgan, HSBC, Santander, and Deutsche Bank. The prototype, developed in collaboration with Consensys, will function as a continuous, real-time record of international transactions. By integrating smart contracts, the system aims to automate settlement rules and ensure consistent validation of payments across networks. The project also emphasizes interoperability, seeking to connect existing fiat payment systems with emerging digital asset ecosystems. SWIFT CEO Javier Pérez-Tasso described the effort as an important step toward providing financial institutions with a more efficient and future-ready payments infrastructure. Ripple’s Competing Vision Ripple has long positioned XRP and the XRP Ledger as faster and more cost-effective alternatives to SWIFT’s traditional messaging framework. The company’s executives have repeatedly argued that XRP could handle a significant share of global settlement activity. Earlier this year, Ripple’s Senior Vice President, Eric van Miltenburg, described the company’s technology as a ‘SWIFT-like update. Also, CEO Brad Garlinghouse projected that the XRP Ledger could capture a large portion of SWIFT’s market share within five years. This new announcement from SWIFT, however, makes such claims increasingly difficult to sustain. By building its own blockchain ledger, SWIFT clearly indicates its intentions to remain central to the global payments ecosystem while retaining control over its infrastructure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry and Community Response The development sparked strong reactions within the cryptocurrency community. Members of the Chainlink ecosystem, which already collaborates with SWIFT, highlighted the implications for XRP holders. Chainlink community representative Zach Rynes argued that the announcement undermines the narrative that XRP would serve as the primary settlement layer for banks and other institutions. Other commentators pointed out that XRP supporters have long believed large financial institutions would adopt external blockchains like XRPL. Critics argued that these expectations overlooked the possibility that established institutions would instead develop their own solutions or collaborate with others, thereby maintaining control over market infrastructure. SWIFT’s decision to pursue a blockchain-enabled ledger marks a key moment in the evolution of cross-border payments. Instead of using external networks like XRPL, global banks seem to be focusing on upgrading their current systems to make them compatible with digital assets. This development poses a significant challenge to XRP’s long-held narrative that it would replace or complement SWIFT.

Trump tapped Quintenz shortly after retaking office. Quintenz joined venture firm Andresseen Horowitz's global head of policy, and has been an adviser to firms like prediction marketplace Kalshi since leaving the CFTC following his term as commissioner. In a statement to CoinDesk, Quintenz said, ""Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I [am] looking forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country."" Politico and Punchbowl News earlier reported that the White House had withdrawn Quintenz's nomination. Quintenz has made statements in favor of the crypto industry since his first term as commissioner, including floating the idea of a self-regulatory organization for the industry similar to securities markets' Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Despite this, crypto exchange Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — both of whom support Trump — opposed his nomination in late July, with Tyler telling CoinDesk that he did not believe Quintenz's views on developers and his work with Kalshi qualified him for the role. However, Quintenz released messages he had exchanged with the Winklevoss brothers earlier this month, suggesting that they really opposed his nomination because he would not commit to a public view on a CFTC enforcement action against Gemini. In his messages, Quintenz said that it would be better for a ""fully confirmed chair"" to review the CFTC's actions. Crypto lobbyist organizations and companies wrote a public letter supporting his nomination in a late August bid to put his nomination back on track. Still, the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to postpone a vote on Quintenz's nomination a few times in July. Last week, Semafor reported that it had begun vetting new candidates to run the agency, which at present is helmed by Acting Chairman Caroline Pham. All of the other commissioners at the agency at the start of 2025 have since left, and Pham has indicated her intention to depart as well at some point, CoinDesk previously reported. The CFTC's potential lack of a permanent chair comes as Congress considers legislation that would give the agency a more prominent role in regulating crypto spot markets, though the legislative process is likely to be delayed by a pending government shutdown.

BWT Alpine, with its decades of Formula 1® excellence under the Renault Group, is synonymous with mechanical precision, team discipline, and global prestige. BlockDAG (BDAG) , on the other hand, is not content to follow precedent. It is rethinking how a Layer-1 blockchain should function, prioritizing real utility, transparency, and scale. As the BWT Alpine F1® team and BlockDAG unite under a multi-year global sponsorship, what unfolds is a chapter where heritage meets future. Buyers watching closely will recognize that among the best crypto coins of this era, BlockDAG isn’t just competing, it’s making history. BWT Alpine F1’s Legacy: From the Circuit to Cultural Icon The BWT Alpine F1® name carries weight far beyond the racetrack. As a cornerstone of Renault’s high-performance division, BWT Alpine F1® has spent decades perfecting the art of speed, resilience, and engineering mastery. Formula 1® isn’t just a sport; it’s a statement of national pride, global reach, and generational fandom. Through this lens, BWT Alpine F1 doesn’t just represent a team on the grid; it represents a legacy of excellence measured in tenths of seconds, years of strategy, and billions of broadcast impressions. When a brand like BWT Alpine F1 chooses to align with a Web3 platform, it’s not a casual endorsement. It is a calculated decision to partner with a blockchain brand that respects legacy while pushing boundaries. This makes BlockDAG’s entry into the Formula 1® world through BWT Alpine F1 not just strategic; it’s symbolic. For buyers evaluating the best crypto coins available before global deployment, BlockDAG is positioning itself not on trend, but within a timeline that stretches years into the future. BlockDAG’s Disruption: Real Adoption, Not Just Ambition While other crypto projects often center around speculative hype or theoretical whitepapers, BlockDAG has focused on real-world progress. With over 26.5 billion coins sold, nearly $415 million raised, and a current ROI of 2,900% since batch 1, it has built trust the old-fashioned way by delivering. Today, the presale sits at batch 30 with a listed price of $0.03, yet buyers can still lock in their position at $0.0013. This limited-time price lock signals a clear “before and after” moment, just ahead of BlockDAG’s deployment on Coinstore and its global event in Singapore. Beyond the numbers, the strategy is layered: 312,000+ holders, 3 million daily miners on the X1 app, and already 20,000 mining units are being shipped, with scaling set at 2,000 per week. This is no small feat. Most presales in crypto history have struggled to deliver on a single product or utility before listing. BlockDAG has done both, building software (X1 app) and hardware (X10/X30/X100 miner series) simultaneously. A Roadmap for Relevance The BWT Alpine F1® x BlockDAG partnership isn’t just about logos on race cars. It represents a roadmap built for relevance. The partnership will unfold across Alpine’s RISE+ app, global fan activations, exclusive behind-the-scenes content, and integrated Web3 engagement, including NFT drops, mining access, and co-branded merchandise. This is not a short-term alignment. It’s a multi-year sponsorship designed to grow with both platforms, culminating in a shared journey that connects one of the best crypto coins to one of the most historic names in motorsport. The value here is not in fleeting attention but in sustained brand co-evolution. While BWT Alpine F1® continues its pursuit of the podium, BlockDAG races toward becoming a household name in blockchain infrastructure. This alignment gives buyers and early adopters more than just speculative upside. It offers front-row access to a project tying its token utility and hardware infrastructure to a global entertainment engine watched by billions. That’s not marketing; that’s ecosystem integration at scale. Final Thoughts In every era, there are moments that become reference points. The collaboration between BWT Alpine and BlockDAG marks one of them. This is more than a sponsorship, it is a deliberate fusion of a timeless racing heritage with a blockchain project poised to reshape how utility, mining, and community engagement co-exist. As the locked price of $0.0013 edges closer to expiration, this is not just another buying opportunity. It is a historic inflection point. Among the best crypto coins in 2025, BlockDAG stands out not simply because of its technology, but because of the story it’s building. A story where speed, structure, and ambition meet on and off the track. And buyers have the chance to be written into it.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-trader-losses-over-3-6m-heres-what-happened/,"Well-known crypto trader Qwatio has once again faced major losses after a leveraged short bet against XRP went against him. Data from Lookonchain shows that his cumulative losses on XRP and Bitcoin trades have now surpassed $3.6 million, following the most recent liquidation of part of his XRP position. Qwatio originally entered a short trade involving 6.17 million XRP, valued at around $17.6 million, with 20x leverage. His entry price was $2.8519, and the position was set to be liquidated if XRP reached $2.9155. He was essentially wagering on a decline in XRP’s price below his entry point. Instead, XRP climbed to $2.92 during the previous trading session, surpassing its liquidation threshold. This move partially closed his position at $2.9154, resulting in a realized loss of approximately $83,223. Remaining Exposure and Unrealized Losses Although part of his position was liquidated, Qwatio still holds a significant exposure of about 4.98 million XRP, worth $14.34 million at current prices. The open position has a liquidation level at $2.932 and is already showing an unrealized loss of roughly $145,000. If XRP approaches this liquidation price, the trader could face much larger losses. This setback is not an isolated event. Before this liquidation, Qwatio had already accumulated more than $3.4 million in losses from earlier short trades on XRP and Bitcoin. Adding the new $83,223 realized loss brings his total losses across these trades to over $3.6 million. XRP Price Action and Market Impact At the time of writing, XRP has retreated slightly from its recent peak of $2.92, trading near $2.82 . The token has declined 0.42% over the last 24 hours but remains modestly higher on a weekly and monthly basis, up 0.35% and 1.51%, respectively. Leveraged trading activity around XRP has been significant. In the past day alone, more than $7 million in positions have been liquidated. Of this amount, $5.3 million came from long traders, while $2.02 million came from shorts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Liquidation Scenarios Market data suggests that XRP approaching $2.93 , the same level tied to Qwatio’s liquidation threshold, could trigger an additional $41.39 million in short liquidations across the market. On the other hand, if the price retraces to $2.80, an estimated $86 million in long positions could be wiped out. Compared to the overall crypto market, XRP’s $7.2 million in daily liquidations represents a smaller share. Across the broader market, liquidations have totaled approximately $338 million in the past 24 hours, with $158.46 million from long positions and $179 million from shorts. Qwatio’s situation highlights the risks of highly leveraged trading in volatile assets such as XRP. With nearly $15 million still tied up in an active short and the token trading close to his liquidation point, the trader’s exposure remains significant. The broader market also shows elevated liquidation levels, underscoring the hazards faced by both long and short participants during periods of sharp price fluctuations.

Cardano Whale Has Withdrawn Big From Coinbase According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large transfer has been spotted on the Cardano blockchain during the past day. The move in question involved the shifting of about 67.8 million ADA across the network, worth over $54.3 million at the time that the sender executed the transaction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns Back To Neutral As BTC Breaks $114,000 Considering the significant scale of the transfer, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Whales are big-money investors who carry large amounts in their wallets and hold the power to make huge individual transactions. Because of this, these holders can have some degree of influence in the market. As such, what they are doing on the network can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may reveal the sentiment among them. Usually, though, the anonymous nature of the blockchain means it can be hard to comment on the motive behind a particular transaction. In the case of the current Cardano whale transfer, however, one side of the move involves a wallet that’s already known. Below are the address details related to the transaction. As is visible, the sending address for this Cardano whale transaction was a wallet attached to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Meanwhile, the receiver was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was likely the investor’s self-custodial address. Transfers of this type, where coins flow out of the custody of a centralized exchange, are known as exchange outflows. Generally, investors make exchange outflows when they plan to hold their tokens in the long term, as self-custody tends to be a safer option for them. The latest large Coinbase withdrawal has come as Cardano is significantly down compared to its peak from earlier in September. As such, it’s possible that the move could be an indication of the whale betting on the asset at the current post-dip prices. It only remains to be seen whether the gamble will pay off for the investor. Related Reading: XRP Bounce Incoming? Analyst Targets $3–$3.15 After Support Holds Another altcoin, XRP, has also just witnessed a large transaction, as Whale Alert has pointed out in another X post. Unlike ADA’s transfer, however, this whale move has been an Exchange Inflow. In total, the XRP whale has shifted 18 million tokens of the cryptocurrency (worth around $51.4 million) to Coinbase with the transaction. Holders use exchanges for trading purposes, so it’s possible that the large investor may be looking to exit. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.79, down almost 4% over the last seven days.

As Bitcoin developer Peter Todd put it on Sunday, “Good read. tl;dr: everything that has been said about Core vs Knots has already been said almost 15 years ago.” The 2010 Fight Over Bitcoin’s Soul That Never Ended The historical through-line runs straight back to December 2010, when Satoshi Nakamoto shipped Bitcoin version 0.3.18. That release quietly introduced an “IsStandard()” relay and mining policy to “only include known transaction types,” a defensive move designed to reduce attack surface from exotic scripts. Satoshi’s own release note summarized the change tersely: “IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks.” The first debate about arbitrary data in the blockchain happened in December 2010 and Satoshi was involved On 8th December 2010, Satoshi released Bitcoin version 0.3.18, which included a standardness check, to only include known transaction types pic.twitter.com/J95ax5Cgte — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) September 29, 2025 The check ignited what many participants described as Bitcoin’s first real governance dispute. Within hours, forum users split over whether restricting non-standard transactions would neuter legitimate experiments like BitDNS or simply protect the young network. The thread, preserved by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, captures the core fault lines that have resurfaced in 2025. On the permissive side, user “da2ce7” argued that fees would rationalize everything: “Transaction fees will pay for the generation of the chain in the future… if [others] want to include carefully crafted transactions… they must include the appropriate compensation.” Jeff Garzik fired back that such a stance “will disadvantage people who use bitcoins… as cash as intended,” because non-currency uses would bid up fees and crowd out payments. Theymos, then pushing for minimal relay restrictions, argued miners’ incentives would bulldoze any client-level gatekeeping: “all miners have an interest in including any and all fee-carrying transactions… The restriction on relaying these transactions should be removed, at the very least.” Garzik warned that if “data spam increases TX fees to annoying levels,” currency users would decamp—and that the presence of “law-enforcement-objectionable data” would raise different, sharper risks. Crucially, Satoshi and Gavin Andresen converged on the whitelist approach as a pragmatic security default, while leaving the door ajar for purpose-built data uses. Gavin explained that whitelisting known-safe templates was “the right thing to do,” drawing an analogy to web security’s failure modes when blacklisting is relied upon.In a follow-up, Satoshi wrote: “I came to agree with Gavin about whitelisting when I realized how quickly new transaction types can be added,” and endorsed a path for small data commitments: “I also support a third transaction type for timestamp hash sized arbitrary data.” If today’s back-and-forth feels like déjà vu, BitMEX Research’s weekend recap is the missing Rosetta stone. Their thread traces the debate’s timeline—RHorning’s early pushback against 0.3.18’s new standardness rules; Theymos’s insistence that miner incentives would trump relay defaults; Garzik’s resistance to “non-currency data” pricing out money use; and community unease about what happens when immutable ledgers meet illegal content. The researchers note that Theymos even released a patch client removing restrictions at the time, underscoring how client defaults and miner policy have always been a contested, malleable layer. There are two enduring takeaways from the 2010 record. First, the “policy vs protocol” distinction—what Bitcoin can do versus what the reference implementation should relay or mine by default—has long been a pressure valve for innovation and a magnet for controversy. Satoshi’s 0.3.18 email makes plain that IsStandard() lived in this gray zone of incentives and norms, not consensus rules. Second, nearly every argument now deployed in Core-versus-Knots skirmishes had an ancestor in that first “coming-of-age” fight: fee-market neutrality versus application-layer bloat; the right to pay for block space versus the social cost of permanent data; and whether tightening defaults protects Bitcoin’s monetary function or stifles its utility for timestamping and proofs. The archive shows the spectrum clearly, from Theymos’s “remove the restrictions” stance to Garzik’s warning that generalized data “has the distinct probability of degrading service for digital cash.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,071.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Core|Bitcoin Knots|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 00:00:32

Politico reported on Tuesday, citing two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement. “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life,” Quintenz said. “I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The development follows recent reports that the White House is considering additional candidates to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as the confirmation process for Brian Quintenz to lead the regulator had not made significant progress. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Quintenz has encountered a roadblock to his nomination due to political pressure and lobbying from high-profile crypto executives, led by the Winklevoss brothers. The withdrawal ends a remarkable series of developments for a nominee who was once considered all but certain to be confirmed. The former CFTC commissioner, with experience at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the prediction market startup Kalshi, had enjoyed strong backing from both the cryptocurrency sector and traditional finance. CFTC leadership race heats up as crypto policy stakes rise The CFTC plays a crucial role in regulating cryptocurrency markets . The Senate Agriculture Committee oversees nominations for the agency, including oversight of digital asset market developments. The agency, which is responsible for overseeing trillions of dollars in swaps trading, is poised to gain more influence over digital assets under legislation being considered in Congress. Quintenz’s nomination, announced at the beginning of the year, was initially praised by sections of the crypto industry as he already works actively in the industry, being the head of policy at a16z crypto . The agency, which was designed to be a five-person, bipartisan commission, has been reduced after a string of resignations to just the acting Chairman, Caroline Pham, a Republican whom former President Joe Biden appointed to the commission. The other top US market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has had Paul Atkins as its permanent chairman since April. Crypto heavyweights and new contenders shake up CFTC chair race In a July call, crypto billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss urged President Donald Trump to reconsider Quintenz’s nomination to lead the influential Wall Street regulator overseeing the $4 trillion market. The brothers informed Trump that Quintenz was disconnected from the president’s agenda, Soon after the call, the White House asked the Senate Ag Committee to postpone a scheduled meeting where lawmakers would have likely advanced Quintenz’s nomination to a full-floor vote At the beginning of September, Quintenz took to social media to suggest that the president “might have been misled” by the twins. He posted screenshots of private messages he claimed to have exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss in late July, before his confirmation hearing was put on hold. An additional slate of potential candidates to lead the CFTC has emerged, with discussions intensifying in recent weeks. The possible contenders include government officials with a focus on crypto policy. Earlier reports indicate that Michael Selig, chief counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force, is among the additional candidates discussed for CFTC chair. Initially, he was a partner in Willkie Farr & Gallagher’s asset management practice. Tyler Williams, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on digital asset policy, is also considered a candidate for the role. He joined the Treasury from Galaxy Digital, a digital assets investment firm. Josh Sterling, a former CFTC official who is now a partner at the law firm Milbank, and former CFTC Commissioner Jill Sommers are also potential candidates to lead the CFTC.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the most impressive. At $0.035 currently, MUTM has already reached more than $16.55 million in presale and has had more than 16,660 holders, providing higher exposure to the market. Mutuum Finance offers a working DeFi platform with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, staking rewards flexibility, and a rapidly expanding global community. Unlike meme-based coins, Mutuum Finance offers actual financial utility, engaging retail and whale investors, and turning into an upside altcoin to track in 2025. Dogecoin Whale Sell-Off Sparks Market Buzz, What Investors Should Watch Dogecoin (DOGE) was in the news over the last 24 hours following sales of more than 40 million tokens by whale wallets that are creating speculation over short-term price movements. Such large token sales do suggest market stress, but not all whale activity is bearish, analysts say, and some may be profit-taking or shifting into a different asset class as part of larger market trends. Historic trends would suggest DOGE bounces back after such corrections, but traders are keenly observing exchange inflows and trading volumes to take a cue on the next direction. While investors seek to decipher this heightened volatility in DOGE, several others are observing alternative cryptocurrencies with strong utility and growth prospects like upstart DeFi platforms with more stable financial opportunities. Mutuum Finance Records Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to make strong gains in Phase 6 of its presale, onboarded over 16,660 investors, and achieved a high of more than $16.55 million. Increasing entry is an indication of increasing faith in the long-term potential and vision of the project for the future of decentralized finance. In yet another example of its security and transparency culture, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program. Through the program, security engineers and developers can hunt for platform vulnerabilities in four severity levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The program is just one of the numerous steps Mutuum is taking to be even more secure in its infrastructure and to earn the trust of its increasing community. Dynamic Interest Rates and Maximum Efficiency At the center of the Mutuum Finance protocol is an algorithmic real-time floating interest rate system that is adjusted according to liquidity levels. During high liquidity, borrowing cost reduces, thereby promoting lending and incoming capital. During low liquidity, borrowing cost goes up to prompt new deposits and loan repayment. Self-balancing ensures natural equilibrium, which discourages over-leveraging risks and overall ecosystem health. Efficiency also results from collateral optimization, particularly where co-related assets are collateralized. Collateralized holdings carried in a proper manner enjoy higher borrowing ability with improved Loan-to-Value (LTV) terms, and reserve factors act as cushions when there is market uncertainty. Asset volatility is subject to increased reserve requirements to minimize uncertainty, but stable low-volatility assets can have higher borrowing with lower liquidation risk. LTV ratios and liquidation points are dynamically scaled to fit each of the tokens it lists’ distinctive volatility profiles, spreading risk evenly throughout the platform. With success in presale, sophisticated risk management technology, and unwavering dedication to transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a wholesome and viable network for long-term adoption, growth, and success in the DeFi network. Join the Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it to the list of the most viable utility-based altcoins of 2025, raising over $16.55 million from more than 16,660 investors and selling more than 50% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per coin. With the whales of Dogecoin causing market uncertainty by dumping 40 million tokens, investors are now on their way to making a shift towards projects with real-world utility and strong fundamentals. With its innovative DeFi lending platform, dynamic interest model, and security-focused ecosystem, MUTM is a top contender with high growth potential. Reserve your spot before presale expires.

Visa Direct Will Utilize Stablecoins For The First Time Payments giant Visa has announced a new pilot program for Visa Direct, the firm’s real-time global payments platform. According to the announcement, which occurred at Sibos 2025, businesses will be able to prefund cross-border payments with stablecoins , cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency. Until now, Visa Direct users could only prefund their international payments using fiat. Such transactions were slow, sometimes taking days, forcing businesses to park their capital in advance. With the use of stablecoins, however, settlement can occur in minutes. Chris Newkirk, President, Commercial & Money Movement Solutions at the company, said: Cross-border payments have been stuck in outdated systems for far too long. Visa Direct’s new stablecoins integration lays the groundwork for money to move instantly across the world, giving businesses more choice in how they pay. Pre-funding with these fiat-tied currencies works just like with fiat: Visa treats the tokens as “money in the bank.” Recipients, however, aren’t forced to get paid in stables; they can choose to receive in their local currency instead. With the new pilot, businesses will have the advantage of having better access to capital, as they won’t have to park it up in advance for as long as with the current fiat system. As for who can use the Visa Direct pilot right now, the payment card services company has noted that it’s only open to select partners that meet the criteria. The firm expects the pilot to move into limited availability by April 2026. Visa said in the press release: By combining the scale and trust of Visa’s global network with the programmability of blockchain and by partnering with leading payment providers on prefunding use cases, Visa is helping modernize cross-border payments for businesses, financial institutions and consumers worldwide. Visa isn’t the only financial institution that has made a move toward modernizing cross-border payments during Frankfurt’s Sibos 2025. Payments messaging platform SWIFT has also announced a shared ledger developed with 30+ major global banks based on the blockchain, the technology that powers digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins. Bitcoin Has Retraced Some Of Its Recovery Over The Past Day Bitcoin exceeded the $114,700 mark on Monday in what looked like the return of bullish momentum, but the rally seems to have already run out of steam as the cryptocurrency has returned to the $112,800 level. The chart below shows how the coin’s recent performance has looked: One warning sign that may have already been there could be the sharp surge in the Open Interest that accompanied the price surge, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn pointed out in an X post .

XRP, in particular, has been hit hard, falling below the $3 threshold and sparking concerns among investors. Despite the current downturn, market analyst Jay has issued an optimistic forecast, suggesting that XRP could still achieve double-digit prices within the ongoing cycle. Recent XRP Performance As of report time, XRP trades at approximately $2.82, a level that reflects its retreat from the $3 range and highlights broader market weakness. Jay maintains that XRP has the potential to stage a strong recovery, with the possibility of reaching $10 before the current market cycle concludes in December 2025. Achieving this target would require an increase of around 256% from present levels, raising XRP’s market capitalization to an estimated $598 billion. His projection mirrors the outlook of Jake Claver , CEO of Digital Ascension Group, who also expects XRP to reach new all-time highs before the cycle ends. Tops this cycle: * Bitcoin – $4690k * Ethereum – $25k * Solana – $1000 * Hyperliquid – $300 * XRP – $10 Thoughts? — jay (@0xjaypeg) August 14, 2025 Predictions for Other Major Assets Alongside his XRP forecast, Jay outlined ambitious targets for several leading cryptocurrencies. His estimates include a peak of $469,000 for Bitcoin, $25,000 for Ethereum, $1,000 for Solana, and $300 for Hyperliquid. These price levels represent potential gains of 328% for BTC, 528% for ETH, 395% for SOL, and 570% for HYPE. Compared to these figures, XRP’s projected 256% increase appears less aggressive, though still significant in scale. Possible Catalysts for XRP’s Growth Although Jay did not provide specific reasons behind his projections, several recent developments may support optimism for XRP. Foremost among them is the anticipation of additional spot-backed XRP exchange-traded funds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved the first spot XRP ETF, and market observers expect other proposals to be approved in the near future. Such investment products could attract substantial institutional inflows, boosting liquidity and demand for XRP. Institutional interest is already beginning to surface. Trident Digital Tech Holdings recently allocated $500 million toward establishing an XRP-based treasury, signaling growing corporate confidence in the asset. Retail participation is also increasing, particularly as decentralized finance platforms such as Axelar , Flare Network, and Uphold launch programs that allow XRP holders to earn yields of up to 10% annually. These initiatives enhance XRP’s utility and create new avenues for adoption. While XRP’s price remains under pressure in the short term, long-term forecasts such as Jay’s suggest that a sharp recovery could be possible if broader market conditions improve. A climb to $10 would represent a significant milestone for the asset, though it depends heavily on institutional adoption, ETF-driven demand, and integration into the DeFi ecosystem. The ambitious projections for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Hyperliquid further highlight expectations for the cycle, but whether XRP can match its bold $10 target remains uncertain.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Could Happen ‘In A Hurry,’ Analyst Warns Momentum is supported by increasing ETF optimism, with new trust and ETF discussions bringing HBAR into the same conversation as large-cap altcoins, along with renewed engagement from SWIFT. Hedera Makes Global Partnerships Hedera representatives participated with SWIFT, Citi, and Germany’s Bundesbank on a Sibos panel to discuss digital-currency interoperability, highlighting Hedera’s role in real-world finance. Meanwhile, Wyoming’s Frontier Stablecoin pilot, which selects HBAR for low-cost, high-speed settlement, continues to validate Hedera’s enterprise-first approach. Under the Hedera Governing Council, featuring companies like Google and IBM, the network’s value proposition is clear: high throughput, low fees, and energy efficiency through its hashgraph consensus. These fundamentals, combined with institutional filings and improved macro narratives for regulated crypto products, keep HBAR on watch lists despite short-term volatility. Price Action: HBAR Key Levels Into “Uptober” Technically, HBAR’s structure shows a recovery from a two-month low near $0.21, with the price still coiling inside a descending wedge, a setup that often precedes upside moves when broader sentiment turns positive. Immediate support lies between $0.212 and $0.205; losing that range could lead to a slide toward $0.198. On the upside, $0.226–$0.230 remains the first barrier; a clear break above could target $0.235 and the mid-September highs near $0.245, with $0.285 as the October stretch level if buying momentum accelerates. HBAR's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: HBARUSD on Tradingview Momentum indicators are mixed but stabilizing. RSI has rebounded from oversold (28) into the mid-40s, while Chaikin Money Flow trends higher, suggesting net inflows. The near-term warns of a narrowing golden cross between the 50- and 200-day EMAs that could turn into a death cross if bulls fail to defend the support levels. For swing traders, the strategy is simple: respect downside risk below $0.205, but look for confirmation above $0.230 to push toward $0.245–$0.285. Enterprise Adoption Gains Momentum, With Risks HBAR’s story is supported by enterprise integrations (payments, identity, and tokenization) and consistently very low fees (<$0.0001), making it appealing for high-frequency settlement. On-chain, active addresses and staking participation have increased, and sentiment is bullish going into Q4, driven by ETF hopes and public-sector pilots.

With its name now plastered across Grand Prix tracks, F1 simulators, and global media coverage, BlockDAG is positioning itself beyond code, into real-world credibility. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA), despite holding firm near the $0.80 support line and making headlines through Grayscale’s multi-asset ETF, is struggling to convert technical merit into mainstream momentum. For those assessing what crypto to invest in this quarter, the contrast is becoming harder to ignore. BlockDAG’s Real-World Presence: More Than Just Tech With over 26.5 billion coins sold and a presale that continues to accelerate through batch 30 at a current price of $0.0013, BlockDAG is stepping into a league of its own. The partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team is not just a sponsorship; it is a calculated move to connect blockchain engineering with a global stage that values speed, precision, and consistency. The BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team deal was unveiled at Raffles Hotel in Singapore, setting the tone for BlockDAG’s expansion through fan engagement zones, driver appearances, simulators, and hackathons. Traction in crypto means more than GitHub commits or TPS benchmarks. It’s about showing up where attention already lives: sports arenas, digital media, developer showcases, and institutional boardrooms. BlockDAG’s technology is built on a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, designed to deliver higher throughput and near-instant finality. But now, it is doing the harder part, making people care. The F1® partnership achieves that by placing the BlockDAG brand where audiences are already emotionally invested, thus building trust and recognition beyond whitepapers or tech claims. Cardano’s Slower Climb: Institutional Nod, Retail Hesitation Cardano (ADA), often hailed for its academic rigour and peer-reviewed development model, is currently trading around the $0.80 range . Analysts from crypto.news suggests it may bounce toward $1.14 if bullish conditions take hold. This optimism is partly driven by Cardano’s inclusion in Grayscale’s multi-asset ETF, which lends it institutional validation. However, visibility in institutional funds doesn’t always translate to retail conviction or cultural relevance. ADA’s roadmap remains robust, with updates on smart contract scalability, interoperability, and governance. But the project continues to struggle with engagement outside the crypto-native crowd. Cardano lacks the type of narrative activation BlockDAG has recently achieved, something that could become a critical differentiator in the Layer 1 wars of 2025. As users ask what crypto to invest in, projects that can command both technical and emotional loyalty may win out. BlockDAG, through its traction playbook, is building both. Traction as a Growth Multiplier The importance of traction is often underestimated in crypto. Many Layer 1 projects assume the merits of their consensus algorithms or TPS benchmarks will eventually be recognised. But BlockDAG’s recent moves show otherwise. Traction requires exposure, activation, and repeat touchpoints. The presence at Grand Prix events, simulators that connect fans directly with the protocol’s branding, and developer integrations via hackathons turn BlockDAG into a living brand, not just a whitepaper. This traction also helps with partner onboarding. As media coverage of the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team partnership expands, institutional players who may not yet understand DAG-based consensus will still recognise the significance of a blockchain project being affiliated with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® team. In turn, developers who once saw the Layer 1 space as saturated may start building on BlockDAG simply because it’s visible, accessible, and socially validated. This is why traction matters, and why it can be a tipping point toward top-tier Layer 1 status. Cardano’s Stiff Challenge To be clear, Cardano isn’t faltering; it’s holding ground. But the pace of growth feels slower. The recent price support is fragile, and ADA continues to be a coin that’s held rather than used. Unlike BlockDAG, which is integrating interactive fan and developer experiences into its rollout, Cardano’s ecosystem remains somewhat abstract to the average user. The contrast between institutional relevance and cultural relevance becomes stark when you consider where each project is being talked about. As buyers and traders search for what crypto to invest in, this gap may become decisive. Even with smart contract upgrades, Cardano must still translate its capabilities into mainstream relevance, something BlockDAG is rapidly achieving through its sports partnerships and on-ground events. Why BlockDAG’s Model Could Shift Layer 1 Rankings What sets BlockDAG apart isn’t just its technology stack. It’s the ability to convert that stack into traction, and traction into adoption. With nearly $415 million raised, over 26.5 billion coins sold, and a massive ROI since batch 1 (now at $0.0013), BlockDAG is not operating on hype but on a clear business strategy: connect brand, community, and technology through real-world channels. And it’s working. The protocol is appearing where people aren’t expecting a blockchain, Formula 1® simulators, BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team fan activations, digital track overlays, and developer summits. This signals that BlockDAG is not simply trying to disrupt crypto spaces but to expand into sectors like sports tech, digital entertainment, and enterprise tools. The high-profile BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team deal is the launchpad for that vision. Final Thoughts For those seriously evaluating what crypto to invest in, the data points toward a shift. It is no longer enough to have a strong protocol. What matters is traction, being seen, understood, and engaged with. Cardano (ADA) may continue to hold value through ETF inclusion and price rebounds, but its lack of cultural and mainstream momentum could limit its upside. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing how to scale visibility into adoption. The BWT Alpine Formula 1® team partnership gives it credibility on a global stage and serves as a signal to developers, investors, and partners that this Layer 1 is not just technically sound; it is socially validated. With momentum from both fundraising and real-world activations, BlockDAG offers more than a speculative token. It offers presence, growth, and trust, three things that define what crypto to invest in going forward.

He shared that over the last few months, he has been researching other use cases for XRP besides what Ripple is focused on. Still, he noted that he isn’t leaving Ripple permanently and will continue to remain active in the company’s activities. Schwartz joined the company in 2011 as a cryptographer and was promoted to Chief Technology Officer in 2018. “The time has come for me to step back from my day-to-day duties as Ripple CTO at the end of this year,” Schwartz wrote on X. “I’m really looking forward to spending more time with the kids and grandkids and going back to the hobbies I set aside. However, be warned, I’m not leaving the XRP community. You haven’t seen the last of me (now, or ever). Schwartz steps back but remains on the Ripple board Schwartz will remain at Ripple as Chief Technology Officer Emeritus, an honorary title , and will also join the company’s board of directors. CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised the move on X, calling Schwartz a “true OG in crypto.” A Ripple spokesperson noted that Dennis Jarosch, Senior Vice President of Engineering, will lead the team going forward. Data from the blockchain analytics platform Nansen showed that the price of XRP surged about 1.4% to $2.87 from $2.83 in the hours following Schwartz’s announcement. The token reached an all-time high price of more than $3.50 in July. It is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a value of roughly $172 billion. Ripple is one of the leading blockchain tech and crypto payments firms in the world. Notably, Schwartz had been associated with both Ripple and the XRP Ledger since their inception. The blockchain firm has established itself as a massive presence in the crypto space, with a loyal fan base they’ve dubbed the “XRP Army.” The company has also dabbled in political efforts; along with Coinbase, it recently donated approximately $70 million to a United States-backed political action committee, Fairshake, that influenced the 2024 election and the 2026 midterms. In a 60 Minutes interview, Garlinghouse said the PAC was formed in part as a counter to the SEC’s enforcement action against Ripple. Novogratz surprised by XRP’s survival The SEC’s case, brought under the leadership of Jay Clayton in December 2020, concluded in March when the regulator abandoned a key appeal . Recently, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz stated that he did not expect Ripple’s token to survive the SEC lawsuit against the California-based blockchain company. Novogratz made this declaration on a podcast with Kyle Chasse. The SEC initially accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP worth $1.3 billion. Following years of litigation, the court finally approved the settlement reached by the parties in August 2025. Novogratz said that this development came as a surprise, as he did not think XRP would last so long. The entrepreneur continued to say that he previously regarded Ripple’s token with disdain, partly due to its community, which he likened to a cult. Still, he admitted that over time, he concluded that this could generally apply to fans of most successful cryptocurrencies who are completely devoted. The Galaxy head mentioned an example of one of his own employees, who considers Bitcoin a central part of their life. Novogratz acknowledged the role of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in the successful resolution of the legal dispute, as well as maintaining the integrity of the community, which he called “one of the strongest” in the industry. He also noted that XRP turned out to be the best asset to invest in after November 2024, considering its rally. Get seen where it counts.

XRP ETF approval in October could unlock large institutional inflows and lift price quickly. Market analysts and probability markets assign a high chance to approvals, creating bullish sentiment. Sistine Research and other forecasters project target ranges of $37–$50 for XRP if ETFs attract major institutional capital (estimates vary). Meta description: XRP ETF approval drives market optimism — front-loaded with primary keyword. Read the latest analysis and prepare for potential institutional inflows. XRP’s price could surge if the SEC approves multiple ETF filings in October, driven by institutional interest and Ripple’s legal victory. XRP’s recent price consolidation is expected to end with an SEC decision on spot XRP ETFs, potentially driving a significant price surge. Experts predict a 95% chance of ETF approval, which could pave the way for institutional adoption and a historic rally in XRP’s price. Sistine Research forecasts XRP could reach $37 to $50 following ETF approvals, marking a potential 10x increase from its current price. XRP’s three-month consolidation phase may soon be over, as all eyes are on the SEC’s upcoming decision on spot XRP ETFs in October. After reaching a record high of $3.66 in July, the cryptocurrency has been in a holding pattern, with the market waiting for a fresh catalyst. The looming XRP ETF approval decision could be the catalyst that reignites momentum and attracts institutional capital. What is the likely market impact of an XRP ETF approval? XRP ETF approval is likely to increase liquidity and broaden investor access, encouraging institutional participation. If the SEC approves multiple spot XRP ETFs, market makers and asset managers would channel significant capital into XRP, potentially driving rapid price appreciation and narrower bid-ask spreads. How confident are analysts about ETF approval? Industry commentators and ETF analysts have expressed high confidence in approvals. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have publicly cited strong odds, while PolyMarket pricing reflects elevated probabilities. These market-implied signals are driving optimistic positioning among institutional and retail traders. Why does Ripple’s legal victory matter for ETF chances? Ripple’s court outcomes removed regulatory ambiguity that previously hindered institutional adoption. That legal clarity is a core rationale cited by analysts when assessing spot XRP ETF prospects. With litigation risk reduced, asset managers face fewer legal hurdles to offering XRP exposure to clients. What price targets are being discussed if ETFs are approved? Forecasts vary: some research groups present conservative upside while others — such as Sistine Research — outline aggressive scenarios with range targets between $37 and $50. These estimates assume sizable institutional inflows and a multiple expansion from present valuations. Comparative price scenarios for XRP after ETF approval Scenario Assumptions Price range Moderate inflows Selective asset manager adoption $5–$15 Broad institutional adoption Multiple spot ETFs + market makers $20–$37 Full institutional wave Large capital inflows, ETF-led retail pickup $37–$50 How should investors prepare for a potential ETF decision? Investors should assess risk tolerance, position sizing, and liquidity needs before reacting to regulatory outcomes.

ETF approval typically increases liquidity as institutional investors and market makers provide volume. For XRP, that would mean tighter spreads and higher daily traded volumes, improving execution for large orders. How quickly could price reactions occur after approval? Price reactions can be immediate—within hours—or unfold over weeks as assets are allocated to ETFs. The speed depends on the number of approved funds and their initial capital commitments. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity matters : Ripple’s legal outcomes underpin the improved ETF approval odds. Institutional demand is the catalyst : Spot XRP ETFs would create a regulated channel for large capital inflows. Risk management is essential : Prepare for volatility with position sizing, entry/exit rules, and monitoring of official SEC announcements. Conclusion With strong market signals and legal clarity behind Ripple, XRP ETF approval in October could be the next major catalyst for price discovery. Investors should weigh potential upside against volatility and plan positions accordingly.

This, however, needs to be done carefully, without causing severe economic stagnation that could result in job losses, officials said. This inflation concern was raised after Sarah Breeden, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for Financial Stability, gave a speech in Cardiff on Tuesday, September 30. In her speech, Breeden pointed out that inflation was expected to reach 4% in September, amid food and energy price hikes, as well as increases in payroll taxes and controlled prices. “It is too high,” she added. At that time, Catherine Mann, an American economist and a member of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), also commented on the situation during a Financial Times event in London. Mann noted that individuals have changed their expectations for future inflation from the earlier official target of 2%. Following this situation, she urged policymakers to commit more to restoring price stability and rebuilding trust. The UK’s ongoing high inflation raises tension among individuals The above remarks highlight mounting concerns among the MPC that the UK is beginning to stand out from other developed countries because of the ongoing high inflation. To address these concerns, economic analysts suggested that the situation may be partly a result of government policies, adding that it could also be due to long-term changes in how families and businesses operate. When the MPC announced its intention to cut interest rates in August, several officials raised concerns about it. This led to two rounds of voting before a conclusion was drawn. In September, things took a different turn. They voted 7-2 to continue with the current borrowing costs at 4% and market analysts do not expect any changes before the end of the year. Concerning the changes made, the Deputy Governor of BoE expressed that she still believed they could handle any small challenges that might come up in the short term, referring to them as “a bump in the road.” In the meantime, she speculated that inflation would return to the BoE’s earlier target of 2% as the job market slows down and the pressure on wages decreases. Breeden had also raised concerns about the inflation level earlier in August. This followed data released that month indicating that the inflation level had risen to 3.8%. Regarding this data, she suggested possible risks on both sides. Analysts still point out that inflation could become “sticky, not bumpy” if businesses continue to raise prices or if the BoE and other policymakers miscalculate the amount of labor available in the market. Breeden calls for the urgency to lower interest rates Breeden cautioned that if the BoE delayed lowering interest rates again, products and jobs would be harmed significantly. This might result in inflation levels falling below the target level. On the other hand, Mann mentioned that there are clear risks that a long period of persistently high inflation has altered consumers’ behavior. She explained that once inflation in the UK gets above 3%, it does not matter what goods they buy — consumers start paying much more attention to all the prices they see. “We have been above that level for quite some time already,” she added. However, Mann noted that this does not necessarily mean she is ruling out additional interest rate cuts. Based on her argument, consumers are concerned about higher prices. They are also increasingly nervous about job prospects, citing high uncertainty surrounding GDP growth. She further explained that if the economy improves, consumers will start to spend a little and buy things. However, if the economy slackens, they will “keep their wallets shut,” making it difficult for companies to raise prices, as consumers cannot or will not buy their products, she said.

Financial companies have been increasingly interested in stablecoins under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, which signed the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act into law in July. The stablecoin market has boomed to $300 billion, with the US Treasury estimating it will rise to $2 trillion by 2028. Source: Stripe The Information also reported on Tuesday that Stripe is seeking a federal banking charter to meet US stablecoin requirements, as well as a trust license from the New York State Department of Financial Services. How fast can Stripe service launch stablecoins? Stripe said businesses using Open Issuance could launch a stablecoin in a few days, adding that users can create rewards and use earnings from these rewards to incentivize their customers. Launch timelines depend on onboarding, reserve setup, and compliance checks. “Businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them,” Stripe said, emphasizing issuer control and customer-facing use cases. Stripe argues the approach carries fewer operational risks than building a full in-house stablecoin stack, which often strains teams on reserve management, compliance, and liquidity provisioning. Why is crypto-as-a-service gaining traction? Stripe’s stablecoin service follows similar white-label crypto offerings as traditional financial firms and exchanges expand product suites. Major exchange providers are rolling out crypto-as-a-service products to let banks, brokerages, and other enterprises offer crypto functions without building infrastructure from scratch. These services typically include access to trading, custody, liquidity, and compliance tooling — reducing time-to-market and operational complexity for incumbents entering crypto. How does Open Issuance fit into agentic e-commerce? Stripe also announced an Agentic Commerce Protocol developed with OpenAI to let merchants sell through AI agents while retaining brand control. Stablecoins issued via Open Issuance could be used to power payments and incentives for these AI-driven commerce flows. Circle, Crossmint, Binance, and Coinbase have similarly announced moves to expand rails and crypto-as-a-service capabilities, showing industry momentum toward integrated crypto payments and tokenized commerce. Frequently Asked Questions Can a company control its stablecoin reserves with Stripe Open Issuance? Yes. Issuers can customize reserve composition and set mint/burn rules while relying on Stripe and partner managers for custody and treasuries to simplify audits and reporting. Will Stripe Open Issuance reduce issuer compliance burden? Stripe positions Open Issuance to reduce compliance overhead by offering tooling, partner-managed treasuries, and reporting, but issuers remain responsible for regulatory obligations and onboarding. Key Takeaways Speed to market : Open Issuance aims to let businesses launch stablecoins in days with developer-focused APIs. Reserve control : Issuers can set cash/treasury ratios and choose treasury managers to support audits and liquidity. Industry context : The stablecoin market is large and growing ($300B today; U.S. Treasury projects up to $2T by 2028), and multiple firms now offer crypto-as-a-service. Conclusion Stripe Open Issuance positions companies to deploy branded stablecoins quickly while outsourcing reserve custody and reporting to established managers. For businesses exploring tokenized rewards, payments, or agentic commerce, Open Issuance offers a pragmatic path to production — monitor regulatory guidance and complete onboarding to go live.",Guides|News|FLOW|USDC,EN,0,0,FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 01:18:16

Nomination withdrawn: White House pulled Brian Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination Quintenz cited interference and shared private messages involving the Winklevoss brothers; reasons for withdrawal are not officially stated. Regulatory context: the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could shift broad crypto oversight to the CFTC, affecting assets like BTC and ETH. Quintenz nomination withdrawn: CFTC chair nomination pulled; read implications for crypto regulation and next steps under COINOTAG coverage. Brian Quintenz confirmed the White House withdrew his nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and said he will return to the private sector. What happened to Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination? Quintenz nomination withdrawn after the White House pulled his nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The withdrawal ends his pending confirmation and leaves the agency led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham while Congress considers crypto jurisdiction bills. Why was Quintenz’s nomination withdrawn? There is no official White House explanation at publication. Brian Quintenz said he will return to the private sector and confirmed reporting by Politico and comments he gave to Cointelegraph. Quintenz also published private messages that indicate public pushback from Gemini co‑founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Brian Quintenz speaks during a Congressional nomination hearing in June. Source: Senate Agriculture Committee How did the Winklevoss messages affect the nomination? Quintenz shared private messages on social media showing the Winklevoss brothers urged intervention in his confirmation over CFTC handling of a civil matter involving Gemini. Those exchanges, Quintenz said, informed communications to the President and complicated his path to confirmation. How could CFTC authority change under upcoming legislation? The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, moving through Congress, seeks to define which agencies regulate specific crypto assets. If enacted, it would assign sufficiently decentralized assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as “digital commodities,” expanding the CFTC’s remit. The bill aims to resolve overlaps between the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Industry participants and lawmakers expect clearer enforcement boundaries, but the timeline and final text remain subject to Congressional approval. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/quintenz-cftc-nomination-withdrawn-2025-10-01"" }, ""headline"": ""Quintenz Nomination Withdrawn: White House Pulls CFTC Chair Pick"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/01999d19-6036-7101-8ef9-6be738e9f6ad"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Brian Quintenz confirmed the White House withdrew his nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will return to the private sector.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Was Brian Quintenz's nomination to be CFTC chair withdrawn?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Quintenz is a former CFTC commissioner and headed crypto policy at a16z. Politico reported the White House action, and Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal in comments to Cointelegraph. The White House has not released a formal explanation. What are the immediate regulatory implications for crypto firms? With the CFTC lacking a permanent chair, agency priorities may remain stable under Acting Chair Caroline Pham, but long‑term direction depends on future nominees and pending legislation like the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Key Takeaways Nomination status : The White House withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination for CFTC chair; Quintenz will return to the private sector. Industry friction : Private messages between Quintenz and the Winklevoss brothers highlight industry lobbying that may have influenced the process. Regulatory context : The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act could expand the CFTC’s authority over BTC and ETH if enacted, making the agency’s leadership decision consequential. Conclusion The withdrawal of Brian Quintenz’s CFTC chair nomination leaves the agency without a confirmed leader at a pivotal moment for crypto policy. With the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act advancing in Congress, the choice of a permanent chair will shape enforcement and market clarity.

SEC guidance on crypto custody states the Division of Investment Management will not recommend enforcement action against Registered Advisers or Regulated Funds that treat a state-chartered trust as a “bank” for placement and maintenance of crypto assets, provided the trust is authorized by banking authorities and maintains written policies for custody and private key management. How must advisers verify a state trust to use it as a qualified custodian? Advisers must confirm the state trust is authorized by the relevant banking regulator to provide crypto custody services.

The memorandum clarifies enforcement priorities but leaves the ultimate legal standards of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 intact. Why does this matter for crypto firms and custodians? Opening custody to state-chartered trusts could broaden the pool of qualified custodians beyond national banks. That potentially allows affiliates of crypto-native firms and specialized trust companies to custody assets for registered products when they meet oversight and policy requirements. What conditions did the SEC emphasize in the letter? The SEC emphasized that custodial agreements must ensure segregation of crypto assets, explicit limits on use of funds, documented private key controls, and that the adviser determines the trust arrangement serves client interests.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart praised the letter as added clarity for the digital asset space.

Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity : The SEC letter signals tolerance for state-chartered trust custody when safeguards are present. Adviser responsibility : Registered Advisers must verify authorization, policies, and contractual protections. Non-binding guidance : The letter is interpretive and does not change statutory legal obligations; due diligence remains essential.

The European Systemic Risk Board, tasked with guarding Europe’s financial system, last week passed a recommendation to ban so-called multi-issuance stablecoins, according to people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be identified while discussing non-public information. While the ESRB’s guidance, approved by a board of central bank governors and EU officials, is not legally binding, it is expected to pressure authorities to either adopt the restrictions or justify how financial stability could be maintained without them. ECB moves to restrict multi-issuance stablecoins Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a specific asset, such as the US dollar, and are typically backed by a corresponding reserve of cash . In the case of the multi-issuance model, Licensed providers that issue tokens in the EU should have a local reserve established in at least one member state, and should also manage reserves for identical Tokens issued outside that member state. The ECB, headed by President Christine Lagarde, who chairs the ESRB’s general board, was a vocal proponent of the proposed ban and secured support from EU officials and regulators to proceed. The ESRB also identified possible alternative mechanisms to safeguard multi-issuance stablecoin arrangements in the EU, which were considered less effective.ESRB and ECB spokespersons declined to comment on the matter. The implications for stablecoin firms already licensed under the multi-issuance model, including Paxos and Circle , remain unclear. Finland’s markets authority, which oversees Paxos, and France’s L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, which oversees Circle, also declined to comment. Both companies operate primarily out of the United States, whose crypto-friendly regulatory environment has raised concerns among European regulators. The bulk of their reserves is invested in dollar-denominated cash and cash-equivalent assets, including short-term US government debt. Circle and Paxos spokespeople declined to comment, though some sources noted the European Commission’s prior support for the multi-issuance approach. ECB raises alarms over dollar-backed stablecoins The ECB has been exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC) tied to the euro since 2021, but awaits a legal framework to proceed. Officials have repeatedly expressed concerns that dollar-backed stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability and monetary sovereignty in the European Union. Lagarde previously warned that foreign holders of a stablecoin could pose “significant legal, operational, liquidity and financial stability risks at the EU level.” In a presentation in April, the ECB stated that reserves held by third-country issuers were likely invested outside the EU in dollar-denominated assets, which would undermine its agenda for a Savings and Investment Union. The Bank of Italy, earlier this month, urged the European Commission to define the legal status of cross-border stablecoins. The ECB doesn’t police the regulations that apply to these assets in the EU. The European Commission has so far avoided adopting an official position on the matter. Judith Arnal, board member at the Bank of Spain, wrote earlier this month that the debate over multi-issuance stablecoins “exposes a deeper challenge for MiCA’s credibility as a global benchmark.” She warned that a regulatory framework disputed between the ECB, the Commission, and the European Parliament “risks sending the wrong signal internationally, namely that MiCA is fragile and subject to diverging interpretations.” The European Commission, a member of the ESRB, did not respond to requests for comment.

Leadership change at Ripple announced Schwartz becomes CTO emeritus and joins the board; Dennis Jarosch will lead engineering. On-chain data showed a ~1.4% XRP price uptick after the announcement (Nansen data). David Schwartz Ripple CTO steps back — official update, XRP market reaction, and next steps; read the full leadership briefing. David Schwartz was one of the chief architects behind the XRP Ledger and is well known by many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. Who is David Schwartz and what did he announce? David Schwartz , a founding engineer of the XRP Ledger , announced he will scale back his day-to-day duties as Ripple CTO at the end of this year and transition to CTO emeritus while joining Ripple’s board of directors. What will change in Ripple’s leadership when David Schwartz steps back? Schwartz will retain an advisory and board role as CTO emeritus , providing institutional knowledge and technical guidance. Senior vice president of engineering Dennis Jarosch will take operational leadership of the engineering team going forward. How did markets react to the announcement? On-chain analytics from Nansen recorded an immediate market response: XRP price rose roughly 1.4% from $2.83 to $2.87 in the hours after the announcement. XRP’s market capitalization remains among the largest in crypto, reflecting steady community interest. Source: David Schwartz Schwartz joined Ripple in 2011 as a cryptographer and became chief technology officer in 2018. In a public post, he said he looks forward to more family time and resuming personal hobbies, while assuring the community he will remain engaged with XRP users and developers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised Schwartz’s contributions, calling him a “true OG in crypto.” The company confirmed internally that Dennis Jarosch will assume leadership of day-to-day engineering operations. Why does this matter for the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s product roadmap? Schwartz’s technical legacy includes core protocol design and long-term architecture work for the XRP Ledger . His move to an emeritus position preserves his influence while enabling new operational leadership to execute near-term engineering milestones. Will Ripple’s strategy or political activity change with this leadership shift? There is no immediate sign of strategic pivot. Ripple continues to participate in regulatory and market initiatives.

According to court records, she admitted two counts under the Proceeds of Crime Act for acquiring and possessing criminal property in the form of bitcoin at Southwark Crown Court. Huge Seizure Found In A Hampstead Property Based on reports , police found devices holding about 61,000 BTC during a 2018 search of a hampstead home, a haul now valued at roughly £5 billion (about $6.7 billion). That cache has been described by investigators as one of the biggest single crypto seizures ever. Investigators say the case traces back to an investment scheme run in China between 2014 and 2017. Reports have disclosed that more than 128,000 people were cheated out of money that was later converted into bitcoin. It follows a seven-year ongoing investigation by the Met’s Economic Crime team into international money laundering, which today has seen the leading figure convicted for her crimes. Zhimin Qian, 45 (04.09.1978), of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court on… pic.twitter.com/DYaor97YLH — Politics UK (@PolitlcsUK) September 29, 2025 Qian is accused of moving those proceeds into crypto and then trying to hide them overseas. Company Claims And Alleged Promises According to court filings and reporting, Qian ran a company called Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology, which promised very high returns — figures as large as 300% were used in promotional material — and claimed involvement in mining and other crypto activities. Authorities say investors’ cash was routed into exchanges and swapped for bitcoin. Charges And Legal Steps Underway The Metropolitan Police say Qian was charged after a long, cross-border probe and has been remanded in custody ahead of sentencing and further recovery hearings. Civil recovery steps are also under way to try to return assets to victims. The police listed offences of acquiring and possessing criminal property in their statement about the case. Assistant Convicted And Overseas Links Reports note that an associate, “Jian Wen”, was earlier convicted in relation to parts of the scheme and received a prison term of almost seven years for laundering some of the proceeds. Authorities also say properties tied to the investigation were seized abroad, including in Dubai, as investigators followed funds around the world. What Comes Next Sentencing dates have not yet been set and Qian remains in custody. Court testimony and evidence presented in London are expected to include material from overseas agencies and witnesses, with victims in China due to give accounts remotely. The case is likely to be used as an example of how law enforcement can track and seize large crypto holdings across borders.

By enabling interoperability between two of the most influential payment ecosystems, Ripple is positioning XRP as a key player in the future of international money movement. Could XRP Become A Standard For Settlement? The strategy for mainstream adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its native asset, XRP, is intricately linked to the Interledger Protocol (ILP). As highlighted by researcher SMQKE on X, Ripple’s approach is to become an essential part of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network, providing an interoperable layer that seamlessly bridges the old and new financial worlds. Related Reading: Pundit Claims That Ripple Is Building The Banking System Right On The Blockchain Using XRP This Interledger Protocol is designed to synchronize separate ledgers without forming a new one, while acting as a connective tissue across financial systems. In many ways, it mirrors SWIFT’s own structure, where the successful processing of a payment message creates binding obligations to pay between nodes and intermediaries. However, ILP is Ripple’s core strategy for mainstream adoption of the XRP Ledger. By making ILP fully compatible with SWIFT, Ripple ensures that both XRP and its technology can plug into the world’s most dominant payment network. What’s important about this move is the fact that Ripple itself is now often described as evolving into the Interledger Protocol initiative. Ripple understood that the world would never standardize on a single ledger, which is why it built ILP to enable interoperability to bridge across multiple systems. Meanwhile, this approach is reinforced through the ISO 20022 adoption to ensure that the entire transaction is secure, seamless, and scalable, offering a superior settlement experience that coexists with the bank’s existing messaging connectivity across the global financial infrastructure. “The strategy is clear: one protocol (ILP), unlimited networks, and seamless XRP movement,” SMQKE noted. The Promise Of Financial Freedom With XRP As the crypto landscape expands, XRP has been hailed as an asset that could offer financial breakthroughs. The sentiment expressed by Traveler2236 points to a profound vision of global financial inclusion and the end of economic inequality enforced by legacy systems. His core claim is that there will come a day when XRP will unleash dreams beyond imagination. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors That This Is Happening Right Now – Time To Pay Attention? Also, there will be no denials because of a credit score, and no more doors closed because your income doesn’t match some arbitrary outcome. Traveler2236’s statement is not merely a prediction, but a declaration of certainty, bordering on a personal epiphany. “This isn’t a dream anymore, it’s happening right now,” the expert stated.

The new product aims to help businesses take advantage of artificial intelligence and stablecoins to grow their revenue. Open Issuance also empowers businesses to create, mint, and redeem their own stablecoins using a few lines of code and new solutions for agentic commerce. Stripe revealed that the updates were part of Stripe Tour New York, where it launched over 40 new products and features. Stripe focuses on channeling opportunities in AI Introducing Open Issuance from Bridge ( @stablecoin ). Launch and manage your own stablecoin—with just a few lines of code. https://t.co/lX1VYHmuER pic.twitter.com/87WNy8WXcU — Stripe (@stripe) September 30, 2025 Will Gaybrick, Stipe’s president of technology and business, said the company’s role in stablecoins and AI is to bring frontier technology out of the experimental and into the mainstream. He added that Stripe is focused on capitalizing on the numerous opportunities in AI and stablecoins, which have seen a 57% surge in total supply over the last 12 months. Stripe revealed that treasuries on the new platform are managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Superstate, while Lead Bank holds cash to provide liquidity. According to the announcement, all new tokens will be fully interoperable with any others issued via Open Issuance. The company added that Bridge’s orchestration API comes with low-cost conversions to virtually any other stablecoin. Stripe also acknowledged that businesses can generate rewards for stablecoins they create on their platform. Users can also use earnings from the rewards to incentivize their customers. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don’t build on top of someone else’s coin. With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” – Zach Abrams , Co-Founder and CEO of Bridge. Phantom has designed the first stablecoin issued via Open Issuance called CASH. Stripe also revealed that mUSD for MetaMask and USDH, built by Native Markets for Hyperliquid, will also be issued on top of the new platform. Stripe has announced that its Optimized Checkout Suite will now accept stablecoin payments by default, aiming to help businesses easily accept recurring stablecoin payments. Businesses can also hold stablecoin balances, convert between fiat currencies, spend stablecoin balances with a locally issued card, and send stablecoins to crypto wallets cross-border. Stripe integrates the Agentic Commerce Protocol https://t.co/n3bvdBBdEz — Stripe (@stripe) September 30, 2025 On September 29, Stripe also partnered with OpenAI and launched the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). The product already powers the new Instant Checkout in ChatGPT. ACP maintains a shared language between merchants and AI agents, allowing merchants to sell through AI agents with a single integration while retaining control over their business. Businesses that don’t process payments with Stripe can also adopt ACP due to its open standard feature, which allows it to work across AI agents. Stripe is currently testing ACP’s solutions in real-world settings with the help of Microsoft Copilot, Anthropix, Perplexity, Vercel, Lovable, Replit, and Manus to help businesses get ready for agentic commerce. Stripe also introduced Stripe Billing to help businesses run hybrid revenue models that combine subscriptions with usage-based pricing. The new product will feature a new API that enables businesses to connect with LLM providers and track inference cost changes in real-time. Stripe unveiled a new app-to-web payments flow to help businesses seamlessly redirect customers from their iOS app to a mobile checkout page powered by Stripe Checkout. The company also launched Link, a wallet that now supports Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services with Klarna. Stripe said it manages global taxes through Stripe Tax, which supports tax collection in 102 countries. The firm also revealed that it manages fraud prevention with Stripe Radar, which is expanding to block fraud types, such as the abuse of free trial periods.

Over $10B in ETH shorts at risk near $4,359 Whale buys (Bitmine ~234,846 ETH) and fading bearish indicators suggest weakening downtrend. Key technicals: RSI ~45 (neutral), DMI shows declining –DI; 20/50 EMAs act as immediate resistance. Ethereum short squeeze: ETH shorts >$10B near $4,359; monitor funding rates, whale flows, and key EMA breaks for a potential breakout — read now. Is Ethereum about to trigger a short squeeze? Ethereum short squeeze probability has increased as a large pool of leveraged short positions sits vulnerable near the $4,359 level. Reduced bearish momentum, negative funding rates and significant whale accumulation raise the odds of a cascade of liquidations if buyers sustain upward pressure. What evidence shows traders may be ignoring bullish signs? Funding rates stayed negative last week, indicating persistent short-side conviction. Meanwhile, on-chain monitoring platforms reported elevated whale purchases and large exchange outflows. Bitmine’s reported purchase of 234,846 ETH (approx. $963M) enlarged a top holder’s supply, signaling accumulation by smart money despite public pessimism. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/eth-short-squeeze-analysis-2025-09"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum Shorts Top $10B — Is a Short Squeeze Imminent?"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/M0C6k1Dj_58eb1cbaf69dc8df7004dc58f9cdf854d5108488efe29e619d494ed0f36217b5.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T06:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Ethereum short squeeze risk rises as more than $10 billion in ETH shorts face liquidation pressure near $4,359 amid whale accumulation and fading bearish indicators.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much in ETH shorts is at risk?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Over $10 billion in open ETH short positions are vulnerable to liquidation if price pushes toward the $4,359 zone, based on on-chain derivatives data and exchange open interest snapshots."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain signs indicate a potential squeeze?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key signs include large whale buys, exchange outflows, negative funding rates consistent with heavy shorting, and concentrated stop levels near $4,300–$4,400."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to monitor a possible Ethereum short squeeze"", ""description"": ""Practical steps to track indicators that could trigger an ETH short squeeze."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track funding rates"", ""text"": ""Monitor perpetual swap funding rates for spikes from negative to less-negative or positive, which signal increasing buyer pressure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch whale flows"", ""text"": ""Follow large on-chain transfers and exchange outflows indicating accumulation by large holders."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor technical levels"", ""text"": ""Observe price reaction at the 20- and 50-day EMAs and key resistance around $4,300–$4,400 for potential liquidation cascades."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions What triggers a short squeeze in Ethereum? A short squeeze is triggered when price rises quickly, forcing leveraged short positions to cover (buy) to close losses. In ETH’s case, clustered stops and high open interest near $4,359 could create cascading liquidations and sharp upside moves. How should traders manage risk around a potential squeeze? Use defined position sizes, set protective stops below key support, avoid heavy leverage, and monitor funding rates and whale activity to reduce unexpected liquidation risk during volatile moves. Key Takeaways Large short exposure : Over $10B in ETH shorts creates vulnerability near $4,359. Smart money accumulation : Significant whale buys and exchange outflows suggest accumulation by large holders. Technical setup : RSI at neutral, fading –DI on DMI, and price near 20/50 EMAs — breakout depends on sustained buying pressure. Market snapshot and technical context At press time, Ethereum traded around $4,173 after a modest rebound. RSI sat near 45, indicating neutral momentum. The DMI showed declining bearish strength as the –DI began to flatten against the +DI. Price action remains capped by the 20 and 50-day EMAs, which now serve as critical decision points for bulls and bears. Funding rates remained negative through last week, reflecting a dominant short bias — a condition that historically precedes squeeze dynamics when buyers step in. On-chain analytics providers and derivatives aggregators (reported by CryptoQuant and exchange interest trackers) show concentrated leverage levels and clustered short positions in the $4,300–$4,400 band. Whale activity further supports the thesis. Bitmine’s reported purchase of roughly 234,846 ETH (reported value ~ $963M) increased top-holder balances, suggesting accumulation by entities prepared to hold through volatility. Source mentions: CryptoQuant, TradingView, X (all cited as plain text, no external links). Ethereum [ETH] might be on the edge of something big, and short sellers are sweating. Over $10 billion worth of ETH shorts are now hanging by a thread. If price breaks toward the $4,359 mark, it could spark a liquidation cascade that sends ETH flying. The recent downtrend looks like it’s losing steam, and bullish momentum is rising. Where do we go from here? Fear in the air, but ETH is unfazed Despite the gloom in the market, Ethereum’s starting to push higher, and that’s no coincidence. Funding Rates stayed negative throughout last week, meaning traders were paying to stay short. That kind of bearish sentiment often shows up right before a reversal. Source: Cryptoquant And it’s not just the charts, whales are moving too. Just yesterday, Bitmine bought a jaw-dropping 234,846 ETH (worth $963 million), bringing their total stash to over $10.8 billion. Source: X $10B in shorts and they’re on thin ice When a market is heavily shorted and whales begin to accumulate, open interest concentrated at clear levels becomes the fuel for a rapid squeeze. If ETH breaches the $4,300–$4,400 zone, stop-losses and liquidations could force short covering that exacerbates upside momentum. Waning bearish pressure Ethereum’s intraday price action hovered below the 20- and 50-day EMAs, which act as resistance and short-term trend gauges. A decisive close above these EMAs with increased volume would be a technical signal confirming buyers are taking control. Source: TradingView Conclusion Ethereum’s setup — concentrated short interest, negative funding rates, rising whale accumulation and weakening bearish momentum — increases the chance of a short squeeze if buyers sustain a march toward $4,359. Traders should monitor funding rates, exchange flows and EMA breaks for actionable confirmation.

Tether has increased its Bitcoin reserves to nearly $10 billion, marking a major investment move while expanding USDT’s supply to $175 billion. What happened to Tether’s Bitcoin reserves? Tether Bitcoin reserves rose after the company added roughly 8,889 BTC (~$1 billion), bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to about $9.79 billion. The purchase was recorded in a transfer from Bitfinex and is consistent with Tether’s pattern of quarter-end reserve top-ups ahead of attestations. How much Bitcoin did Tether add and why did it matter? Tether executed an 8,889 BTC transfer, valued near $1 billion at the time of the transaction. Arkham Intelligence flagged the move, which follows similar buys in September 2024, December 2024 and March 2025. Analysts say these buys strengthen liquidity and balance-sheet metrics before quarterly attestations. How is USDT supply changing and what does that indicate? USDT circulation increased by about 10.7% over three months to roughly $174.6 billion, according to market data providers. This rise highlights stronger demand for dollar-pegged liquidity across crypto trading and custody services and underscores USDT’s dominant market position among stablecoins. Did Tether sell BTC recently and what does that show? Tether previously sold $1.4 billion in Bitcoin to Twenty One Capital as part of separate treasury actions.

Author: COINOTAG What does Bitcoin’s taker buy volume decline mean? Bitcoin’s taker buy volume decline means frontline buyer activity is shrinking, indicating reduced market conviction and higher vulnerability to price drops. When taker buy volume falls while sell-side metrics rise, momentum often shifts from bullish to neutral or bearish within weeks. How significant is the recent taker buy volume drop? CryptoQuant data shows ten consecutive months of falling taker buy volume, reaching early‑2024 lows. This sustained decline is notable because it measures aggressive buy-side execution; prolonged weakness here historically precedes momentum shifts. Exchanges like Binance exhibited the sharpest declines, highlighting concentrated trader caution. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin taker buy volume hits 2024 lows as sharks and retail sell"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/taker-volume.jpeg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-XXT09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-XXT12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-taker-buy-volume-analysis"" }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin taker buy volume drops to 2024 lows, signaling weak demand—seller cohorts and SOPR analysis show rising pressure and possible range-bound action between $111K and $114K.""} Why is SOPR relevant to Bitcoin selling pressure? SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicates whether spent coins are being sold at profit or loss; a SOPR persistently below 1 shows sellers are realizing losses or not achieving breakeven, which often aligns with selling pressure. Analyst Axel Adler notes SOPR has failed to clear 1 recently, a bearish confirmation of weak buyer follow-through. Who is selling Bitcoin now? On-chain cohort analysis shows elevated selling from mid‑sized ‘sharks’ and retail holders. Checkonchain metrics report a Sharks to Exchange Balance Change of +109k BTC (net deposits), while retail holder balances trended negative through September. Smaller wallet cohorts—Fish (-7.9k BTC), Crabs (-3.9k BTC), Shrimps (-1.7k BTC)—also recorded outflows at press time. Source: CryptoQuant At the time of writing, BTC traded near $113,541 after a 1.16% 24‑hour gain. Despite the short rebound, the demand side remains fragile and the recent upward move faces headwinds from low taker buy volume and active sellers. How are wallet cohorts affecting short‑term price action? Wallet cohort flows influence supply on exchanges. Sharks’ net deposits increase available supply for market sales. Retail negative balance change suggests small‑holder selling or reduced accumulation. Together, these flows increase immediate sell liquidity and pressure price support levels. Source: CryptoQuant What are the likely price scenarios for BTC? Two outcomes are most plausible based on current on‑chain signals: Downside scenario: Intensifying seller activity could push BTC below recent support toward $111,054, confirming a short-term reversal. Range-bound scenario: If selling and low buying pressure persist in balance, BTC may range between $111K and $114K until a clear catalyst emerges. What would confirm a sustained uptrend? Buyers must reassert control by driving a decisive breakout above $114K and securing daily closes near $115K. Sustained increases in taker buy volume and SOPR above 1 would signal renewed demand and reduce downside risk. Source: Checkonchain Source: Checkonchain Frequently Asked Questions How long can low taker buy volume persist? Low taker buy volume can persist for months, especially during consolidation or when macro sentiment is neutral. Ten consecutive months of decline suggests structural caution among aggressive buyers rather than a short-lived blip. Does a SOPR below 1 always mean price will fall? No. SOPR below 1 signals coins sold on average at a loss, which often accompanies capitulation or distribution. It is a bearish indicator but must be assessed alongside volume, exchange flows, and macro conditions. Which wallet cohorts should traders watch? Monitor sharks, whales, and retail cohorts.

Prediction markets currently assign a 91%–95% chance of U.S. Cardano spot ETF approval, with dates tentatively set for late October 2025.

Bulls believe institutional access could mirror BTC/ETH’s ETF strategy by increasing liquidity and expanding demand. However, options activity remains subdued, and recent long liquidations suggest traders are cautious about chasing gains before a clear breakout. If ADA closes above $0.85, potential upward targets are $0.87 (Fib 0.382) and $0.90 (Fib 0.5). Cardano (ADA) Key Levels: $0.78 Support, Then $0.75 and $0.71 The Cardano (ADA) near-term structure is a range between $0.78 and $0.83 after a pullback from highs near $0.95. Momentum has improved from oversold levels, but Parabolic SAR remains above the price, and the trend hasn’t fully flipped. Immediate support is at $0.78, with deeper liquidity pockets at $0.75 and $0.71; a failure there exposes $0.68 as the last major defense. Analysts also point out a developing death-cross risk on lower timeframes, implying rallies could fade without new catalysts. Macro factors remain influential: tighter financial conditions or a Bitcoin retrace can reduce altcoin bids, capping ADA under resistance even if ETF headlines stay strong.

Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview The 2026 Bear Case: Why Sub-$0.30 Isn’t Impossible Beyond the next few weeks, some strategists warn of a path where ADA may revisit sub-$0.30 in 2026. The reasoning: at a roughly $34B market cap near $0.80, multiples might shrink unless usage growth significantly accelerates. While Cardano promotes research-driven upgrades (Ouroboros Leios, the Omega roadmap) and has an eight-year record with no downtime, critics point to slow app adoption, capital shifting to newer ecosystems, and ETF attention potentially directing flows into a few large caps. If global liquidity tightens, ETFs underperform, or structural demand weakens, a prolonged cycle could push ADA toward value zones below $0.30, where longer-term buyers might enter.

This means that any officially approved or licensed trust company can hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether in the same way they hold hard cash or other assets. The American financial watchdog disclosed the update in a letter sent to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a law firm that reached out to the SEC, seeking clarification. SEC supports state-trusts as crypto custodians The Securities and Exchange Commission stated in the letter that trust companies may be treated as “banks.” The approach works under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. State-chartered trust companies are now eligible to hold crypto assets on behalf of their clients. The SEC shared the letter and analysis on its website. The agency wrote, “…any Registered Adviser that has custody of client funds or securities maintain those funds and securities with a qualified custodian, where “qualified custodian” is defined to include “a bank as defined in Section 202(a)(2) of the Advisers Act.” The SEC letter is classified as a no-action letter, meaning that the agency will not take enforcement action if advisers or funds use state trust companies to hold crypto assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis posted on X and said that she is “encouraged to see @SECGov recognizing state-chartered trust companies as qualified digital asset custodians.” She reminded people of how Wyoming paved the way for this decision when it issued a no-action relief in 2020 and was criticized back then by SEC employees. She said, “They finally recognized the rigor & value of WY’s digital asset supervision.” Brian Daly, Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, told Eleanor Terrett that, “This additional clarity was needed because state-chartered trust companies were not universally seen as eligible custodians for crypto assets.” Daly explained that the letter to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is a staff letter. He said the topic could be brought up in future rulemaking, but for now, it works and provides clear guidance for today’s products and managers. The decision taken by the SEC staff is a turning point, especially after the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department restricted how banks and regulated entities could work with crypto firms in what is known as Operation Choke Point 2.0.

52500943,593641,1759287635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52500943.jpeg,Stablecoin Crackdown: European Central Bank Gathers Backing For Joint Issuance Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-crackdown-ecb-joint-issuance-ban/,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is reportedly gaining traction in its pursuit of a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins across the European Union (EU). This move comes in light of recommendations from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is tasked with safeguarding Europe’s financial integrity. Multi-Issuance Stablecoins Under Fire Last week, the ESRB approved a recommendation that advocates for a prohibition on multi-issuance stablecoins. Sources familiar with the discussions, told Bloomberg that this guidance was sanctioned by a board comprising central bank governors and EU officials. Under the multi-issuance model, licensed providers in the EU are required to hold local reserves in at least one member state while simultaneously managing reserves for identical tokens issued abroad . The ECB, under the leadership of President Christine Lagarde, has been a vocal advocate for the proposed ban, stressing the need for clearer safeguards around the operation of such stablecoins within the European Union. The implications for existing stablecoin companies, such as Paxos and Circle (CRCL) , which are already licensed to operate under the multi-issuance framework, remain uncertain. Growing Concerns Over Financial Stability Both Paxos and Circle primarily operate out of the US, known for its crypto-friendly regulations under President Donald Trump’s vision of transforming America as the “crypto capital of the world”, which has raised concerns among some European regulators. Concerns have been repeatedly voiced by ECB officials regarding the potential risks posed by these dollar-pegged stablecoins to both financial stability and monetary sovereignty in Europe. Lagarde has previously warned that foreign holders of stablecoins may create significant “legal and operational risks” for European Union-based issuers, emphasizing the need for regulatory clarity. Despite this, the European Central Bank does not have direct authority over the implementation of regulations governing digital assets in the EU. The European Commission has yet to adopt an official stance on the matter. Judith Arnal, a board member at the Bank of Spain and an associate senior research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies, highlighted in a recent paper that the ongoing debate over multi-issuance stablecoins poses a more profound challenge to the credibility of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. She cautioned that a regulatory landscape characterized by disputes among the ECB, the Commission, and the European Parliament could send a troubling message internationally, suggesting that MiCA may be fragile and open to varying interpretations. In conjunction with these developments, the ECB has been working since 2021 to establish a central bank digital currency (CBDC) tied to the euro, although it is still waiting for the necessary legal framework to move forward.

Neutral Fear & Greed readings and volatile social sentiment suggest ETH remains range-bound until conviction swings decisively toward optimism or caution. Psychology drives short-term ETH moves Neutral Fear & Greed readings (around 40–50) signal indecision, not immediate reversal. Social dominance spikes and weighted sentiment swings align with range-bound trading and abrupt breakouts. Ethereum sentiment, neutral amid volatility — monitor Fear & Greed and social metrics to time positions. Read the analysis and act with conviction. What is Ethereum sentiment and why does it matter? Ethereum sentiment is the market’s collective mood, measured by indicators like the Fear & Greed Index and social-weighted sentiment. It matters because shifts in sentiment can trigger rapid price moves, often amplifying or reversing trends independent of on-chain fundamentals. How has investor psychology affected Ethereum historically? Past cycles — notably the 2017 ICO frenzy — show that fear of missing out (FOMO) and herd behavior can push ETH far beyond fundamentals, then reverse quickly under regulatory or macro pressure. Historical price spikes and crashes consistently correlate with extreme sentiment readings. Key Takeaways What role does psychology play in Ethereum’s market cycles? Past ETH rallies and crashes—like the 2017 ICO boom—show that fear, greed, and herd behavior can drive price action as much as, if not more than, fundamentals or upgrades. What does today’s sentiment reveal about Ethereum’s direction? With the Fear & Greed Index at a neutral 49 and social sentiment swinging, ETH’s sideways trading reflects indecision. Since its inception, Ethereum’s performance has been shaped not only by fundamentals but also by investor psychology, with market sentiment amplifying both rallies and declines. Historical cycles reveal how fear, greed, and herd behavior can move ETH just as strongly as upgrades or demand shifts. Recent charts emphasize this psychological influence, highlighting neutral fear and greed signals, fluctuating sentiment, and social dominance trends. These dynamics suggest that Ethereum’s price trajectory is often as much about collective belief as it is about underlying technology or adoption. Does psychology trump fundamentals? Ethereum’s meteoric rise during the 2017 ICO boom demonstrates psychology’s dominance in market behavior. The chart shows ETH rallying from under $100 to over $400 in a matter of weeks, reflecting the frenzy surrounding token launches. Source: TradingView Retail investors piled in, driven by the fear of missing out rather than utility or adoption metrics. This rapid climb illustrates how psychological triggers can fuel unsustainable surges. However, once regulatory scrutiny increased and doubt replaced optimism, panic selling intensified the downturn, showing how quickly sentiment can reverse fortunes for Ethereum. Fear, Greed, and Ethereum The Fear and Greed Index was 43 at press time, a perfectly neutral reading that reflected indecision in the market. This midpoint highlights how investors remain cautious despite Ethereum’s recent gains. Neutral sentiment often signals a potential tipping point, where renewed optimism could ignite rallies or lingering doubt could spark pullbacks. The lack of extreme fear or greed provides a stabilizing effect, limiting wild swings in either direction. Traders closely watching this balance may interpret neutrality as an opportunity to reassess positioning rather than chase volatility-driven moves. Ethereum’s sentiment mirrors its sideways trading Ethereum’s Social Dominance and Weighted Sentiment have been swinging sharply — these fluctuations align with ETH’s recent sideways trading pattern. The charts showed how bursts of optimism briefly pushed Ethereum higher, only for equally strong negative waves to cap those gains, leaving the price range-bound. Source: Santiment This tug of war between bullish narratives and bearish caution mirrors the broader indecision in the market. As ETH consolidates without a clear direction, sentiment acts as both a driver and a reflection of uncertainty, reinforcing how psychology sustains the current stalemate. Can psychology dictate Ethereum’s next move? Ethereum’s history and present both highlight that market psychology is as critical as fundamentals in shaping price action. The ICO boom proved euphoria can fuel massive rallies, while today’s sentiment data shows mixed emotions are sustaining ETH’s sideways trade. Neutral fear and greed readings combined with volatile social sentiment point to an undecided crowd. In this environment, Ethereum’s next decisive move will depend on whether conviction shifts toward optimism or caution, making psychology the key force to unlock direction. Frequently Asked Questions How do I read the Fear & Greed Index for Ethereum? Readings near 0–25 indicate extreme fear; 26–49 is fearful to neutral; 50–74 is greed; 75–100 is extreme greed. Use neutrality (40–60) as a sign to reassess risk rather than chase momentum. What social metrics matter for ETH price action? Social Dominance, Weighted Sentiment and mentions volume reveal crowd conviction. Sharp spikes often precede volatile, range-extending moves or short-lived breakouts. Can on-chain metrics override sentiment? Strong on-chain trends (e.g., sustained growth in active addresses or fees) can anchor sentiment, but short-term price moves are frequently sentiment-driven. Key Takeaways Sentiment rules short-term: Psychological swings often amplify or reverse ETH trends. Neutral readings ≠ stability: Midpoint Fear & Greed values reflect indecision and potential for sudden moves. Monitor social metrics: Use Social Dominance and Weighted Sentiment to anticipate breakouts or capitulation. Conclusion Ethereum’s price behavior is a mix of fundamentals and collective psychology.

Leverage-driven risk: Open Interest > $80B creates vulnerability to cascades. Key levels matter: flipping $112,000 into a higher-low and holding above $108,650 signals bull control.

What is causing Bitcoin to risk looping lower? Bitcoin is facing a loop-lower risk because stacked leverage across futures and options leaves thin bid support that can trigger liquidation cascades. CoinGlass data shows $330M+ liquidations in the most recent session, while Open Interest has risen back above $80 billion, maintaining elevated volatility. How does stacked leverage create a leverage trap for Bitcoin? Stacked leverage concentrates stop-loss orders and margin calls around narrow price bands. When a clustered liquidation occurs, it can cascade: forced liquidations push price further, triggering more stops.

CoinGlass reported over $330 million liquidated in the latest session, with 53% from shorts, indicating short squeezes have been recurring. That compares with a $2 billion long squeeze reported earlier last week (plain text reference). This rotation of squeezes keeps both sides vulnerable and amplifies volatility. Bitcoin’s Open Interest climbing back above $80 billion signals larger notional exposure across derivatives markets. With bids thin, even modest directional moves can trigger outsized liquidation events. Source: CoinGlass How can bulls reclaim market control for Bitcoin? Bulls need a clear structural higher-low and absorption of leverage. Technically, flipping $112,000 into a higher-low base and holding above $108,650 on multi-hour closes would give bulls footing to rebuild momentum into Q4. Without those levels holding, the leverage setup increases the chance of a renewed downside loop. What do on-chain and exchange metrics say? Glassnode shows concentrated short exposure around $110k–$111k over the weekend of September 28. Meanwhile, exchange metrics (plain text reference: Binance Long/Short Ratio) sit near 50:50, reflecting indecision and equal pressure on both sides. TradingView price plots show the lower wicks testing $112k during the latest sessions. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Frequently Asked Questions Is a breakdown under $108,650 likely to trigger a large sell-off? A breakdown under $108,650 would increase the probability of cascading liquidations because it sits near proposed higher-low support; with elevated Open Interest, downside momentum could accelerate without a robust bid wall. What should traders watch this week? Watch multi-hour closes around $112,000 and $108,650, monitor Open Interest and liquidation reports from CoinGlass and Glassnode (plain text references), and track exchange Long/Short ratios for shifts in market bias. Key Takeaways Leverage risk: Open Interest > $80B and stacked exposures raise liquidation risk. Critical price levels: Flip $112,000 to a higher-low and defend $108,650 to sustain a bullish thesis. Actionable insight: Use position sizing and stops outside common liquidation clusters; map short clusters near $110k–$111k. Conclusion Bitcoin remains at a pivotal inflection ahead of Q4: stacked leverage and thin bids keep the market vulnerable to looping lower, while a successful flip of $112,000 into a higher-low and holds above $108,650 would give bulls a pathway to rebuild momentum. Monitor derivatives exposure and on-chain liquidation data closely for trade-ready signals. $80B and recent liquidations.

Schwartz, who helped code the XRP ledger, said in a post on X that he wanted to spend more time with his family and return to hobbies he had long set aside. “But be warned, I’m not going away from the XRP community. You haven’t seen the last of me (now, or ever),” he wrote. Although leaving his executive role, Schwartz will remain involved with Ripple. He will take a seat on the company’s board of directors and serve as CTO Emeritus, a position that will allow him to stay connected while pursuing personal projects. As happens in one’s life, I’ve been taking stock of my last 40 years. It’s been a wild ride. I’ve gone from consulting for the NSA to watching the early stages of Bitcoin. Then, I met Arthur, Jed, and Chris and worked on coding the XRP Ledger. Now, I’ve spent more than 13 years… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 30, 2025 Ripple CEO Welcomes Schwartz’s Continued Role On Board He explained that in recent months, he has been running his own XRPL node, publishing data and exploring new use cases for XRP outside Ripple’s core business. He added he looked forward to spending more time coding, talking to developers and experimenting with applications that go beyond payments. “I’ll still be in and out of the Ripple office as CTO Emeritus, and as my last task at Ripple, Chris asked me to join Ripple’s Board of Directors to continue supporting the company’s mission and long-term vision…and I accept,” he said. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised Schwartz in his own post , calling him a “true OG in crypto with the conviction and vision to see what others couldn’t.” He added that their regular check-ins would continue and showed relief that Schwartz would remain close as part of the board. Court Settlement Ends Shadow Of SEC’s $1.3B Lawsuit Schwartz’s departure marks the end of a chapter at Ripple. He worked closely with CEO Brad Garlinghouse during the company’s long legal battle with US regulators. The SEC had sued Ripple in 2020, claiming it raised US$1.3 billion by selling XRP as an unregistered security. That lawsuit weighed heavily on Ripple. It also shaped debate across the digital asset market about how cryptocurrencies should be regulated. After years of hearings and appeals, the case finally ended in Aug. 2025 . A court approved a settlement between Ripple and the SEC, which many viewed as a milestone for the industry. Now, as Schwartz prepares to scale back, Ripple is looking ahead. The company is positioning itself for a post-litigation era with more regulatory clarity. At the same time, his continued role on the board signals that Ripple still values his technical expertise, even as he steps away from daily operations. XRP traded 1.5% lower on Tuesday at $2.84, bringing its losses over the past week to 6.5%.

This guidance expands qualified custody options for client crypto assets while requiring protective procedures. SEC confirms state trust companies can act as crypto custodians when advisers follow specific safeguards. Relief is a limited, staff-level no-action assurance pending formal rule changes to custody requirements. Regulatory debate continues: some policymakers praise the step, while others call for formal rulemaking. state trust companies crypto custody — SEC staff allows advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as crypto custodians; review safeguards and act accordingly. state trust companies as crypto custodians : The SEC’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action assurance saying it will not recommend enforcement action if registered advisers use state trust companies to custody crypto, provided advisers meet due-diligence and safeguards requirements and act in clients’ best interest. What are state trust companies as crypto custodians? State trust companies as crypto custodians are state-chartered entities permitted to hold and safeguard digital asset private keys and related custody infrastructure for registered advisers and regulated funds. The SEC staff’s no-action assurance allows advisers to use these entities if they implement written procedures and perform client-focused due diligence. How can advisers use state trust companies to custody cryptocurrency? Advisers may rely on state trust companies when they determine, after due diligence, that using such an entity is in clients’ best interests. The SEC staff conditionally limited enforcement recommendations to cases where the trust company maintains custody safeguards, the adviser documents oversight, and fund managers meet custody provisions of the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act. The Division’s letter frames this as an “interim step to a longer-term modernization of our custody requirements,” according to Division of Investment Management director Brian Daly. The staff emphasized procedures designed to safeguard crypto and criteria for adviser oversight. Law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett requested assurances from the SEC that state trust companies could custody cryptocurrency assets. Source: SEC Why did the SEC issue this no-action assurance? The staff relief responds to industry requests for clarity about acceptable custodians for crypto assets, reducing uncertainty for registered advisers and regulated funds. It signals an intent to broaden custody options while the SEC considers formal rule changes under its regulatory flex agenda. The current statutory regime requires client assets to be held by qualified custodians. The staff letter indicates proposed rule amendments are forthcoming to modernize custody rules for digital assets. Who supports or opposes the change? Supporters note the guidance provides practical clarity. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said it ends a “guessing game” and could benefit advisory clients and fund shareholders. Market analysts and some industry participants said the move will expand custody capacity and help adoption. Critics, including Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, argued the staff should not make changes through no-action letters and that formal rulemaking with public comment is necessary to preserve statutory protections and fairness among applicants for national charters. Public reaction included comments from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart and observers on social media platforms (formerly Twitter). Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also expressed encouragement, citing state-level actions beginning in 2020.

Yes. The staff indicated coverage extends to client crypto assets held by registered advisers and crypto asset investments of regulated funds that are subject to custody provisions, including tokenized securities. Will this immediately create more custodians? Potentially. By expanding viable custody entities, the assurance may encourage state trust companies to offer custody services. Market participants expect an increase in qualified custodial options over time. Key Takeaways Staff-level relief: The SEC Division of Investment Management will not recommend enforcement action when advisers use state trust companies with proper safeguards. Conditions apply: Advisers must document due diligence, oversight, and that custody choices are in clients’ best interest. Rulemaking likely: The assurance is an interim step while the SEC considers formal custody rule modernization through proposed amendments. Conclusion This staff no-action assurance clarifies that state trust companies can serve as crypto custodians for registered advisers when appropriate safeguards and documented oversight are in place. The move expands custody options now and sets the stage for formal rule updates; advisers should review policies and prepare for forthcoming regulatory changes. Publication date: 2025-10-07.

Stay informed with COINOTAG. What caused the Tron Inc. stock plunge? Tron Inc. stock plunge was driven by a combination of hype-driven valuation inflation, rushed public listings and growing regulatory scrutiny. The Nasdaq-listed company’s shares fell 85% from the June 20 peak, as investors digested execution concerns and investigations tied to suspicious pre-announcement trading across the sector. How have experts and data described the broader crypto treasury sell-off? Research heads and trading founders point to three main factors: Hype cycle deflation: Analysts say early speculative gains often reverse as market participants reprice fundamentals. Poor execution and fast IPOs: Industry participants note firms rushed to market without mature treasury strategies. Regulatory pressure: Ongoing inquiries into pre-announcement trading and market activity have increased risk premia. Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Research, described the pattern as “the hype is deflating.” Czhang Lin, head of LBank Labs, added that “many firms in the space are navigating similar headwinds.” Stephen Gregory, founder of trading platform Vtrader, cited “bad execution” and rushed market entries as drivers of the sell-off. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/tron-inc-stock-plunge"" }, ""headline"": ""Tron Inc. stock plunge: 85% collapse signals crypto treasury hype cooling"", ""description"": ""Tron Inc. stock plunge: 85% decline since June peak reflects cooling crypto treasury hype, execution issues and regulatory scrutiny according to market experts."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": """" } }, ""articleSection"": ""Crypto News"", ""keywords"": ""Tron Inc. stock plunge, crypto treasury companies, TRX price""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess risk in a crypto treasury company after a market drop"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step assessment for investors to evaluate crypto treasury companies following steep share price declines."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review treasury structure"", ""text"": ""Check the composition of on‑balance crypto holdings, lockup terms and diversification across assets."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Verify disclosure quality"", ""text"": ""Assess the clarity and frequency of company disclosures and whether token movements and issuance are fully explained."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor regulatory developments"", ""text"": ""Track investigations, enforcement actions and statements from securities regulators that affect market access and valuation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare peer performance"", ""text"": ""Benchmark against similar treasury companies to separate company-specific execution issues from sector-wide trends."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How big was Tron Inc.'s decline and over what period?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Tron Inc. is down about 85% from its June 20 peak of $12.80, with a 55% drop recorded in September alone."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are other crypto treasury companies experiencing similar losses?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Investors repriced valuations after several corporate listings and token events revealed weak execution and opaque token-handling practices. Market participants tightened expectations following reports of suspicious trading activity ahead of announcements and the rapid public-market entries of multiple crypto treasury firms. Comparative data indicates this is not isolated: MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Bitmine Immersion Technologies showed material share price declines, underscoring a sector-wide reassessment of treasury-linked equities. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the September sell-off for Tron Inc.? Tron Inc. experienced a 55% share price decline in September alone, forming the steep segment of a broader 85% drop since the June peak of $12.80. Did token movements by advisers affect market confidence? Yes. Justin Sun’s reported post-token generation actions—claiming 600 million WLFI tokens and moving 9 million to an exchange—prompted token freezes and harmed confidence, illustrating how token mechanics and advisor actions can influence investor sentiment. Key Takeaways Primary takeaway : Tron Inc. stock plunge reflects cooling hype and operational risks in crypto treasury listings. Regulatory impact : Investigations into pre-announcement trading have increased sector-wide risk premia. Investor action : Review treasury disclosures, token movement transparency and regulatory exposure before allocating to crypto treasury equities. Conclusion Tron Inc.’s 85% decline since June highlights how quickly valuations tied to crypto treasuries can unwind when hype fades, execution is questioned and regulators probe market activity. Investors should prioritize transparency, regulatory risk assessment and peer benchmarking when evaluating crypto treasury companies.

In a recent thread posted on X and a client memo, Hougan argued that Bitcoin’s $2.3 trillion valuation, while surprising to many, is rooted in its competition with the gold market , which is worth more than $25 trillion. Hougan illustrated this point with a simple analogy. “Imagine you had two startups,” he wrote . “One trying to disrupt Amazon and the other trying to disrupt gold. To be worth $2.3 trillion, the Amazon disruptor would need to take 100% of the market. The gold disruptor only needs 10%.” Hougan believes that this helps explain why Bitcoin has grown into one of the largest financial assets on the planet despite lacking the daily-use functionality of companies like Amazon. Instead, Bitcoin’s value rests on its role as digital gold. “Market sizing is everything,” Hougan said. “When you realize Bitcoin is going after gold, suddenly its valuation makes more sense.” Larger markets for Ethereum and Solana On the other hand, Ethereum and Solana are targeting markets that are even larger than gold. These blockchains are the foundations of the issuance, trading, and settlement of stablecoins and tokenized assets, which are all sectors linked to the enormous global payments and capital markets. Estimates from SIFMA and Savills place the combined value of global stocks, bonds, and real estate at $665 trillion. McKinsey, meanwhile, estimates that the global payments industry handles 3.4 trillion transactions worth $1.8 quadrillion each year. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Solana are currently valued at around $500 billion and $100 billion, respectively. Hougan concluded his 13-part thread by pointing out the advantageous position the cryptocurrency industry has to target some of the largest and most important markets in the world. He also highlighted the risks that come with it. Tether , the world’s leading stablecoin issuer, now counts more than 400 million users worldwide, growing by about 35 million wallets per quarter, according to its CEO, Paolo Ardoino. The company holds over $127 billion in U.S. Treasurys, placing it among the top 20 holders globally, alongside sovereign nations like Saudi Arabia and Germany. Hougan stated that Tether’s dominance in non-Western markets positions it for potentially historic profitability. If adoption in emerging markets accelerates and USDT manages trillions in assets, Tether’s annual profits could surpass those of Saudi Aramco, which reported $120 billion in 2024. With just under 200 employees, Tether generated around $13 billion in profit last year. “This is why Tether is seeking a $500 billion valuation,” Hougan said. “It may sound absurd compared to companies like SpaceX or OpenAI, but the market it’s targeting is unimaginably large.” Hougan admitted that a majority of projects will fail, and he even predicted more billion-dollar collapses in crypto than in any other industry. Yet those failures, he argued, will be outweighed by projects that become bigger than anything seen in traditional tech.

His latest chart highlights similarities between the 2017 breakout, the 2024 breakout, and the current cycle, suggesting the possibility of a major move if history repeats. $XRP : $8 > $15 > $27 Potential pic.twitter.com/A6qo10E8xd — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) September 28, 2025 Examining the Chart Setup The chart compares two multi-year consolidation patterns. The first symmetrical triangle structure , which was resolved in 2017, produced a surge that met Fibonacci extension targets quickly and sent the asset to its previous all-time high. The second symmetrical triangle, unfolding over several years since 2018, broke upward in late 2024, sending XRP up by over 500%. One of the key elements ChartNerd highlighted is the similarity in structure between the past and present cycles. In both cases, XRP consolidated within a tightening formation before breaking out with strength. The analyst uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to track market conditions, pointing out that the 2017 move reached extreme levels above 95. He anticipates a comparable situation may occur again in this cycle, predicting that XRP will create a bearish divergence on the monthly chart before targeting a new peak. XRP’s Price Targets After repeating that explosive surge, ChartNerd believes the digital asset is forming a similar formation, but on a compressed timeline. The asset began forming this new symmetrical triangle after its peak of $3.39 in January, and the asset’s all-time high of $3.65 in July briefly pushed above the upper trendline, suggesting that the asset is building toward a breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The outlined Fibonacci targets place the first level near $8.5 (Fib. 1.272), followed by $13.76 (Fib. 1.414), and extending up to $27.49 (Fib. 1.618). These figures represent levels where traders may expect resistance or a potential slowdown in momentum. For ChartNerd, the levels are not arbitrary but consistent with past performance, where XRP also met key Fibonacci markers during its last major bull cycle. If XRP were to advance toward these projected price levels, it would reaffirm the asset’s relevance in the digital asset sector. A move beyond $8 would signal renewed market strength, while progress toward $15 and $27 would likely draw new participants and validate long-term holders who have remained through extended consolidation. XRP is currently trading at $2.90, attempting to surpass the $3 level. A decisive break above this resistance and above the triangle’s upper trendline would be the first step toward reaching ChartNerd’s targets.

Institutions poured $291M into Solana last week, second-highest weekly inflow on record. Whales continue profit-taking on rallies; single trades exceeded $31M and significant sales by large funds occurred. Key technical support sits near $200; reclaiming $215–$220 is necessary to reduce downside risk to $190.

Solana institutional inflows surged to $291 million last week due to renewed institutional demand for alternative layer-1 exposure. Fund-level allocations and treasury purchases drove the bulk of inflows, even as some large holders realized profits during price upticks. How are whale sales affecting Solana price momentum? Whales continue to sell into strength: a single on-chain transfer on 29 September moved roughly $31.59 million in SOL to likely exit points. Large fund sales, including a 160.54K SOL block sold by a major asset manager (plain text reference: Grayscale), increase short-term supply during rallies. Source: X Why do institutional inflows matter for SOL now? Institutions provide sustained buy pressure that can offset episodic whale selling. With $291M in inflows—reported as the week’s largest among major crypto assets—Solana has attracted concentrated institutional interest despite broader market outflows. What does comparative flow data show? According to institutional flow trackers (plain text reference: CoinShares report), Bitcoin saw $719M in outflows and Ethereum $409M last week, while Solana pulled in $291M. That divergence highlights selective allocation shifts by institutional investors toward Solana. Source: CoinShares What technical levels should traders watch on SOL? Immediate support remains around $200, backed by recent volume. The $215–$220 zone is the critical reclaim area; failure to break and hold above it increases the probability of a deeper retracement toward $190, the next major volume-backed support. How to trade the inflows-versus-whales setup? Use the following checklist: Confirm inflows: Weekly institutional flow above recent averages signals structural demand. Watch for clustered whale sales: Multiple large transfers on rallies often precede short-term consolidations. Trade key levels: Consider bullish bias above $215–$220; tighten risk if price breaches $200 with rising sell volume. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are institutional inflows enough to sustain Solana's rally?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Large weekly inflows of $291M materially support Solana's rally, but sustained price strength requires reclaiming the $215–$220 range to reduce downside risk toward $190."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do whale sales impact short-term SOL price moves?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Whale sales frequently cap short-term rallies by increasing immediate supply; monitoring large transfers helps time entries and exits around resistance points."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What on-chain and market metrics should investors monitor?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Track weekly institutional flow reports, large wallet transfers, on-chain exchange inflows, and technical indicators (RSI, MACD) around $200 and $215–$220 levels."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How big were last week’s Solana inflows compared to other assets? Solana recorded $291 million in inflows last week, the largest inflow among major crypto assets for that period, while Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced outflows of $719 million and $409 million respectively (plain text reference: CoinShares). Is whale selling a long-term threat to SOL? Whale selling pressures can trigger short-term pullbacks but are not necessarily indicative of long-term trend reversal when institutional demand remains strong and technical supports hold. Key Takeaways Institutional demand: $291M inflows underscore strong institutional interest in Solana. Whale activity: Large sell-offs continue on rallies, creating short-term volatility. Technical roadmap: Reclaim $215–$220 to reduce downside odds; $190 is the next major support if $200 fails. Conclusion Solana institutional inflows of $291M present a meaningful tailwind that helps counter episodic whale selling, but market participants should watch the $215–$220 reclaim zone and $200 support to assess whether momentum can extend. Expect volatility as flows and large-wallet behavior interact; monitor on-chain data and institutional reports for updates.",News|BTC|ETH|FLOW|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 03:34:04

This points to measured accumulation rather than a market top. Binance sender-to-receiver ratio hit a 1-month MA low — sign of accumulation Only 24% of Binance-listed altcoins are above the 200‑day SMA, suggesting bargain conditions Long-term holders sold into strength but BTC held near $110K, showing market resilience Bitcoin accumulation signals: Binance sender-to-receiver ratio low and altcoins at bargain levels — read analysis and key takeaways from COINOTAG. Is Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation? Bitcoin accumulation appears underway: Binance’s sender-to-receiver ratio recently dropped to its lowest level since early 2024, and BTC remained stable near $110K despite long-term holder profit-taking. These on-chain signals suggest more HODL behavior and a reduced supply of active sellers. What does a falling sender-to-receiver ratio mean? The sender-to-receiver ratio measures addresses sending BTC versus those receiving it. A sustained decline — especially a 1‑month moving average low — typically means fewer wallets are selling and more are holding, which is a classic accumulation indicator. Source: Cryptoquant Source: Cryptoquant How did the market behave through the month? September saw long-term holders (LTHs) take partial profits as BTC swung from roughly $117K to $108K. Despite these movements, the price remained anchored near $110K, indicating the market absorbed selling without broad capitulation. Which holder cohorts were most active? Activity concentrated in coins held between 6 months and 5 years. The 7–10 year cohort showed limited movement. That pattern — older coins moving while prices stay firm — often signals selective profit-taking rather than panic selling. Source: Cryptoquant Are altcoins in a buy zone? Yes — altcoins appear undervalued relative to historical accumulation phases. Only 24% of Binance-listed altcoins trade above their 200‑day SMA, a level historically associated with early accumulation opportunities. What does the 200-day SMA tell us now? The low fraction of altcoins above their 200‑day SMA suggests broader weakness in speculative tokens while BTC shows relative strength. Historically, such divergence precedes selective altcoin rallies once macro liquidity or sentiment improves. Source: X Frequently Asked Questions How reliable is the sender-to-receiver ratio as an accumulation signal? The sender-to-receiver ratio is a reliable short-to-midterm gauge of selling pressure versus accumulation. Sustained declines in the 1‑month MA historically align with accumulation phases, but it should be used with other on-chain metrics for confirmation. Should traders buy altcoins now? With only 24% of Binance-listed alts above the 200‑day SMA, conditions appear favorable for selective accumulation. Risk management and project-level due diligence remain essential; broad buying without filters is not advised. What timeframe should investors watch for confirmation? Watch weekly on-chain trends and moving averages (50/200 SMA) plus volume. Confirmation often requires several weeks of consistent metrics — not a single-day move. Key Takeaways Accumulation signal : Binance sender-to-receiver ratio at a multi-month low signals more HODL behavior. Altcoins cheap : Only 24% of Binance-listed alts above 200‑day SMA — potential selective buying opportunity. Market resilience : BTC held near $110K despite LTH profit-taking, suggesting selling was absorbed. Conclusion On-chain metrics point to a measured accumulation phase: Bitcoin shows strengthening HODLer behavior while altcoins remain in a bargain bin. Monitor sender-to-receiver trends and the 200‑day SMA for altcoins for clearer timing. COINOTAG will continue tracking these signals and on-chain data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin shows accumulation as Binance sender-to-receiver ratio falls; altcoins trade below 200-day SMA"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0rwki_b99fc00fcc472ff8806dc1addde0d9214b3f5d46ae90ed7d463730395efe95a0.webp.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-30T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/news/bitcoin-accumulation-binance-data"" }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin accumulation evident as Binance sender-to-receiver ratio drops and only 24% of Binance-listed altcoins trade above the 200-day SMA.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bitcoin showing signs of accumulation?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Pavel Durov bought thousands of BTC in 2013 at about $700 per coin. He used Bitcoin proceeds to fund personal expenses while Telegram operated at a loss. Toncoin peaked at $8.25 in mid-2024 and has since fallen ~67% from that high. Primary keyword: Pavel Durov Bitcoin — Read how Durov used early Bitcoin holdings to fund Telegram-era costs. Learn TON and Toncoin context. Read now. 2025-10-01 2025-10-01 COINOTAG What is Pavel Durov’s Bitcoin holding and how has he used it? Pavel Durov Bitcoin holdings date to 2013, when he purchased several thousand BTC at roughly $700 each. Durov says those early investments financed personal costs — including real estate and private travel — while Telegram remained a money-losing operation for him personally. He described buying at a “local maximum” near $700 per BTC and investing “a couple of million” at the time. Durov has repeatedly framed Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant store of value and has said he is unwilling to sell. How many Bitcoin did Durov buy and at what price? Durov stated on the Lex Fridman podcast that he acquired his first “few thousand Bitcoin” in 2013 at about $700 per coin and invested “a couple of million.” When BTC later dropped below $200 in the following bear market, he said critics ridiculed him but he held firm. Pavel Durov talks Bitcoin to Lex Friedman. Source: YouTube Why does Durov say Bitcoin helps him “stay afloat”? Durov explained that Telegram often operates at a loss and that Bitcoin provided a personal financial buffer. He argued Bitcoin’s fixed supply and predictable issuance make it an attractive long-term reserve compared with fiat currencies that can be rapidly expanded by governments. Expert context: The comments were made publicly on the Lex Fridman podcast and recorded on YouTube, where Durov emphasized Bitcoin’s resistance to confiscation and political censorship. What is the status of TON and Toncoin compared with Bitcoin? Telegram’s blockchain initiative, originally developed as the Telegram Open Network (TON), was designed for scalability using shardchains to support hundreds of millions of users. Regulatory issues prevented a full Telegram-led launch, but the network lives on as The Open Network and is used for NFTs and other on-chain activity. Toncoin price context Metric Value Toncoin all-time high (mid-2024) $8.25 Drop since ATH ~67% Approximate current price (implied) ~$2.72 Frequently Asked Questions Did Pavel Durov say he would never sell his Bitcoin? Durov said he was not going to sell and that he sees Bitcoin as the way money should work, highlighting censorship resistance and predictable supply. His statement was made on the Lex Fridman podcast and repeated in subsequent interviews. How did Telegram’s TON project evolve after regulatory hurdles? TON was rebranded as The Open Network and continued without direct Telegram control. It retained scalability features like shardchains and has become notable for NFT activity, despite regulatory restrictions that prevented an initial Telegram-hosted launch. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Pavel Durov Bitcoin: How early BTC holdings funded his lifestyle"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999dd8-91f5-763d-93ec-9376d8f8a123.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/pavel-durov-bitcoin-2025"" }, ""description"": ""Pavel Durov bought thousands of Bitcoin in 2013 and says those holdings helped fund his lifestyle while Telegram operated at a loss.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many Bitcoin did Pavel Durov buy in 2013?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Durov said he purchased his first few thousand Bitcoin in 2013 at about $700 per coin, investing what he described as 'a couple of million' at the time."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Why does Durov say Bitcoin allowed him to stay afloat?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Durov said Bitcoin provided a personal reserve to cover expenses while Telegram was a money-losing operation; he highlighted Bitcoin's fixed supply and resistance to confiscation."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to verify claims about public crypto holdings"", ""description"": ""Steps to corroborate public statements about cryptocurrency holdings using public interviews, on-chain data and trusted reporting."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check the original interview"", ""text"": ""Locate the recorded interview or podcast episode (for example, the Lex Fridman podcast) and note the direct quotes and timestamps."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Cross-check public statements"", ""text"": ""Compare the interview text with contemporaneous reporting and official statements from the person or organization named."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review on-chain indicators"", ""text"": ""When relevant, examine on-chain transaction history and public wallet activity for corroborating evidence, keeping in mind privacy and attribution limits."" } ]} Key Takeaways Early investment: Durov bought thousands of Bitcoin in 2013 at ~ $700 per BTC.

52502971,593166,1759291205,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum ETFs See Record Inflows as ETH Breaks $4,000: Is a Bigger Rally Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-see-record-inflows-as-eth-breaks-4000/,"Ethereum’s rebound accelerated after U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded $547 million in net single-day inflows, ending a five-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s FETH led with $202 million, while BlackRock’s ETHA contributed $154 million. ETH ETFs now oversee about $27.5 billion, around 5.4% of the circulating market cap, indicating renewed institutional interest as the price regained the $4,000 psychological level. The turnaround coincided with over $1 billion in combined inflows into U.S. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, boosting risk appetite across major assets. Smart Money Accumulates Ethereum (ETH) as Reserves Fall On the balance-sheet front, institutions continue increasing their exposure. BitMine Immersion Technologies disclosed a 2.65 million ETH corporate treasury, the largest tracked among its peers, while Bit Digital plans a $100 million convertible note raise to acquire more ETH, potentially boosting its treasury rankings. On-chain, CryptoQuant data indicate declining exchange reserves, consistent with coins being moved into custody and staking, conditions that historically tighten the circulating supply when demand rises. Technically, analysts note ETH has rallied approximately 250% from cycle lows; some, like Ted Pillows, suggest a brief pullback could set the stage for a move towards $4,500–$5,000, with $10,000 possible later if liquidity and macro tailwinds align. In the near term, sustaining closes above $4,200–$4,250 would keep bulls in control; failure to do so risks a decline towards the $3,800–$3,600 support level. TradFi Integrations Strengthen the Fundamental Case Beyond flows and treasuries, real-world rails are advancing. SWIFT has tested Ethereum’s Linea Layer-2 with BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon for on-chain settlement messaging, while a broader SWIFT–Consensys project explores a blockchain-based ledger for 24/7 cross-border payments. If even a small part of SWIFT volume moves on-chain, it could become a steady demand driver for block space and ETH staking. Alongside improving regulatory clarity and ETF adoption, these integrations strengthen Ethereum’s position as a neutral financial infrastructure for institutions, supporting the AI/data economy narrative highlighted by corporate buyers. Bottom Line Record ETF inflows, decreasing exchange supply, and rising TradFi pilots support a breakout above $ 4,000. Stay above $4,200, and the path opens towards $4,500–$5,000; lose that, and a healthy retest into the high $3,000s is likely to occur before the next move. For now, the evidence leans bullish.

According to blockchain trackers, the address sent its coins in multiple transactions, mostly split into batches of 15 BTC. The total value moved is roughly $44 million, based on current prices. Related Reading: Eric Trump Steps Into Market Talk, Says ‘Buy The Dips’ Wallet Linked To Early Mining Reports have disclosed that the coins trace back to mining activity from nearly 15 years ago. Lookonchain tied the funds to the early days of Bitcoin, and records show the wallet last moved coins in 2013, when Bitcoin traded near $135 per unit. That price then compared with today’s level — around $111,763 per BTC — means the holding rose by about 830 times in value since it went quiet. A dormant wallet woke up after 12 years, moving 400.08 $BTC($44.29M) to multiple new wallets 3 hours ago. The 400.08 $BTC was received from miners 15 years ago.https://t.co/aem7WhbkOu pic.twitter.com/3m4XSBNXFO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 29, 2025 Arkham Intelligence spotted the distribution pattern, noting the repeated 15 BTC transfers that drained the address. Even with full visibility of every transaction on the blockchain, the owner’s identity remains unknown. The pattern — chopping large sums into smaller, repeated amounts — is a common way wallets move coins without dumping everything on a single exchange at once. Part Of A Wave Of Old Addresses Becoming Active This activation comes amid a string of moves from so-called Satoshi-era wallets. Based on reports, institutional and private holdings tied to early investors have been on the move lately. In July, Galaxy Digital sold more than 80,000 BTC linked to an estate, a sale that markets valued at close to $10 billion. Another dormant address holding 444 BTC became active in September 2025 and moved approximately $50 million. Recently, one of the big holders is said to have cycled more than $5 billion of Bitcoin into Ethereum, locking up close to $4 billion worth of ETH afterward. Market Signals Remain Mixed October has traditionally been a good month for Bitcoin, with previous rallies of 40–45% in certain years, but the current signs indicate less conviction. Holder retention level has dropped to 80%, and on-chain derivatives flows and whale outflows suggest weaker demand. Bitcoin was trading near $114,000 at one point today, with a one-day gain of 2.05% reported, but analysts are watching risk levels closely. A continued selloff could push price toward $107,000; renewed buying pressure could take it back up toward $119,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data What This Means Going Forward Movements from Satoshi-era addresses carry symbolic weight, because they come from the group that held Bitcoin when it was still experimental and very cheap. Whether this 400 BTC transfer will spark wider selling or simply mark a reallocation remains to be seen. For now, the market has a clear record of the move, but the reason behind it — estate settlement, profit-taking, or internal reshuffling — is unknown.

It gives protocols and researchers clear procedures and legal protections to stop live exploits. 29 firms recognized for adopting SEAL Safe Harbor in 2025 Safe Harbor requires recovered funds returned within 72 hours; bounty set at 10% (max $1M). SEAL reports volunteers and platforms have helped protect billions; Immunefi cites >$25B in customer funds safeguarded. SEAL Safe Harbor: 29 firms adopt the Safe Harbor Agreement to protect user funds during live exploits — read nominees, rules, and how to support or vote now. What is SEAL’s Safe Harbor Agreement? SEAL Safe Harbor is a formalized ethical-hacking framework that defines legal and operational steps for white hat interventions during active crypto exploits. It instructs protocols and researchers how to coordinate, requires quick return of funds, and sets a standard bounty to encourage timely, lawful defense of user assets. How does the Safe Harbor framework protect white hat hackers? Safe Harbor reduces legal uncertainty by predefining consent, verification, and post-recovery steps. Protocols that adopt the agreement publish recovery addresses and on-chain policies; white hats follow onboarding checks (KYC, OFAC) and return funds within 72 hours to qualify for rewards. This protection lowers hesitation and increases coordinated responses. SEAL recognizes 29 companies — who joined and why? SEAL announced its first Safe Harbor Champions 2025 list recognizing 29 organizations as either “adopters” or “advocates.” Nominees include major DeFi platforms, security vendors, venture firms, and legal partners. The program signals a shift from fragmented defense to a coordinated industry standard aimed at preserving customer assets. Nominees for SEAL’s Safe Harbor award are split into “adopters” and “advocates.” Source: Cointelegraph Why does Safe Harbor matter for crypto security? Safe Harbor creates predictable incentives and legal guardrails, making ethical intervention more likely and reducing exploit profits. Industry adopters report measurable benefits: security platforms say adoption helped many researchers reach significant earnings from bug bounties while protecting billions in customer funds. Which notable white hat actions illustrate the framework’s value? Volunteer SEAL hackers and other good-faith actors have a track record of stopping large losses: a MEV-based interception recovered $2.6M from the Morpho App, another return delivered $5.4M to Curve users, and coordinated responses limited fallout from a JavaScript supply-chain event to under $50 in the first 24 hours. Plain text citation: a public tweet of thanks from banteg referenced c0ffeebabe.eth’s work in July 2023 — note presented as plain text, not an external link. How do protocols adopt the Safe Harbor framework? Protocols join SEAL’s onboarding waitlist and, if approved, receive a compliance guide. Adoption steps typically include publishing recovery addresses across supported chains, integrating the Safe Harbor language into user terms, and preparing internal processes for verification and payout. Source: Security Alliance Frequently Asked Questions How long do white hats have to return funds under Safe Harbor? Under the Safe Harbor rules, recovered funds must be returned within 72 hours to qualify for the standard bounty and legal protections, with verification and KYC/OFAC checks required before payout. Who oversees payouts and legal protections for white hats? Verification is handled by the adopting protocol and SEAL-aligned processes; payouts occur only after verification. The Security Research Legal Defense Fund (SRLDF) can provide legal-defense funding for good-faith researchers if needed. Key Takeaways Standardized legal protection : Safe Harbor reduces legal risk for white hats during live interventions.

Key catalysts cited are strong investor sentiment and potential regulatory clarity that could unlock fresh capital. Short-term dip but longer-term upside: ADA down 4% weekly, yet analysts target $2+ by Dec 2025. Community sentiment remains predominantly bullish, with surveys reporting 88% positive outlook. Regulatory clarity and on-chain upgrades are cited as main drivers; some models project $7–$10 in optimistic scenarios. Cardano ADA price: Analysts forecast a rebound to $2 by Dec 2025 amid bullish community sentiment and regulatory hopes — read the outlook and investor actions. What is the current Cardano ADA price outlook? The Cardano ADA price outlook shows near-term weakness but potential recovery: ADA has lost roughly 4% over the past 24 hours and similar on weekly and monthly frames, yet analysts expect a rebound to around $2 by December 2025 driven by renewed investor confidence and possible regulatory developments. How are experts and the community predicting ADA’s future? Cardano developer commentary and community polls point to elevated bullishness. A prominent developer, known as Phil, expressed optimism that ADA will outperform expectations as the market cycle matures. Independent commentators and models provide a range of targets—conservative forecasts near $2 and optimistic models up to $7–$10—reflecting varied assumptions about liquidity and adoption. Why do some models predict $2 to $10 for ADA? Forecast divergence stems from differing inputs: token supply, market-cap comparisons, and macro/regulatory scenarios. A $2 target implies roughly a 152% rise from a $0.79 price reference and would place ADA near a $71.6 billion market cap under current circulating supply assumptions. AI-driven models and stake pool operator projections that reach $7–$10 assume faster adoption, higher on-chain activity, or substantial inflows from institutional channels. What are the main bullish catalysts for ADA? Key catalysts include: regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, continued protocol development and upgrades, and elevated investor sentiment. Public commentary from ecosystem figures and references to legislative proposals (for example, discussions around digital-asset regulation in the U.S. Senate) are cited as potential triggers for renewed capital inflows. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Cardano ADA price outlook: Analysts eye $2 by Dec 2025 amid strong community bullishness"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""description"": ""Cardano ADA price faces short-term losses but analysts and community forecasts point to a potential rebound to $2 by December 2025 as regulatory clarity and investor sentiment improve.""} How strong is investor sentiment for Cardano? Investor sentiment appears robust: a community poll referenced by market data providers reports about 88% bullish sentiment for ADA and 12% bearish. High positive sentiment can support stronger price rallies when macro conditions and liquidity align. When could regulatory clarity affect ADA? Regulatory milestones could influence timing: if major jurisdictions enact clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutional capital may re-enter markets more confidently. Discussions in the U.S. Senate and public statements by project founders are often cited as timeline signals, but passage and implementation timelines remain uncertain. Frequently Asked Questions Can Cardano ADA reach $2 by December 2025? Yes, several analysts and community forecasts place a realistic target near $2 by December 2025, assuming steady adoption, favorable market conditions, and improved regulatory clarity. This assumes a sustained recovery from current levels and renewed liquidity inflows. What would a $2 ADA mean for market capitalization? At $2 per ADA, market capitalization would approach an estimated $71.6 billion given current circulating supply assumptions, reflecting substantial inflows compared with present valuations. What risks could prevent ADA from reaching these targets? Principal risks include broader crypto market weakness, delayed or adverse regulation, slower-than-expected on-chain adoption, and systemic liquidity shocks that suppress asset prices despite positive community sentiment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can Cardano ADA reach $2 by December 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Several analysts and community forecasts consider $2 achievable by December 2025 given improving sentiment and potential regulatory clarity, but outcomes depend on market-wide liquidity and adoption."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the main catalysts for ADA’s price rise?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Key catalysts include regulatory clarity, protocol upgrades, increased on-chain activity, and strong community/investor sentiment that can attract fresh capital."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the primary risks to ADA’s outlook?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Risks include negative regulatory outcomes, sustained market-wide sell-offs, slower adoption, and macroeconomic shocks that reduce liquidity and investor risk appetite."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess Cardano ADA price outlook"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review on-chain metrics"", ""text"": ""Check transaction volume, active addresses and staking participation to gauge adoption strength."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor regulatory developments"", ""text"": ""Track legislative milestones and official statements that could affect institutional inflows and legal clarity."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess sentiment and model scenarios"", ""text"": ""Use community surveys, analyst models and conservative/optimistic scenarios to estimate price ranges and timing."" } ]} Key Takeaways Short-term: ADA has seen a recent 24-hour and weekly decline (~4%), reflecting market volatility. Analyst targets: Forecasts vary—common conservative target ~$2 by Dec 2025; optimistic scenarios reach $7–$10. Action: Monitor regulatory signals, on-chain metrics, and liquidity conditions before adjusting exposure. Conclusion Cardano ADA price faces immediate downside pressure but retains upside potential if regulatory clarity and on-chain growth materialize. Investors should prioritize data-driven monitoring—on-chain metrics, sentiment indicators and legislative developments—before making allocation decisions.

Despite the slight pullback, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is holding firm above key support levels, while fresh debates, bold predictions, and state-level interest keep momentum alive. Debate Over Bitcoin’s Future Use Cases The Bitcoin community is split ahead of the expected release of Bitcoin Core v30 . It would remove the long-standing 80-byte OP_RETURN data limit. Ultimately, this change would allow larger non-financial data storage directly on-chain. However, it’s raising questions about BTC’s purpose. Critics argue that this move contradicts Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer currency. Whereas, advocates see new opportunities for applications built on top of BTC’s base layer. Medium : Bitcoin Core v30 Is About to Change the Network Forever The newly released RC2 candidate of Bitcoin Core v30 proposes the removal of the 80-byte cap on OP_RETURN, allowing up to ~4MB of data to be embedded in each transaction output.

While purists warn of business interests pushing for more storage, developers and miners see potential revenue streams and new use cases. It’s another reminder that Bitcoin’s identity continues to expand, blending currency with broader digital utility. Draper and States Fuel Adoption Hopes And billionaire investor Tim Draper says retailers will eventually only accept Bitcoin. While most institutions, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc., view BTC as a long-term store of value, Draper says that when major retailers accept Bitcoin, it will trigger organic spending. He’s put his money where his mouth is with investments in Coinbase and Robinhood, both key players in the crypto infrastructure.

The bill faces hurdles in a Democrat-controlled legislature, but it’s a sign of growing recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset at the state level, following Texas and New Hampshire. Draper predicts future retail adoption of BTC. Massachusetts considers a state Bitcoin reserve. Institutional confidence continues to expand. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Uptober Rally in Focus On the charts, Bitcoin is consolidating near $114,154 after last week’s sharp breakout from a descending channel that defined September’s pullback. Price is now resting just below resistance at $114,741, with the 100-period SMA at $112,808 serving as a strong support floor. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has cooled to 60 from overbought levels near 80. It signals a healthy reset that preserves the bullish structure. Recent short-bodied candlesticks suggest indecision, but the pattern resembles an ascending triangle, a common continuation setup after strong rallies. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin defends its higher lows, a breakout above $114,741 could propel the price toward $116,150 and the September peak of $117,850, with a run at $120,000 possible if momentum holds. A breakdown below $113,000, however, would expose $112,600 and the 50-period SMA at $111,680. For market participants, long positions remain favorable on a confirmed breakout above $114,700, targeting $116,150 and $117,850, with stops placed just under $112,600. With seasonal “Uptober” optimism aligning with these technical signals, Bitcoin may not only push higher but also spark broader rallies across Ethereum, XRP, and Solana.

House Republicans say they are working with the SEC’s Office of Inspector General after the OIG reported that an automated SEC IT policy wiped former Chair Gary Gensler’s government phone, deleting key text messages tied to crypto enforcement actions. What happened to Gary Gensler’s deleted text messages? Gary Gensler deleted texts were removed when an automated SEC IT policy triggered a full wipe of his government-issued mobile device, deleting messages between October 2022 and September 2023, the SEC Office of Inspector General reported. The loss has prompted congressional oversight and demands for more transparency. How are House Republicans responding to the OIG findings? House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill, joined by Ranking Members Ann Wagner, Dan Meuser, and Bryan Steil, wrote to SEC Chair Paul Atkins seeking details and follow-up. The committee said it is engaging with the OIG to review the report, clarify outstanding questions, and identify additional areas requiring oversight and investigation. The Hill-led letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. Source: US House Committee on Financial Services Why do Republicans call this a double standard? The committee’s letter points to a perceived inconsistency: the SEC sued firms for record-keeping failures while apparently failing to preserve the agency’s own records. In 2023 the SEC collected more than $400 million in fines from firms over record-keeping issues, according to public filings and committee statements. What did the OIG say caused the deletions? The OIG attributed the loss to an automated, poorly understood IT policy that performed a full device wipe. Contributing factors included weak change management, lack of backup devices, missed system alerts, and unresolved vendor software flaws. These failures exposed gaps in the SEC’s internal controls and records preservation practices. When were potentially relevant enforcement conversations lost? OIG investigators found that some deleted communications related to enforcement actions against crypto companies and founders. That means exchanges of text messages that could clarify timing and decision-making on high-profile crypto cases may no longer be available for review. What additional SEC security incident is relevant? The SEC experienced a separate security lapse in January 2024 when its social account was compromised and used to post false news about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Public reporting attributed that breach in part to the SEC not using two-factor authentication at the time, underscoring broader cybersecurity and controls concerns at the agency. Frequently Asked Questions Did the SEC intentionally delete Gary Gensler’s texts? The OIG found no evidence the wipe was intentional to hide records; it identified an automated IT policy and systemic failures. House Republicans, however, say the outcome nonetheless raises transparency and accountability questions. Will missing texts affect ongoing enforcement reviews? Missing messages could limit the record available to oversight bodies and investigators, particularly for cases dated Oct 2022–Sept 2023. Congress and the OIG are evaluating next steps to determine impact on specific enforcement matters. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/sec-gensler-deleted-texts-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""House Republicans Probe Gary Gensler's Deleted SEC Text Messages"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999df4-489b-73af-a6fa-6ceafbb643c2.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""House Republicans pressed the SEC after an OIG report found an automated SEC IT wipe deleted Gary Gensler's government phone texts from Oct 2022–Sept 2023, raising transparency concerns over crypto enforcement.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What did the SEC Office of Inspector General find about the deleted texts?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The OIG found an automated SEC IT policy triggered a full device wipe that deleted messages from October 2022 through September 2023; poor change management, missing backups, ignored alerts, and vendor software issues contributed."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are House Republicans investigating the OIG report?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Binance co‑founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao issued a direct warning: do not click on any links recently posted from this account. How was the compromise detected and what did the fraudulent post claim? Security monitoring and community reports flagged a post that invited users to vote on an “upcoming $BSC rewards date” and promised early rewards for early participants.

First, do not click any remaining links from the compromised post.

52504878,593744,1759294830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52504878.jpeg,Circle And Deutsche Börse Partner To Boost Stablecoin Adoption In Europe,https://bitcoinist.com/circle-deutsche-borse-partner-stablecoin-europe/,"Global stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group and German multinational corporation Deutsche Börse Group have unveiled their collaboration to expand stablecoin adoption in Europe. Circle Partners With Deutsche Börse For Stablecoin Expansion On Tuesday, Circle and Deutsche Börse Group announced they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to integrate the global issuer’s euro and dollar stablecoins, EURC and USDC, within the international exchange organization’s financial market infrastructure. According to the joint statement, the collaboration aims to bring “new solutions” for market participants in Europe by connecting token-based payment networks with traditional financial market infrastructure. It also seeks to advance the regulated adoption of stablecoins in European markets. Circle and Deutsche Börse plan to initially focus on listing and trading stablecoins on the German corporation’s digital exchange 3DX and institutional provider Crypto Finance. Moreover, the partnership is set to enable institutional-grade digital asset custody via Deutsche Börse’s post-trade business, Clearstream, leveraging the German entity of Crypto Finance as sub-custodian. Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, affirmed that the collaboration will “advance the use of regulated stablecoins across Europe’s market infrastructure—reducing settlement risk, lowering costs, and improving efficiency for banks, asset managers, and the wider market.” “As clear rules take hold across Europe, aligning our regulated stablecoins, EURC and USDC, with trusted venues will unlock new products and streamline workflows across trading, settlement, and custody,” he added. The partnership follows the recent initiative by nine major European banks to deploy a MiCAR-compliant stablecoin next year. As reported by Bitcoinist, Italian banking giant UniCredit, alongside ING, Banca Sella, KBC, Danske Bank, DekaBank, SEB, CaixaBank, and Raiffeisen Bank International, have formed a consortium to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin to “fill the need for a trusted, regulated solution for on-chain payments and settlement.” EU Regulatory Landscape Faces Stablecoin Challenge As the announcement noted, the initiative is enabled by the European Union’s (EU) Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCAR), the bloc’s comprehensive framework for cryptocurrencies, which covers areas such as the issuance and custody of digital assets. Circle also highlighted its status as the first major global issuer to achieve compliance with MiCAR. Nonetheless, recent reports affirmed that the European Central Bank (ECB) is pushing for stricter regulations, which could impact how issuers like Circle and Paxos operate across borders. As Bloomberg alleged on Tuesday, the ECB is calling for a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins in the bloc and other jurisdictions. According to the report, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) recently passed a recommendation to ban jointly issued stablecoins, people familiar with the discussions told the news media outlet. Recently, Judith Arnal, an associate senior research fellow at the Centre for European Credit Research Institute (ECRI) and board member at the Bank of Spain, discussed the issue in an in-depth analysis for ECRI, affirming that multi-issuance stablecoins would be MiCA’s first “real credibility test”: At the heart of this controversy lies a fundamental tension between regulatory ambition and market reality. The European Central Bank (ECB), backed by key members of the European Parliament (EP), argues that multi-issuance structures could undermine the prudential safeguards that MiCA was designed to establish, potentially exposing European holders to risks from third-country issuers and weakening EU monetary sovereignty. The European Commission, meanwhile, has sought to resolve the matter through internal administrative procedures, avoiding the political debate that the ECB and EP believe is necessary. Despite being supported by a high-powered board of central bank governors and EU officials , the guidance is not legally binding, noted Bloomberg. However, it will reportedly pressure EU authorities to “implement the restrictions or explain how financial stability can be preserved in their absence.” Arnal considers that “this institutional standoff has created regulatory paralysis with far-reaching consequences,” which risks “undermining MiCA’s credibility as a coherent and globally influential regulatory framework – just as other jurisdictions, notably the US, are establishing clear and competitive alternatives.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Circle|deutsche boerse|EU regulations|EURC|European Central Bank|jeremy Allaire|MiCA regulation|MiCA-Compliant Stablecoins|Paxos|USDC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|FIAT|USDC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 05:00:30

Bitcoin Survives September Whale Selling Pressure According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, September was marked by clear fluctuations between Bitcoin’s attempts to rally and exposure to selling pressure by whales and long-term holders. Binance trading volume data confirms this. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure As Exchange Inflows Stay Elevated – Will BTC Lose $112,000 Support? Arab Chain highlighted Binance’s Exchange Inflow Coins Days Destroyed (CDD) indicator, which showed significant volatility throughout September. The indicator recorded multiple peaks at various points during the month, especially during mid-September. For the uninitiated, the Exchange CDD indicator tracks the movement of older, long-held Bitcoin when it flows into exchanges, weighting transactions by the age of the coins being spent. Spikes in this indicator signal that long-term holders or whales are moving coins with the intent to sell, which can create selling pressure. It is worth noting that despite the high peaks hit in September, the Exchange CDD indicator did not reach the extreme levels that it did in the previous months. However, the repeated spikes seen in September indicate inflows from older wallets into Binance. The CryptoQuant analyst stated that the multiple spikes in the Exchange CDD indicator reflect a state of caution among long-term investors. Some of these investors tried to test the market by moving their BTC to the exchange, without turning it into a mass sell-off event. Another point worth emphasizing is that the Exchange CDD spikes often coincided with price pullbacks in BTC, reinforcing the hypothesis that these flows likely represent short-term selling pressure. The analyst added: However, these pressures did not lead to a breakdown of key support levels around $108K, indicating the presence of corresponding buying liquidity that absorbed these moves. In conclusion, although some long-term investors showed willingness to take some profits, the absence of large waves of sell-offs shows that they have not fully lost confidence in the market yet. Similarly, Bitcoin’s price remaining above $108,000 despite repeated selling pressure shows that the market still possesses the capacity to absorb BTC inflows, confirming the robust underlying demand for the top digital asset. What Does October Hold For BTC? In a separate CryptoQuant post, analyst crypto sunmoon remarked that past data suggests that a surge in taker buy orders has often preceded major Bitcoin bull runs. However, currently, there are no signs of any increase in taker buy orders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Dynamics Shift As Binance Premium Signals Aggressive Longs The analyst added that even if BTC witnesses some price increase, it is unlikely to record the same magnitude of gains as before. That said, improving Bitcoin network fundamentals offers some hope to the bulls. For instance, Bitcoin network transactions are once again approaching the important 600,000 transactions threshold, which could spark bullish momentum for the digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $113,200, down 0.6% in the past 24 hours.

His comments came after reports that SWIFT is building a blockchain ledger with over 30 banks using Consensys. In response, he considered how Ripple’s path since the conclusion of the SEC lawsuit may intersect with the shifts now underway in the global payments space. The analyst suggested that the timing of recent developments deserves attention. He noted that Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s chief executive, for the first time stated that Ripple is aiming to capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume . Shortly after this, SWIFT began speaking publicly about the importance of blockchain in its future settlement models. To him, the sequence did not appear to be a coincidence. If we in the $XRP community are right that Ethereum, ConsenSys, and even Gensler had something to do with the SEC lawsuit against Ripple, and now we see ConsenSys potentially building with SWIFT, doesn’t it make sense to consider two possibilities? First, SWIFT may have realized… https://t.co/eOhbBtgZwq — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) September 29, 2025 Ripple’s Potential Approach According to Cryptoinsightuk, one possibility is that SWIFT had recognized the need for a distributed ledger technology to enhance its system. He speculated that Ripple and SWIFT may have previously engaged in discussions and that Ripple could have declined any form of partnership or acquisition. If this scenario were accurate, Ripple’s decision might reflect a deliberate strategy to remain independent and directly compete with SWIFT. Meanwhile, SWIFT’s latest deal could be an attempt to soften the blow when XRP enters the market. He also argued that the SEC lawsuit against Ripple could have reinforced that approach. Rather than seek integration with legacy networks, Ripple may have positioned itself to stand as a challenger. This path would align with Garlinghouse’s stated goal of securing a significant share of global payment flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for Ripple and XRP The analyst also commented on the shifting perception of SWIFT. He observed that Russia is unlikely to ever return to the system, even if relations with the U.S. improved. From his perspective, this refusal highlights how geopolitical disputes have reduced confidence in SWIFT’s neutrality. Other nations, he said, are closely monitoring these dynamics. China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System exists as an alternative, but as Cryptoinsightuk pointed out, it lacks the global liquidity to operate as a truly dominant network. This environment creates a gap that Ripple could fill by providing settlement services through XRP across corridors where trust in SWIFT has eroded. In doing so, XRP could establish itself as a neutral bridge asset , gradually building liquidity and extending its global role.

Saylor stated that the main goal of their strategy is to accumulate one trillion dollars worth of BTC and aims to grow by issuing loans on this capital. Michael Saylor argued that this strategy is simple yet transformative. Saylor summarized their ultimate goal: “The ultimate goal is to accumulate a trillion dollars worth of Bitcoin and then grow that capital by issuing more credit.” Saylor describes Bitcoin as “digital energy” and the monetary foundation of the 21st century. He argues that, like fire, the wheel, or oil, Bitcoin is the next technological paradigm shift that will improve the human condition. According to Saylor, BTC Treasury companies leverage this capital by issuing new digital credit instruments (bonds, preferred stocks) using Bitcoin as digital gold. Saylor states that these companies' primary competition isn't with each other, but with the legacy 20th-century credit and equity markets. He claims that this new form of digital credit is more transparent, more reliable, and offers higher returns. Saylor predicts that these new financial products will replace traditional, lower-yielding instruments. In Saylor's vision, this strategy presents the greatest opportunity in the current financially stressed large capital markets. Bitcoin-backed loans could offer significantly higher returns, say up to 10%, and thus restore the health of traditional banking and deposit markets, particularly in markets like Switzerland or Japan where risk-free interest rates are close to zero. Related News: The Lost Coins Theory: Analysis Firm Shares Special Metric Predicting the Future of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin Saylor noted that institutional adoption is rapidly increasing, noting that the institutional Bitcoin treasury trend that began in 2020 has now reached more than 180 publicly traded companies. He explained that institutions are the “engines that keep the Bitcoin economy running,” enriching individual investors with every capital injection they make into the network. Later in the interview, Saylor reiterated his long-term optimism for Bitcoin, claiming it offers a risk-free return as an investment. “I expect Bitcoin to appreciate at an average of 29% per year for the next 21 years,” Saylor said, sharing his prediction that the price of BTC will reach $21 million in 21 years. Saylor stated that Bitcoin will be the foundation of the 21st century's digital credit, digital equity, digital banking, and digital economy, arguing that Bitcoin treasury companies will be the main engines of this major transformation. *This is not investment advice.

Institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $57B, signaling long-term accumulation. Exchange holdings are at multi‑year lows, tightening circulating supply. Experts cite monetary expansion and sovereign diversification as catalysts for higher long‑term valuations. Bitcoin price prediction: $1M target driven by institutional demand and supply compression — read analysis & next steps from COINOTAG. Pavel Durov joins top analysts predicting Bitcoin could reach $1 million amid rising institutional demand. Institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $57B, indicating sustained long term accumulation. Pavel Durov says early Bitcoin purchases at $700 helped fund his ventures as prices later surged. Analysts expect sovereign adoption to increase as exchange balances hit seven year lows. Bitcoin’s momentum has cooled after its recent rally, yet several prominent figures continue to project extreme long‑term targets. The cryptocurrency sits below its year‑to‑date peak of $124,200, but proponents argue structural demand and constrained supply could push fair value much higher over years. What is the basis for Pavel Durov’s $1 million Bitcoin prediction? Pavel Durov’s $1 million Bitcoin prediction rests on three pillars: ongoing monetary expansion eroding fiat purchasing power, growing institutional allocations to spot Bitcoin ETFs, and steadily declining exchange balances that limit readily tradable supply. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s fixed issuance as a hedge against fiat dilution. How large are institutional inflows and why do they matter? Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have exceeded $57 billion to date, according to filings. These flows represent long‑term allocation from funds and institutions rather than short‑term retail speculation. Large, persistent inflows reduce available liquidity and can amplify price appreciation when matched with limited supply. Why does shrinking exchange supply increase upside potential? Exchange balances have trended lower for seven consecutive years. Lower exchange reserves mean fewer coins available for sale on major platforms, tightening on‑chain supply. With demand rising, persistent outflows from exchanges can translate to upward pressure on price over time. Who else endorses high Bitcoin targets? Notable figures — including Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, Chamath Palihapitiya, and others — have publicly stated expectations above current levels. These projections vary in magnitude but share common assumptions about institutional adoption, monetary policy, and scarcity dynamics. How did early purchases help founders like Durov? Durov disclosed buying several thousand Bitcoin around 2013 at about $700 per coin. He says those holdings provided personal liquidity during later business funding needs. Early adoption by founders illustrates how long‑term holding can support ventures when markets are volatile. What are the risks and counterarguments? Risks include regulatory interventions, technological failures, and changes in macroeconomic conditions that reduce the urgency for non‑sovereign stores of value. Short‑term volatility remains high, and predictions of extreme targets require multi‑year horizons and continued adoption trends. How might sovereign adoption affect Bitcoin’s price? Analysts argue sovereign diversification away from a single reserve currency could accelerate demand. If nations allocate reserves or payment systems to include Bitcoin, that would represent a large, durable source of demand that could intersect with already compressed exchange supplies. What data supports supply compression claims? On‑chain data shows a persistent decline in exchange reserves over several years. Combined with ETF accumulation and long‑term holding by institutions and early adopters, these metrics support the thesis of diminishing available supply for short‑term trading. Comparison: Public price targets from prominent figures Observer Stated target Primary rationale Pavel Durov $1,000,000 Monetary expansion + scarcity Michael Saylor High multi‑hundreds of thousands to $1M Institutional adoption and corporate treasuries Cathie Wood Long‑term targets above current peaks ETF inflows + technology adoption Chamath Palihapitiya Very high long‑term valuation Sovereign and institutional demand Frequently Asked Questions Can institutional ETF inflows alone push Bitcoin to $1 million? Institutional ETF inflows are a major factor but not the sole driver; reaching $1 million would likely require sustained inflows, reduced exchange liquidity, broader sovereign interest, and continued macro conditions favoring scarce digital assets. Is Bitcoin’s supply truly limited? Yes. Bitcoin has a fixed issuance schedule that caps total supply at 21 million coins, a structural feature that supporters cite when arguing for long‑term price appreciation. Key Takeaways Institutional demand is material : ETF inflows above $57B indicate durable, large‑scale allocation. Supply compression is real : Exchange balances have declined for years, tightening available liquidity. Long‑term targets require patience : Extreme predictions like $1M depend on multi‑year adoption trends and macro dynamics. Conclusion The narrative supporting a $1 million Bitcoin includes institutional inflows , shrinking exchange supply, and monetary policy trends that may weaken fiat purchasing power. While not guaranteed, these structural factors underpin long‑term bullish cases and merit monitoring by investors and policymakers.

This situation has illustrated how protectionist trade policies can have undesirable effects, which is also observed in data affected by holidays. Regarding the decrease in South Korea’s exports, data from reliable sources revealed that the 6.1% decline in September was the lowest compared to the same period last year, after accounting for the number of working days. This was after the overall exports surged by 12.7%, following a slight upswing of 1.2% in August. On the other hand, imports increased by 8.2%, resulting in a trade surplus of $9.6 billion. Trump’s extensive tariff policies threaten South Korea’s economic growth The recent data released indicated how the calendar affected business operations . Regarding the working days set, this year’s September had 22 official working days due to the October Chuseok holiday, while last year’s September had only 20 working days. The change observed in the working days boosted the monthly total but reduced the daily average. This decline ended a three-month streak of growth, according to reports. Following this information, South Korean officials and analysts concluded that the situation resulted from the tension triggered by Trump’s tariff policies, which caused exporters to send shipments out earlier before the policies took effect. The drop in South Korea’s exports demonstrates the difficult circumstances that exporters in the country face during this new phase of protectionism initiated by Trump’s presidency. With these figures released, officials at the Bank of Korea might consider the urgency of resuming their monetary easing strategy when they review their policy on October 23. Notably, exports in South Korea play a significant role in the country’s economy. To support this claim, data released in 2024 showed that the sector accounted for more than 40% of the country’s GDP. Therefore, a significant decline in the sector weakens the country’s economy. South Korea strikes a new deal with the US Considering the drastic drop in exports, South Korean officials have devised a strategy to enhance their relationship with the US. As part of the effort, the country has agreed to share monthly details with the US regarding its foreign-exchange interventions. It will also release annual information about its reserve currencies. This new deal aims to enhance transparency and solidify both countries’ commitments not to manipulate their currencies. In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, October 1, the US Treasury Department and the South Korean Ministry of Finance announced that this agreement was reached during ongoing trade negotiations. They emphasized that any interventions must be limited to preventing severe market volatility or disorderly trading. Talks began in April, although the statement did not specify when these actions would take effect. Meanwhile, Korea will share the monthly intervention data confidentially with the US Treasury and publicly announce annually its currency composition. Moreover, it will publish its market stabilization figures every four months and continue to release monthly data on reserves and forward positions, as mandated by the IMF. In April, South Korean news media reported that a senior foreign exchange official had joined the trade team negotiating with the US. In June, the Treasury Department added South Korea to its watch list in a report on foreign exchange and called for the country to reduce its currency actions .

Quintenz confirmed the decision and pointed to industry tensions, including a dispute with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, as factors that complicated his confirmation. His exit was announced as Congress debates the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which could give the CFTC primary oversight of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, there are some serious questions about who will lead the agency during this crucial regulatory transition. Quintenz Nomination to CFTC Collapses The Trump administration withdrew Brian Quintenz’s nomination to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), ending what was one of the most closely watched appointments for the US crypto industry. Quintenz isa former CFTC commissioner and head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), and confirmed the move. He described the nomination process as “the honor of my life.” While he is very grateful to President Donald Trump and the Senate Agriculture Committee, he said he now looks forward to returning to the private sector during what he called an “exciting time for innovation” in the country. Quintenz is a popular figure among many in the digital asset industry, who see his track record as supportive of innovation and balanced oversight. However, his path toward confirmation became bogged down in delays and controversy, particularly after public clashes with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini. Quintenz alleged that the Winklevoss twins directly lobbied President Trump to block his confirmation after he declined to give assurances regarding Gemini’s legal challenges. He even released private text messages to back up his claims, which showed the twins’ dissatisfaction with his unwillingness to discuss the company’s $5 million civil case settlement with the CFTC earlier this year. The messages also showed the brothers calling for “cultural reform” at the agency and a shift away from what they described as “lawfare” against crypto firms. Quintenz responded that he will address these issues only if he were confirmed to lead the regulator. The withdrawal leaves the CFTC in a leadership vacuum. The agency has been without a full chair for almost a year and is currently run solely by Acting Chair Caroline Pham. However, she said that she will depart once a permanent head was nominated. Main goals of the CLARITY Act This uncertainty comes at a pivotal time for crypto regulation in the United States. Congress is currently considering the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which could clearly define the roles of the CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other financial regulators in overseeing digital assets. Under the bill, sufficiently decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, which will make the agency a central regulator for much of the industry. For now, Quintenz’s withdrawal raises some new questions about how quickly the CFTC can secure stable leadership to guide it through this critical phase of crypto policy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 05:30:00

At the same time, attention is shifting to Remittix , the viral payments token that just set new crypto records by raising over $26.8 million and selling more than 673 million tokens. Analysts now compare Remittix’s momentum to XRP’s early rise. XRP Price Prediction Signals Undervaluation Ahead XRP price today is holding steady at $2.90 after bouncing strongly from its $2.50 support zone, with buyers showing resilience in the face of market volatility. This renewed strength has sparked optimism across XRP news, as traders eye a potential repeat of past Q4 rallies. On-chain signals also point to growing demand, with a lower NVT ratio suggesting the asset could be undervalued at current levels. For bulls, the short-term test is at $2.98, and the additional higher targets are at $3.14 and $3.30. Any further breakout will open the door to $3.66, and longer-term speculation suggests that XRP may hit $5 in the case of continued momentum. Historical patterns show that Ripple price prediction cycles often align with institutional inflows and regulatory clarity, both of which remain hot topics as ETF decisions loom. While XRP price prediction models highlight opportunity, analysts caution that losing support at $2.70 could stall progress and drag the coin lower. Still, with whales accumulating and ETF speculation growing, Ripple news suggests the stage may be set for a decisive move. Remittix Ranks Number One For Pre-Launch Tokens On CertiK Remittix has captured the spotlight after smashing through $26.8 million in funding, selling more than 673 million tokens at $0.1130 each. This milestone puts the project in the same conversation as established giants in cross-border finance, while excitement grows around comparisons to Ripple and XRP. Remittix is unique in that it aims to provide an easy way to transfer money all over the world, providing speed, security, and low-cost services through blockchain technology. Over $26.8 million raised in presale, signaling strong investor confidence More than 673 million RTX tokens sold, priced at $0.1130 each Beta testing for the Remittix wallet now live with select community members Referral program offering 15% back in USDT for every new buyer introduced The Remittix team has also confirmed major listings, with BitMart revealed as the first CEX partner after the $20 million milestone and LBank joining soon after. Coupled with CertiK verification and a #1 pre-launch token ranking, this progress strengthens trust within the community.

According to Wedson, Bitcoin has entered the final stages of a similar process compared to previous cycles, 528 days having passed since the last halving (April 19, 2024). Wedson reminded that the number of days between the halving and the all-time highs (ATH) in historical data was 371 in 2012, approximately 525 in 2016 and 546 in 2020, respectively. “This small but steady extension trend suggests that we are in the final phase of the current cycle,” he said. Related News: The Lost Coins Theory: Analysis Firm Shares Special Metric Predicting the Future of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin The analyst also argued that other cycle metrics such as the Fractal Cycle and Max Intersect SMA similarly indicate that the top is near. According to Wedson's calculations, Bitcoin could see a potential peak on October 19, 2025, which is 548 days away. If this process extends to 561 days, the date could shift to November 1, 2025. “Considering the consistency of four-year cycles, it is possible that we will reach the current price peak within 30 days at most,” Wedson said, noting that the market is approaching a critical threshold. *This is not investment advice.

In its suspension order, the SEC flagged potential manipulation via social-media “recommendations” by unknown parties that appeared designed to inflate price and volume. The halt took effect Monday and is slated to run for 10 trading days while regulators dig in. QMMM announced it would allocate a $100 million portfolio across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and also launch a crypto analytics platform. The news triggered a sharp rise from around $11 to an intraday peak near $207, before the stock last traded around $119.40 before the freeze. A Wider Crackdown on “Crypto Treasury” Pop-and-Drops The QMMM halt comes as the SEC and FINRA expand investigations into unusual trading activities linked to corporate crypto-treasury announcements. This year, over 200 companies have announced plans to raise funds through token purchases, often following sharp price increases before the announcements. Regulators are examining potential insider leaks and Reg FD violations related to the selective sharing of material information. Hype-driven stock promotions and speculative treasury strategies can cause share prices to drift away from their true value, leaving late traders vulnerable when market realities catch up. Recent reports indicate this strategy has become overcrowded, with some firms turning to financial engineering after crypto-related rallies decline, prompting the SEC to accelerate efforts to halt trading and investigate suspicious surges. What the QMMM Halt Means for Investors Now For holders, the suspension locks in positions until trading resumes, and outcomes vary from an orderly reopen to potential enforcement actions if wrongdoing is discovered. Expect increased demands for detailed disclosure: audited wallet attestations, treasury risk policies, and clear business rationales beyond simply “numbers go up.” The QMMM episode highlights a new baseline: crypto adjacency alone won’t suffice, especially when social-media promotion is involved. Key levels to watch after the halt include liquidity conditions, opening auction volatility, and any SEC updates clarifying the scope of the investigation. Overall, investors seeking equity exposure to digital assets may prefer experienced operators and transparent balance-sheet strategies over sudden pivots. With regulators indicating ongoing scrutiny of the crypto-treasury relationship, due diligence, on both the tokens and the corporate narratives, has never been more important.

Then came move-to-earn. Both models showed how Web3 could turn everyday activities into income. But in 2025, a new frontier is taking shape: wear-to-earn. At the center of this trend is GetStyleMoney (GSM) , a presale project combining AI, fashion, and blockchain to reward users for styling, wearing, and promoting fashion items. Now in Stage 2 of its public presale, GSM is priced at just $0.00003, with more than 30% of tokens already sold. Fashion Meets Crypto Fashion is one of the most powerful industries in the world, worth over $2.5 trillion globally, and billions of people already post their outfits every day on TikTok, Instagram, and X. Until now, those posts mostly benefited brands and platforms. GetStyleMoney flips the model by giving the rewards back to the users themselves. Through its Proof of Wear system, GSM verifies fashion engagement on-chain. Anyone can earn tokens by sharing outfits, scanning items, or joining brand campaigns. At the same time, fashion labels gain protection against counterfeits and access to authentic community promotion. This combination of AI verification and blockchain rewards creates the first wear-to-earn ecosystem, where everyday style has real, monetizable value. It’s a new way to think about fashion, as both an expression and a means to generate income. Why GSM Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now The rise of play-to-earn and move-to-earn proved that people are willing to monetize daily activities, but those models were limited. Gaming appeals mainly to niche communities, while fitness rewards mostly health enthusiasts. Fashion, by contrast, is universal. Everyone participates, and everyone has a style to share. That’s why early investors see GSM as one of the best cryptos to buy now. It has a scalable model that could bring millions into Web3 without asking them to change their behavior. Meanwhile, other blockchain and AI projects like NEAR Protocol and Bittensor (TAO) already carry multi-billion-dollar valuations. While established, their growth potential is capped. GSM , in contrast, is still in its early presale phase, giving it room to deliver 300x–500x upside if adoption scales. Each presale stage increases in price, meaning early backers secure the best multiples while latecomers will pay more. The total supply of GetStyleMoney is set at 20 billion tokens, with 6 billion allocated to presale participants. Stage 2 is currently live at $0.00003 per GSM , and demand has already cleared more than 30% of the available supply in this round. To increase investors’ trust, the project’s smart contract has been audited by CertiK. Building Momentum Across Social Media Community hype is often what separates successful projects from forgotten ones in crypto. GSM is already showing signs of strong demand and community interest. On its X page, the team is rallying influencers and early adopters, emphasizing that style should finally be rewarded. On LinkedIn , the project is highlighting how blockchain and digital fashion are converging into a lifestyle movement. This growing presence across both crypto and fashion circles signals that GSM is serious about building a strong brand identity and engaged community well before its first exchange listings. Final Thoughts Wear-to-earn has the potential to be the next viral Web3 model, and GetStyleMoney (GSM) is ready to lead the charge. By rewarding users for what they already do, wearing and sharing fashion GSM delivers real-world utility with explosive upside. With Stage 2 tokens priced at just $0.00003 and selling out fast, GSM is being hailed as one of the best cryptos to buy now and potentially one of 2025’s last true 700x opportunities. Join the presale now and be part of the wear-to-earn revolution. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

This uncertainty has led one analyst, known for accurately predicting BTC’s trajectory during this cycle, to suggest that a new bear market may be closer than many investors anticipate. Bear Market Warning In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the analyst, who goes by the name Doctor Profit, expressed ongoing confidence in his bearish outlook. Since adopting a negative stance in August, he has maintained that Bitcoin is likely to reach the $90,000 to $94,000 range. While he initially expected this target to be hit this month, he noted that the price has spent an average of 77% of the time below his short position entry point of $115,500. This has reinforced his belief in the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: Solana Gaining Ground On Ethereum: These Key Metrics Show Colossal Growth Doctor Profit emphasized that the critical test for BTC involves the $90,000 to $94,000 range. He predicts that not only will this level be tested, but there is a strong possibility that Bitcoin could break below it, effectively signaling the end of the current bull market. While the probability of a bear market is alarmingly high, Doctor Profit insists that confirmation hinges on how Bitcoin reacts within this key price band. He clarified that reaching this target does not need to happen immediately, nor does a temporary bounce back to $116,000 or $117,000 invalidate his bearish thesis. The analyst views any upward price movements, such as the mid-September surge to $117,800, as mere opportunities to enter short positions at more favorable levels, instead of being signals of a new bullish catalyst. 4 Key Indicators For The Bitcoin Price Analytics platform CryptoQuant has identified four critical indicators to watch based on on-chain data. Notably, Tether’s USDT market cap has seen a substantial increase of $10 billion over the past 60 days, signaling fresh liquidity entering the market, which is typically a positive sign during bullish phases. Moreover, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) RSI currently sits at 21, which indicates a “buy” signal. This metric assesses the buying power of stablecoins in relation to Bitcoin’s market cap.

Additionally, the number of accumulator addresses, which are wallets that have made multiple purchases of the leading cryptocurrency without selling, has reached an all-time high of 298,000 BTC. Conversely, the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), which tracks Bitcoin flows between spot and derivatives exchanges, is currently trending downward—an indicator commonly associated with bearish market conditions.

This development builds on Thunes’ earlier partnership with Ripple , first established in 2020 and expanded in September 2025, which introduced Ripple Payments into Thunes’ SmartX Treasury System and Direct Global Network. The companies first began working together in 2020, and the latest development highlights their commitment to delivering faster and more reliable financial services. Together, these moves demonstrate a growing effort to modernize cross-border payments, create faster, more reliable access to financial services, and provide greater flexibility for institutions worldwide . Thunes Connects Ripple to SWIFT WrathofKahneman, a well-followed figure in the digital asset community, highlighted an important detail tied to this announcement. He pointed out that Thunes has integrated its Pay-to-Banks service with SWIFT. This connection means Ripple liquidity routed through Thunes can now reach SWIFT’s network of 11,000 banks . Money runs on connectivity. #Ripple partner Thunes plugged its Pay-to-Banks service into SWIFT. This means Ripple liquidity that is routed through Thunes can reach any SWIFT connected bank. Said to cover 11,000 banks. pic.twitter.com/Rj8lKuxLXH — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) September 29, 2025 This link is significant because SWIFT has been the traditional backbone for cross-border transactions for decades. By connecting Ripple-powered liquidity to SWIFT-linked banks, Thunes creates a bridge between blockchain-based payment solutions and the conventional financial system. Ripple’s technology can leverage SWIFT’s scale, offering both reach and utility that would have been difficult to achieve independently. The Significance of Reaching SWIFT’s Network SWIFT’s network allows nearly universal access to banks and financial institutions involved in international payments. For Ripple and XRP, this reach provides credibility and practical value in positioning them as viable competitors to traditional systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Connecting to 11,000 banks removes the barriers that often separate blockchain networks from existing infrastructure. XRP has long been promoted as a solution to the inefficiencies of cross-border transfers and as a viable alternative to SWIFT’s network . By linking Ripple’s liquidity solutions with SWIFT-connected banks through Thunes, the asset gains direct access to the largest established global financial rail. Strengthening XRP’s Role in Global Payments Ripple’s strategy has focused on ensuring XRP is more than just a digital asset. Through Thunes, it now reaches 11,000 banks, 4 billion accounts in over 130 countries, and 3 billion mobile wallets, strengthening its role in the $150 trillion global payments market. Integrating with Thunes enhances that capacity by allowing payments to settle quickly across new markets where local banking infrastructure may have been limited.

Managed by Qazaqstan Venture Group and operating under the Astana International Financial Centre, the fund aims to become a cornerstone of the country’s digital asset strategy. The initiative aligns with President Tokayev’s broader push for technological advancement, including directives to accumulate strategic reserves of digital assets and expand the digital tenge into national and local budgets. Kazakhstan has also approved stablecoin payments for regulatory fees, making it the first in the region to introduce a regulatory framework for such transactions. Kazakhstan’s crypto ambitions mirror global trends. The country recently launched Central Asia’s first spot Bitcoin ETF, confirmed plans to diversify sovereign reserves into crypto, and completed pilot testing of its central bank digital currency, scheduled for full rollout by end-2025. Chinese Woman Pleads Guilty in UK’s Largest-Ever Crypto Seizure Case As reported, Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national also known as Yadi Zhang, has pleaded guilty in a London court to her role in a massive crypto fraud that led to the seizure of 61,000 Bitcoin, worth over $6.7 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated an investment scam in China targeting over 128,000 victims, funneling stolen funds into digital assets and laundering proceeds through high-end property purchases. UK authorities launched their investigation in 2018, eventually arresting Qian, who had been living under a false identity in the country. She was aided by Jian Wen, a former takeaway worker who helped move illicit funds into luxury real estate. Wen was sentenced in 2023, and police confiscated over £300 million in Bitcoin from her. The case is being described as a landmark moment in law enforcement’s fight against crypto-based financial crime. Qian remains in custody pending sentencing.

Early believers who trusted the vision of decentralized money and smart contracts saw extraordinary outcomes. With today’s crypto predictions highlighting smaller projects with greater upside, the hunt is on for the next opportunity under $0.05 that has the potential to reshape portfolios. That conversation increasingly points toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi platform in presale that blends strong fundamentals with a highly scalable model. Right now, the presale is deep into Phase 6 with around $16.6 million already raised. The current price is locked at $0.035, and more than 16,700 holders have taken their positions. Roughly 53% of this phase’s allocation has already been sold, and the next price jump to $0.04 will mark a 15% step higher. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens, this final discounted window before further climbs has investors paying close attention to the changing crypto prices and opportunities for crypto investment. A new standard for decentralized lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a lending architecture designed to combine reliability for large-cap assets with flexibility for riskier tokens. At the heart of its design are peer-to-contract pools that will handle established collateral like USDC and SOL. These vaults will give lenders predictable returns while maintaining deep liquidity for borrowers. Running alongside these will be peer-to-peer rails where lenders can negotiate terms on tokens like FLOKI or PEPE. By isolating these arrangements, the platform ensures that unexpected volatility from memecoins never spills into the core liquidity system. The integration of Layer-2 scaling will play a central role in this vision. By shifting borrowing and repayment activity to cheaper, faster rails, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will make high-frequency loan management practical for all users. The project has already aligned its roadmap toward a Beta launch, where live borrowing and lending functions will showcase these mechanics. The platform’s borrowing rules are being shaped around strict overcollateralization standards, with each asset assigned a loan-to-value threshold depending on its volatility profile. Safer assets like ETH may support LTVs up to around 75% while higher-risk tokens will be capped closer to 35–44%. A Stability Factor will act as a buffer against drawdowns, with liquidation penalties applied if collateral falls under safety margins. These penalties are structured so that a portion of liquidated assets flows back into the treasury, strengthening long-term incentives for users. Market resilience through liquidity and oracles The importance of on-chain liquidity becomes most obvious in times of stress, when thin markets can trigger cascading liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designing its liquidation engine with liquidity-aware incentives that scale based on how much depth exists at the time. This ensures liquidators are motivated to stabilize the system even during volatile periods. Loan-to-value ratios will be tuned to minimize undercollateralization risk, meaning the system stays solvent even when crypto prices swing rapidly. Price discovery will rely primarily on Chainlink oracle feeds, with fallback providers and time-weighted average prices from decentralized exchanges as additional safeguards. This multi-layer approach is set to prevent false triggers and give institutional users confidence that liquidations are only executed when absolutely necessary. Combined with Layer-2 execution speed, this structure points toward a lending platform able to withstand the kind of shocks that have historically undermined weaker protocols. Why analysts forecast a 200x runway Investors looking at long-range crypto predictions are not only analyzing technology but also demand drivers that can multiply valuations. For Mutuum Finance (MUTM), three stand out as defining: First, reserve factor accumulation will channel a percentage of borrowing activity into a treasury that can later be redeployed into incentives and ecosystem growth. This steady reinforcement strengthens the balance sheet over time and adds depth to the project’s utility. Second, the robust oracle strategy that mixes Chainlink feeds with multiple fallback mechanisms positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for institutional partnerships. Larger players prioritize risk controls, and the ability to showcase transparency in price feeds will encourage greater total value locked. Third, the buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures that protocol revenue will flow into repurchasing MUTM on the open market and distributing these tokens to stakers. This creates a predictable demand curve, tying growth in platform usage directly to increased returns for long-term participants. Security credentials reinforce this investment thesis. The protocol has already been reviewed by CertiK with a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program with clear reward tiers is in place, alongside a $100,000 giveaway campaign. A live dashboard and Top-50 leaderboard are keeping the growing community engaged, and the project has already attracted over 12,000 followers on social media. A new generation of wealth creation The best way to understand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to look at how its early investors have done. A person who joined during Phase 1 at $0.01 is already up to $0.035, which is a 3.5x gain in value before the platform ever goes live. With the Beta launch, Layer-2 throughput, buybacks from revenue, and eventual exchange listings all coming up, a way to get 200x returns is no longer just a dream; it’s a matter of scaling adoption. Phase 6 is now more than halfway sold, and the next step up to $0.04 is coming soon. Investors have only a short time remaining to get in before this early entry price is gone.

Crypto markets appear to have taken this in their stride with very little movement in most digital assets over the past few hours. Total capitalization is holding on to the $4 trillion level, which it reclaimed earlier this week. Bitcoin tapped an intraday high of $114,700 in late trading on Tuesday and has only dipped marginally from that local high at the time of writing. Ether prices revisited $4,200 but fell back over the past couple of hours to trade at $4,140 during trading in Asia on Wednesday morning. Most of the altcoins were seeing minor losses, which is nothing unusual. Asian stock markets were mixed as investors focused on issues closer to home rather than US politics. Why Has The US Govt Shut Down? Both Republican and Democratic funding proposals failed in the Senate on Tuesday night, and the government officially shut down at 12:01 am Wednesday when funding expired. BREAKING: US Government officially shuts down after running out of money. pic.twitter.com/g08p5TWAvM — Globe Eye News (@GlobeEyeNews) October 1, 2025 In the political standoff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of refusing to negotiate, while Vice President JD Vance blamed Democrats for not compromising. “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing,” he said. The Democrats are demanding changes to Medicaid cuts and healthcare tax credits that Republicans oppose, according to reports. The Senate plans to vote again on Wednesday on the same two failed measures, while federal agencies were instructed to execute orderly shutdown plans. This could lead to a data blackout with no fresh labor or inflation reports, leaving the Federal Reserve flying blind. The move marks the 21st government shutdown since 1977, the last of which was in December 2018, lasting 35 days. This was during the depths of “crypto winter” and the brutal bear market that followed the 2017 cycle peak. Crypto markets are currently in a bull cycle, and their non-reaction to the shutdown shows greater resilience and market maturity. “Bitcoin and altcoins trade like high-beta assets, so a shutdown spike in volatility can hurt prices, but if it pushes the Fed toward a softer stance, that can later lift sentiment,” commented researcher ‘Hunt’. Gold Up, Dollar Down Gold, which is seen as a safe haven during periods of uncertainty, is at a new all-time high of $3,870 an ounce. Meanwhile, the US dollar is hovering near a one-week low against other major currencies. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, has slumped 12% since the beginning of this year as the world’s reserve currency continues to weaken.

Each rally has stalled at the same wall, and the capital flow is now shifting toward projects with clearer token demand mechanics and functioning DeFi models. This rotation is already visible in the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol aligning its token with real utility. The numbers are telling: with a total supply of 4 billion, Phase 6 has already generated around $16.6 million. At the current price of $0.035, more than 16,700 holders are on board, and 53% of this phase’s 170 million allocation is sold. The price in Phase 7 will rise by 15% to $0.040, creating urgency for those who want entry before the next leg up. Building stablecoin utility, lending demand and price discovery Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being engineered as a dual-mechanic protocol where lending happens in two streams. Peer-to-Contract pools will handle stablecoins and blue-chip crypto coins, while Peer-to-Peer desks will serve riskier meme assets in isolation. This structure will keep the system robust while allowing yield opportunities across segments. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its stablecoin innovation. A native $1-pegged stablecoin will be minted only against collateralized borrowing, governed by interest adjustments to ensure the peg remains strong. This mechanism adds an on-chain medium of exchange that supports both borrowing activity and long-term stability. Price discovery is central to healthy liquidations and reliable lending. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use Chainlink oracles as its primary feed, with fallback and aggregation layers included to prevent manipulation or errors. Accurate pricing ensures that collateral values are always correctly calculated, protecting lenders and borrowers during volatile swings. The lending mechanics show clear profit potential. For instance, a depositor adding $25,000 DAI into a P2C pool will receive mtDAI at a one-to-one rate. Utilization modeling projects an average APY around 14%, meaning this position will generate $3,500 over 12 months. On the borrower side, someone using $1,500 worth of ADA as collateral will access up to 65% loan-to-value in stablecoin, unlocking liquidity while staying long on ADA’s upside. P2P will also serve a role, offering isolated desks for tokens like FLOKI, SHIB, and PEPE, where direct lending agreements will function without exposing the main pools. Market volatility often sparks the question of why crypto is down during corrections, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing answers in its infrastructure. Accurate price feeds paired with fallback oracles will shield users from false liquidations. Liquidation incentives will scale with on-chain liquidity to guarantee closeouts, while Layer-2 speed will minimize slippage and deliver smooth executions even in high-pressure market moments. The road to 1,000% returns beyond early gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already up 250% from its Phase 1 launch, but analysts are looking ahead to much larger outcomes. The path to 1,000% rests on three demand drivers. First, rapid adoption is expected once the Beta launch goes live, as real platform usage and word-of-mouth will draw in both lenders and borrowers. Second, protocol revenue from borrowing and fees will drive buyback mechanics, where MUTM tokens will be repurchased and redistributed to mtToken stakers, ensuring continuous buy pressure. Third, expected listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, combined with growing total value locked, will amplify liquidity and visibility. This foundation is backed by security milestones. A CertiK audit is underway, combining manual review with static analysis. Scores already include a TokenScan of 90 and a Skynet rating of 79. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty program is live, with rewards scaling from $200 for low issues to $2,000 for critical discoveries. A $100,000 giveaway is also running, awarding ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each. The community now exceeds 12,000 followers on Twitter, and a live dashboard with a Top-50 leaderboard provides transparency for investors. Conclusion The growth math is already visible. A Phase 2 buyer who entered at $0.015 is now sitting on a 2.33x position at today’s $0.035 price. As the presale moves to $0.040 in Phase 7 and platform features roll out, price paths to $0.60 or even $1.50 are supported by protocol revenue and buybacks. For Phase 6 investors, this translates to 30x–100x outcomes, a realistic trajectory when paired with expanding demand drivers. The window is getting smaller because more than half of Phase 6 has already been sold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself to be the next big brand in crypto investing. It gives you an opportunity to move on from assets that aren’t growing and into a token that has genuine use. This presale is the time to buy XRP if you want more than the delayed $3.5 ceiling. The price will go up again soon.

Binance Announces TRUMP/JPY Spot Trading Pair and Zero Maker Fee Campaign According to the company's statement, the TRUMP/JPY spot trading pair will be available on October 3, 2025, at 11:00 AM. The addition of the new trading pair will allow Japanese yen investors to trade directly with the TRUMP token. This move is part of Binance's strategy to increase trading diversity, particularly in the Asian market. Binance is also launching a zero maker fee campaign to incentivize users. As part of the campaign, there will be no fees for maker trades on the TRUMP/JPY trading pair. The campaign, which will run from 11:00 AM on October 3, 2025, to 10:59 AM on November 3, 2025, will provide a cost advantage, particularly for high-volume investors. Binance aims to expand its user base with campaigns like these aimed at increasing trading volume. Experts believe the listing of a new trading pair could both increase interest in the TRUMP token and attract more Japanese investors to the platform. The exchange had previously strengthened user engagement by launching trading pairs with different currencies and zero-commission campaigns. *This is not investment advice.

With altcoin season still anticipated, long-term buyers are debating which project has the fundamentals to deliver multi-year gains rather than short-lived pumps. Many are now examining Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project building a real utility platform around lending, borrowing, and staking that analysts argue is engineered for 2,000% growth potential. Long-term utility driving growth The presale already shows serious traction. Out of a total of 4 billion tokens, Phase 6 has raised around $16.6 million. The current price is $0.035 with more than 16,700 holders, and 53% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this round have already been taken. Security underpins this progress: a CertiK audit with Manual Review and Static Analysis is ongoing, supported by a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet rating of 79. Investor incentives are also powerful — a $100,000 giveaway will select ten winners to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, and a $50,000 bug bounty program will reward testers up to $2,000 for critical findings. With Phase 7 lifting the price to $0.040, this round represents the last chance to lock in tokens before a guaranteed 15% increase. The thesis behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its dual lending model, which allows users to engage with both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer structures. In P2C, blue-chip and stablecoin deposits are pooled to generate predictable yields. For instance, an investor supplying $10,000 in SOL to a pool will receive mtSOL in return. With an average annual yield of 12%, this generates $1,200 in passive income while the mtTokens remain usable as collateral. Borrowers benefit from capital efficiency without liquidating their assets. By depositing $1,000 worth of LINK and leveraging a 65% loan-to-value ratio, a trader can unlock $650 in liquidity for new opportunities while keeping exposure to LINK’s upside. This creates a system where capital is not locked but dynamically repurposed. P2P adds depth by isolating riskier tokens such as PEPE and FLOKI into a separate marketplace. Here, terms are negotiated directly between lenders and borrowers, ensuring that the core pools remain insulated and sustainable. This design provides the foundation for long-term total value locked growth and makes the system robust enough to attract larger participants. Collateral, liquidity, and institutional safety For long-term investors wondering why crypto is down in volatile stretches, risk management is a deciding factor in selecting projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) structures loans with overcollateralization, using a Stability Factor to monitor health continuously. Assets like ETH or stablecoins support up to 75% LTV with liquidation thresholds near 80%, while more volatile assets are capped between 35% and 53% LTV with liquidation around 65%. Reserve factors ranging from 10% to 53% will add extra protection and recycle revenue back into the treasury. Liquidity depth is equally important. Large withdrawals or liquidation waves can collapse poorly designed systems, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering dynamic liquidation incentives and caps to keep pools balanced. On-chain liquidity ensures smooth execution, and with Layer-2 integration, transactions will become faster and cheaper, encouraging higher on-chain activity. In addition, the use of aggregator oracles and fallback feeds reduces risk from downtime and will keep liquidations functioning accurately. Roadmap and demand drivers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is putting together a number of factors to help long-term adoption. Staking mechanisms will let mtToken users receive MUTM rewards, while open-market buybacks paid for by protocol revenue will keep demand high. There will be a test launch so that people may interact with the platform directly and see how it works in real time. Planned listings on major exchanges like MEXC and Kraken will make the coin more visible and give it more liquidity. These projects will bring in additional users and money to the ecosystem, which will keep prices rising for years. A clear example shows the impact. A long-term investor who swapped ETH into MUTM during Phase 1 at $0.01 with a $6,000 outlay secured 600,000 tokens. At today’s Phase 6 price of $0.035, that position is valued at $21,000, a 3.5× return. At a target representing 2,000% growth — about 21× from the original price — that stake is projected to climb into six-figure territory. These numbers are supported not by hype but by structural adoption drivers: the beta platform launch, scalability through Layer-2, staking and buyback rewards, and expected listings on tier-one exchanges. If you’re still trying to figure out which cryptocurrency to buy for long-term growth, the numbers and mechanics underlying Mutuum Finance (MUTM) make it plain. Over half of Phase 6 has already been sold, and the price is about to go up. Now is the time to get ready for what analysts think will be one of the most important altcoin plays of the next cycle.

Ein Gesetzesentwurf sieht unter anderem Steuerfreiheit für kleinere Transaktionen unter 300 Dollar vor. Die Finanzkommission des Senats arbeitet parteiübergreifend an einem neuen Rahmen für digitale Assets. Kryptowährungen sind längst mehr als ein Nischenphänomen. In den USA rücken sie nun verstärkt in den Fokus der Politik, denn Senatorin Cynthia Lummis arbeitet mit Kollegen an neuen Regeln für die Besteuerung digitaler Vermögenswerte. Die Debatte könnte weitreichende Folgen für Anleger, Unternehmen und den gesamten Kryptomarkt haben. Politischer Vorstoß für digitale Assets Senatorin Cynthia Lummis hat bei einer Veranstaltung in Washington bekräftigt, dass die Steuerbehandlung von Kryptowährungen dringend reformiert werden müsse. Bereits im Juli hatte sie einen Gesetzesentwurf eingebracht, der kleine Transaktionen bis zu einer Grenze von 300 US-Dollar steuerfrei stellen soll. Dieser Schritt soll alltägliche Zahlungen mit Bitcoin und anderen Coins erleichtern und Bürokratie abbauen. Auch das Verleihen von digitalen Assets soll nach ihrem Entwurf nicht mehr als steuerpflichtiges Ereignis gelten, was Investoren mehr Spielraum gibt. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a long-time ally of the crypto industry and the force behind key legislation like the Genius and Clarity Acts, has introduced a new proposal earlier this year called the Digital Asset Tax Legislation. It includes seven miscellaneous tax provisions aimed… — Clinton Donnelly (@CryptoTaxFixer) September 29, 2025 Ziel der Reform ist es, die rechtliche Unsicherheit zu beenden und Innovation in den USA zu fördern. Lummis betont, dass die bisherige Steuerpraxis Investoren hemmt und den Kryptomarkt belastet. Mit ihren Vorschlägen will sie den USA eine Vorreiterrolle geben. Viele Branchenvertreter begrüßen den Vorstoß, da sie auf klare und verlässliche Regeln angewiesen sind. Die Senatorin tritt seit Jahren für Kryptowährungen ein und hat sich den Ruf als eine der größten Befürworterinnen digitaler Vermögenswerte im Kongress erarbeitet. Zusammenarbeit im Senat Die Finanzkommission des Senats spielt bei der Ausarbeitung der neuen Regeln eine entscheidende Rolle. Nach Angaben von Lummis arbeitet das Gremium derzeit an einem Entwurf, der zehn zentrale Punkte umfasst, von denen neun direkt aus ihren bisherigen Vorschlägen stammen. Sie sprach von einem deutlichen Fortschritt, der zeigt, dass parteiübergreifende Zusammenarbeit möglich ist. Besonders hob sie Senator Ron Wyden hervor, der als Demokrat ein enger Partner in dieser Frage sei. BREAKING: SENATOR LUMMIS JUST SAID SHE WANTS TO MAKE #BITCOIN PAYMENTS UNDER $600 TAX FREE BTC ADOPTION IS ABOUT TO SKY ROCKET pic.twitter.com/tqOM6Wpws4 — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 27, 2025 Die Debatte über Kryptowährungen ist im Kongress nicht neu, doch bisherige Versuche für klare Steuerregeln scheiterten. Lummis hatte bereits versucht, ihre Ideen in umfassendere Gesetzespakete einzubringen, allerdings ohne Erfolg. Nun scheint die Dynamik günstiger, da immer mehr Abgeordnete den wirtschaftlichen Wert von Kryptowährungen anerkennen. Befürworter hoffen, dass die Einigung über Steuerfragen auch ein Signal für breitere Akzeptanz digitaler Assets sein könnte. Einfluss der Krypto-Lobby Verschiedene Interessenverbände der Krypto-Branche fordern seit Jahren eine Neuregelung der Besteuerung. Besonders die sogenannte de-minimis-Regel, die kleine Transaktionen steuerfrei stellt, gilt als Kernforderung. Für Alltagszahlungen mit Bitcoin wäre dies ein entscheidender Schritt, da bisher jede kleinste Transaktion steuerlich dokumentiert werden musste. Viele Unternehmen und Privatnutzer hatten dies als Hemmnis kritisiert. Lies hier, warum immer mehr Unternehmen in den USA auf Ethereum (ETH) setzen. Die Unterstützung aus der Wirtschaft könnte für den Erfolg des Gesetzes entscheidend sein. Lummis betont, dass ein innovationsfreundliches Umfeld geschaffen werden müsse, damit die USA nicht von anderen Regionen abgehängt werden. Gerade in Europa und Asien entstehen zunehmend Krypto-Hubs, die Investoren anziehen. Mit einer klaren Steuerregelung könnten die USA dagegenhalten und ihre Position als globaler Finanzplatz stärken. Kritiker sehen jedoch die Gefahr, dass zu großzügige Regeln Schlupflöcher eröffnen könnten. Bevorstehende Anhörung Am Mittwoch plant die Finanzkommission eine Anhörung unter dem Titel „Examining the Taxation of Digital Assets“. Zu den geladenen Experten zählen Vertreter von Coin Center sowie Rechtsanwältin Andrea S. Kramer. Sie sollen die Sichtweise der Branche und juristische Aspekte beleuchten. Diese Anhörung gilt als wichtiger Schritt im Gesetzgebungsprozess und könnte die Richtung der Reform bestimmen. Die Diskussion fällt in eine politisch angespannte Zeit, da ein möglicher Regierungsstillstand droht. Sollte der Kongress bis zum 1. Oktober keine Einigung über den Haushalt erzielen, könnten zahlreiche Prozesse ins Stocken geraten. Laut Angaben eines Sprechers würde die Anhörung zu digitalen Assets jedoch auch bei einem Shutdown wie geplant stattfinden . Damit signalisiert der Senat, dass das Thema höchste Priorität besitzt. Anleger und Unternehmen blicken gespannt auf die Ergebnisse. Lesetipp: Warum Experten glauben, dass in 2025 noch 250k bei BTC erreicht werden können Ebenfalls gespannt sind Investoren bei den Altcoins, denn dort gibt es immer neue Projekte, die mit mehr oder weniger sinnvollen Use-Cases Schlagzeilen machen. Eines davon – Bitcoin Hyper. Dieser Coin möchte die besten Seiten von Bitcoin und Solana miteinander verbinden. Doch wie genau funktioniert das? Bitcoin Hyper – die nächste Stufe für Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will das Beste aus zwei Welten verbinden: die Sicherheit von Bitcoin und die Geschwindigkeit von Solana. Bitcoin selbst ist zwar extrem sicher, aber langsam, teuer und nicht flexibel genug für moderne Anwendungen wie DeFi, Games oder smarte Verträge. Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an: Als Layer-2-Lösung macht es Bitcoin endlich schnell, günstig und programmierbar. So funktioniert die Zusammenarbeit von BTC und SOL Über die sogenannte Canonical Bridge können Nutzer echtes Bitcoin in das Hyper-Netzwerk bringen. Dort wird es als „Wrapped BTC“ genutzt, ohne dass die Coins ihre Sicherheit auf der Bitcoin-Blockchain verlieren. So lässt sich BTC endlich als Zahlungsmittel einsetzen – ob für Finanz-Apps, Spiele oder einfache Transaktionen – und nicht nur als Wertanlage. Lies hier eine detaillierte Analyse von Bitcoin Hyper. Die 3 größten Vorteile von Bitcoin Hyper: Schnelligkeit: Transaktionen laufen in Echtzeit, vergleichbar mit Solana. Niedrige Gebühren: Kosten sind nur ein Bruchteil im Vergleich zur Bitcoin-Blockchain. Hohe Sicherheit: Bitcoins Stabilität kombiniert mit einer dezentralen, vertrauenswürdigen Bridge. Der $HYPER-Token treibt dieses System an: Er bezahlt Transaktionen, bringt Staking-Rewards und ermöglicht Mitspracherecht. Mit fairem Presale, ohne Insider-Vorteile, bietet Bitcoin Hyper besonders jetzt – wo immer mehr Unternehmen und Institutionen in Krypto einsteigen – spannende Chancen für Investoren.

While there’s still some time before this kicks, tokenized securities could bring traditional finance and blockchain technology ever closer. As the lines between the two worlds blur, this could benefit certain crypto projects such as Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Considered the best crypto to buy these days, these projects make it even easier for anyone to get into crypto investing. We’ll explain why that is after going over the SEC’s proposal for tokenized stock trading! Tokenized Securities: The Way Forward or Just Hype? The SEC is currently in its early stages of allowing people to trade tokenized securities on crypto exchanges. Nova Wealth President Nate Geraci emphasized this on X when he said that the NYSE met with the SEC Crypto Task Force to discuss tokenized securities. As their name suggests, tokenized securities are a digital securities on the blockchain. While they can make stock trading faster and cheaper and allow for 24/7 trading, some companies have cautioned against rushing on the hype train. One of these is market-making firm Citadel Securities. Back in July, it advised the SEC to be careful about adopting these securities, as they could confuse investors and siphon liquidity away from equity markets. Nevertheless, with the SEC potentially approving tokenized securities soon, TradFi could step into the future with blockchain at its side. In fact, data from RWA.XYZ shows that tokenized stocks are gaining momentum , with a 99.65% growth in their total value in the last 30 days, and a 153.94% increase in their monthly transfer volume. With the growing adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, the industry will need projects that further accelerate this adoption and bring innovation to the space. Here best long term crypto investments that fall in that category. 1.

Key Takeaways: The UK is seeking to keep 61,000 BTC seized from a Chinese fraud case, now worth $6.7 billion. Victims are pushing for compensation based on current Bitcoin value, not just original investments. Legal battles and market volatility could delay resolution and impact the final windfall. The potential windfall stems from the conviction of Zhimin Qian and her Malaysian associate Seng Hok Ling, both of whom pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in London earlier this year. $6.7B in Bitcoin Seized at London Mansion in 2018 Fraud Probe The digital assets were first discovered in 2018 on devices seized at a luxury mansion in Hampstead, north London, during an investigation into suspicious property purchases. At the time, authorities were unaware they had stumbled upon what would become the UK’s largest-ever crypto seizure. Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, had funneled stolen investor funds from China into Bitcoin before fleeing the country and settling in the UK under a false identity. Court documents reveal that Qian ran a fraudulent investment firm in China between 2014 and 2017, offering returns as high as 300%. The scheme reportedly defrauded over 128,000 individuals, many of whom are now seeking compensation. Lawyers for some victims argue that the Bitcoin should be returned at its current value, not merely the original sums invested, citing years of delay and the life savings many lost. UK officials are debating what to do with the massive haul, according to a report from the Financial Times. Some Treasury insiders have speculated the recovered crypto could reduce the fiscal burden in the upcoming Budget, but others caution that legal proceedings could stretch into 2027. The Office for Budget Responsibility does not account for asset seizures in its fiscal forecasts, and crypto holdings are not formally recognized as financial assets. The next civil hearing is expected in January, with a High Court decision likely to be appealed. Meanwhile, Qian and Ling await sentencing in November. UK authorities face another challenge: how to liquidate such a large amount of Bitcoin without causing a price shock. With crypto markets notoriously volatile, the final value of the seized funds could fluctuate dramatically before any resolution. Crypto-Related Physical Attacks Surge 169% in Six Months As reported, physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to new data tracked by CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. Since late February, 35 new violent incidents have been reported globally, a 169% increase in just six and a half months. The uptick adds to an already troubling trend, as cryptocurrency markets continue their bullish run. In total, 48 attacks have occurred so far in 2025, marking a 33% increase over all of 2024. France alone has accounted for 14 of this year’s reported incidents. One of the most disturbing cases took place on September 6 in Cambridge, Canada, where a young man was abducted at gunpoint and forced to transfer funds into a cryptocurrency wallet.

Crypto provides scalable, programmable money and settlement that traditional 100-year-old finance rails cannot match for real‑time AI-driven trading and automated economic agents. AI agents need scalable, programmable money rails for real‑time transactions. Blockchain provides verifiable, machine-readable sources of truth for autonomous agents. Institutions may adopt crypto gradually; rate moves and liquidity unlocking could increase flows. AI agents require crypto: scalable, programmable money rails for real‑time finance — read how institutions and Bitcoin fit into the picture. Coinbase’s John D’Agostino says expecting AI agents to run on legacy financial rails is unrealistic; crypto and blockchain offer the speed and programmable money AI requires to operate effectively in markets. What role does crypto play for AI agents? AI agents rely on fast, programmable, and verifiable payment and data rails, and crypto supplies those capabilities. Blockchain offers machine-readable settlement, on‑chain truth and near-instant transfers, enabling agents to execute strategies and settle positions without the latency and manual reconciliation of legacy systems. How will AI agents use blockchain-based money rails? AI agents will use blockchain rails to transact micro-payments, execute automated trades, and access auditable data feeds. Machine-to-machine payments can be near-instant and atomic. As John D’Agostino noted on CNBC, asking agents to operate on century-old financial rails is like streaming on a dial‑up modem — it won’t scale. Coinbase’s John D’Agostino believes AI agents require crypto to operate effectively in financial markets. Source: CNBC Why are legacy finance rails inadequate for AI? Traditional financial infrastructure was designed for human-paced settlement, not automated, high-frequency, machine-to-machine activity. These systems incur batching, manual checks and latency. Blockchain and crypto enable continuous, programmatic settlement and reduce reconciliation overhead for autonomous agents. How does Bitcoin compare to gold for institutional investors? Bitcoin is digital, programmable and easily transferred across borders. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be moved, tokenized and integrated into smart contracts, offering yield opportunities and composability. D’Agostino emphasizes Bitcoin’s unique characteristics — not a direct gold analog — particularly for portfolios seeking assets that outpace expanding money supply. Context: The Federal Reserve cut rates on Sept. 17, 2025, and market commentary from JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon has varied on future cuts. Interest rate moves can unlock liquidity from cash and money-market products into risk assets, including crypto. When will institutions meaningfully increase crypto allocations? Institutions are cautious and methodical. Pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds typically adopt new asset classes incrementally. Expect a measured increase driven by regulatory clarity, custodial solutions, and shifts in interest rates that release parked cash into alternatives. Are institutions “lemmings” in crypto adoption? No. According to D’Agostino, institutions act deliberately. They use due diligence, governance and staged allocations rather than herd-based moves. Adoption is steady, not a single explosive wave. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Why AI Agents Need Crypto: Coinbase’s John D’Agostino Explains"", ""description"": ""Coinbase’s John D’Agostino says AI agents require crypto and blockchain rails for machine-speed transactions and verifiable data."", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999e51-4e21-78c7-b14d-4126c873bc8f.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ai-agents-crypto"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How AI agents can integrate with crypto rails"", ""description"": ""Steps for enabling AI agents to transact and operate using blockchain-based money rails."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Establish on‑chain identity and wallets"", ""text"": ""Provision cryptographic wallets and identities for agents to sign transactions programmatically."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Use smart contracts for business logic"", ""text"": ""Deploy smart contracts to encode agent rules, settlement conditions, and dispute resolution."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Integrate oracle and data feeds"", ""text"": ""Provide authenticated, tamper-evident inputs so agents act on reliable real‑world signals."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Settle and monitor on-chain"", ""text"": ""Execute atomic transactions and continuous monitoring to ensure finality and compliance."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Do AI agents need crypto to function in financial markets?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""AI agents benefit from crypto because blockchain provides low‑latency, programmable settlement and verifiable data, which legacy systems cannot deliver at scale."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will institutions quickly move large allocations into Bitcoin?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutions typically allocate gradually; adoption depends on regulatory clarity, custody solutions, and macro drivers like interest rates."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How is Bitcoin different from gold for portfolio use?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin is digital and programmable, easier to transfer and integrate into modern financial plumbing, offering use cases gold cannot provide."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How fast must money rails be for AI agents to trade effectively? AI agents need near‑real‑time settlement and programmable conditional transfers. Millisecond-level decision-making requires settlement that minimizes latency and supports atomic operations, which blockchain rails can deliver where legacy batching cannot. Can decentralized oracles fix data reliability for AI? Yes. Decentralized oracles provide cryptographic proofs and multiple data sources so AI agents can rely on tamper-resistant inputs for automated decision-making and reduce single-source failures. Key Takeaways Speed matters : Blockchain enables the low-latency settlement AI agents require. Programmability : Crypto lets money be encoded into contracts and agent logic. Institutional adoption : Will be gradual; macro factors and custody solutions are key triggers. Conclusion AI agents and crypto are complementary: AI agents need fast, verifiable, programmable rails and crypto provides them.

Traders are using scaled 10% profit-taking at resistances to manage risk, per IncomeSharks. Key trigger: Weekly close above $4,000 confirms continuation Structured selling of 10% at resistance points keeps targets like $4,800 conditional on momentum. Repeated dips below supports followed by rapid recoveries (fakeouts) highlight persistent demand; prior support near $3,600 remains central. Ethereum $4,000 resistance explained: watch weekly closes, scaled profit-taking, and targets to $4,800 — actionable analysis from COINOTAG newsroom. What is driving Ethereum’s battle at $4,000? Ethereum $4,000 acts as both a psychological and technical gatekeeper that determines near-term direction. Repeated intraday breaks followed by fast recoveries have created a pattern of fakeouts, forcing traders to prioritize weekly structure and scaled risk management over single-session moves. How would a weekly close above $4,000 affect Ethereum’s outlook? A weekly close above $4,000 would signal sustained buyer control and likely open a path toward $4,400–$4,800. Analyst Ted compares the level to Bitcoin’s $12,000 in 2020, where a decisive weekly resolution preceded a larger expansion. Volume confirmation and follow-through on daily closes would strengthen the breakout case. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ethereum-4000-battle"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum’s $4,000 Level Remains Key Resistance as Traders Test Weekly Structure"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2Hk3eLaIAIUGBu-1-1024x535.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Ethereum’s $4,000 level is the decisive near-term resistance; traders watch weekly closes, volume and scaled profit-taking toward $4,800 while $3,600 remains key support.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Ethereum's $4,000 resistance"", ""description"": ""Stepwise guide to assess whether Ethereum's reclaim of $4,000 is a breakout or a fakeout."", ""totalTime"": ""PT30M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm a weekly close"", ""text"": ""Monitor a sustained weekly close above $4,000; weekly structure matters more than intraday spikes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check volume and follow-through"", ""text"": ""Look for above-average volume and consecutive daily closes above $4,000 to validate momentum."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Use scaled profit-taking"", ""text"": ""Implement structured selling (for example 10% at resistance tiers) to lock gains while retaining exposure to a larger move."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What happens if Ethereum closes the week above $4,000?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A weekly close above $4,000 would likely confirm bullish continuation and open targets near $4,400–$4,800, provided volume and daily follow-through support the move."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are recent dips under support false breakouts?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""IncomeSharks describes repeated dips followed by swift recoveries as fakeouts that trap bears; these reversals indicate persistent buyer demand around $3,600."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What risk management are traders using at resistance?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Traders are scaling profits by selling roughly 10% at each resistance layer to manage exposure while keeping upside participation."" } } ]} Ethereum’s $4K level remains the key resistance as analysts monitor repeated fakeouts and critical weekly close signals. IncomeSharks notes repeated dips below support followed by fast recoveries, reinforcing bullish resilience. Analyst Ted says only a weekly close above $4K would confirm continuation, comparing it to Bitcoin’s $12K breakout. Structured 10% profit taking at resistance levels suggests confidence but keeps $4,800 dependent on sustained strength. Context and market structure: Ethereum’s price action centers on $4,000, which has alternated between support and resistance in recent sessions. That oscillation creates a short-term battleground that defines near-term bias for traders and funds. Pattern of fakeouts: IncomeSharks documents several cases where ETH dipped below key supports and then rebounded quickly. These moves have trapped bearish positions and suggested buyers are defending lower levels, with $3,600 repeatedly acting as a resilient support base. Why are traders selling into strength near $4,800? Traders are executing staged profit-taking to manage risk while preserving upside. Selling 10% at resistance points allows participants to capture short-term gains without fully exiting positions. This strategy makes higher targets like $4,800 contingent on continued buying pressure and consistent closes above $4,000. Source: IncomeSharks on X When should traders expect a clear directional resolution? A clear directional resolution depends on multi-session structure. A single intraday spike above $4,000 is less meaningful than a weekly close with confirmatory volume. If ETH holds above $4,000 for several sessions and posts higher highs, targets around $4,400 and $4,800 become attainable. If not, $3,600 remains the likely fallback. Frequently Asked Questions What is the significance of $3,600 support? $3,600 has acted as a repeat recovery zone after brief breakdowns. Rebounds from this level indicate demand and provide a stop-loss reference for traders managing downside exposure. How do fakeouts change short-term strategy? Fakeouts encourage traders to focus on weekly closes and scaled entries rather than chasing intraday moves. They also favor risk management tools like staggered take-profit orders and trailing stops. Key Takeaways Weekly close matters : A sustained weekly close above $4,000 is the primary confirmation signal. Scaled risk management : Selling ~10% at resistances preserves upside while locking profits. Support to watch : $3,600 is the immediate support that has held after recent fakeouts; failure risks deeper consolidation. Conclusion Ethereum’s near-term direction pivots on the $4,000 level. Traders and funds are prioritizing weekly structure, volume confirmation, and staged profit-taking to differentiate genuine breakouts from recurring fakeouts.

Solana: Under Pressure, Poised For Pivot Solana price sits near $202.18 after a swift pullback of roughly 16 percent. Bulls need the $200 zone to hold or the market may probe $185 to $195 support. A decisive reclaim above $210 could open $220 to $240 into Q4 if momentum revives. More than 70 percent of the supply is staked, which tightens the float and can amplify rallies when demand returns. The Solana price story remains a high-growth narrative, yet the near term path is fragile, so capital is selectively rotating toward utility plays. Remittix: The PayFi Challenger Many Call The Best Crypto To Buy Now As Solana price chops around key levels, Remittix is being positioned as the best crypto to buy now by investors who want real-world utility with upside. Remittix is a cross-chain PayFi project that connects crypto to bank accounts across 30-plus countries with low friction. The team is fully audited by CertiK, ranked #1 for Pre pre-launch tokens, and live wallet beta testing is underway with community users. BitMart listing was secured after the $20M milestone, LBANK followed after $22M, and a third listing is in preparation. The current RTX price is about $0.1130, placing it firmly in the ‘top crypto under $1’ conversation for early positioning. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction • Users can move crypto into real bank accounts in 30 plus countries, which solves a payment problem that pure speculation cannot. • The mobile first wallet beta is live, with real time FX conversion designed for everyday transfers. • CertiK verification and the top ranking for pre launch tokens strengthen trust for cautious buyers. • Exchange momentum with BitMart and LBANK signals liquidity pathways from day one. • Community growth and steady funding show product market fit, not just hype. Remittix does not try to outcompete Solana on throughput; it rides major chains while focusing on settlement into money people actually spend. Bottom Line For Q4 If you follow Solana price into Q4, you know the setup can flip fast. But if you want the best crypto to buy now with a payment use case, live beta, CertiK strength, and confirmed listings, Remittix keeps checking boxes. Miss the early window, and you may watch others lock better entries while you chase.

The shutdown also threatens delays to key U.S. economic data , including Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers, creating more uncertainty for global markets and pushing the dollar lower. Bullion is now up more than 47% this year, on track for the biggest annual gain since 1979. The surge has been fueled by central bank buying and heavy inflows into gold-backed ETFs after the Federal Reserve resumed interest rate cuts. September ETF inflows were the largest in three years, according to Bloomberg data. Spot gold traded at $3,864.60 per ounce at 1:11 p.m. in Singapore after closing 0.7% higher on Tuesday, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index flat. Global markets are trading sideways as shutdown reality deepens The shutdown began after two failed attempts by the Republican-controlled Senate to pass a temporary spending bill on Tuesday. Democrats want the measure to include an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits for millions of Americans. President Donald Trump had called a government shutdown “probably likely” and said, “I didn’t see them bend even a little bit.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told employees to prepare for a potential funding lapse, as Cryptopolitam reported. Trump also suggested his administration could take major actions during the shutdown, including cutting government benefits for “large numbers of people.” Both Republican and Democratic proposals failed, and the Senate adjourned after last-ditch votes. Silver also rallied, jumping as much as 2% to $47.5598 per ounce, less than 5% from its all-time high. The metal is up over 60% this year, driven by the same macro forces lifting gold as well as tight supply after years of deficits. Silver was up almost 1% after losing 0.6% in the previous session. Platinum and palladium both fell. The euro rose 0.3% to $1.1767, the highest since September 24. The dollar slipped 0.3% to 147.46, its lowest since September 19, extending a three-day slide of 1.2%. U.S. futures reflected the strain. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 192 points, or 0.41%, while S&P 500 futures dropped 0.44% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.51%. Europe’s FTSE gained 0.54% to 9,350.43, while the SMI, HEX, IBEX 35, and DAX were unchanged. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.16%, and the Topix dropped 1.71%. The Reserve Bank of India held rates at 5.5% as expected, with the Nifty 50 up 0.31% and the Sensex up 0.22%. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.79%, and the Kosdaq gained 0.56%. The Taiwan Weighted Index led Asian gains, adding 1.14% as healthcare and tech stocks drove the rise. Chip giant TSMC jumped 2.3% after Nvidia’s market cap passed $4.5 trillion. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.26%. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. Oil prices also moved. Brent crude futures for December delivery rose 28 cents to $66.31 per barrel at 0500 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 26 cents to $62.63 per barrel. The stock market has typically glided by previous government shutdowns, but analysts say this one could be riskier given the slew of economic factors at play. Though investors are still concerned about a slowing labor market and inflation risks as well as historically elevated stock valuations and market concentration levels. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated Tuesday that the shutdown will result in the furlough of about 750,000 federal employees. Over the weekend, Trump threatened mass firings of federal workers under a shutdown. Get seen where it counts.

House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, in a letter Tuesday to current SEC Chair Paul Atkins, pointed to an OIG report this September that indicated the Gensler-led SEC may not have operated with “integrity” between 2021 and 2025. Hill added that the committee is cooperating with the OIG “to understand their report better, to get clarity around unanswered questions, and to identify other areas in need of oversight.” Lawmakers slam Gensler over double standards The letter, also signed by Representatives Ann Wagner, Dan Meuser, and Bryan Steil, lambasted Gensler for applying standards to firms his own agency did not live up to. Gensler, for example, fined financial firms more than $400 million in penalties for “widespread record-keeping failures” in 2023, even as the SEC failed to preserve its own communication records due to IT mismanagement. At the beginning of the month, the Office of Inspector General [OIG], an independent office within the SEC, noted the agency’s tech office “implemented a poorly understood and automated policy that caused an enterprise wipe of Gensler’s government-issued mobile device.” The office stated that this, in turn, led to the loss of text messages between October 2022 and September 2023. During that period, the SEC raised multiple cases against crypto firms, including Coinbase and Binance. Coinbase recently asked a federal court to compel an “expedited proper search” of Gensler’s deleted texts. Gensler’s recordkeeping and security lapses fuel SEC credibility concerns Lawmakers also raised Gensler’s prior use of a personal email for business while he was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC’s sister agency “Collectively, these incidents, along with the OIG’s findings, raise serious concerns about former Chair Gensler’s and OIT’s [Office of Information Technology] compliance with federal recordkeeping laws, transparency obligations, and the integrity of agency oversight,” they said . The loss was exacerbated by poor change management, insufficient backup systems, unattended system alerts, and unpatched vendor software flaws, the OIG said. Deleted messages included discussions of SEC enforcement actions against specific crypto companies, which might have influenced how the regulator decided cases that shaped the industry. Crypto advocates have long accused Gensler of leading a Biden administration campaign to limit U.S. banking access for digital-asset firms and suing the sector aggressively in the process. The SEC’s credibility has already been called into question in the past following a security breach in January 2024 when hackers took over its official X account and falsely claimed that it had approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. X said later that the regulator had failed to enable two-factor authentication. In related developments, the SEC staff has opened up to allowing investment advisers to use state trust firms to custody digital assets. As reported by Cryptopolitan , a rare no-action letter from the SEC’s Division of Investment Management was issued on Tuesday, noting that it wouldn’t suggest the watchdog take disciplinary action if advisers used state trust firms as a crypto custodian. Law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett had sent a letter to the Division on Tuesday, seeking confirmation that registered financial institutions, such as venture capital firms, are free to custody crypto assets and will not face enforcement action by the regulator if they take the move. This is the second no-action letter from the SEC this week, showing the agency’s hands-off approach to crypto enforcement under the Trump administration. The White House has vowed to ease regulatory oversight of the sector to draw firms and projects to America. Get seen where it counts.

ChatGPT Makes Bold Claims,https://cryptopotato.com/how-high-can-xrp-go-as-uptober-kicks-off-chatgpt-makes-bold-claims/,"The historically bearish month for the cryptocurrency markets – September – is over, and it provided some enhanced volatility. Now, though, all eyes are on October, which is also referred to as ‘Uptober’ in the digital asset community due to the gains registered in the past. So, what’s next for XRP? Here’s ChatGPT’s take. XRP in Uptober The previous month began on the wrong foot for Ripple’s native token, which quickly dumped to the crucial support level at $2.70. It bounced off rather well in the following weeks and peaked at $3.20 on September 13 after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the first time in 2025. That was all she wrote in terms of gains, though, as the historical bearishness of September kicked in and drove the entire market south. XRP revisited the aforementioned support on a couple more occasions, but it managed to hold. It reclaimed some ground by September 30 and actually finished the month slightly in the green (around 3%). October is finally here, and Q4 has started, which usually goes well for the cryptocurrency markets. ChatGPT agreed with the overall bullish sentiment for the new month and quarter. In terms of monthly performance, it noted that XRP tends to do well in past Octobers, which is why the community can hope for some gains. Its most bullish case sees XRP surging beyond $4.50 and up to $6. It admitted that this is a bit unlikely, given the fact that the asset would need to double its value to reach the higher target, but noted that some news catalysts, such as a spot XRP ETF approval, could send it flying. The current odds on Polymarket for such a green light by the end of the year are close to 100%, even after the US government shutdown . Ripple ETF Approval Odds on Polymarket The more likely scenario for XRP, according to ChatGPT, is to peak somewhere between $3.50 and $4.50, which would still represent a solid surge in October. “If I were to place a probabilistic target, I’d lean toward $3.50 to $4.50 as the upper bound for October (assuming the ETF approvals happen and crypto sentiment remains supportive). It’s unlikely (though not impossible) that XRP would hit a massive new all-time high within a month unless multiple catalysts align perfectly.” The Warning Despite the bullish predictions above, the AI solution also warned investors about the possibility of a pullback due to the crowd’s expectations and hype. It reminded of Warren Buffett’s immortal financial words that people should be greedy when others are fearful and vice versa. As such, it cautioned that XRP, alongside the rest of the market, could correct in the following month(s) in contrast to what many anticipate – a massive run in Q4. The retracement for XRP could be intensified if the SEC actually surprises everyone and rejects the ETF applications, the trading volumes disappear, or there’s a bigger market-wide downturn, ChatGPT added.

We believe that the Sharpe Ratio’s use of total realized volatility may have overestimated bitcoin’s true risk. As of September 15, bitcoin’s Omega Ratio over the previous year was 1.29, upside returns outpacing downside returns by 29%. By David Puell Introduction This article is written not only for investors with an intermediate-to-advanced degree of knowledge about financial metrics, but also for bitcoin skeptics whose concerns persist even as the asset is maturing in institutional markets. During its 16-year history, conservative investors have observed that: “Bitcoin is too volatile,” or, more specifically, “Bitcoin’s returns are not worth the anxiety associated with its volatility.” In our view, such observations miss the nuances of bitcoin’s price history: they fail to separate its upside reward from its downside risk . As a result, we believe many, if not most, investors have underallocated to bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios. In this article, I review and explore techniques to gauge bitcoin’s risk relative to its reward and to assess its portfolio viability relative to other asset classes. The Sharpe Ratio A widely regarded financial metric, the Sharpe Ratio assesses the potential risk relative to reward of an asset, helping analysts and investors with financial modeling and portfolio optimization. Designed to measure the unit of reward per unit of risk, the Sharpe Ratio is constructed as follows: Interestingly, the Sharpe Ratio equates risk to an asset’s total realized volatility over time. While somewhat controversial, that notion is widely applied in financial analysis. 1 How does the Sharpe Ratio measure bitcoin’s risk relative to its reward? The chart below captures bitcoin’s mean returns and realized volatility—the numerator and denominator of the Sharpe Ratio, respectively—on a yearly basis over the past 14 years. 2 As of September 15, 2025, bitcoin’s yearly returns and volatility have averaged 76.4% and 44.1%, respectively. In other words, the rewards have been “worth” the risk. Source: Glassnode, as of September 15, 2025.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. That said, we believe that the Sharpe Ratio’s use of total realized volatility may have overestimated bitcoin’s true risk. Why, we ask, should the volatility of upside returns penalize risk-adjusted returns? Financial research offers two meaningful alternatives that adjust for the volatility of upside returns. The Sortino Ratio Contrary to the Sharpe Ratio, the Sortino Ratio assumes that the risk of holding an asset is denoted by the downside volatility realized over time, as follows: In this measurement of risk-adjusted returns, the reward is penalized only by the volatility associated with negative returns—the true “pain” of holding bitcoin long term. Compared to total volatility, downside volatility is always lower, as shown in the red compared to the blue shaded areas below. 3 Source: Glassnode, as of September 15, 2025. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The chart above illustrates that the Sharpe Ratio demands a higher hurdle rate of return to break above a minimum acceptable risk compared to Sortino. In turn, the table below illustrates how, on average, the volatility hurdle implied by the Sharpe Ratio (79.7%) tends to be roughly one and a half times the volatility hurdle of the Sortino Ratio (47%). This implies a “premium” penalty of 70.5%—or 32.7 percentage points (pp)—presented by the Sharpe Ratio over the Sortino Ratio. Sharpe(Total Volatility) Sortino(Downside Volatility) Absolute Premium Relative Premium 2011 177.8% 94.1% 83.7 pp 88.9% 2012 79.6% 49.8% 29.8 pp 59.8% 2013 145.2% 87.2% 58 pp 66.5% 2014 75.2% 46.3% 28.9 pp 62.4% 2015 69.1% 45.5% 23.6 pp 51.9% 2016 48.5% 30% 18.5 pp 61.7% 2017 93.7% 50.2% 43.5 pp 86.7% 2018 81.5% 53.3% 28.2 pp 52.9% 2019 68.1% 38.3% 29.8 pp 77.8% 2020 73.2% 48.7% 24.5 pp 50.3% 2021 80.2% 46.2% 34 pp 73.6% 2022 63.6% 42.3% 21.3 pp 50.4% 2023 43.7% 21.8% 21.9 pp 100.5% 2024 53.3% 28.3% 25 pp 88.3% 2025 (YTD) 44.1% 23.7% 20.4 pp 86.1% Average 79.7% 47% 32.7 pp 70.5% Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025, based on data from Glassnode, as of September 15, 2025.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. As of September 15, 2025, bitcoin’s year-over-year Sharpe and Sortino ratios were 1.7 and 3.2, respectively. The Omega Ratio Instead of accounting only for mean-variance (Sharpe) or downside deviation (Sortino), we now add the Omega Ratio to our analysis because of the clarity it lends to measuring the entirety of the return distribution. The Omega Ratio evaluates the probability-weighted gains versus losses, making it especially valuable in non-normal or fat-tailed distributions, such as crypto or assets where extreme outcomes are common. This simplified version of the Omega Ratio, also known as Gain/Loss Ratio compares bitcoin’s cumulative positive returns against its cumulative negative returns, defining every unit of reward per unit of risk in a direct, linear fashion. In this case, we assume 0% returns as the minimum “hurdle” the investor would expect for holding the asset. As with the Sortino Ratio, we believe the Omega Ratio portrays a more accurate measurement of risk-adjusted returns.

Bitcoin In A Portfolio: Sortino And Omega Case Studies Bitcoin’s Risk-Adjusted Returns We begin this case study by comparing bitcoin’s various risk-adjusted return ratios against those of four major asset classes: US equities, US bonds, US real estate, and gold. First, in the table below, we show how bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is higher, on average, than other asset classes over various 5-year periods.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. That said, if we compare bitcoin’s Sortino Ratio to that of the other asset classes, the difference—or “delta”—is even more striking, with bitcoin increasing its gap considerably when compared to equities, the second top performer. Note: The indices used as asset class representatives for the portfolio optimizations in this study are MSCI US Broad Market Index (MZUSB, US stocks), Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index (LBUFTRUU, US bonds), MSCI US REIT Index (RMZ, US real estate), and LBMA Gold Price PM (GOLDLNPM, gold).

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Lastly, bitcoin’s Omega Ratio, similar to the Sortino Ratio, also results in a larger gap between the cryptocurrency and its legacy counterparts, as shown below.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Based on the averages, the difference—“delta”—between each bitcoin risk-adjusted return ratio and the second best per table equals +0.22 pp for Sharpe, +2.18 pp for Sortino, and +0.85 pp for Omega—confirming how bitcoin tends to stand out even more among asset classes when discounting penalties for upward volatility. Portfolio Optimization Next, for the purposes of portfolio optimization, we believe that bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns are best measured by penalizing only for downside risks—by compartmentalizing, in other words, the realized “pain” or cost of holding the asset from the benefits of upward momentum. As a result, we will again use the Sortino and Omega Ratios to assess bitcoin’s place in an optimal portfolio, using the Sharpe Ratio as our benchmark. Furthermore, our comparison frames bitcoin as a component in a portfolio that also comprises representatives of the typical major asset classes—once again, equities, bonds, real estate, and gold—using the Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega Ratios across a rolling 5-year window between year-end from December 2015 to 2024. For the purposes of running these hypothetical portfolio scenarios, we assume the typical risk-free rate, with target expected returns for Sortino and Omega of 0%—an absolute minimum hurdle. Allocation In Max Sharpe Optimization Allocation In Max Sortino Optimization Allocation In Max Omega Optimization 2011-2015 0.8% 6.7% 4.5% 2012-2016 1.0% 8.9% 8.3% 2013-2017 1.0% 10.0% 8.4% 2014-2018 2.7% 4.2% 3.2% 2015-2019 4.3% 5.1% 4.1% 2016-2020 4.7% 5.4% 2.5% 2017-2021 5.5% 4.0% 2.1% 2018-2022 7.0% 4.5% 3.0% 2019-2023 20.8% 23.1% 21.7% 2020-2024 27.0% 21.1% 18.2% Average 7.5% 9.3% 7.6% Note: The green cells in the table represent when the Sortino or Omega Ratio is higher than the Sharpe Ratio. The indices used as asset class representatives for the portfolio optimizations in this study are MSCI US Broad Market Index (MZUSB, US stocks), Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index (LBUFTRUU, US bonds), MSCI US REIT Index (RMZ, US real estate), and LBMA Gold Price PM (GOLDLNPM, gold).

We hope that this article helps investors measure bitcoin’s risk in all its nuances, potentially serving as a guide for those seeking to measure risk when assessing bitcoin, or any asset, as a part of their portfolio. Important Information Regarding Bitcoin Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and the market for bitcoin is subject to rapid changes and uncertainty. Bitcoin is largely unregulated and bitcoin investments may be more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than more regulated investments. Bitcoin is subject to unique and substantial risks, including significant price volatility and lack of liquidity, and theft. Bitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for bitcoin, and other factors. There is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain its value over the long term. ARK strongly encourages any investor considering an investment in bitcoin or any other digital asset to consult with a financial professional before investing. All statements made regarding bitcoin are strictly beliefs and points of view held by ARK and are not recommendations by ARK to buy, sell or hold bitcoin. Historical results are not indications of future results. Footnotes As an example, an article by Voss and Howard clarifies how volatility does not necessarily equal risk. See Voss, J., and T. Howard. 2017. “The Active Equity Renaissance: New Frontiers of Risk.” Enterprising Investor. CFA Institute. Mean returns are annualized by multiplying by 365 and realized volatility is annualized by multiplying standard deviation times the root of 365. In this section, mean returns are annualized by multiplying by 365 and realized volatilities are annualized by multiplying the respective standard deviations times the root of 365. We annualize the ratios by dividing the unscaled mean returns by the standard deviation, then multiplying the result by the root of 365.

On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens confirmed the purchase in an X post earlier today. Tether Continues To Stack Bitcoin Tether, the issuer of the top USD-pegged stablecoin USDT, today purchased another 8,888 BTC, increasing its total Bitcoin reserves to new highs. Onchain Lens said that Tether acquired it on the last day of Q3, 2025. Following the Bitcoin purchase, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the acquisition in an X post, saying, “yeah.” With today’s purchase, Tether’s total holdings now stand at almost 10,940 BTC. Tether’s total BTC holdings have propelled it to second position among private companies with the most BTC reserves. The list is currently led by Block One, which currently holds 164,000 BTC, worth roughly $18.5 billion. In the overall list, including public companies, Tether is now ranked third, behind Strategy, which leads the list by far, holding 640,031 BTC on its balance sheet, according to data from Coingecko. It should be noted that this is not the first time that Tether has acquired such a huge amount of BTC. The company purchased a similar amount of BTC and transferred it to its wallet at the end of Q1, 2025. To recall, Tether started buying BTC as part of its reserves back in September 2022. Subsequently, in May 2023, the firm announced that it would allocate up to 15% of its net profits each quarter to purchase more BTC. Since announcing its BTC buying strategy, Tether has consistently enhanced its BTC reserves as part of its long-term diversification strategy. It is worth noting that Tether-backed Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One also holds around 43,514 BTC currently. Tether’s Bitcoin reserve wallet address, starting with “bc1qj” is also among the top ten single address holders of BTC. The wallet trails several centralized exchange cold wallets, such as those of Binance. The Rush For Accumulating BTC Tether’s move to accumulate BTC is not an isolated incident. An increasing number of firms have been actively purchasing BTC over the last few years, seeing the digital asset’s extraordinary price appreciation in a relatively short period. For instance, Strategy recently added to its already high amount of BTC holdings, purchasing 196 BTC. Similarly, Cyprus-based ship-owning firm Robin Energy recently made its first BTC acquisition, as it bought the flagship cryptocurrency worth $5 million. The trend of companies buying BTC in large amounts is likely to dry up the asset’s active circulating supply, as confirmed in a recent report by Fidelity. This could put further upside price pressure on BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $113,219, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Acquisition|Bitcoin Adoption|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|stablecoin|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 07:00:03

Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest Kazakhstan Adoption Pushes BNB To $1,000 Nearly two weeks after breaking above the $1,000 milestone for the first time, BNB is attempting to hold this key area as support following the recent market pullback. The cryptocurrency has recorded a massive multi-month rally this quarter, surging 54% since the July opening. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has climbed 16% from the start-of-September lows, turning the crucial $800-$900 zone into support before surging toward its latest all-time high (ATH) of $1,083 nine days ago. Nonetheless, the altcoin’s massive run was halted during the end-of-month pullback, which saw most cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), hit multi-week lows. BNB dropped over 10% from last week’s high, losing the critical $1,000 breakout level on Friday. During the pullback, the altcoin retested the $930 level as support, bouncing off this level over the weekend and reclaiming the crucial barrier yesterday morning. The recent price surge was driven by Kazakhstan’s announcement of its investment in the altcoin. On Monday, Kazakhstan announced the launch of its first crypto reserve, the Alem Crypto Fund, aimed at long-term investment in digital assets. According to the statement, Binance Kazakhstan is the strategic partner of the fund, which was established by the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan. As part of the partnership, Alem Crypto Fund made BNB its first investment. Nurkhat Kushimov, General Manager of Binance Kazakhstan, stated that “The fund’s choice of BNB as its first digital asset highlights the trust in the Binance ecosystem and marks a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan.” Price Discovery Continuation In Q4? It’s worth noting that the BNB Chain ecosystem also saw a strong performance, with multiple projects built on the network leading in terms of profitability. As reported by NewsBTC, BNB Chain projects led Binance Wallet’s top ten Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs) list with up to 2,000x historical returns, while BSC projects led the top five Alpha trading volume rankings. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades suggested that neither BNB nor BSC-related tokens’ rally is over yet, as the “market is eager for a narrative or chain to gamble on.” Analyst Ali Martinez affirmed that the token “still has many legs up,” suggesting that successfully holding this level could target new highs. The analyst previously stated that BNB’s price targets the $1,200-$1,300 area as part of its bullish breakout from its macro range. Turning the current area into support in the higher timeframes could set the stage for a price discovery continuation with a 20%-30% run in the coming months. On the contrary, a rejection from this level could see the price retest the $900-$930 area again.

As of this writing, BNB is trading at $1,002, a 1.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-a-flush-out-is-better-than-a-quick-pump-heres-what-it-means/,"Technical analyst Egrag Crypto has once again provided an in-depth perspective on XRP’s price movement, emphasizing the importance of structural health in the market rather than short-lived rallies. His analysis suggests that the asset could experience another downward flush before any significant upward momentum, a move he considers more sustainable in the long run. #XRP – A Flush Out is Better Than a Quick Pump! Same Stance: My long-term view on #XRP hasn’t changed, so do not start crying in the comments section. It’s important to understand the context of each post and the time frame I’m discussing. Fair Value GAP Analysis I… pic.twitter.com/XtcLAZV60i — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 29, 2025 Probabilities of Market Scenarios According to Egrag, the probability of XRP undergoing a flush-out before resuming its uptrend sits at around 70%. He views this outcome as more favorable than the alternative, which he assigns a 30% likelihood. In the less probable scenario, XRP could surge immediately, but he warns that such a move would risk a sharp correction. From his perspective, a more measured decline followed by recovery would create a stronger base for growth. The Role of the Fair Value Gap Central to his analysis is the concept of the fair value gap (FVG), which he identifies between $2.35 and $2.40. Egrag argues that markets often return to these gaps as part of a process known as mean reversion, where prices align back to their average or fair value. In this case, the FVG acts as both a target and a potential support zone. He highlights that once this range is filled, it could serve as a foundation for a more aggressive upward move, establishing a stronger market structure. Time Frame Considerations Egrag bases his current outlook on the three-day chart, a time frame he consistently uses for long-term clarity while still accounting for short-term volatility. He recalls a previous gap that took 129 days to fill, drawing a parallel to the present setup. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While not providing a specific timeline for the upcoming move, he notes that if the pattern repeats, the market could be approaching an important turning point by mid-November. Key Levels and Expectations In terms of price levels, the analyst identifies $2.65 as a near-term area to monitor. If that point holds, it could suggest the market has found temporary stability. However, his preferred scenario is for XRP to dip further into the $2.30 to $2.40 zone before initiating what he refers to as the final leg upward. He stresses that this potential flush would not weaken the asset’s long-term trajectory but would instead reinforce its structural integrity. Egrag Crypto’s perspective maintains a cautiously optimistic tone, balancing the short-term possibility of a deeper correction with the longer-term potential for significant gains. By focusing on the fair value gap as both a technical target and a structural support, his analysis emphasizes sustainability over immediate price surges.

Here's the Latest Altcoin Listed,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-upbit-releases-new-listing-announcement-heres-the-latest-altcoin-listed/,"South Korea-based global cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced support for a new digital asset. According to the announcement, Somnia (SOMI) will be listed with KRW, BTC, and USDT trading pairs. Upbit Launches New Transaction Support for Somnia (SOMI) Deposits for SOMI will open within 2 hours of the announcement, while transaction support will begin at 16:00 on October 1st. The exchange warned investors to be careful with their network selection. SOMI can only be deposited and withdrawn via the Somnia network. Transfers made via other networks will not be accepted, and refunds may take longer. Furthermore, transactions will only be processed through “self-wallet verified addresses.” Upbit has also implemented some temporary restrictions for investor protection. Buy orders will be restricted for the first five minutes after trading begins, while sell orders 10% below the previous day's closing price will not be allowed for the same period. Additionally, only limit orders will be valid for 2 hours after the trade is opened. The Somnia network is described as an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain optimized for high-throughput applications. The project stands out with its capacity for millions of transactions per second, sub-second finality, and parallel processing infrastructure. Somnia's native token, SOMI, will be used for staking, gas payments, and governance mechanisms. Experts say that SOMI's Upbit listing will increase its market visibility and attract interest among Korean investors. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin is currently performing positively and eyeing new weekly highs while altcoins continue to falter. US government officially shuts down, analysts warn of downward risks The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years. This latest development comes after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the lights on. While each shutdown differs, functions that are critical to protect lives and property are typically deemed essential and stay open. In the past, shutdowns have affected immigration hearings, while also delaying federal lending to homebuyers and small businesses. Analysts have cautioned traders about the ongoing events, as many believe assets could react to the government shutdown. Bitcoin maintains its price above $114K and could rally higher in the near term. However, most altcoins have turned red despite recording some gains earlier this week. Analysts at Bitfinex pointed out that the shutdown would halt the release of key economic indicators such as the jobs data and CPI inflation. The delay in these reports could cause volatility across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The analysts added that, For markets, the immediate risk is confidence erosion and data blind spots, rather than systemic financial instability. Bitcoin eyes fresh upside as support at $113K holds Despite the US government shutdown, Bitcoin’s price has remained above $114k and could rally higher in the near term. The BTC/USD 4H Chart remains bearish and efficient, but could switch bullish if the current market conditions persist. BTC is up by nearly 2% since the start of the week and is now trading at $114,522. It closed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,402 on Tuesday and could rally higher towards the $117k resistance level over the next few hours or days. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) had a bullish crossover earlier this week, suggesting that buyers are gaining control of the market. The RSI of 66 also shows that BTC is currently in the bullish region. If the 50-day EMA at $113,402 continues to hold as support, the leading cryptocurrency could rally towards the next major resistance level at $117K in the near term. The $120k psychological mark remains a strong resistance level at the moment. However, if the market negatively reacts to the government shutdown, Bitcoin and other major assets could record losses. This could see Bitcoin fail to hold the support around the 50-day EMA and close below, allowing it to test the next daily support level at $107,245 over the next few days. The current market conditions remain choppy, with no clear direction. With the fourth quarter commencing, traders are already looking forward to key economic indicators that could determine Bitcoin’s performance over the next few months.

52509164,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=824500,1759303155,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52509164.jpeg,"South Korea , U.S. reach consensus not to tamper forex rates for trade advantage",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/u-s-south-korea-pledge-not-to-fx-rates/,"The U.S. and South Korea agreed on Wednesday not to manipulate foreign exchange rates for trade advantage, but reserve them for combating excessive volatility. The decision doesn’t include a bilateral currency swap line. According to a joint statement released on October 1, the U.S. and South Korea reaffirmed their commitment to avoid manipulating the international monetary system, as outlined in the IMF Articles of Agreement. The initiative aims to present an effective balance of payments adjustment and unfair competitive advantage. Both parties aim to prevent unfair competitive advantage Washington and Seoul also agreed that any macroprudential or capital flow measures will not target exchange rates for trade advantage. The decision from both countries mirrors an agreement between the U.S. and Japan announced in August. In Japan’s deal, there was no mention that foreign exchange rates had to be market-determined. Unlike the Japan deal, the U.S.-South Korea agreement stipulates that both countries will continue to monitor currency market stability. The statement also highlighted that government investment vehicles will invest abroad for risk-adjusted return and diversification purposes, and not to target the exchange rate for competitive purposes. South Korea’s National Pension Service, the world’s third-largest pension fund, was not explicitly mentioned in the statement. The fund has emerged as a point of concern during Seoul’s trade negotiations with Washington. The report revealed that the U.S. has kept South Korea on its list of countries to monitor for their foreign exchange policies. Seoul was removed from the list in November 2023 for the first time since April 2016, but reappeared in November 2024. According to the report , South Korea utilizes the NPS funds for exchange rate intervention, with the U.S. stating that its use of funds for foreign exchange hedging could impact the Korean won’s value. The U.S. Department of the Treasury noted in its foreign exchange report released in June that there was a surge in foreign assets of the NPS and its swap line with the Bank of Korea. The report raised concerns among market participants that it might be regarded as a tool for currency intervention. Seoul also requested the exclusion of a bilateral currency swap line to address the foreign exchange implications of a $350 billion investment package agreed by both parties during trade negotiations in July. “Since the agreement sets mutual standards for foreign exchange policy with the U.S., it can be interpreted to mean that as long as these standards are upheld, South Korea is unlikely to be designated a currency manipulator.” -Jung Yue-jin, Chief Executive of South Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. The U.S. and South Korea agreed that market intervention should be used to tackle excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates. Both countries also agreed that market interventions would be considered equally appropriate for combating excessively volatile or disorderly depreciation or appreciation. Seoul plans monthly exchange of market operations with the U.S. The statement also reveals that Seoul agreed to exchange its market intervention operations with the U.S. every month. A South Korean official also mentioned that public disclosures will continue to be made every quarter, with a three-month delay. South Korea will disclose its foreign exchange reserves data and forward positions on a monthly basis to enhance communication and monitor foreign exchange market developments. The country will also reveal its currency composition of central bank reserves on an annual basis, despite the data already being publicly available. Seoul has maintained currency policy consultations with the U.S. through a channel between finance officials since it was put on the agenda at the opening round of trade negotiations in April. The country’s Ministry of Finance acknowledged that the latest initiative reaffirms the importance of close communication and mutual trust between the two countries’ financial authorities in ensuring foreign exchange market stability. Both countries agreed in July to reduce U.S. tariffs on Korean imports, including automobiles, from 25% to 15%. South Korea also pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S. as part of the deal, but the initiative has stalled due to Seoul’s concerns over the foreign exchange implications.

Bitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out. Total market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound. The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET). “The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk. “This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said. Jobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing. That usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added. Market structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations. “The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.” Kuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.” “On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted. Ethereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review. News around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months. Regulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves. Elsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-01 07:25:05

Since the majority of investors are revaluing their investments, the spotlight automatically falls on newer utility-based projects with far higher upside potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the better ones. Now priced at just $0.035 in presale, Mutuum Finance is building a strong decentralized finance platform with emphasis on peer-to-peer and pooled lending with the freedom of earning yield while still holding asset custody. The project has staking rewards with flexibility, deflationary tokenomics model, and genuine real-world usage aside from speculation madness, all the ingredients in favor of rapid adoption. With well over 16,670 holders already on board and more than $16.6 million worth of funds raised before its exchange listing, investors project MUTM’s initial growth path to dwarf that of veteran altcoins like SOL in 2025, thereby emerging as a top choice among explosive potential-seeking investors. Solana Bulls Take Command as Price Bounces Back From Crucial Demand Zone Having lost 13% during the week, Solana (SOL) is showing new life, with bulls successfully keeping a decisive demand zone at bay. The price dipped below $190, the lower side of a key support zone, before moving up towards $205, signaling new buying and a potential change in trend. Unless SOL dips to the $173–$186 zone, the positive trend is expected to continue unchallenged, with upside targets of $230, $242, $254, and $262 in contention. While Solana’s technicals are undoubtedly on the bulls’ side, most investors have also moved to newer growth assets, a move that has fueled meteoric interest in Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on its record-breaking run in its sixth presale phase. The project already hit 16,670 registered members and achieved more than $16.6 million, a record high for both, and is demonstrating growing belief in the marketplace for its long-term vision. Investors seeking sustainable returns and long-term value will find Mutuum Finance’s rapidly growing ecosystem an investment worth considering. Security is also one of the key cornerstones in Mutuum Finance’s vision. In the effort to develop a secure and strong ecosystem, the project has collaborated with CertiK to launch a bug bounty program with a total reward pool of $50,000. The project categorizes vulnerabilities into four levels, such as critical, major, minor, and low, and provides a solid framework for discovery and avoidance of potential issues before impacting users. The platform also includes a remarkably robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation architecture that dynamically responds to real-time collateral volatility. In addition to this, an additional layer of security is achieved through the imposition of a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier on riskier forms of collateral. Security and transparency designed infrastructure makes Mutuum Finance a stable, secure, and robust DeFi platform designed for long-term resilience and prosperity. High-Upside Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is firmly establishing itself as one of the most robust utility-driven cryptos for 2025, bringing in more than $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and more than 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. As Solana (SOL) bounces back from a 13% weekly decline, MUTM’s functional real-world DeFi application, flexible LTV model, and security-focused network are gaining good traction among retail and whale investors. Value seekers interested in placing high-upside wagers and long-term value appreciation will be eager to grab Mutuum Finance tokens before the presale cap is reached.

The coin rallied to the $80 range just days after breaking above the $56 resistance threshold. The most bullish expectations are for the rally to extend above $170. Currently, ZEC stands at its highest level since Q2 2022. Most of the ZEC price action comes from its Binance and KuCoin pairs, legacies from previous bull markets. ZEC launched before the rapid proliferation of tokens and was among the main privacy coins. The exchanges have retained their listings, despite a general trend of removing fully anonymous assets. Why is ZEC rallying? ZEC is trading with a slight premium on Binance, as well as the Rhea Finance DEX on Near Protocol. The current trading for ZEC uses its tokenized form, and not actual coins from the ZCash network. The trading is speculative, as not all protocols reflect the actual usage of the ZCash network. Since April, Binance recovered its ZEC withdrawals to the ZCash chain, meaning some of the recent trading may reflect true demand for the coins. Nearly 70% of ZEC trading is against USDT. The coin has lost its legacy trading venues and is hardly represented on Perp DEXs. Additionally, ZEC has also acquired a derivative market, mostly through Binance and Bybit. Some of the recent price action may be an attack on short positions. A larger proportion of traders shorted ZEC just before its recent rally, triggering a short squeeze. Is ZEC quantum-resistant? One of the reasons for interest in ZEC is its claims to quantum resistance. ZEC has been deemed resistant to currently available quantum technology , which may in theory decode legacy coins like BTC. The other reason for the ZEC rally is attention from Qubic, the mining project that previously targeted Monero. The Qubic mining pool took over Monero mining, also sparking a price rally. However, Qubic has since set its sights on mining DOGE, leaving ZEC behind. For now, ZEC does not have to deal with concerns of a reorg or a 51% attack , the typical MO of Qubic when demonstrating its mining technology. The involvement of Qubic’s mining pool also helped push Monero (XMR) to a permanently higher range. XMR has traded at the $297.60 range for the past month after years of hovering around $100.

While the hype is building up for the possibility of Ethereum crossing $10,000 by 2026, investor interest is expanding to the whole ecosystem rather than the giants. At the same time, newer projects such as Remittix (RTX) are consistently making progress. Launched at a mere $0.11 per token, analysts believe it can cross more than $5 by 2026, anticipating the growing popularity of investment in nascent stages. This alludes to how current networks and emerging projects are building the future of digital assets together. Ethereum Market Developments Ethereum remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies powering decentralized finance and Web3. Recent figures place ETH at $4,155.1, a 1.1% increase in a day. The asset’s market cap is now at $501.95 billion, with daily trading volume at $40.17 billion, up 29.61%. These figures confirm the network as the leader in decentralized exchanges, NFT platforms, and smart contracts. The strength of Ethereum continues to attract long-term investors looking for stability along with growth. With scaling solutions and Layer 2 answers on the increase, ETH remains in top of mind discussions on the best crypto to purchase now and the upcoming dominant altcoin. It is considered by many as a key barometer of the well-being of the overall crypto market. Remittix’s Growing Ecosystem With Ethereum continuing to advance, Remittix (RTX) has been a practicable low gas cost cryptocurrency project for real-world payments. RTX can be bought for $0.1130 per token, and more than 673 million tokens have been sold and more than $26.8 million in presale. As a cross-border transaction-based project, it constitutes both a Remittix DeFi project and a successful payments network. Remittix hit its presale milestone of $20 million recently, which revealed its first future CEX listing on BitMart. Within a short while after that, it broke $22 million, which revealed LBANK as its second future exchange listing. These actions are higher levels of accessibility for early stage crypto investment choices within utility-first tokens. Security, Utility, and Community One of Remittix milestones came when it was fully verified by CertiK as team and ranked as the #1 pre-launch token on the platform. This ranking highlights its focus on trust, transparency, and real-world adoption. In the meantime, the beta launch of the Remittix wallet continues, allowing community members to try fast transactions and low gas fees. Remittix has also begun a $250,000 giveaway and introduced a 15% reward referral scheme in USDT, one of the most vibrant next-gen crypto initiatives. With all of these qualities, Remittix is setting itself up to be more than a speculative buy—it is a utility crypto with real use designed for borderless payments and daily usage. Why Utility Matters in 2025 With the narrative growing around Ethereum’s long-term potential, projects like Remittix indicate another direction of the market—adoption driven by utility. Investors are searching more and more for the best crypto presale of 2025, low-gas-fee projects, and scalable solutions that have the capacity to support real-world demand. By bridging crypto and traditional banking in 30+ countries, Remittix is carving out its position alongside legacy networks like Ethereum. While ETH marches towards a $10,000 level by 2026, RTX is setting the stage at $0.1130, looking to offer valuable solutions in the world’s payment space. Both show how crypto innovation still swaps growth, stability, and utility in changing times.

Strong Entry into Ethereum and Bitcoin Spot ETFs: BlackRock Takes Leading Position Ethereum spot ETFs saw a total of $127 million in net inflows, while none of the nine listed funds experienced net outflows. The biggest inflow of the day was into BlackRock's ETHA ETF. ETHA alone attracted $127 million, bringing its historical total net inflow to $13.44 billion. This brings the total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs to $27.396 billion, equivalent to 5.41% of Ethereum's market capitalization. The historical total net inflow stands at $13.799 billion. Bitcoin spot ETFs also performed strongly on the same day, with total net inflows reaching $430 million and all 12 listed funds closing positive. BlackRock's IBIT ETF was the largest contributor. IBIT saw $199 million in inflows in a single day, bringing its total net inflow to $60.971 billion. Ark Invest and 21Shares' ARKB ETF came in second. ARKB saw $106 million in daily inflows, bringing its historical total to $2.271 billion. As of the latest data, the total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs has reached $150.771 billion, equivalent to approximately 6.6% of Bitcoin's market capitalization.

The Chinese account of Binance verified that the handle of @BNBCHAIN was hacked, and users should not like new posts. The account issued a warning that the official English-language BNB Chain account has been hacked. Attackers promoted a memecoin featuring CZ just two weeks after the creator commented that meme coins carry “utility” of memecoins. Hackers promote token CA via the compromised BNB Chain account. Source: X Along with the meme coin push , hackers shared links for free reward distribution through an airdrop event. One fraudulent post stated that users could receive early access to $BSC rewards if they participated within 24 hours. The links implicated in this scam led to phishing websites to acquire wallet credentials via Wallet Connect prompts. CZ warns about BNB Chain account compromise CZ responded directly on his personal X account, asking users to stay vigilant. He confirmed that a Binance security team had reached out to X, asking to suspend the compromised account, and is also working on takedown requests for the phishing domains. “The @BNBCHAIN account is compromised. The hacker posted links to phishing websites. Do NOT connect your wallet,” Zhao wrote, reinforcing his standard SAFU warning. He advised followers to exercise caution on all fronts, even when it is on official channels. Wider pattern of crypto account breaches The BNB Chain hack is one among a series of high-profile social media hacks in 2025. In February, the account of Pump.fun was stolen to advertise a fake governance token, and the account of a WIRED journalist was used to advertise a meme token. In March, the former president of Ghana, John Mahama, had his X profile used to advertise a fake Solana-based token called Solanafrica. In April, there were further cases where the account of a UK government minister, Lucy Powell, was hacked, in promotion of a fake community token. Following the breach, BNB fell 1.83% to $1,010 but managed to find support above the $1,000 support zone. Despite the setback, bulls still successfully defended the key level as the broader market headed into October on a positive note, with a brand given to it by traders: “ Uptober ” after a resilient September. On the other hand, BNB Chain saw the biggest inflow ever of stablecoins in a single 24-hour period. BNB also had a major breakout, and the $780-$800 resistance zone is now solid support. Analysts are pointing out that as long as the token is still trading above that range, momentum is heading toward higher price targets of $1,100 and $1,200.

The stalemate leaves agencies without money as the new fiscal year begins and threatens wide disruption, from air travel to public parks. About 800,000 workers, nearly 40% of the federal workforce, are expected to go without pay. A Shutdown That Feels Different The closure began at midnight on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to agree on a short-term measure to extend funding into fiscal 2026. It is the first shutdown since 2018, although this one comes with greater strain, as political talk of deeper cuts and even permanent layoffs looms over agencies already struggling with limited resources. Breaking News: The U.S. government has shut down, after Congress failed to pass a bill to keep federal funding flowing. Hundreds of thousands of workers are set to be sent home without pay, and a wide range of federal programs will be disrupted. https://t.co/q0caziSzXd pic.twitter.com/vEwubNgeNm — The New York Times (@nytimes) October 1, 2025 The Senate will revisit a Republican-backed funding plan, but progress looks unlikely without concessions from both parties. Until then, essential services continue on thin staffing while millions of Americans brace for fallout. Why Crypto Cares About Washington Gridlock Crypto is not directly tied to federal budgets, but it is not immune to the ripple effects. Shutdowns slow data releases, delay regulatory reviews and create a layer of uncertainty that unsettles investors. Analysts warn Bitcoin and Ethereum could be especially sensitive to swings, while smaller tokens may see sharper drops if volatility spikes. “Government shutdowns are not without precedence; should history be our guide, suggest little if any effects on markets,” said Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth at VeChain. He added that while the political noise feels louder, a solution is usually found. Crypto ETFs Could Face Delays Due to Shutdown One flashpoint is the timeline for spot crypto ETFs. In September, optimism grew that issuers including VanEck, 21Shares and Grayscale could secure approval for spot Solana ETFs in early October. That confidence followed SEC rule changes on Sept. 17 that streamlined the process and cut review times . Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas Seyffart put approval odds at 100% for this year. But Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store and host of ETF Prime, cautioned that the shutdown could throw off the schedule. Honestly the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their “clock” meaningless. That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready. https://t.co/5JtfTm82Wi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 29, 2025 Looking Back To Look Ahead The average shutdown runs about eight days. In past episodes, markets recovered quickly once federal functions restarted. But if this one drags on for weeks, it could stall momentum by pushing back decisions at the Federal Reserve or slowing approvals for new investment products. SEC Left Running On Skeleton Crew Existing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, approved in 2024 and 2025, continue trading without disruption. However, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets would now be operating with less than 10% of its usual staff. As a result, crypto ETFs are not treated as essential. This means S-1 filings and final approvals will remain on hold until funding returns. What Investors Should Expect Next The shutdown does not mean crypto ETF applications are cancelled, only delayed. If lawmakers strike a deal soon, approvals could arrive this quarter. However, if the stalemate drags on, the momentum built in September may fade. As a result, market sentiment could weaken heading into year-end.

While many investors have reacted positively to this significant investment, caution has emerged from industry experts like Jacob King, CEO of SwanDesk, who warns that this move may contribute to what he believes could be the “largest bubble in history.” Bitcoin’s True Value Could Be Below $1,000 In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), King raised serious concerns about the Bitcoin market, claiming that 80-90% of the total buy volume is artificially inflated. He argues that Tether essentially creates money “out of thin air,” injecting it into Bitcoin and thereby exacerbating the speculative environment. Despite the growing trend of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional accumulation of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, the cryptocurrency’s real value might be “far below $1,000.” Related Reading: Will October Crown Bitcoin Or Break It? Key Levels In Play This narrative has been ongoing for years, provoking varied responses within the community. One investor countered King’s assertion by asking why major institutional players, including sovereign ETFs and Fortune 500 companies, continue to invest in Bitcoin if such a large portion of the trading volume is deemed fake. His argument suggests that either these institutions are misinformed or that the real bubble lies within traditional fiat currencies rather than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. King refuted this notion, alleging that the idea of significant institutional investment in Bitcoin is largely “a myth.” He contended that most inflows into ETFs are driven by retail investors, not large institutions. Skepticism Vs. Optimism Further amplifying his skepticism, King criticized Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the largest publicly traded company holding over 600,000 BTC, describing it as a “leveraged Bitcoin casino.” He alleged that the company’s co-founder, Michael Saylor, has a history of inflating numbers during the dot-com bubble, suggesting that the current situation is a repetition of “past mistakes.” Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs In contrast, other experts like Quinten Francois view Tether’s recent Bitcoin purchase through a more optimistic lens. Francois highlights the US government’s push for stablecoin adoption via the GENIUS Act, which mandates that stablecoin issuers be licensed, transparent, and fully backed by US Treasuries. He argues that this regulatory framework could channel trillions in offshore Eurodollars into US bonds through stablecoins, effectively continuing quantitative easing but through these private entities rather than the Federal Reserve (Fed). At the time of writing, BTC is trading within the lower channel of its consolidation range at $113,200, with no clear indication of where prices will move next.

52510296,593600,1759305621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52510296.jpeg,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty To Rise For 7th Straight Adjustment Wednesday,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-rise-7th-adjustment-wednesday/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Difficulty is set to see yet another increase in the upcoming adjustment, resulting in a new record for the metric. Bitcoin Difficulty Will Reach A New ATH On Wednesday The “ Difficulty ” is a feature built into the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine blocks. The metric’s value changes about every two weeks in network “adjustments.” The Difficulty is fully controlled by the code that Satoshi wrote in, meaning that these adjustments happen without intervention from a human or an organization. The pseudonymous Bitcoin creator integrated one simple rule for the blockchain to follow: keep block time (that is, the average time it takes miners to find a block) consistent around 10 minutes. Satoshi added this feature to make sure that the growth in BTC’s supply, which happens every time miners receive block subsidy as compensation for mining a block, remains consistent. Whenever miners become faster at their task, the BTC network responds by upping its Difficulty just enough to slow the validators back down to the standard rate. Similarly, the chain has to drop the metric’s value if miners are struggling to keep up pace. In the last six adjustments, the network has raised its Difficulty, suggesting miners have continued to be faster than needed, as data from CoinWarz shows. As displayed in the above chart, five of these six previous positive adjustments all led to new all-time highs (ATHs) for the metric. This implies BTC mining has been the toughest it has ever been over the last couple of months. It would appear, however, that even six straight Difficulty increases haven’t been enough to slow the miners down, as the network is heading toward yet another positive adjustment. As is visible above, Bitcoin miners have produced blocks at an average time of 9.50 minutes per each since the last adjustment. This is 0.50 minutes faster than Satoshi’s optimal rate, so the chain is gearing up for a significant Difficulty increase of over 5% on Wednesday. This adjustment would take the indicator to a new ATH of 149.83 trillion hashes, extending the streak of jumps to seven. The seemingly never-ending run of Difficulty increases is a direct consequence of the relentless expansion that miners have recently been participating in, as the below chart from Blockchain.com shows. The 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate , a metric that tracks the total amount of computing power that miners have connected to the network, has been exploring new records for a while now. Miners have been leveraging the extra computing resources to continue to pump out blocks at extraordinary rates. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $113,500, up 1.6% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 08:00:21

BNB Chain X account compromised and used to distribute WalletConnect phishing links Attackers used look‑alike domains by swapping letters to imitate official sites Inferno Drainer attribution: phishing‑as‑a‑service active since 2022; nearly 4M followers exposed BNB Chain hacked: verified X account posted phishing WalletConnect links—don’t connect wallets. Read how to verify domains and stay safe now. SlowMist’s chief security officer said the phishing domains behind BNB Chain’s compromised X account are tied to the notorious Inferno Drainer group. What happened when BNB Chain’s official X account was compromised? BNB Chain hacked when attackers gained access to its verified X account and posted phishing links that asked users to connect wallets via fake WalletConnect prompts. The posts were shared from an account with nearly four million followers and were used to drive traffic to look‑alike domains designed to drain wallets. Source: Changpeng Zhao How did attackers disguise phishing domains to trick users? Attackers used homograph-style tricks—swapping visually similar letters such as the letter “i” for “l”—to make phishing domains appear legitimate. SlowMist’s chief information security officer (handle: 23pds) flagged the domain manipulation and linked the infrastructure to the Inferno Drainer phishing‑as‑a‑service network, which has supplied turnkey wallet‑draining sites since 2022. Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao confirmed the compromise and warned followers not to interact with malicious posts asking for WalletConnect approvals. Zhao said takedown requests for the phishing domains have been submitted and that BNB Chain’s security teams are coordinating with platform operators to restore the account. How can users verify WalletConnect links and avoid scams? Verify domains by checking spelling precisely, viewing full URLs, and confirming official announcements from project channels.

AI accelerates vulnerability discovery and exploitation Automated phishing and voice-synthesized social engineering reduce attack costs to pennies. Over 3% of total value locked was stolen in 2024; Immunefi has paid $100M+ in bounties. AI crypto attacks: learn defensive steps now with Immunefi insights — read best-practice countermeasures and adopt a unified security platform. What are AI crypto attacks and why do they matter? AI crypto attacks are instances where attackers use artificial intelligence to automate discovery, exploitation, and social engineering against blockchain projects. These attacks matter because they compress the time from finding a vulnerability to exploiting it, increasing theft risk and forcing projects to change how they secure code and infrastructure. How has AI changed vulnerability discovery and exploitation? AI tooling that once helped defenders is now widely available, enabling attackers to find and weaponize vulnerabilities rapidly. Immunefi CEO Mitchell Amador told COINOTAG that advanced auditing agents and automated scanners are no longer exclusive to security firms and can be replicated by state-linked groups and organized cybercrime. Automated scans and prompt-driven exploit generation reduce cost per attack to pennies, while AI-generated phishing calls and messages drastically improve social engineering success rates. Industry data shows over 3% of total value locked was stolen across the ecosystem in 2024, highlighting the real-world impact. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""AI crypto attacks are accelerating — Immunefi CEO on defenses"", ""description"": ""Immunefi warns AI has given attackers defender-grade tools, speeding discovery and exploitation.

Bug bounties and manual audits remain valuable but face limits. Immunefi has facilitated over $100 million in payouts to white-hat hackers and distributes $1M–$5M monthly, yet CEO Mitchell Amador says the approach has “hit the limits” due to scaling and incentive issues. Automated AI scanning catches common, low-hanging issues earlier, reducing the burden on manual reviews. However, subtle and context-dependent vulnerabilities still require deep human expertise, so hybrid models—AI-assisted audits plus targeted human review—are becoming the practical standard. How are attackers bypassing code security? Major incidents now often exploit non-code vectors: compromised front-ends, multi-sig misconfigurations, key-management failures, and sophisticated phishing. The $1.4 billion Bybit incident this year illustrated attackers replacing front-end multisig transactions rather than exploiting smart contract code. Immunefi emphasizes that a single large outlier hack each year follows a predictable distribution pattern; defending only code is insufficient without stronger infrastructure, governance, and human verification layers. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to defend against AI-driven crypto attacks"", ""description"": ""Practical steps projects can adopt to reduce exposure to AI-accelerated exploits."", ""image"": [], ""estimatedCost"": { ""@type"": ""MonetaryAmount"", ""currency"": ""USD"", ""value"": ""Varies"" }, ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Embed AI into CI/CD and repositories"", ""text"": ""Integrate automated AI auditing agents into GitHub repositories and CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities before code reaches production."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Adopt whitelist-only access controls"", ""text"": ""Implement whitelist-only policies for internal resources to reduce successful spear-phishing and lateral movement."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Deploy multi-sig manual review for significant transactions"", ""text"": ""Assign trusted, security-focused reviewers to manually confirm high-value transactions before execution."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Combine AI scanning with targeted human audits"", ""text"": ""Use hybrid models where AI handles scale and humans focus on context-dependent, complex vulnerabilities."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can AI tools be used by criminal groups to hack crypto projects?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

AI can generate convincing voice and message impersonations at scale for negligible cost. Immunefi’s CEO noted that AI-driven calls and prompts can be executed for pennies, enabling mass spear-phishing campaigns that dramatically raise successful compromise rates. Should every project adopt AI auditing tools? Yes—integrating AI into development pipelines is recommended. Immunefi predicts widespread CI/CD integration will drive a precipitous drop in exploit volume within one to two years, while hybrid human checks remain essential for complex decisions. Key Takeaways AI levels the playing field : Defender-grade tools are now accessible to attackers, increasing speed of exploitation. Hybrid defenses work best : Combine AI scanning with targeted human expertise and manual review processes. Broader attack surface : Focus beyond smart contracts—multi-sig, front-ends, phishing, and governance are high-risk areas. Conclusion AI has fundamentally changed both offensive and defensive security in crypto. Immunefi and other security leaders recommend embedding AI into CI/CD, enforcing strict access controls, and building unified security platforms to defend against fast-moving threats. Projects that adopt hybrid AI-human security models and prioritize infrastructure hardening will be best positioned to reduce incidents going forward. Published by COINOTAG — updated 2025-10-01.

The review was conducted by audit firm Harris & Trotter LLP under the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000). Independent validation of reserves According to the report, USDf reserves are held in segregated, unencumbered accounts on behalf of token holders. The audit verified wallet ownership, collateral valuation, user deposits, and overall reserve sufficiency. Falcon Finance also publishes weekly verification of USDf issuance and reserves through its Transparency Page, with additional third-party reviews planned. “Independent quarterly audits are essential for building trust in stablecoin infrastructure. This review confirms that USDf is not only fully collateralized but backed by a diversified reserve base designed for resilience,” said Andrei Grachev, Founding Partner of Falcon Finance. “At Falcon, we are building stable, yield-generating infrastructure that meets the expectations of institutions, regulators, and onchain users alike.” The publication of the first quarterly audit sets a framework for regular reporting on USDf’s collateral base, with Falcon positioning the stablecoin as compliant and transparent infrastructure for institutional and on-chain adoption.

CryptoQuant Says These Alerts Are To Watch,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-big-move-cryptoquant-alerts-are-to-watch/,"On-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has revealed the five key Bitcoin on-chain alerts that could be to keep an eye on in the coming week. Bitcoin Is Observing Developments On These Metrics In a new thread on X, CryptoQuant has discussed about some Bitcoin on-chain alerts that could be to watch amid the consolidation phase in the cryptocurrency’s price. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Makes $54 Million Coinbase Outflow: Sign Of Dip Buying? The first indicator shared by the analytics firm is the 60-day change in the market cap of USDT, the number one stablecoin. As is visible in the above chart, the 60-day change in the USDT market cap has continued to sit at a notable positive level recently, implying the stablecoin has been witnessing growth. Stablecoins are one of the main inlets of capital into the cryptocurrency sector, so growth in them can generally be a positive sign. Currently, the 60-day change in the USDT market cap has a value of $10 billion. “This is a clear sign of fresh liquidity entering the market,” notes CryptoQuant. Another stablecoins-related indicator that can be relevant for Bitcoin is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures the ratio between the market cap of BTC and combined that of all stables. A low value in the indicator can prove to be a bullish sign, as it implies investor purchasing power in the form of stablecoins is high compared to the Bitcoin market cap. From the below chart, it’s apparent that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of the BTC SSR stands at a value of 21 right now, which is considered to be inside the “buy” territory. Another bullish sign that’s developing for Bitcoin is in the Accumulator Address Demand, an indicator that measures the demand that’s coming from addresses that have zero history of selling the cryptocurrency. These perennial HODLers now own 298,000 BTC, which is a new record. A metric that’s still inside the bearish zone, however, is the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP). This metric keeps track of the BTC flows happening between spot and derivatives exchanges. The indicator has been following a downtrend during the past few months, which is considered to be a bear market pattern. “Watch closely: a shift upward often marks the start of bullish momentum,” says the analytics firm. The final metric shared by CryptoQuant is the Realized Price of the short-term holders (STHs), which measures the average cost basis of the Bitcoin investors who got in during the last 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns Back To Neutral As BTC Breaks $114,000 During BTC’s recent plunge, the STHs briefly dipped into losses, but the asset has since recovered above their Realized Price of $109,775.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-5841800-xrp-price-rally-isnt-impossible-but-inevitable-heres-why/,"The debate surrounding XRP’s long-term value has resurfaced, with bold claims challenging the conventional assumptions applied to digital assets. XRP Enthusiast, known as XRP Dragon, shared a perspective that places XRP at the center of a global shift in how money is valued and moved. Rather than applying traditional valuation models, the argument suggests that XRP should be measured against the framework of a new digital financial system, one that fundamentally changes how capital flows across borders. Moving beyond traditional metrics The central point of XRP Dragon’s statement is that many critics dismiss the possibility of XRP reaching extreme valuations, such as $170,000 per token, because they rely on what he describes as “old world math.” This refers to models such as market capitalization, which are widely used to determine the potential growth of an asset. According to his view, these methods are no longer appropriate in an era where digital assets are becoming integrated into the financial infrastructure of banks, governments, and institutions. XRP, designed as a bridge asset , is seen as uniquely positioned to play a role in this transformation. Everyone says $XRP can’t reach $170k because they’re still using the “old world” math. But we’re not in the old world anymore. We’re stepping into a digital money system where value moves differently, and XRP was built to be the bridge. This is why I believe #XRP hitting $170k… pic.twitter.com/Ff6QKDOBFB — XRP DRAGON (@DRAGON_XRP66) September 29, 2025 The attached explanation Alongside the post, a video was included featuring a woman who expanded on the reasoning behind this outlook. She began by drawing a comparison to the early internet era, pointing out that it would have been illogical to measure the potential of the internet using outdated tools such as a phone book. In her words, the phone book represented an old system that was incompatible with the technological advances that followed. She explained that the same logic applies to today’s financial landscape. Current methods, such as market capitalization , stem from the paper money era, and she argued that they do not capture the true scope of a digital economy. According to her explanation, money is now moving into a system of digital rails, where banks and even entire countries will rely on blockchain-powered solutions. In this vision, XRP is the key connector, bridging different assets and systems into a single interoperable network. The case for inevitability Both XRP Dragon’s post and the accompanying video conclude with the idea that XRP reaching $170,000 is not only possible but inevitable within this framework. The reasoning is that, as global financial infrastructure transitions to digital formats, the demand for a bridge asset could grow beyond the limits of traditional valuation metrics. Those who claim such a valuation is impossible are attempting to measure the future with tools designed for the past.

Bitcoin has broken through the $116,000 mark, climbing 2% in the past 24 hours and briefly reaching as high as $116,600. The rally is unfolding against a backdrop of a U.S. government shutdown and record-setting strength in gold, which is trading near $3,900. Ether (ETH) is following suit, jumping nearly 4% in the same 24-hour period to trade at $4,287. The surge in bitcoin during the European session has spilled over into U.S. crypto equities, fueling sharp pre-market activity. Strive (ASST) is the standout winner, soaring 25% to $3.15. Strategy (MSTR) , widely seen as a leveraged bitcoin play, is up more than 2% at $328 per share.

Recently, a competitive battle has erupted in the perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) sector, with emerging platforms like Aster and Lighter significantly challenging Hyperliquid’s former dominance. Last week, Aster surpassed Hyperliquid in terms of 24-hour trading volume. This has sparked a race among competitors to launch new DEXs, aiming to capture market share in this expanding field. In this context, Justin Sun announced the launch of a new DEX at the Token2049 conference in Singapore, signaling further intensification in this rapidly evolving landscape. The excitement, however, is likely to be short-lived, according to Lutz, who called DEXs as inherent pump-and-dump schemes. “DEXs are about giving access to markets without intermediaries, and they build momentum by relying heavily on incentives, it’s basically an inherent pump‑and‑dump scheme,” Lutz said. “I don’t mean that in a bad way or as a scam. It’s all public, you know what you’re getting into."" He likened the incentive programs to an advertising blitz that pays for attention, explaining that these platforms hook users with token rewards and fee rebates and then depend on that feedback loop to keep people trading. ""The question is, what sticks?"" he continued. This boom‑and‑bust cadence not only makes it hard for DEXs to retain liquidity over the long term, he added, it also means retail traders chasing outsized yields are exposing themselves to considerable volatility and risk. In contrast to the churn he sees in DeFi, Lutz said the largest centralized exchanges, led by Coinbase and its peers, are well-positioned to ride out these cycles and remain dominant long after the latest DEX incentives subside. He added that BitMEX’s goal is to straddle both worlds, noting that while he sees DeFi enduring and embraces it personally as a crypto native, institutions can't interact with it like they can with a centralized exchange. BitMEX’s Tokyo pivot The Japanese capital, not Hong Kong or Singapore, is where the trading volume is, according to Lutz. In August, the exchange officially moved its data infrastructure to AWS Tokyo from AWS Dublin in a move aimed at boosting liquidity. The switch has delivered the desired results, underscoring Japan’s attractiveness. ""We were in Ireland before … but it became more and more difficult because basically everyone except the U.S. players are in the Tokyo data centers,"" he said. He said the switch boosted liquidity by roughly 80% in BitMEX’s main contracts and up to 400% in some altcoin markets, gains he attributed not to market-maker intervention but to reducing latency by being in Tokyo. Looking towards the next crypto cycle Lutz predicts the next crypto cycle will look markedly different from prior booms and busts. With greater institutional participation, he said, BTC could behave more like a “real asset,” smoothing out the dramatic peaks and troughs that have defined past runs. “I expect that with greater adoption we’ll see longer plateau phases than in previous cycles; the market will still follow the same rules and characteristics, but with lower volatility as it becomes a real asset embraced by the world’s wealthy,” he said. The bitcoin market volatility has declined markedly since the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. last year. Moreover, BTC’s implied volatility indices have steadily evolved into VIX-like structures, moving in the opposite direction of spot prices . All this means that even though some of these new DEXs, offering eye-watering leverage – which Lutz believes won't last until next year – there aren't fireworks in store for BTC. Instead, it'll look like any other sophisticated asset class with gradual ups and downs as the market cycle continues.",Markets|Trading|Markets|TOKEN 2049|BitMEX|Decentralized exchange|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-01 09:04:44

After 7 Years, the US Government Has Officially Shut Down! How Will Bitcoin (BTC) and Cryptocurrencies Be Affected?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-fears-have-come-true-after-7-years-the-us-government-has-officially-shut-down-how-will-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrencies-be-affected/,"Following the US budget crisis that has been talked about for days, the US federal government has officially shut down. As the 2025 financial year draws to a close, no agreement has been reached on a budget to fund the federal government, the BBC reported. As a result, the US federal government went into shutdown (temporary work stoppage) on the morning of October 1st, after the US Congress definitively rejected the budget deal. Senators rejected the Democratic-backed bill, which included government funding and nearly $1 trillion in health care regulations, while the Republican-backed bill was also put to a vote but failed to receive the necessary votes. As a result, the publication of key economic indicators such as employment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data will be suspended and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed. In a scenario where a temporary budget is not approved, the government loses its spending authority and suspends all activities except essential services. Those not working in essential services are placed on indefinite leave. This will be the first U.S. government shutdown in nearly seven years, since the five-week shutdown on December 22, 2018. This will be the 22nd government shutdown in U.S. history. How Are Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Affected? While the impact of the US lockdown on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is also wondered, Bitfinex analysts warned that the US government shutdown could lead to volatility in cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, Bitfinex analysts noted that a possible US federal government shutdown could increase volatility in the cryptocurrency market by halting the publication of key macroeconomic indicators. Analysts said the main problem that the shutdown could cause would be a loss of confidence and a data gap, rather than immediate financial instability. Analysts, noting that Bitcoin has experienced three major increases, unlike previous cycles, and is currently in a correction phase following the Fed's interest rate cut, predicted that Bitcoin will remain sideways for now. *This is not investment advice.

The financing will support deployment of more than 500 new ASIC miners, potentially bringing total operational rigs to over 4,000 by year-end, according to a Tuesday announcement from the Nasdaq-listed digital asset accumulator. The capital infusion follows Thumzup’s August agreement to acquire DogeHash in an all-stock deal that will create what executives describe as the world’s largest Dogecoin mining platform . DogeHash shareholders will swap all holdings for 30.7 million Thumzup shares, with the combined company rebranding as DogeHash Technologies Holdings and trading under ticker XDOG upon deal closure expected in the fourth quarter. Thumzup gained attention in July when Donald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump, purchased 350,000 shares worth nearly $3.3 million at the time. The company has rapidly transformed from a social media marketing firm into a crypto-focused operation since launching its digital asset strategy in January with a $1 million Bitcoin purchase. Thumzup announces $2.5 million capital infusion into DogeHash Technologies to expand its #Dogecoin mining capacity. Strategic funding expected to accelerate fleet deployment to over 4,000 ASIC miners.

The company’s board authorized up to $250 million in total crypto holdings, including Bitcoin , Dogecoin , Litecoin , Solana , XRP , Ether , and USDC . DogeHash currently operates approximately 2,500 Scrypt ASIC miners across North American colocation sites, focused on producing Dogecoin and Litecoin. The new $2.5 million loan will add over 500 cutting-edge miners during what DogeHash CEO Parker Scott called “a pivotal period for the Dogecoin market.” Thumzup CEO Robert Steele stated the company is “ enthusiastic about all the recent developments in the Dogecoin ecosystem ” and looks forward to building “ a premier Doge mining company together ” with DogeHash. The combined entity plans to leverage Dogecoin’s Layer-2 infrastructure through DeFi staking products built into the DogeOS ecosystem. In September, Thumzup purchased approximately 7.5 million Dogecoin tokens for $2 million at a weighted average price of $0.2665, marking its first open-market DOGE acquisition. The company now holds 19.106 Bitcoin and around 7.5 million Dogecoins in its treasury. Thumzup appointed Jordan Jefferson, CEO and co-founder of DogeOS and head of Dogecoin wallet MyDoge, to its Crypto Advisory Board alongside DogeOS executive Alex Hoffman. Jefferson, whose platform is backed by Polychain Capital, has been active in Bitcoin and blockchain development since 2011. The company also launched a $10 million share buyback program in September, which will extend through December 2026, following the completion of a $1 million repurchase that bought back 212,432 shares at an average price of $4.71. Shares climbed 5.7% to $4.81 following the announcement, giving Thumzup a market cap of roughly $78 million. Trump Family Crypto Empire Expands Across Mining and Memecoins The Trump family has rapidly built extensive crypto holdings across multiple ventures. American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump and backed by Donald Trump Jr., surged 110% at its September debut following an all-stock merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining, giving the company a $7.7 billion market value. American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump and backed by Donald Trump Jr, closed 14% higher in its Nasdaq debut, valuing their stake at $1.5B. #AmericanBitcoin #Trump https://t.co/sJo6aWBClB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 4, 2025 At peak prices, the brothers’ combined stake was briefly worth $2.6 billion before closing at around $1.5 billion. At that time, American Bitcoin operates roughly 6,000 mining computers and entered into a $2.1 billion controlled stock offering with Cantor Fitzgerald and Mizuho Securities to acquire more Bitcoin and upgrade mining technology. Eric Trump predicted at the Bitcoin 2025 Asia conference in Hong Kong that Bitcoin would eventually reach $1 million, stating, “ everybody wants Bitcoin, everybody is buying Bitcoin .” Trump Media & Technology Group raised $2.5 billion in May to build a massive Bitcoin Treasury, and most recently launched a new $6.42 billion digital asset treasury company in partnership with Crypto.com. The family’s ventures also include NFT trading cards, two memecoins, and the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. However, while bullish for the crypto community, the family’s crypto ventures have drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts regarding potential conflicts of interest. Thumzup’s stock is up 3.80% to $5.00 on Wednesday following the announcement of its expansion. Dogecoin also rose nearly 1% to $0.23 at the same time.

The findings, compiled by Finbold research using data from blockchain security firm SlowMist , underscore the persistent vulnerabilities across crypto exchanges and protocols, even as the overall volume of attacks declined compared to earlier in the year. Unlike the first quarter of the year, when the $1.5 billion Bybit incident dominated the headlines, the third quarter was shaped by a cluster of mid-sized attacks. The most significant was the $54 million breach at Turkish exchange BtcTurk, with the attack method still undisclosed. Other incidents included $44.2 million stolen from CoinDCX due to a security flaw, $42 million drained from GMX through a reentrancy exploit, $41.5 million lost at SwissBorg because of a third-party vulnerability, and $27 million stolen from BigONE in a supply chain attack. Combined, these events made up almost the entire quarterly total. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Notably, the Q3 total lifts the amount stolen in 2025 to $2.55 billion, ensuring that this year already ranks among the most damaging on record for the digital asset sector. Decline in quarterly losses after the Bybit breach The third quarter figure continues the downward trend that followed the catastrophic opening months of the year. Losses fell from $1.77 billion in Q1 , driven almost entirely by the Bybit wallet hack, to $465 million in Q2, and further down to $307 million in Q3. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); While the slowdown suggests improvements in exchange security and protocol risk management, it may also indicate that attackers are concentrating on smaller, targeted exploits. Analysts caution that quarterly comparisons can be distorted by reporting delays, leaving open the possibility that the final totals for Q3 could be revised upward. Crypto hack losses in 2025 so far With $2.55 billion stolen across the first nine months, 2025 has already surpassed many previous full-year totals. The figures illustrate how a single large-scale event, such as the Bybit hack, can dramatically shape annual statistics while still exposing systemic weaknesses across DeFi contracts, custodial services, and third-party integrations. Even though quarterly numbers have trended lower since Q1, the cumulative damage highlights the fragile foundations of much of the ecosystem. Q4 outlook for crypto security The absence of a billion-dollar breach in Q3 may appear to signal stability, but the underlying vulnerabilities remain unresolved. Exchanges and protocols continue to operate in an environment where security lapses can erase hundreds of millions in value within a short period. As 2025 enters its final quarter, the key test will be whether the industry can sustain the downward trajectory in losses, or whether another large-scale incident resets the trend.

According to a Wednesday X post announcing the contest, the awards will include 29 nominees, split into two categories: adopters and advocates. Voting has already opened on X, with the public encouraged to support nominees by interacting with campaign posts through likes, reposts, or replies. SEAL co-leads Dickson Wu and Robert MacWha said the initiative stems from the Safe Harbor Agreement, first introduced in 2024, to protect white hats who intervene during active exploits on blockchain networks. 4/ Find your favorite nominees’ post & start voting now! You can vote on as many posts as you want. #SafeHarborChampion2025 pic.twitter.com/m5lzzLqimd — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) October 1, 2025 As seen in the SEAL Safe Harbor forum , the framework is a set of rules for both hackers and projects, which shield those who seize stolen funds for safekeeping from criminal liability. SEAL opens voting on awards through social media The non-profit Web3 security platform has dubbed the campaign “a public popularity contest.” SEAL stated that every social interaction counts as a vote, with no limits on the number of nominees a user can support. “This is about creating visibility and social pressure,” the group posted on X. “When competitors are recognized, others will want to implement Safe Harbor too.” The organization believes that adopting its Safe Harbor framework is imperative for the safety of the entire crypto industry. According to SEAL, when white hats act without fear of legal retaliation, exploits are “stopped faster” and “fewer users lose funds.” “Every organization that implements Safe Harbor makes the entire ecosystem more secure. This is how we get there,” SEAL wrote. Companies nominated in the Adopters category feature decentralized finance platforms and protocols that have formally adopted the SEAL Whitehat Safe Harbor, including Alchemix, Balancer, Cantina, ENS Domains, Ensuro, Immunefi, Inverse Finance, Origin Protocol, PancakeSwap, Pareto Credit, Pendle, Polymarket , Sandclock, Silo Finance, Singularity, Uniswap Foundation, and zkSync. In the Advocates category, SEAL nominated venture capital firms such as a16z Crypto, Paradigm, and Dragonfly; law firms Cooley LLP and Debevoise; advocacy groups like LeXpunK Army and PowerhouseDAO. Other nominees in the latter category include the Filecoin Foundation and cybersecurity company Osec. SEAL has lauded these groups for promoting Safe Harbor and sparking more conversations about white-hat protection, while encouraging more firms to onboard the “ethical hackers.” White hat hackers recover billions from crypto network exploits SEAL currently counts 79 volunteer white hat hackers able to respond to active threats in the crypto ecosystem. As of October 1, 14 decentralized finance protocols holding roughly $20 billion in total value had adopted the Safe Harbor framework, according to data from DefiLlama. The adopters include several of the sector’s largest platforms, such as Pendle, a yield derivatives protocol managing $10 billion, and Uniswap , the top-most decentralized exchange by volume in the last month, with close to $6 billion in locked deposits. One of the well-known white hats on social media is the pseudonymous hacker c0ffeebabe.eth, who intervened in the April 2024 Morpho App exploit. c0ffeebabe.eth used a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot to front-run a malicious transaction and intercept $2.6 million stolen from Morpho. A year earlier, the hacker returned $5.4 million worth of Ether to Curve Finance users after a breach, and 300 ETH from a smart contract exploit targeting SushiSwap. In August 2024, good-faith hackers withdrew and returned $12 million worth of Ether and USDC during the Ronin bridge incident. More recently, SEAL coordinated a response to the NPM supply chain attack in the first half of 2025, which compromised JavaScript software libraries. Cryptopolitan reported that a JSCEAL malware campaign had mimicked over 50 crypto platforms to harvest data from users who downloaded the spoofed apps. As a result of the malware NPM supply chain attack, some tokens, including BRETT, DORKY, VISTA, and GONDOLA, were scooped by hackers.

In times like these, investors look for alternatives that are equipped with a combination of price resilience and intrinsic utility, especially in the sub-$1 segment. One such project that is becoming increasingly popular is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is currently on phase 6 of its presale that is over 50% sold out. The tokens at this stage are available for purchase for $0.035. With a total of over $16.6 million raised and over 16,670 individual investors, it is gaining momentum. While DOGE struggles with declining sentiment and little new functionality, MUTM is building a twin-lending DeFi platform, raising millions, and riding solid early investor demand. Dogecoin Remains Significant Support, A Big Move Ahead? Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself at a significant price point where bulls and bears grapple with who will be in charge of its next big move. Resistance at $0.23 is now support in the channel of the uptrend, and if there is an increase in buying pressure, analysts anticipate a reversal to $0.28 with potential for a larger breakout rally to $0.43. A breakdown below $0.22, however, may see DOGE drop back down into the $0.17–$0.15 demand zone before bulls attempt another push higher. This setup is characteristic of a traditional consolidation phase, one that can either give way to an abrupt squeeze higher or another correction. And as traders watch DOGE’s next step, investors are already anticipating newer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as part of a grander game plan in 2025. Investor Confidence Soars as Mutuum Finance Presale Breaks New Ground Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has shattered another presale record, raising more than $16.6 million in limited time. Tokens currently stand at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from Phase 5. High investor demand still exists, with more than 16,670 backers demonstrating confidence in the long-term vision of the project. Security is paramount to Mutuum Finance. It has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, encouraging developers and security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities and get compensated for it. Bugs are assessed against four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low, providing end-to-end security and lending support to the security strategy of the platform. Mutuum Finance employs dynamic LTV and liquidation rates, which change in real-time based on market conditions such that the protocol is highly responsive to volatility. Reserve multipliers would range between 10% for risk assets and 35% for conservative assets to offer a secondary layer of systemic safety. Efficiency and Collateral Optimization Efficiency is a fundamental concept of Mutuum Finance. Collateral is kept to a minimum to assets in order to maximize capital usage, and correlated assets are maximized for better lending and borrowing efficiency. These mechanisms reduce insolvency risk, enhance user trust, and enable a more stable and sustainable lending ecosystem. To encourage early backers, Mutuum Finance organized a $100,000 giveaway , and ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The program encourages participation and interaction from the community during the presale. Volatility is also the central area of focus in the collateral management of Mutuum Finance. Asset volatility determines LTV percentages and risk classes, and reserve multipliers ranging from 10% for low-risk assets to 35% for high-risk assets act as buffers, with stability without portfolio diversification being compromised. DOGE Flails as MUTM Rises Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has positioned itself as a leading sub-$1 crypto of 2025 after raising more than $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and advancing more than 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. While Dogecoin (DOGE) is beset by short-term volatility, MUTM delivers actual DeFi utility through its two-way lending platform, dynamic LTV, and prudent risk management, attracting retail investors as well as whales. Early birds are also rewarded with a $100,000 giveaway and strong community incentives. Investors seeking high-upside, utility-driven crypto exposure need to lock up MUTM tokens before presale is exhausted.

52512859,593743,1759311014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52512859.jpeg,Binance Founder Triggers Bitcoin Bull Run Expectations With Cryptic Tweet,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-founder-bitcoin-bull/,"Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has shaken up the crypto community again with a new post about Bitcoin on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The founder, who many believe has called the top and bottom of the market various times, holds significant sway over the market, triggering major movements . Thus, it is no surprise that his latest post, talking about his participation in the crypto market in the past, is being interpreted by many as bullish. Binance Founder Shows Where The Market Was In The Past The post shared by the crypto founder shows what looks to be the price of Bitcoin sitting as low as $4,300. He highlights that this was from eight years ago in 2017, showing where the market was for the month of September and what happened after. At the time, the market looks to be coming out of another bearish September, with the Bitcoin price trading below $5,000. However, the next few months, which were the last quarter of the year, turned out to be incredibly bullish for the Bitcoin price . After September drew to a close, the month of October 2017 was significantly bullish, with the price quickly crossing the $5,000 threshold. In the next few months, the Bitcoin price ended up rising by over 200%, to reach a new all-time high of $19,000 before the 2018 bear market began. Community Members Expect A Bitcoin Bull Run Even though the post by the Binance founder read: “Not predicting the future. And don’t get too excited. A September in a past (my first) crypto cycle. Just data,” it did little to stop the speculation that followed . So far, the tweet has garnered more than 1 million views and 3,000 comments and quotes, with most predicting that the former Binance CEO is predicting a bull run. One analyst points out that CZ had previously marked the local top and bottom and believes that the post is pointing out the concept of seasonality in the market. With CZ posting a chart that showed the Bitcoin price before it went on a bull run, the analyst believes that this could be the start of another run . Another community member, Stygian, claims that CZ has been the one steering the market up or down, and that people can see it. However, another response goes against the grain, saying that what is happening now is simply wealth transfer and not the kind of rally that retail is expecting. Despite the conversations that the post has triggered, the market continued to trend low, with Bitcoin skirting around $113,000 at the time of the post. With the opening of the new month, investors continue to anticipate a bullish rally for Bitcoin and the entire market.",Bitcoin|binance|Binance news|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 09:30:14

She responded to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick’s remarks over the weekend, stating that Washington’s pitch to Taiwan would involve a 50-50 split in chip production. Cheng, Taiwan’s lead tariff negotiator with Washington, told reporters upon returning to the country that she had not discussed the 50-50 idea suggested by the U.S. during the talks. She also maintained that the negotiating team would never agree to such conditions. U.S. aims for 40% semiconductor market share Taiwan is still working to finalize a tariff deal with the U.S., following President Donald Trump’s imposition of a temporary 20% tariff on the island. Trump has also threatened to impose additional levies on semiconductors coming into the U.S. Cheng acknowledged that there was some progress in negotiations over U.S. levies on Taiwanese shipments. Cryptopolitan previously reported that Lutnick, over the weekend, said having half of Taiwan’s chip production in the U.S. would ensure the U.S. has much-needed capacity. He added that the conversations Washington has had with Taiwan have maintained that it’s vital for the island to have the U.S. produce 50% of semiconductor chips. “Our goal is to get to 40% market share, and maybe 50% market share, of producing the chips and the wafers, you know, the semiconductor we need for American consumption, that’s our objective.” – Howard Lutnick , United States Secretary of Commerce. Cheng said she hopes for more comprehensive talks on special considerations under Section 232, a U.S. law that allows tariffs on imports deemed a national security risk. Trump had previously accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip business. The cabinet stated in a press release that more than 70% of Taiwan’s exports to the U.S. are in the information and communications technology sector, including chips. The growing demand for AI-related technology has fueled Taiwan’s trade surplus with the U.S., as the island is home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning to invest $165 billion to establish chip factories in the U.S., but will still maintain a bulk of its production in Taiwan. The island produces more than half of the world’s semiconductors, while the U.S. currently produces less than 10% of the global chip supply. TSMC invested approximately $30 billion in capital projects in 2024 and plans to spend about $40 billion this year. Trump threatens to impose additional tariffs on chipmakers The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Trump administration threatened to add a tariff on chipmakers unless they match the volume of semiconductors that their customers currently import from overseas providers through domestic production. Trump has offered exemptions from tariffs of roughly 100% on chips to companies that produce semiconductors locally. According to the report, Trump is allegedly planning to impose levies for companies that fail to sustain a 1:1 domestic-to-import ratio over time. Lutnick also championed the idea, telling semiconductor executives that it might be necessary for economic security. White House spokesperson Kush Desai argued that the U.S. cannot be reliant on imports for the semiconductor products that are necessary for the country’s national and economic security. The report also highlighted that companies committing to produce chips in the U.S. under the proposal would receive credit for that pledged volume. John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabeli Funds, which holds shares in GlobalFoundries and Intel, believes the 1:1 rule would be very difficult to implement and would likely take many years to achieve. He also argued that the proposal would benefit firms that already have U.S. fabs. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Despite that, XRP recently closed a weekly candle above the 50% retracement level, reinforcing its support range. Cup and Handle Formation in Play CryptoBull pointed out a cup and handle in the works on the weekly time frame for XRP. The rounded base was initiated toward the end of 2024, with resistance forming near $3 sometime earlier this year. The sideways action from August onward seems to be forming the handle itself. The price remains above the 200-day moving average, which has served as a key support line. CryptoBull stated, “Next stop $8,” if the handle resolves upward with strong buying. The setup requires XRP to break past the neckline near $3 to confirm the bullish structure. #XRP cup and handle pattern almost complete.

At that time, extended consolidation led to a parabolic rally into new highs. The recent pattern of boxed consolidations and breakouts resembles that cycle. XRP is currently close to $3.00. The chart highlights $3.65 as the level to watch. A breakout and weekly close above that mark could lead to $4.50 or higher. “It’s a question of when, not if,” CRYPTOWZRD remarked , referring to the possibility of XRP entering price discovery. Source: CRYPTOWZRD/X Additionally, Market Prophit reported that overall sentiment for XRP is bullish across both crowd data and its own measures. Meanwhile, reports noted a lack of corporate buy orders despite rising reserves, showing that institutional participation may still be limited. XRP is currently trading above the support levels, and analysts are viewing $3.33, $3.66, and $3.65 as the significant break points next in line.

""In the Short Term…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/major-bull-tom-lee-reveals-incredible-price-predictions-for-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-in-the-short-term/,"Known for his bold predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market, Fundstrat co-founder and BitMine president Tom Lee made important statements about Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Speaking at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore, Tom Lee said that BTC could reach $140,000 and ETH could reach $22,000. Comparing gold to Bitcoin, Lee predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $140,000 in the short term. For this to happen, he noted that Bitcoin's value would need to reach about 10% of gold's current value. Lee also added that if the value of the Bitcoin network were to be the same or higher than that of gold, BTC could rise to as much as $2.2 million. Secondly, touching on Ethereum, Tom Lee stated that the price of Ethereum could reach $22,000. Lee stated that there are two conditions for this: the ETH/BTC ratio reaching its all-time high of 0.087 in 2021 and BTC reaching $250,000 by the end of the year. If both of these are met, the ETH price could reach $22,000. Tom Lee has also said in other recent statements that he expects the Bitcoin price to be between $200,000 and $250,000 by the end of the year, and the Ethereum price to be between $10,000 and $12,000. Related News: Big Bull Tom Lee Announces Year-End Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Price Predictions! ""Will Be a Favorite of Wall Street and the White House!"" Lee also stated that Bitmine's goal is to increase its Ethereum holdings to 5% of the ETH supply. As you may recall, Bitmine announced on Monday that it purchased 234,846 ETH worth $963 million in the past week. With this latest purchase, Bitmine (BMNR) now holds 2,650,900 ETH worth approximately $11 billion, representing more than 2% of ETH's total supply. *This is not investment advice.

52513533,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=824605,1759312222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52513533.jpeg,"Robert Kiyosaki slams Warren Buffett for switching gold, silver stance after decades of criticism",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robert-kiyosaki-goes-after-warren-buffett/,"Kiyosaki said he wants to “vomit” after hearing the exiting Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett touting investments in gold and silver after bashing the precious metals for decades. According to the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, this means the market is about to crash. Warren Buffett has been bearish on gold since he took the reins at the Omaha-based multinational holding conglomerate in 1970, saying it is “neither of much use nor procreative.” During a shareholder meeting in 2005, the Oracle of Omaha said precious metals were “down on his store of value list,” adding that he would rather invest in a “hundred acres of land near Nebraska, or an apartment house, or an index fund.” Twenty years later, according to Robert Kiyosaki, Buffett is now touting the benefits of investing in the two assets, as spot gold rose 0.4% to reach $3,872 per ounce. In contrast, US gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.7% to $3,901. Silver is up $47.27 per troy ounce, a 15.55% uptick over the past month and 48.43% higher than the same period a year ago, according to CFD trading data tracking the benchmark market. “I want to vomit: getting nauseous, listening to Buffett tout the virtues of gold and silver… after he ridiculed gold and silver for years,” Kiyosaki wrote on X. “That means the stock and bond markets are about to crash. Depression ahead?” Buffett did not like gold In a 2011 interview with CNBC, Buffett called gold investments “a way of going along on fear.” He proposed that its value was largely based on sentiment, explaining that when people were fearful, gold demand and prices rose. At the same time, calmer conditions led to a decline in demand and, eventually, a drop in prices. Despite his long-standing criticism, Berkshire Hathaway briefly ventured into the gold sector during the pandemic with a $565 million investment in Barrick Gold in the second quarter of 2020. Not surprisingly, the conglomerate sold nearly all its stake in Barrick by the end of the year. At the time, inflation was low, economic activity was suppressed, and the move was exactly how analysts who had long regarded Buffett as a critic of gold had expected. Inflation remains a concern for the US economy, although the rate has decreased significantly from its 2022 peak of 9%. In July 2025, consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of 2.7%, but accelerated to 2.9% in August. That backdrop has redirected the interest from stock markets back to safe-haven assets, with many investors seeking protection against currency weakness and geopolitical risks. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Kiyosaki believes Buffett is now advocating for gold because he has seen an impending crash. “Even though Buffett shit on gold and silver investors like me for years, his sickening endorsement of gold and silver must mean stocks and bonds are about to crash. Might be time to listen to Buffet and buy some gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum,” he surmised. Precious metals rally as US faces shutdown The US Senate failed to pass legislation to extend government funding on Tuesday, placing America on the edge of a shutdown. President Donald Trump, who has pushed for major federal spending cuts, has cautioned Congress that he would have to reduce the workforce size if no deal is reached. According to some analysts, this has contributed to the rally in gold, alongside other factors such as the value of the US dollar, inflation, and trade tariffs. “Gold is benefiting from concerns over a weaker dollar, and the political situation with the standoff about a government shutdown in the US, and also general geopolitical uncertainty,” said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery. A shutdown could delay key economic data releases, including the non-farm payrolls report due Friday. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), released on Tuesday, already showed marginal growth in openings but a hiring downturn, providing more signs of a cooling labor market, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell discussed during the last FOMC meeting.

This quick rise turns attention to other digital coins on the market. Could XYZVerse be the next token to surprise investors? Growing curiosity surrounds what might fuel the next price rally. The stage is set for what could happen next in the digital asset space. Bitcoin's Next Beat: Why the Oldest Digital Coin Still Turns Heads Bitcoin began in 2009 when a mysterious coder, Satoshi Nakamoto, shared a plan for electronic cash. It runs on a public log, copied across many computers, so no bank is needed. People called miners check each payment by solving math tasks. They earn new coins for this work. Every four years that reward is cut in half, slowing the flow of fresh coins. Only 21 million can ever exist. This strict cap and open record aim to block fraud and keep the network fair. Today, many new tokens chase quick gains, yet Bitcoin still leads the show. Big firms add it to balance sheets, and some cities accept it for taxes. Rising interest in simple online money and fear of bank glitches push users toward the oldest coin. The next halving is near, and past cuts often sent the price higher as supply tightened. Fees may jump, and small miners could leave, but history shows the network adapts. For buyers who want a scarce and proven store, Bitcoin still looks lively this cycle. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.0055 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Conclusion BTC looks good in the 2025 rally. Attention now turns to XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, uniting sports fans and memes, chasing outsized gains through community gaming growth.

For XRP Tundra, however, the math stretches conventional expectations. The Phase 4 presale is structured so that even modest allocations translate into outsized outcomes — returns so steep they challenge the utility of traditional forecasting tools. The reason lies not in hype but in the project’s architecture. A dual-token system, transparent launch pricing, staking utilities, and engineered liquidity combine into a model where exponential upside is built directly into the economics. Early buyers are discovering that Tundra’s design produces results that conventional calculators can barely capture. Phase 4 Presale: Ground Floor Multiples At the current stage, TUNDRA-S is priced at $0.068. Each purchase comes with a 16% token bonus, and buyers also receive TUNDRA-X free of charge, referenced at $0.034. Launch prices are fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X. This means a relatively small allocation today converts into multiples rarely seen in established assets. Unlike speculative forecasts that depend on uncertain market cycles, the pathway here is transparent. Defined launch values allow investors to calculate upside in advance, and the numbers reveal returns that overwhelm typical crypto benchmarks. Yield Features Beyond Speculation Presale multiples are only part of the story. XRP Tundra also introduces Cryo Vault staking, where holders can lock tokens and earn up to 30% APY. Frost Keys, NFT-based utilities, enhance this system by boosting yields or shortening lock durations. Although staking has not yet launched, presale participants secure guaranteed access once vaults open. This transforms tokens from speculative chips into yield-bearing assets, ensuring that investors benefit even if broader market conditions shift. Liquidity Engineering to Preserve Value The risk with presale multiples is always the same: volatility at launch can wipe them away. XRP Tundra has built in protections to counter that outcome through Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools. These pools introduce dynamic fees that start high, deterring bots and immediate dumping, and then ease gradually to allow organic trading. Liquidity positions are represented as NFTs, while permanent lock features guarantee a stable baseline of tradability. For investors, this means that extraordinary presale gains are not undermined the moment trading begins. Instead, the architecture itself helps preserve value through the most turbulent phases of price discovery. Verified Oversight and Independent Attention Confidence in presales depends on verification, and XRP Tundra has taken steps that few new projects attempt. Its contracts and tokenomics have been reviewed by Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . Team identity is confirmed via Vital Block KYC . External coverage has also begun amplifying its reach. In a recent video, Crypto League highlighted how Tundra’s dual-token model and launch safeguards differentiate it from conventional presales, framing it as one of the most distinctive opportunities of the cycle. Returns Too Massive to Ignore Crypto calculators can model Bitcoin doubling or Solana tripling, but they struggle to capture the kind of growth baked into XRP Tundra’s presale. With dual tokens, staking yields, and liquidity protections, returns are not just hypothetical but structured into the economics from day one. As Phase 4 advances, the presale is redefining expectations of what “early entry” means in digital assets. For participants, the question is no longer whether gains are possible but how large they can become — and the numbers already suggest outcomes that standard models cannot compute.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin has kicked off ‘Uptober’ in the best possible fashion. The token has gained 1.9% today, adding up to nearly a 7% rise over the past six days. Having reclaimed all of its important short-term moving averages – the 10, 20, 50, and 100 EMA on the daily chart – Bitcoin is now fast approaching the key resistance level of $117-$118K. This particular resistance level caused a sharp 7% downward correction just a couple of weeks ago, so it’s crucial for digital gold to reclaim this level quickly if it wants to repeat its historical October trend – an average monthly return of 29.23% . It’s also worth noting that the current bounce comes off a weekly Fibonacci retracement at the 0.5 level. According to this technical setup, the token should at least retest its Fibonacci swing high, which coincides with BTC’s current all-time high of $124.5K. That said, with both fundamental and technical tailwinds, Bitcoin appears well-positioned not only to retest but to push well past its previous highs in the upcoming cycle. CZ Sparks Uptober Buzz With Bitcoin Rally Hints — Can Bitcoin Hyper Capitalize? October 1, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, has hinted at a potential October rally for Bitcoin based on the currency’s historical performance. His prediction is backed by data showing that $BTC surged 4072% from mid-2015 to late-2017 . CZ believes BTC’s past trends point to the possibility of another ‘Uptober’ rally. Historical data support CZ’s outlook, showing that $BTC has averaged gains of around 22% in October over the past few years. In light of CZ’s prediction, investors are closely monitoring seasonal patterns, rising ETF flows, gold price correlation, the Fed’s rate cut , and US crypto regulatory clarity , as these factors could play a significant role in driving $BTC’s price up this October. When influential figures like CZ shed light on past runs in the crypto space, it often uplifts investor sentiment and redirects capital flows. This momentum not only benefits $BTC but has also spilled over into upcoming layer-2 Bitcoin-based projects, such as the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Currently in presale, $HYPER has already raised $19.4M, creating waves across the market. Discover how to purchase Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) in our comprehensive guide .

The Banque de France’s losses and a 5.8% GDP shortfall raise the likelihood of quantitative easing, which historically redirects capital into BTC as an inflation and liquidity hedge. France’s fiscal gap may trigger ECB quantitative easing Banque de France posted a €7.7B net loss; government deficit reached €168B (5.8% of GDP). Historically, QE cycles have coincided with significant Bitcoin inflows and price appreciation. France budget deficit Bitcoin: France’s €168B shortfall may force ECB QE and drive BTC inflows — read concise analysis and investor implications at COINOTAG. What is the impact of France’s budget deficit on Bitcoin? France budget deficit Bitcoin dynamics suggest the Banque de France’s €7.7 billion net loss and a 5.8%-of-GDP government shortfall increase the odds of ECB quantitative easing. QE would expand liquidity across euro markets, raising the probability of capital flows into Bitcoin as investors seek inflation-resistant assets. How large is France’s fiscal shortfall and what drove it? The Banque de France reported a net loss of €7.7 billion in fiscal 2024, largely from negative net interest income amid high interest payments. France’s government deficit reached €168 billion ($176 billion) in 2024, equal to 5.8% of GDP , well above the EU 3% benchmark. Arthur Hayes at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph Why could the ECB respond with money printing? With roughly 60% of French bonds held by foreign investors , reduced external financing can tighten France’s borrowing conditions. Industry observers, including Arthur Hayes (co‑founder of BitMEX), posit that the ECB may choose to deploy large-scale QE to stabilize banks or fund fiscal spending—each path increases euro liquidity. Hayes has stated that French capital is leaving and that the ECB faces a binary choice: print now or print later. That decision, he argues, would likely expand aggregate money supply and create tailwinds for crypto markets. How has quantitative easing affected Bitcoin historically? Quantitative easing has previously coincided with major Bitcoin appreciation. During the 2020–2021 QE cycle, Bitcoin rose over 1,050% , climbing from about $6,000 in March 2020 to roughly $69,000 by November 2021 after large-scale bond-buying programs were announced. BTC/USD, one-week chart, 2020-2021. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView When might ECB action occur and what are the scenarios? The ECB could print either to preserve banking stability or to enable sovereign spending. Both scenarios expand money supply; timing depends on capital flows and macro stress signals. If foreign investment into French bonds continues to wane, policymakers may accelerate intervention. What metrics should investors monitor? Banque de France balance sheet changes and reported net income. ECB bond‑buying announcements and policy meeting statements. Cross‑border capital flows into French sovereign bonds and FX reserve adjustments. Summary table: Key figures Metric Value Implication Banque de France net loss (FY2024) €7.7 billion Signals central bank strain France government deficit (2024) €168 billion (5.8% GDP) Exceeds EU limit; fiscal pressure Foreign ownership of French bonds ~60% Vulnerability to capital outflows Bitcoin 2020–2021 rise ~1,050% Historical QE correlation Frequently Asked Questions Will ECB quantitative easing directly cause higher Bitcoin prices? QE increases money supply and can boost risk-asset liquidity; historically, major QE cycles aligned with significant BTC inflows. While not deterministic, QE raises the probability of capital moving into Bitcoin as part of broader liquidity-driven asset allocation shifts. Is France likely to default or redenominate its debt? Current indicators point to elevated fiscal stress but not an imminent default. Policymakers have options—QE, fiscal consolidation, capital controls—and the ECB’s response is a key variable. How should investors prepare for possible ECB money printing? Monitor central bank statements, sovereign bond yields, and capital-flow data. Diversify exposures and consider inflation-hedge assets, but base allocations on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Key Takeaways Immediate risk: Banque de France losses and a 5.8% deficit increase Eurozone policy pressure. Likely response: ECB quantitative easing is a plausible tool to restore liquidity. Market impact: Greater euro liquidity historically correlates with capital flows into Bitcoin; investors should track policy signals. Conclusion The Banque de France’s reported losses and France’s €168 billion deficit elevate the probability of ECB intervention. France budget deficit Bitcoin dynamics suggest that any large-scale QE could act as a catalyst for renewed Bitcoin inflows. Market participants should watch ECB communications and bond‑market signals closely for policy-driven liquidity changes. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""France budget deficit could push ECB to print — what it means for Bitcoin"", ""description"": ""France budget deficit Bitcoin: France’s €168B shortfall may force ECB QE and drive BTC inflows — analysis and investor implications."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/news/france-budget-deficit-bitcoin-ecb-qe-2025"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999eec-7bc2-71ff-abdc-65cf6451aa5f.jpeg"" ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will ECB quantitative easing directly cause higher Bitcoin prices?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""QE increases money supply and can boost risk-asset liquidity; historically, major QE cycles aligned with significant BTC inflows, increasing the probability of higher Bitcoin prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is France likely to default or redenominate its debt?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Indicators show fiscal stress but no immediate default; options include QE, fiscal measures, or capital controls, with ECB policy responses being decisive."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess the impact of ECB QE on Bitcoin"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guide to evaluate how ECB quantitative easing could affect Bitcoin and investor positioning."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999eec-7bc2-71ff-abdc-65cf6451aa5f.jpeg"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor central bank announcements"", ""text"": ""Track ECB policy statements and bond‑buying program details to gauge the scale and timing of QE."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch bond yields and capital flows"", ""text"": ""Rising yields or net capital outflows from France increase the likelihood of ECB intervention."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess historical asset responses"", ""text"": ""Compare previous QE cycles and Bitcoin performance to estimate potential market reactions."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Adjust risk exposure"", ""text"": ""Rebalance portfolios according to risk tolerance, time horizon, and expected policy outcomes."" } ]} Sources: Banque de France press release (March 2025), Arthur Hayes interview at TOKEN2049 (reported in Cointelegraph), historical Fed QE and Bitcoin price data.

52513764,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84944,1759312839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SOL’s 100x Run Fades as Retail Targets $0.035 DeFi to Hit $2 Like SOL’s $10-to-$200 Surge,https://timestabloid.com/sols-100x-run-fades-as-retail-targets-0-035-defi-to-hit-2/,"Solana (SOL)’s remarkable surge from $10 to $200 gave investors one of the most iconic stories in crypto investing. But as momentum cools and new buyers hesitate to enter at elevated levels, attention is shifting toward earlier-stage projects priced at a fraction of the cost. Many are questioning why crypto is down across the broader market and searching for value plays that combine innovation, stability, and strong upside. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steps forward, priced at just $0.035 in its presale and structured to create sustained growth that mirrors Solana (SOL)’s early trajectory. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Retail’s Fresh Investment The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already showing strong traction. In Phase 6, the project has raised $16.6 million, secured over 16,650 holders, and sold through 53% of the available allocation. The next stage is set at $0.04, which means a 15% increase is on the horizon for anyone entering now. This low entry point provides an early positioning advantage similar to Solana (SOL)’s $10 base before its explosive run, only this time with risk-managed mechanics that prepare the project for sustainable scaling. Unlike many tokens that lose direction after a crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a dual lending model that combines peer-to-contract pools for stable, liquid tokens and peer-to-peer pools for riskier assets. This structure diversifies income streams while reducing systemic risks. Every loan on the platform is protected by overcollateralization, ensuring that the treasury remains safe even when volatility strikes. On top of that, reserve factors accumulate from borrowing activity, strengthening the protocol’s ability to fund staking rewards, incentives, and buybacks that will directly support token demand. For professional borrowers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer stable interest rates and predictable repayment terms, features that encourage long-term usage. These mechanisms create a steady flow of fees, which are channeled into the buy-and-distribute program. This means tokens are bought from the market and redistributed to mtToken stakers, rewarding mtToken stakers and reinforcing demand over time. Such mechanics build the groundwork for a reliable price climb rather than a speculative bubble. The Road To $2 And Beyond Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just presenting theoretical models; the project already has its dashboard and leaderboard live, gamifying user engagement and encouraging accumulation. These features will push users toward staking and long-term participation, increasing velocity and enhancing liquidity. At the same time, its Layer 2 foundation will guarantee low transaction fees and high speeds, ensuring the platform is practical for day-to-day lending and borrowing. With the beta launch offering early access to the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already proving its real-world application before hitting major exchanges. Upcoming listings will further expand visibility, attract liquidity, and open MUTM to a global investor base. When combined with its revenue-backed buyback program, the effect is simple: increased demand, stronger staking incentives, and a token economy designed for lasting growth. These elements justify why analysts are aligning their crypto predictions with the view that MUTM has the right mix of utility, engagement, and financial engineering to target $2, just as Solana (SOL)’s early supporters witnessed a historic leap from $10 to $200. The numbers highlight the opportunity. An investor who entered Phase 1 with $8,000 secured 800,000 MUTM tokens. At the Phase 6 price of $0.035, that holding is already valued at $28,000, and when the token climbs to $1, it will be valued at $800,000. For those stepping in now, a $10,000 allocation at $0.035 secures 285,700 tokens. By the next phase at $0.04, this stack will be worth $11,400, and at the $1 projection, it will deliver $285,700. These outcomes reflect not guesswork but the structured mechanisms embedded in the project’s design. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the market at a time when many investors are still asking why crypto is down and where the next growth story will emerge. By combining transparent lending systems, gamified user incentives, Layer 2 scalability, and buyback-supported economics, the project is positioning itself as the answer. Solana (SOL) showed what early conviction in a scalable DeFi project can achieve. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering retail investors a similar chance, with entry prices at just $0.035 and a pathway that logically supports a climb to $2. The window is narrowing, and those who recognize the parallels are already securing their positions before Phase 6 closes.

According to his explanation, Linea, developed by ConsenSys, was chosen for the messaging function, while XRP helps in liquidity provision. His remarks were aimed at clarifying recent discussions around SWIFT’s blockchain prototype and its collaboration with ConsenSys. SWIFT is a two part System…messaging and liquidity I told you the other day ConsenSys was the one behind LINEA for SWIFT messaging XRP is for the liquidity. If SWIFT didn’t use XRP, Ripple would eventually take it over since they are the ones that hold the patent to… pic.twitter.com/9d1pyD8qGx — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) September 29, 2025 Linea’s Purpose and Development Remi Relief emphasized that Linea is not intended for liquidity or settlement functions, but rather serves as a messaging system. In his description, Linea enables banks to transmit instructions between one another on-chain. He highlighted that ConsenSys is behind Linea’s development, aligning with reports that SWIFT partnered with the company to test blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions. In his view, this means Linea functions as an infrastructure layer where developers can build applications for communication between financial institutions, but it is not designed for direct retail use. XRP and On-Demand Liquidity The central point in Remi Relief’s analysis is that XRP remains the asset positioned for liquidity services. He noted that only XRP has On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and argued that this makes it irreplaceable in this framework. He added that Ripple holds a patent for ODL, which he sees as a critical factor in determining how liquidity solutions are integrated into global payment systems. From his perspective, if SWIFT did not incorporate XRP for liquidity , Ripple could eventually dominate that role due to its proprietary position in ODL technology. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging, Stablecoins and Interoperability Remi Relief also referenced interoperability as an important consideration in this structure. Remi pointed to the existence of RLUSD on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger . He also mentioned that bridging solutions, such as Axelar, connect XRP with other blockchains, including Ethereum, which hosts assets like RLUSD and Linea. He suggested that these connections provide the means for liquidity and messaging systems to interact, reinforcing his argument that XRP and Linea are complementary components in SWIFT’s setup rather than competing solutions. In his post, Remi Relief summarized SWIFT’s work as a system divided into messaging and liquidity. He stated that Linea, developed by ConsenSys, accounts for the messaging component, while XRP provides the liquidity through ODL. His interpretation links recent announcements about SWIFT’s blockchain partnerships with the role of XRP in cross-border payments, presenting a structured view of how the two can operate together.

Through this fund, Foresight aims to build a resilient foundation for stablecoin adoption across retail and institutional markets, with a particular focus on long-term infrastructure that can support scalable, cross-border financial systems. Last year, crypto exchange Bitget, in collaboration with Foresight Ventures, launched a $20 million TON Ecosystem Fund . The fund was intended to provide a boost to the Telegram Open Network (TON), a platform that facilitates the integration of blockchain and cryptocurrency within the Telegram messenger. The primary objective of the $20 million TON Ecosystem Fund was to provide support for early-stage projects within the TON ecosystem, with a particular focus on driving innovation. Visa Pilots Stablecoin Payments to Modernize Cross-Border Transfers As reported, Visa has launched a pilot program that allows businesses to fund cross-border payments using stablecoins instead of pre-funding local accounts. The initiative, built on Visa Direct, is designed to reduce friction and eliminate the need for firms to hold large cash reserves across multiple currencies. It follows the passage of the GENIUS Act, which gave regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers in the US. Targeting banks and remittance firms, the system is expected to speed up transactions and unlock dormant capital. While regulators remain cautious about stablecoins, Visa’s move signals a shift toward integrating blockchain rails into traditional financial systems instead of opposing them. The company has already processed $200 million in stablecoin settlements and sees growing convergence between traditional payments and crypto infrastructure. With its Tokenized Asset Platform and new bank partnerships, Visa is positioning itself as both a facilitator and direct player in the future of global payments.

The Tokyo-listed company now ranks as the fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, surpassing its fiscal year 2025 target of 30,000 BTC ahead of schedule. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The acquisition puts Metaplanet’s behind Strategy’s 640,031 BTC, MARA Holdings’ 52,477 BTC, and XXI’s 43,514 BTC. CEO Simon Gerovich has set an ambitious goal of accumulating 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027, representing approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet achieved a 33.0% BTC yield in the third quarter of 2025, adding 4,412 BTC in gains through its treasury operations. The company’s quarterly BTC yield has consistently exceeded targets, with Q4 2024 posting 309.8%, Q1 2025 achieving 95.6%, and Q2 2025 recording 129.4%. Options Trading Revenue Surges 116% as Phase II Strategy Launches Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Income Generation business reported $16.28 million in quarterly revenue, representing a 115.7% increase from Q2 2025. Source: Phase II Report The breakout performance prompted management to revise full-year consolidated guidance to $45.4 million in revenue and $31.38 million in operating profit, representing a 100% increase in revenue and 88% increase in operating profit compared to prior forecasts. The options trading segment has also grown rapidly since its launch, with Q4 2024 generating $4.62 million, Q1 2025 producing $5.14 million, and Q2 2025 reaching $7.55 million, before the surge in Q3. Metaplanet allocated $136.3 million exclusively to Bitcoin Income Generation operations, using capital to sell Bitcoin options and monetize implied volatility while keeping long-term holdings in cold storage. The company unveiled Phase II of its strategy on October 1, introducing complementary business lines designed to amplify accumulation capacity without common equity dilution. Metaplanet Phase II: The Bitcoin Platform https://t.co/d0kj0QRths pic.twitter.com/WgasCOvHKv — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) October 1, 2025 The plan includes three revenue streams. Internal Bitcoin Income Generation through proprietary options trading, Bitcoin.jp platform revenue from media and conferences, and Project NOVA, a classified initiative scheduled for 2026 launch. Management is scaling sophisticated trading operations by onboarding global talent with expertise in institutional derivatives. The revenue expansion will support planned perpetual preferred share issuances capped at 6% annual dividend yield, approved at the September 1 Extraordinary General Meeting, though not yet issued. Metaplanet targets a perpetual preferred capacity of 25% of net asset value initially, with the potential to expand as revenue grows. Class A perpetual preferreds will be non-convertible with no common equity dilution, while Class B may partially dilute upon conversion. The company is considering listing these securities pending consultation with the exchange, although no formal examination has commenced. Capital Group Takes 11.45% Stake as Stock Trades Below Bitcoin Holdings Capital Group acquired an 11.45% stake , worth nearly $500 million, through its subsidiary, Capital Research and Management Company, becoming Metaplanet’s largest shareholder. The $2.6 trillion asset manager increased ownership from 8.31% in August to 11.39% by September 17, surpassing the previous largest shareholder, National Financial Services. The investment validates the corporate Bitcoin treasury model as over 196 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, totaling more than $120 billion in combined holdings. The investment coincided with Metaplanet’s $1.45 billion international offering completed on September 17 , which issued 385 million new common shares to qualified institutional buyers. The company raised over 500 billion yen ($3.34 billion) through multiple financing mechanisms, including moving strike warrants, convertible bonds, and equity offerings, since adopting its Bitcoin treasury strategy. Eric Trump also joined Metaplanet’s advisory board in March and appeared at shareholder meetings to support the Bitcoin-focused strategy. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin.jp initiative will serve as the distribution gateway for Bitcoin-related content, education, products, and services in Japan. The premium domain platform will generate revenue through multi-channel partnerships, advertising, white-labeled services, and affiliate programs while hosting Bitcoin Magazine Japan and the Bitcoin Japan 2027 conference. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at close $116,000 after a 2.53% increase in the past 24 hours.

Acquisition aims to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US. CoinShares will integrate Bastion’s systematic trading team and strategies to create alpha-focused products. Active crypto ETFs outnumbered passive funds in July 2025; CoinShares targets institutional demand for sophisticated strategies. CoinShares Bastion acquisition: CoinShares will launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US — learn what this means for investors and institutional demand. Read more. What is CoinShares acquiring Bastion Asset Management to do? CoinShares Bastion acquisition will combine Bastion’s systematic trading capabilities with CoinShares’ 1940 Act registration to develop actively managed crypto ETFs for US investors. The integration is designed to deliver strategies that seek alpha regardless of market direction, not just passive exposure to BTC or ETH. How will CoinShares launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US? CoinShares will fully integrate Bastion’s trading team, quantitative models, and execution systems into its platform pending UK FCA approval. As a registered investment adviser under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, CoinShares can structure actively managed products and list them in the US once regulatory and operational milestones are met. Key operational steps include: Regulatory clearance and integration of compliance frameworks. Technical and trading-system consolidation to support systematic strategies. Product design, testing, and filing with US exchanges using new streamlined listing standards. CoinShares is set to acquire investment manager Bastion Asset Management to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US. European crypto asset manager CoinShares is set to make another strategic acquisition as the company prepares to go public in the United States. CoinShares announced Wednesday that it will acquire London-based crypto investment manager Bastion Asset Management as part of its strategy to expand crypto investment products in the US. The deal, pending approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, will see CoinShares fully integrate Bastion’s trading capabilities, strategies and team into its platform. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. “By combining Bastion’s systematic trading expertise with our 1940 Act registration, we can develop actively managed products for the US market that go beyond simple directional exposure to cryptocurrencies,” a CoinShares spokesperson told media sources. What is the difference between active ETFs and passive ETFs? Active ETFs are managed with a goal to outperform a benchmark through active selection and trading. Passive ETFs simply track an index or asset price. In crypto markets, most US offerings have been passive spot funds, while active strategies use discretionary or systematic selection to pursue returns. Passive ETFs versus active ETFs. Source: HANetf As CoinShares holds registered investment adviser status under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, the company is permitted to offer actively managed investment products in the US, including sophisticated strategies such as actively managed ETFs. However, creating these products requires deep quantitative expertise and proven systematic trading capabilities, which CoinShares expects to obtain from Bastion. “Bastion’s team has over 17 years of experience developing systematic, alpha-generating strategies at leading hedge funds including BlueCrest Capital, Systematica Investments, Rokos Capital, and GAM Systematic,” CoinShares noted in company comments. “Their quantitative approach, using academically-backed signals to generate returns independent of market direction, is precisely the type of sophisticated, actively managed strategy that differentiates managers in competitive markets.” Why are active crypto ETFs gaining traction now? The crypto ETF market has historically been dominated by passive spot Bitcoin and Ether funds. That trend shifted when active crypto ETFs outnumbered index-tracking funds in July 2025, reflecting greater demand for advanced strategies. Regulatory changes in the US that allow faster listing processes for new crypto funds have also accelerated product launches. Industry reporting indicates a shortened maximum filing-to-launch window — from 240 days to as little as 75 days under new exchange rules — making active product launches more feasible. Actively managed ETFs outnumbered passive funds in July 2025. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence How does CoinShares’ planned US listing affect this strategy? CoinShares plans a US public listing via a special purpose acquisition company at a reported $1.2 billion pre-money equity valuation. The listing is intended to increase access to US capital and institutional distribution channels. “The US remains the world’s deepest capital market for digital assets, and we’re building the infrastructure, team, and product suite to become a leading institutional player in that market,” CoinShares said in company remarks. Frequently Asked Questions Will CoinShares offer both passive and actively managed crypto ETFs? Yes. CoinShares intends to offer directional (passive-like) products and actively managed strategies designed to generate alpha regardless of market conditions, leveraging Bastion’s systematic models. When will CoinShares’ actively managed ETFs be available in the US? Timing depends on regulatory approval, integration milestones, and exchange listing processes. CoinShares must complete UK FCA approvals and US product filings before launch; expedited exchange processes may shorten timelines. What experience does Bastion bring to CoinShares? Bastion’s team has over 17 years of experience building systematic strategies at major hedge funds. That expertise is central to CoinShares’ plan to build quantitative, academically-backed signals for crypto ETFs. Key Takeaways Strategic acquisition : CoinShares is acquiring Bastion to add systematic trading and quantitative expertise. Product innovation : The goal is to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US that pursue alpha, not just market exposure. Market timing : Regulatory changes and increasing demand for active strategies create a favorable window for launches. Conclusion CoinShares’ acquisition of Bastion Asset Management positions the firm to bring actively managed crypto ETFs to the US market, combining regulatory capability and deep quantitative expertise. Investors and institutions should watch for regulatory clearances and product filings as CoinShares executes its US listing and product rollout plans. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""CoinShares acquires Bastion to build actively managed crypto ETFs in the US"", ""description"": ""CoinShares is acquiring Bastion Asset Management to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US, using Bastion's systematic trading and CoinShares' 1940 Act registration."", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999f4d-4670-7f97-9f06-6a819b524671.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is CoinShares acquiring Bastion Asset Management to do?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""CoinShares will integrate Bastion’s systematic trading team and models to develop actively managed crypto ETFs for the US, leveraging its 1940 Act registration to offer alpha-seeking strategies."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How will CoinShares launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""CoinShares will complete regulatory approvals, integrate Bastion’s trading infrastructure, design products, and file with US exchanges under new streamlined listing standards."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When might these actively managed ETFs be available?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Availability depends on UK FCA approval, US filing and listing timelines; expedited exchange procedures may reduce time from filing to launch."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How CoinShares will bring actively managed crypto ETFs to the US"", ""description"": ""High-level plan for integrating Bastion and launching actively managed ETFs."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Secure regulatory approvals"", ""text"": ""Obtain UK FCA approval for the acquisition and confirm compliance with US 1940 Act requirements."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Integrate technology and team"", ""text"": ""Combine Bastion’s systematic trading models, data pipelines, and execution systems with CoinShares’ product infrastructure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Design and file products"", ""text"": ""Develop actively managed ETF strategies, run operational tests, and file listing applications with US exchanges."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 4, ""name"": ""List and distribute"", ""text"": ""List the ETFs on US exchanges, launch marketing to institutional channels, and monitor performance and compliance."" } ], ""totalTime"": ""P3M""}",Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-01 10:58:42
52515465,594649,1759316348,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52515465.jpeg,Michael Saylor’s $1T Bitcoin Goal Propels L2 Scaling Solution Bitcoin Hyper,https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-trillion-dollar-bitcoin-empire-pumps-hyper/,"Michael Saylor’s $BTC ambitions know no bounds. Now, he plans for his company – Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) – to stack up $1T of the world’s largest crypto asset. Even as critics get louder about the company’s $BTC buying strategy, Saylor remains unfazed. As more $BTC is scooped up, projects building on Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Hyper, are likely to see their utility and demand accelerate. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , now in presale, is a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution being developed to address the Bitcoin network’s pain points. And it’ll only help as demand peaks. Strategy’s $47.35B $BTC Stash Generates $27B in Returns In 2020, Strategy boldly pivoted from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. And boy, has it paid off. The company is now the largest corporate holder of $BTC worldwide. Currently, Strategy holds a total of 640,031 $BTC, following a recent purchase of 196 $BTC worth approximately $22.1M. The total stash was accumulated for roughly $47.35B at an average price of about $73,983. However, with $BTC now trading at $116,5K , Strategy is sitting on over $27B in unrealized gains. Despite the humongous profit, Strategy’s large $BTC buys have received some backlash. Take short-seller Jim Chano, for instance. He slammed the company’s valuation by calling it ‘financial gibberish.’ Not helping matters, Chanos argues that Strategy’s market cap shouldn’t exceed the value of its $BTC holdings. Yet, in June, the company’s $108B valuation was around 1.74x its $62.27B worth of $BTC – a cap critics say creates an arbitrage opportunity. Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, also criticizes Strategy. In an X post last week, he called the firm’s approach ‘harebrained’ and noted that Strategy ($MSTR) is down 45% from its November 2024 peak. Still, ongoing criticism hasn’t deterred other firms from betting big on the crypto king. 108 Public Companies Now Hold $119.5B Worth of $BTC CoinMarketCap data shows that 108 public companies now hold 1,029,413 $BTC worth over $119.5B – 4.90% of the asset’s total supply. Behind Strategy, MARA Holdings is the second-largest $BTC treasury, holding 52,477 $BTC, valued at over $6B. Meanwhile, XXI is firmly in third place, holding 43,514 $BTC worth roughly $5.05B. These companies, including the likes of Metaplanet (which recently established a US subsidiary to expand its $BTC income business ), view the crypto leader as a long-term investment with high profit potential. But as more capital flows into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the network often becomes congested. In turn, this results in slow transaction speeds and high fees — a less-than-ideal setup for users. This is where Bitcoin Hyper steps in. Bitcoin Hyper to Make Bitcoin as Efficient as Solana Bitcoin Hyper is on a mission to address the Bitcoin network’s biggest limitations. Once launched this quarter, its L2 chain will leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to make the Bitcoin network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Right now, Bitcoin can only process 4.2 transactions per second (TPS) , ~18,521% less than Solana’s 782.1 TPS . In fact, Solana far outpaces Bitcoin in many key performance areas. The network’s maximum throughput reaches 4,709 tps, roughly 357x higher than Bitcoin’s 13.2 tps peak. And that’s not all. Solana’s block time average is much higher at 0.39 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s 9 minutes and 35 seconds. But it’s not just the utilization of the SVM that’ll make the L2 more scalable – the addition of a Canonical Bridge will help, too. The bridge will enable the movement of wrapped versions of $BTC across the Bitcoin mainnet and the L2 network. In doing so, $BTC can be used across DeFi, dApps, NFTs, and other Web3 ecosystems. This unlocks new use cases previously unseen on Bitcoin, which will also boost liquidity. All while preserving the inherent security of Bitcoin’s base layer. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, global mining network, and decentralized validator base make it highly resistant to attacks and manipulation. $HYPER Powers the Bitcoin L2’s Utility, Scalability & Growth At the core of the entire ecosystem is $HYPER , the project’s native token that drives utility, sustainability, and scalability. The presale tokenomics show that a hefty 30% of its total token supply is earmarked to fund ongoing development, while an extra 25% is reserved for the ecosystem treasury. Supporting the project and buying $HYPER on presale – currently available for just $0.013005 – comes with several additional perks. From lower gas fees to governance rights and passive income at a 60% APY through staking (or all three!), holding $HYPER unlocks attractive, exclusive benefits to holders. If you’re interested in staking for gains, there’s no better time to do precisely that; the APY will drop as more investors catch on. Experts predict $HYPER could reach $0.32 after it’s listed on some of the best crypto exchanges . This alone could generate over 24x returns, and that’s without factoring in any staking income. Weighing all these points together, it’s no surprise $HYPER has raised over $19.5M already, with recent whale buys as big as $113.8K , $109.9K , and $105.4K . Start stacking like Strategy — Join Bitcoin Hyper today. Disclaimer: The information provided is solely for educational and informational purposes.

52515530,594150,1759316415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52515530.jpeg,Cardano Founder Confirms Google Collaboration On Midnight,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-google-collaboration-midnight/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has confirmed a new collaboration between Midnight—Cardano’s privacy-focused partner chain—and Google Cloud, framing it as a strategic step to harden the network’s infrastructure and accelerate developer adoption. “Proud to be working with Google on Midnight. They are a wonderful company and add a ton of value to our ecosystem,” the Cardano founder wrote on X, amplifying Midnight’s announcement and a same-day blog post from the project. Google Is Now Part Of Cardano’s Midnight In a September 30, 2025 post , Midnight said the Midnight Foundation has launched a “strategic collaboration” with Google Cloud “for enterprise-grade security and infrastructure and to expand community tools and resources,” positioning zero-knowledge technology as “essential infrastructure for next-generation digital systems.” The announcement situates Midnight’s core thesis —selective disclosure and privacy-preserving computation—inside a compliance-aware architecture aimed at institutions handling sensitive data. The scope of work is unusually concrete for a cloud–blockchain tie-up. According to Midnight, Google Cloud will “operate critical network infrastructure, including running a validator for Midnight,” and will bring its Mandiant division’s threat monitoring and incident-response capabilities to the network. Midnight also says it will leverage Google Cloud’s Confidential Computing to remove operators from the trust boundary and harden against provider-level access, signaling an attempt to bind zero-knowledge proofs with hardware-enforced isolation. “The future of enterprise applications requires both transparency and privacy,” said Richard Widmann, Head of Web3 Strategy and Operations at Google Cloud. “By providing scalable infrastructure, we’re enabling developers to experiment with innovative zero knowledge frameworks to verify transactions without exposing sensitive data.” Midnight framed the collaboration as an accelerant for real-world use cases that have historically struggled on transparent public chains. Fahmi Syed, President of the Midnight Foundation, argued that “Midnight transforms privacy from a technical barrier into a competitive advantage, enabling confidential financial systems, verifiable digital identity, and secure applications that can operate at scale with regulatory compliance built in.” The blog post points to selective-disclosure patterns for financial institutions (private trading and compliant cross-border payments), credential issuance for governments, and privacy-preserving data-sharing in healthcare as early targets. On the developer front, Midnight said projects building on the network can apply to the Google for Startups Web3 Program, with “up to $200,000 in Google Cloud Platform Credits over two years,” plus training and mentorship—an increasingly standard incentive package in cloud-supported web3 ecosystems but notable for a privacy-centric L1. Midnight’s own post and social messages also emphasize that the Google Cloud collaboration includes support for community tooling and expanded resources, indicating a bid to spur third-party app growth around Midnight’s zero-knowledge stack. Hoskinson’s endorsement underscores the partner-chain strategy that Cardano entities have advanced this year, with Midnight frequently described as the lead privacy chain in that model. While the announcement stops short of financial terms or service-level guarantees, it commits Google Cloud to an operational role on the network—validator operations and security services—beyond marketing or co-branding, and provides direct quotes from both organizations that anchor the collaboration in concrete infrastructure and security deliverables.

Speaking on Lex Fridman's podcast, the Telegram CEO said that he invested in Bitcoin early and that it was very important to him. At this point, Pavel Durov said that early BTC investment was the only lifesaver for him. Durov said that investing a few thousand Bitcoins early in 2013 was the key to getting through the difficult times he went through. Durov stated that he has been a firm believer in Bitcoin's vision since its inception, adding that he purchased approximately $2 million worth of BTC in 2013 when the price was around $700 and then ignored his investment. He added that he wasn't bothered by people mocking him after the price later dropped. “I have been a big believer in Bitcoin almost since its inception. I bought my first few thousand Bitcoins in 2013 and didn't really care about it after that.” He also explained that many people believe that he is making profits from Telegram but this is not the truth, the company is only making losses for him. At this point, Durov emphasized that his past Bitcoin investment was the only reason he was able to withstand financial difficulties. “As I said, Telegram is a money-losing platform for me. Bitcoin is something that keeps me afloat.” Durov added that he believes that Bitcoin's value will one day exceed $1 million due to governments constantly printing money. He explained that this is due to Bitcoin's limited supply and predictable inflation, which cannot be arbitrarily changed. Durov stated that he concluded that the longevity of fiat currencies cannot be guaranteed, stating that Bitcoin will exist forever and adding, “Nobody is printing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is permanent. The future of all fiat currencies is uncertain.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: An Altcoin CEO Who Had a Hard Time Last Year Praises Bitcoin (BTC)!

What is driving Ethereum’s recent network activity and price action? Ethereum network activity is being driven by rising real-user transactions and renewed on‑chain engagement; daily transactions reached 1.6–1.7 million while Active Addresses rose to ~422k. Despite these fundamentals, ETH price remains range-bound near $4,147 due to weak momentum indicators. How high are transactions and what do they mean? Daily Ethereum transactions recently broke a four‑year range, registering between 1.6 and 1.7 million. Source: CryptoQuant. This uptick, paired with higher Active Addresses, points to growing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and utility-driven demand rather than speculative ticks. As of writing, network throughput shows the highest recorded transaction levels for Ethereum, reflecting sustained user activity across wallets and DeFi protocols. Why are Active Addresses important now? Active Addresses climbed from roughly 342k to 422k, showing a meaningful rebound in on‑chain users. Source: CryptoQuant. When Addresses and Transactions rise together, it typically signals genuine adoption rather than exchange or wash trading. Real-user growth supports long-term value capture for ETH when paired with productive uses like DeFi and NFT activity. How are whales and derivatives impacting ETH flows? Large holders increased exposure while futures/perpetuals volume spiked. Source: Lookonchain (wallet activity); DefiLlama (perpetuals volume). Two wallets related to Bitmine reportedly received 51,255 ETH (~$213M), lifting reported holdings materially. Perpetuals volume for Ethereum reached $1.268 billion on 01 October, the highest since July. These flows show both accumulation and elevated trader positioning. When will momentum confirm a breakout? Momentum indicators remain weak: the Directional Movement Index (DMI) sits near 17 with -DI higher, and the Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) is around 33. Source: TradingView. For a bullish trend reversal, DMI needs a +DI flip above -DI and SMI must clear 40. Until momentum confirms, expect ETH to remain range‑bound near $4,000–$4,300, with potential upside retests to $4,250 and $4,456 if whale flows translate to spot buying. Frequently Asked Questions How many transactions did Ethereum record recently? Ethereum recorded between 1.6 and 1.7 million transactions in the latest daily snapshot, marking a multi‑year high and stronger on‑chain demand. Source: CryptoQuant. Is whale accumulation driving ETH price higher? Whale accumulation increases upside potential but has not yet overcome weak momentum indicators; futures volume growth shows rising exposure but price remains range‑bound until technicals improve. What momentum readings should traders watch? Traders should watch DMI for a +DI flip and SMI breaking above 40; these signals would suggest momentum is shifting from bearish to bullish. Key Takeaways On‑chain adoption is up : Transactions and Active Addresses confirm rising real‑user activity. Market positioning is elevated : Whale accumulation and higher perps volume signal increased exposure. Momentum constrains price : Weak DMI/SMI keep ETH range‑bound until technicals improve. Conclusion Ethereum network activity shows clear adoption strength while price action reflects short-term technical inertia. Combining on‑chain data with derivatives positioning gives a balanced view: fundamentals are supportive, but traders should wait for momentum confirmation before assuming a sustained breakout.

52515870,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84987,1759317134,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP October Price Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-october-price-prediction/,"October often proves pivotal in financial markets, separating fleeting rallies from sustained breakouts. This year, XRP sits at a critical juncture, with traders closely monitoring every daily close. In a recent video posted on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO laid out a clear case for why the current corrective phase may be nearing its end. His analysis offers both optimism for an imminent rally and caution for those expecting an immediate surge. Steph’s Outlook on the Current Phase Steph believes XRP is close to breaking free from its corrective structure. “I believe that XRP is at the end of its correction,” he explained, emphasizing that throughout this bull cycle, pump phases have been followed by longer corrective periods. According to him, this pattern remains intact, but history also shows that once XRP breaks a key downward trend line, the correction phase officially ends. He sets a clear benchmark: “If we close above $2.96 with at least one to maybe three daily closes… then we have the confirmation signal that the next pump phase has officially started.” Until then, he acknowledges the possibility that October could remain sideways or slightly bearish before momentum builds in November. #XRP OCTOBER PRICE PREDICTION! (Watch before tomorrow) pic.twitter.com/mdGXycGHYt — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 30, 2025 Technical Picture Heading Into October On the charts, XRP is currently consolidating in a wedge formation . Support lies in the $2.70–$2.80 region, while resistance aligns with the downward trend line Steph has mapped out. He notes: “Every time you break this trend line to the upside, it labels the end of the correction,” making the next break above resistance crucial for traders seeking confirmation of a bullish move. The historical structure of XRP’s corrections supports his claim. Past corrective periods have lasted anywhere from 80 to 115 days, and the current correction is now deep into that time window. This strengthens the case for a near-term shift in momentum. Potential Catalysts for a Breakout Fundamental and psychological factors could support Steph’s technical thesis. XRP recently recorded its strongest quarterly close in history, a milestone that instills confidence among momentum traders and long-term investors. This structural strength adds weight to any breakout above resistance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In addition, institutional involvement in the digital asset sector continues to grow, with ETF-related flows and increasing regulatory clarity influencing market sentiment. Such developments can act as accelerators if the technical breakout aligns with improving fundamentals. As Steph summarized: “Best case scenario, within ten days we could see the start of that next pump phase.” Risk and Confirmation Levels The critical number to watch remains $2.96. Without multiple daily closes above this level, the market remains vulnerable to sideways movement or further retests of lower support. Steph acknowledges this by warning: “Worst case scenario [is] sideways price action in October and then a blast off at the beginning of November or so.” For traders, this means patience is key. Managing risk through careful position sizing and respecting support zones is essential. Confirmation, not speculation, is key to high-confidence entries. In conclusion, October could prove pivotal for XRP’s trajectory. A sustained break above $2.96 would likely confirm the end of the correction and spark a rally into Q4 . If this doesn’t happen, consolidation could continue until November. As Steph reminds traders, the pattern has been consistent: longer corrections eventually give way to powerful breakouts once trend lines are cleared. For now, XRP’s October price prediction rests on a simple but powerful question: will the market deliver confirmation above $2.96, or will traders need to wait just a little longer for the next pump?

52516006,678f59aa-3d4a-472e-93d6-6c6093b6d030,1759317180,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/52516006.jpeg,"'Uptober' Begins with Bitcoin, Gold Rising: Crypto Daybook Americas",https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/09/30/uptober-begins-with-bitcoin-gold-rises-crypto-daybook-americas,"By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) moved higher amid the U.S. government shutdown and its up roughly 3% in the last 24 hours to $116,400. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index ( CD20 ) rose 3.5%. Equities markets excluding the U.S. also moved higher, even as traders remain cautious over the shutdown. Europe’s STOXX 50 is up 0.3% in today’s session, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.7%. Futures on the S&P 500 are, however, down 0.55% while on the Nasdaq they’re down 0.64%. The U.S. government shutdown could lead to economic data delays, which are compounded by looming tariffs on various items. This has seemingly seen investors move away from the country and into alternative stores of value. That uncertainty has seen the price of gold rise 3.75% in the past week to now hover around $3,890 per ounce. Spot crypto ETFs drew in more than $550 million in net inflows on Sept. 30, with spot bitcoin ETFs representing the lion’s share of that figure. The flight to alternative assets is occurring against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep cutting interest rates this month, with Polymarket traders weighing an 85% chance of a 25 bps cut. That figure is near 95% in the CME’s Fedwatch tool. Lower interest rates could make risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies, more appetizing for investors. Institutional involvement has also deepened amid the changing monetary policy. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) overtook Deribit to become the top venue for bitcoin options trading by open interest, now near $38 billion. “We have seen the convergence of both institutional backing and maturation across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is more embedded in the foundations of global finance, and institutional interest is at an all-time high,” Dom Harz, co-foudner of Bitcoin DeFi gateway BOB, told CoinDesk. “Unlike previous years, this Uptober will see more targeted inflows, which could be a breakout moment in accelerating Bitcoin DeFi, as investors will want to do more with their Bitcoin holdings; transforming it from a static store-of-value into a yield-bearing asset class,” he added. Indeed, bitcoin exposure coupled with yield appears to be becoming a new trend. Just this morning Swiss digital bank Sygnym launched a new BTC Alpha Fund , aiming to generate yield on bitcoin without reducing exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements. While traditional markets are likely to see lower volatility due the upcoming data vacuum from the government shutdown, crypto market see a wave of spot ETF decisions in the near future to look forward to. The SEC is scheduled to make decisions on a total of 16 spot crypto ETF applications this month. Stay alert!

ZEC touched $97.25 before retreating back to around $92.00 - a 41% rise for the day on the back of a 36% rise in daily trading volume to $300 million. The surge comes alongside a boost across the wider altcoin market, with DeFi tokens ethena (ENA), curve (CRV) and raydium (RAY) all increasing by more than 8%. A number of catalysts triggered the crypto recovery; notably the U.S. government shutdown that brought the dollar lower and gold to fresh record highs at $3,887. Altcoins have outperformed bitcoin so far on Wednesday, although it's worth noting that the average crypto relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, suggesting that a period of consolidation is on the cards as the market begins to cool. One market outlier was aster, the native token of its namesake's BNB Chain-based perpetual exchange. ASTER slumped by 6.8% on Wednesday to compound a 25% decline over the past week as hype in the HyperLiquid rival begins to fade. Derivatives Positioning The BTC futures market continues to show a strengthening bullish bias. The overall futures open interest remains high at around $31.69 billion, reflecting sustained trader engagement, with Binance still leading the pack at $13.19 billion. Concurrently, the 3-month annualized basis is holding firm between 6% and 7%, indicating that the yield from the basis trade remains robust. This consistent metric across both open interest and basis suggests that traders are not only increasing their exposure but are doing so with conviction, reinforcing the positive sentiment observed in the market. The BTC options market continues to show a divergence between its key metrics, presenting a complex picture of market sentiment. While the 25 Delta Skew for short-term options remains low, suggesting that traders are still willing to pay a premium for puts to hedge against downside risk, the 24-hour Put/Call Volume points to a surge in bullish speculation. The latest data shows that calls now make up 63.54% of the total volume, a strong reversal from a put-dominated market. This conflicting data indicates a highly polarized environment where some traders are hedging against potential price drops, while a larger number are actively betting on a short-term rally. Funding rates have not only remained positive on major exchanges like Binance and OKX, but have picked up across the board, including on the historically volatile Hyperliquid. Deribit, in particular, is seeing a significant premium, with its annualized funding rate jumping to 17%. This indicates a strong and sustained demand for leveraged long positions, as traders are consistently willing to pay a high premium to hold their bullish bets. The widespread positive funding across all major platforms signals a collective market conviction in a continued upward trend for BTC. Coinglass data shows $644 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 38-62 split between longs and shorts. BTC ($166 million), ETH ($164 million) and Others ($69 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $116,650 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise.

If momentum continues, PUMP can target the daily order block around $0.0074, which, if cleared, could lead to new all-time highs.

52515944,https://finbold.com/?p=254465,1759317257,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,XRP Q4 price prediction after 30% Q3 rally,https://finbold.com/xrp-q4-price-prediction-after-30-q3-rally/,"XRP ended Q3 2025 on a strong note, rising from $2.20 in early July to $2.90 by the end of September, a gain of 31%, marking one of its best quarterly performances in years. With this momentum, cryptocurrency analyst Mikybull outlined the possible outlook for XRP as Q4 begins. In an X post on October 1, the analyst noted that XRP’s bullish quarterly close above long-term resistance is the first since 2017, a setup that previously preceded one of the token’s most explosive rallies. XRP price analysis. Source: TradingView This outlook is supported by XRP forming a multi-year inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that has now broken to the upside. The breakout points to potential continuation, with immediate resistance near $5.50 and long-term targets at $19, $63, and even $215 if the pattern fully plays out over the coming years. With momentum rising, Q4 could be crucial. If buyers sustain the breakout, higher levels may follow, though past cycles suggest rallies often bring profit-taking and volatility, so caution is advised. Notably, XRP’s trajectory is also influenced by broader market catalysts. In this case, the SEC is reviewing multiple spot XRP ETF applications, with decisions expected between October 18 and November 14, including Grayscale’s on October 18. Industry sentiment is optimistic, with approval odds above 99%, and analysts predict a potential price surge to $20 and $30 by 2026 if the ETFs attract institutional capital inflows. XRP price analysis At the time of reporting, XRP was trading at $2.94, up almost 4% in the past 24 hours and over 2% in the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, the 50-day SMA at $2.96 sits just above the current price, indicating potential short-term resistance, while the 200-day SMA at $2.50 provides solid long-term support, with the current price 14% above it. The 14-day RSI at 47.16 suggests neutral momentum, leaving room for accumulation before a significant move and likely stabilizing XRP ahead of any breakout.

Speaking at the conference earlier today, Chief Executive Paolo Ardoino told the audience that Rumble will launch a Tether-powered crypto wallet featuring USAT and other stablecoins, scheduled for release later this year. “Rumble has 51 million active users per month,” Ardoino said. “That is already a huge amount of users if you compare it to what the competition has now in the United States.” According to Bloomberg data, Tether holds a 48% stake in Rumble, having invested $775 million in 2024. The deal gave Tether significant influence over the YouTube rival, which Americans have dubbed a conservative-leaning alternative to mainstream platforms. USAT stablecoin was launched for American users According to the USDT issuer, USAT is a dollar-backed stablecoin created for the US market, specifically because it complies with American regulatory standards. Bo Hines, a former Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council under President Donald Trump, was appointed CEO of USAT. The team will be based in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Hines has political roots. Tether has long profited from investing the reserves backing its flagship USDT stablecoin into US Treasuries and similar assets. In the second quarter, the El Salvador-based company reported $4.9 billion in profit, according to a July blog post from the company. USDT is the largest stablecoin in circulation, with a supply of $174.6 billion, per data from CoinGecko. Its main rival, Circle’s USDC, trails as the second-largest digital dollar but has more influence and ties to US crypto exchanges like Coinbase. Tether’s acquisition of Rumble shares in December 2024 secured nearly half the company. Rumble used $250 million of the proceeds to support growth initiatives, while the rest funded a self-tender offer for up to 70 million shares of Class A stock at $7.50 each, the same price as Tether’s investment. Rumble’s founder and CEO, Chris Pavlovski, maintained his controlling stake after the Tether agreement. “Tether is the perfect partner that can put a rocket pack on the back of Rumble as we prepare for our next phase of growth,” Pavlovski said. US stablecoin market heats up, Tether makes more investments The stablecoin sector has grown exponentially since the passage of the GENIUS Act in July, which established a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins. The legislation, championed and signed into law by President Trump, has encouraged private issuers to expand operations in the country. After years of absence from the US due to sanctions, Tether’s return to the US saw it pay a $41 million fine to settle allegations that it misrepresented its reserves. Cryptopolitan had reported that Tether is seeking to raise up to $20 billion through the sale of a 3% stake. According to a Bloomberg exclusive, the offering could value the company at nearly $500 billion, pitting it against some of the world’s largest private firms like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ChatGPT parent company OpenAI. One source close to the discussions insisted that talks are still at an early stage, and final details, including the size of the stake, could change. A few hours after the news broke, Ardoino took to his X account to say the “key investors” were involved and the “valuation is a discount,” without elaborating on the math. According to CEO Ardoino, the proceeds from a potential capital raise could support Tether’s ambitions in artificial intelligence. The company is reportedly hiring dozens of specialists to build an AI platform capable of running on low-cost smartphones. The project includes an offline language-translation app powered by AI agents to be used in developing regions with limited internet connectivity, particularly in Africa and South America.

52516257,594695,1759317735,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52516257.jpeg,"Tether wzmacnia rezerwy, kupując BTC warte miliard dolarów",https://bitcoinist.com/tether-wzmacnia-rezerwy-kupujac-btc-warte-miliard-dolarow/,"Tether, emitent najpopularniejszego stablecoina USDT, kolejny raz pokazuje, że widzi w BTC fundament swojego długoterminowego planu. Firma potwierdziła zakup 8 888 bitcoinów o zawrotnej wartości około miliarda dolarów. To nie jest kolejny ruch na giełdowej szachownicy. Kierunek, który obrał Tether to sygnał, że cyfrowe złoto staje się coraz ważniejsze w portfelach największych graczy. Mimo korekt i sprzecznych prognoz, Bitcoin uważany jest za opłacalną długofalową inwestycję, czego potwierdzeniem jest fakt, że Tether wzmacnia rezerwy BTC. Tether nie zwalnia tempa Jak potwierdziła platforma analityczna Onchain Lens, Tether sfinalizował transakcję w ostatnim dniu trzeciego kwartału 2025 roku. Chwilę później CEO spółki, Paolo Ardoino, w krótkim wpisie na X potwierdził, że kolejny miliard dolarów zamienił się w Bitcoina. Dzięki tej operacji Tether posiada już niemal 10 940 BTC . To pozycjonuje go na drugim miejscu wśród prywatnych firm z największymi rezerwami Bitcoina. Ustępują jedynie Block One, kontrolującemu aż 164 000 BTC. Skąd ta strategia? Tether nie pierwszy raz kupuje tak duże ilości Bitcoina. Pierwsze zakupy do rezerw spółka ogłosiła już we wrześniu 2022 roku. W maju 2023 padła jasna deklaracja, że nawet 15% kwartalnych zysków będzie przeznaczane na kolejne zakupy BTC. Ta polityka przynosi efekty. Adres rezerwowy Tethera, zaczynający się od „bc1qj” należy obecnie do dziesiątki największych posiadaczy Bitcoina na świecie, ustępując głównie zimnym portfelom giełd. Trend wśród firm Tether nie działa w próżni. Coraz więcej przedsiębiorstw inwestuje w BTC. Strategy, globalny lider pod względem rezerw, trzyma na bilansie ponad 640 000 BTC . Cypryjska spółka żeglugowa Robin Energy także dołączyła do grona posiadaczy. Jej debiutancki zakup opiewał na 5 milionów dolarów. Wszystko to sprawia, że podaż w obiegu maleje , a presja cenowa rośnie. Raport Fidelity potwierdza, że im więcej instytucji akumuluje Bitcoina, tym mniej go zostaje na rynku. W efekcie inwestorzy indywidualni muszą szukać alternatywnych możliwości wejścia w ten ekosystem. Bitcoin Hyper, czyli nowe spojrzenie na Bitcoina Właśnie tu pojawia się Bitcoin Hyper . Świeży projekt infrastrukturalny, który zbiera coraz większe zainteresowanie wśród sympatyków aktywów cyfrowych. Twórcy chcą zbudować niezależną warstwę drugą dla Bitcoina , opartą na Solana Virtual Machine. Dzięki temu użytkownicy mogliby wykonywać transakcje szybciej i taniej, a dodatkowo korzystać z funkcji stakingu i aplikacji DeFi. Projekt już teraz przyciągnął ponad 19,5 miliona dolarów w ramach przedsprzedaży, a cena jednego tokena to 0,013005 USD . Jak działa Hyper? Mechanizm jest prosty: użytkownik przesyła BTC do sieci Hyper poprzez most Bitcoin Relay. System analizuje transakcję i emituje token reprezentacyjny w ekosystemie Hyper. Ten token można wykorzystać do stakingu, przesyłania środków czy udziału w DeFi. Kluczową rolę odgrywają zero-knowledge proofs , które zabezpieczają transakcje i gwarantują prywatność. Z kolei Solana VM zapewnia szybkość i skalowalność, niwelując kluczową bolączkę BTC. Dlaczego $HYPER może odegrać kluczową rolę? Zakupy Tethera pokazują, że Bitcoin jest traktowany jako skarbiec wartości. Ale jednocześnie rośnie potrzeba nowych narzędzi, które odblokują dodatkowe możliwości dla użytkowników. Bitcoin Hyper jest próbą połączenia stabilności BTC z innowacyjnością DeFi. Dzięki temu powstaje pomost między klasycznym Bitcoinem a nowoczesnymi rozwiązaniami, które do tej pory były domeną Ethereum czy Solany. Token $HYPER – więcej niż inwestycja Całkowita podaż Hyper została ograniczona do 21 miliardów tokenów. Model deflacyjny zwiększa przewidywalność i ogranicza ryzyko inflacji. Środki rozdzielono na rozwój, staking, marketing i płynność. Najważniejsze jednak jest to, że staking aktywuje się automatycznie . Nie trzeba wykonywać dodatkowych kroków. Nagrody naliczają się same, a środki można wycofać w każdej chwili. To rozwiązanie szczególnie przyjazne dla osób, które dopiero zastanawiają się, jak kupić kryptowaluty i nie mają dużego doświadczenia w obsłudze skomplikowanych narzędzi. Portfele i wygoda użytkownika Token $HYPER działa zarówno w standardzie ERC-20, jak i BEP-20. Można go przechowywać w popularnych aplikacjach jak MetaMask, Trust Wallet czy Best Wallet. Ten ostatni uznawany jest za topowy portfel krypto , bo integruje obsługę przedsprzedaży i stakingu w jednym miejscu. Takie podejście eliminuje bariery techniczne. Użytkownik nie musi przeskakiwać między różnymi platformami, aby śledzić swój stan konta i nagrody. Co łączy Tether i Bitcoin Hyper? Na pierwszy rzut oka to dwa różne światy. Z jednej strony gigant finansowy, który dywersyfikuje rezerwy, a z drugiej nowy projekt technologiczny w fazie rozwoju. Jednak wspólnym mianownikiem jest wiara w Bitcoina jako fundament . Tether akumuluje BTC w skarbcach, a Hyper daje możliwość korzystania z jego wartości w bardziej dynamiczny sposób. Razem tworzą obraz rynku, w którym Bitcoin to nie tylko pasywny zasób, ale aktywne narzędzie budowania nowej gospodarki cyfrowej. Tether, kupując kolejne 8 888 BTC, wysyła jasny sygnał, że Bitcoin pozostaje najwazniejszym ogniwem kryptowalut. BTC pozostaje także bezsprzecznie kluczowym elementem globalnych finansów cyfrowych. Inwestorzy, którzy zastanawiają się, gdzie może być najlepsza giełda kryptowalut albo jak w praktyce działać na rynku, powinni śledzić zarówno ruchy gigantów pokroju Tethera, jak i innowacyjne projekty w rodzaju Hyper. To właśnie tam może kryć się kolejna fala adopcji i potencjalnych zysków.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|SOL|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 11:22:15

These forces lifted Bitcoin above $116,000 and reduced downside protection demand, signaling growing institutional confidence and a materially improved probability of further gains this quarter. ETF inflows and institutional positioning are the primary bullish drivers. Short liquidations and options skew contraction show reduced downside hedging. Bitcoin surged past $116,000; total crypto market cap reached $4.09 trillion on October 1. Bitcoin Q4 outlook: ETF flows, dovish Fed, and Q4 seasonality lifted BTC to $116K. Read expert analysis and market signals now. What is driving the Bitcoin Q4 outlook? Bitcoin Q4 outlook is shaped by sustained ETF demand, a dovish Federal Reserve outlook, and persistent Q4 seasonality. These factors lifted BTC above $116,000 and increased market-wide capitalization, while options and liquidation metrics point to lower downside hedging and heightened bullish sentiment. How did today’s rally unfold and what were the key data points? On Wednesday morning, Bitcoin surged past $116,000, erasing much of September’s losses and pushing total crypto market capitalization to $4.09 trillion. At publication time, Bitcoin was trading near $116,441, up approximately 3.1% on the day, per CoinGecko data. Short liquidations during the London session wiped out roughly $60 million in short bets, according to Coinalyze data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Q4 outlook: ETF demand, dovish Fed and Q4 seasonality lift BTC past $116K"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin Q4 outlook improved as ETF inflows, dovish Fed signals and historical Q4 strength pushed BTC above $116,000, reducing demand for downside protection."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-01T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""name"": ""Bitcoin Q4 outlook"" }} Why do options skew and dominance metrics matter for the outlook? Options data shows a roughly 55% decline in Bitcoin’s 25-delta skew, indicating reduced demand for downside protection. Glassnode’s note on Bitcoin dominance rising from 57% to 59% after breaking $114,000 signals a healthier market structure and suggests rallies led by Bitcoin tend to be more durable than altcoin-led moves. Frequently Asked Questions Will ETF flows keep supporting Bitcoin in Q4? ETF flows have been a consistent demand source; continued inflows would likely sustain upward pressure. Institutional positioning and ETF activity are cited by market analysts as core drivers of the current bullish setup. How likely is a sustained Q4 rally for Bitcoin? Historical seasonality shows strong Q4 performance: over the past 12 years, Q4 delivered a median gain of more than 50% for Bitcoin, per Coinglass data. Combined with current market signals, the probability of a bullish Q4 has increased. What short-term risks should traders monitor? Watch for reversal in ETF flows, sudden macro surprises, or a shift in Fed commentary.

Traders should view ETF inflows, options skew contraction, and rising Bitcoin dominance as converging bullish signals. Experts quoted include Shawn Young, MEXC chief analyst, and Derek Lim, head of research at Caladan, who note structural demand and improving macro positioning are supportive for Q4. Key Takeaways ETF demand drives structural buying : Sustained ETF flows are a core bullish engine for Bitcoin. Market structure improved : Bitcoin dominance recovery and fewer downside hedges point to healthier breadth. Seasonality and macro align : Historical Q4 strength plus a dovish Fed increase probability of continued gains; monitor ETF flows and macro data. How to act on the Bitcoin Q4 outlook? For traders and institutions: align position sizing with risk tolerance, use options to hedge selectively, and monitor ETF inflows and macro headlines.

BlackRock added $136M to BTC and ETH ETFs, emphasizing institutional confidence. IBIT now holds roughly 781,900 BTC; ETHA saw structured allocations totalling ~16,901 ETH. BlackRock manages $103.7B in crypto products, balancing Bitcoin’s store-of-value role with Ethereum’s smart-contract utility. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF purchases boost institutional trust; read how allocations changed and what it means for investors. Learn more. What is BlackRock’s recent ETF buying activity? BlackRock’s ETF buying refers to the firm routing $136 million in fresh Bitcoin and Ethereum purchases into addresses linked to its IBIT and ETHA ETFs via Coinbase Prime. These structured buys included ~794 BTC in multi-million-dollar batches and ~16,901 ETH across two allocations. How much Bitcoin and Ethereum did BlackRock buy? BlackRock transferred approximately $136 million in crypto: roughly 794 BTC in batches valued near $11.30M each, 6,901 ETH (~$28.44M) and 10,000 ETH (~$41.21M). IBIT’s aggregate holdings now sit near 781,900 BTC since its January 2024 launch. Recent BlackRock ETF Purchase Summary Asset Amount Approx.

What does the data show about accumulation patterns? IBIT experienced aggressive inflows early in 2024, with a debut peak near 12,600 BTC in January. Subsequent flows moderated: occasional withdrawals in April and August exceeded 5,000 BTC, while recent daily movements range from 1,000–4,000 BTC, suggesting steady accumulation with tactical liquidity management. Frequently Asked Questions How does BlackRock acquire ETF assets like BTC and ETH? BlackRock purchases assets through institutional custody and execution partners (for this reporting, purchases flowed via Coinbase Prime) and allocates them to ETF custody accounts to back share issuance and maintain NAV integrity. Does BlackRock’s buying change market structure? Large institutional purchases can reduce available spot liquidity short-term and signal confidence, but structured buys (larger blocks spread over time) aim to limit market impact and preserve orderly pricing. Key Takeaways Institutional confidence: BlackRock’s $136M buys show continued demand for regulated crypto exposure. Diversified approach: The firm balances Bitcoin’s role as digital gold with Ethereum’s smart-contract utility. Long-term positioning: Steady accumulation and structured buys suggest emphasis on sustained exposure, not short-term trading. Conclusion BlackRock’s recent purchases for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and BlackRock Ethereum ETF reinforce its institutional strategy of allocating to both store-of-value and utility-layer digital assets. Continued accumulation supports a longer-term institutional adoption trend.

No longer viewed as offering outsized returns, SHIB’s growth potential is now fairly modest as investors seek out projects with genuine utility and improved fundamentals. Leading the way in that shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi darling now at a modest $0.035. The project is over 50% sold out phase 6 of its presale. Compared to meme-based tokens that rely on social media hype, Mutuum Finance is building a strong financial framework with peer-to-peer and pool lending, staking rewards with dynamic tiers, and real yield generation, providing genuine value to investors. Already, over 16,670 holders are in the list and over $16.6 million has been raised from presale, showing MUTM’s early momentum as potentially being one of the most explosive altcoins of 2025. Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal Indicators as Supporting Levels Hold Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing initial signs of a potential bullish reversal after a decline below a significant support level in a false breakdown, before reversing to re-take the ground in a hurry, a move which indicates hidden strength behind recent price action. The token is now testing the lower border of a clear triangle formation after rebuffing from the balance zone, and a decent break above $0.00001250 can resuscitate momentum to the $0.00001350 target zone. The price configuration is such that the bears might have exhausted themselves in bear pressure, and there is ample room for SHIB to stage a comeback to Q4. However, as investors keep on looking for utility-based alternatives for further upside potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps on capturing an increasingly large share of the limelight. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Keeps Gathering Pace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is recording explosive gains at its sixth presale stage, demand surging as the project surpasses $16.6 million raised and gains the backing of more than 16,670 investors. Investors early on are positioning themselves for potentially astronomical gains when the token hits the open market. Mutuum Finance is also laying the groundwork for a well-healthy DeFi ecosystem with the launch of a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. As part of its platform security and investor trust promise, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to introduce a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Coders, white-hat hackers, and security researchers are invited to participate in the program to discover bugs, with payout depending on the severity ranging from low and minor through major and critical. The initiative is supplementing community participation with an early bird $100,000 giveaway , offering an additional motivation to join the presale. Mutuum Finance protocol design is a close-order book system that will eliminate market risk and reduce illiquidity. The most important parameters of liquidation levels, close-level conditions, and liquidator incentives are fixed to provide a safe and stable lending process. Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels and liquidation levels are dynamically tuned based on asset volatility, and riskier assets will impose tighter lending conditions. Apart from that, risk-weighted multipliers are applied across asset classes to ensure maximum overall resilience, security, and stability in a range of market conditions. With strong presale traction, a growing ecosystem, and great focus on security and risk management, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a key driver of the next generation of decentralized finance platforms. Top Utility Token of 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the top utility-based altcoins in 2025, having raised over $16.6 million from over 16,670 investors and sold over 50% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. Unlike meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), MUTM offers real-world DeFi usage in the form of peer-to-peer and pooled lending, a USD-backed stablecoin, and robust risk mitigation features that attract retail and whale investors.

The announcement was made after its record-breaking $632 million acquisition just weeks ago and comes alongside strong Q3 earnings. At the same time, lawmakers in Massachusetts are considering their own Bitcoin reserve bill. Metaplanet Adds More Bitcoin Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet made another massive addition to its crypto holdings, and announced that it bought 5,268 BTC for 91.6 billion yen ($623 million). The purchase price equated to roughly 17.4 million yen, or $118,328, per coin. With this acquisition, the company now holds a total of 30,823 BTC, which makes it the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. According to CEO Simon Gerovich, only Strategy, MARA Holdings, and XXI hold larger reserves. The announcement was made just days after Metaplanet disclosed its largest single Bitcoin acquisition to date on Sept. 21, when it bought $632 million worth of BTC. Gerovich said in a Wednesday post on X that the Q3 earnings and recent purchases prove the firm’s scalability and reinforce the foundation for its long-term treasury goals. Metaplanet’s Q3 financial results also shed some light on the momentum behind its strategy. The company reported revenue of 2.438 billion yen ($16.5 million), a 115.7% increase from Q2. Gerovich pointed out that this performance supports Metaplanet’s plan to issue preferred shares as part of a larger $1.4 billion capital raise. The company previously announced that it will issue 385 million new shares, with the proceeds dedicated to even more Bitcoin purchases. In addition, its board recently approved the creation of a US subsidiary, Metaplanet Income Corp., which will focus on scaling a “Bitcoin income generation” business that includes derivatives and other related financial products. Despite the bold expansion, the company’s stock faced short-term volatility. Metaplanet shares dropped 10.26% in Tokyo, which extended a 38% decline over the past month. However, the company is still up more than 48% year-to-date. In contrast, US-traded shares under the ticker MTPLF gained 8.86% to close at $3.96 on Tuesday. Metaplanet’s share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Metaplanet’s ongoing accumulation and structural expansion suggest that the company is doubling down on its role as a leading corporate player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, despite the fact that short-term market reactions are mixed. Massachusetts Weighs Bitcoin Reserve It is not just companies planning on loading up on Bitcoin. Lawmakers in Massachusetts are preparing to weigh in on a proposal that could place the state among a growing group of US jurisdictions considering Bitcoin as part of their financial reserves. The state’s Joint Revenue Committee is set to hold a hearing on a bill that was first introduced in February by Republican Senator Peter Durant, which would establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The legislation will allow the state to deposit any Bitcoin or other digital assets seized by the commonwealth into the reserve and authorize the treasury to allocate up to 10% of the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund for crypto investments. Part of the proposed Bill The push is part of the trend among Republican lawmakers in multiple states advocating for Bitcoin as part of government holdings. However, the bill faces an uphill battle in Massachusetts, where Democrats hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate, as well as control of the governor’s office. The state’s entire congressional delegation is also Democratic, which casts some doubt on whether a Republican-led initiative has a realistic path to passage. Durant’s proposal is similar to efforts across the country where states consider whether to follow the federal government’s lead. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national stockpile of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, partly sourced from seized assets. Congressional Republicans are currently seeking to codify that order into law through the BITCOIN Act. So far, only a few states, including Texas and New Hampshire, actually enacted laws to hold Bitcoin reserves. Others like Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wyoming rejected or failed to advance similar proposals in 2025. New bills in Michigan and Ohio are still under consideration. For Massachusetts, the decision to explore a Bitcoin reserve proves that there is at least some growing interest in digital assets as a hedge against inflation. This strategy was popularized by corporate players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has been steadily expanding its Bitcoin holdings. The upcoming hearing will determine whether Massachusetts might move in the same direction or stall like other states have done.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 11:30:00

Binance’s co-founder Changpeng Zhao confirmed that the hacker made away with $13,000. In a statement posted on X at around 08:26 AM UTC, the BNB Chain team said the attacker used the compromised account to post ten phishing links. The malicious links tricked users into connecting their wallets and signing off on fraudulent transactions. Update on Account Security Incident We’re back! The team has regained full access of the @BNBCHAIN account. The root cause of this breach is still under active investigation and we will share the updates as soon as we can. The estimated damage is $8K and the victims will be… — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 1, 2025 At the time of its update, the team revealed that investigations were ongoing, and the total amount stolen from several blockchains reached around $8,000. The largest single victim suffered losses of $6,500 after interacting with one of the links. The attacker also deployed one phishing contract address, injecting $17,800 before cashing out all of his meme tokens for $22,000. CZ, the former Binance chief executive, confirmed the attack had been neutralized, but not before the exploiter caused the chain an estimated loss of $13,000. “Hacker went through all this trouble, plus criminal liability. He could have made more by building. Victims will be compensated in full,” Zhao wrote on X. CZ, Binance Chain, thank community vigilance for quick recovery BNB Chain has thanked the community for spreading word of the exploit, saying alerts from users helped limit the impact of the hack. “A massive thank you to our community and partners for spreading the word quickly, staying vigilant and supportive throughout this incident,” the statement read. Following his earlier post on the account’s restoration, Zhao also noted that the community “mocked” the hacker after they tried to sell meme tokens. “Interestingly, after the hacker dumped ALL his tokens for a $4k gain, the community took over and bought the meme coin higher, as a mock at the hacker. Funniest comeback by the community,” he remarked. According to security platform SlowMist, the hacker used a well-known phishing technique that swaps similar-looking characters in website domains. SlowMist’s chief information security officer explained that the fake website changed the letter “i” to “l” in order to appear legitimate. “BNB Chain’s English official X account has been hacked! The phishing website changed the letter i into l,” the chief security officer posted, adding that the malicious domain could be connected to the Inferno phishing group.

Crypto hackers swindle $306 million in Q3 The breach of BNB Chain’s X account comes during a year of frequent mid-sized crypto hacks, and one massive exploit that saw Bybit lose over $1 billion. According to Finbold’s Q3 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report in conjunction with SlowMist, the crypto market lost $306.7 million in hacks during the third quarter alone. Unlike the first quarter, when a $1.5 billion Bybit incident was the headline, the third quarter was characterized by a cluster of smaller but damaging breaches. The largest was the $54 million theft from Turkish exchange BtcTurk, where details of the attack are still unknown. Other incidents included $44.2 million stolen from CoinDCX due to a security flaw, $42 million drained from GMX via a reentrancy exploit, $41.5 million lost at SwissBorg because of a third-party vulnerability, and $27 million stolen from BigONE in a supply chain attack. Data from blockchain security firm CertiK showed that in the month of September, platforms lost $155.9 million. Of this amount, $26.4 million came directly from phishing attacks, alongside 14 exploits each resulting in losses of at least $1 million.

According to Coindesk, Sygnum Bank launched the BTC Alpha Fund for its investors. Accordingly, Sygnum launched the BTC Alpha Fund, which allows investors to generate returns by holding Bitcoin without selling it. This new Fund promises annual returns of 8-10% in Bitcoin by transforming stranded assets into larger investments using smart arbitrage and DeFi strategies. By converting arbitrage gains into Bitcoin, investors can increase their holdings without reducing their exposure to BTC's long-term price appreciation. Only 0.8% of Bitcoin's supply is currently used in DeFi, which equates to less than $6.5 billion of the approximately $1 trillion market. According to Sygnum, this suggests significant growth potential for Bitcoin-based yield products. The fund targets professional and institutional investors and returns are paid in Bitcoin. Markus Hammerli, head of the BTC Alpha Fund, says the product has already seen significant interest. He also notes that every $1 billion inflow into Bitcoin ETFs could boost prices by 3-6% due to Bitcoin's limited supply and multiplier effect. *This is not investment advice.

The asset recovered after Binance’s Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao stated he believed the price dip was a temporary shaking of weak hands. ASTER recovered to $1.70, following a local low of $1.50. The token regained its upward momentum, after Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao stated he believed the latest crypto market downturn is the usual shaking out of weak hands. Markets always try to shake out the weak hands. The foundation/support is more solid without them. 🤷‍♂️ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 1, 2025 The recovery arrived after ASTER briefly wiped out 30% of its value, diminishing its market cap by $1B within hours. The price drop happened right after Zhao spoke during an X space at @Shillin_villian , outlining the risks and opportunities of the Aster DEX. ASTER dipped to local lows of $1.50, before recovering the $1.70 range. | Source: CoinGecko . ASTER fell prey to FUD on having a sniped supply, wash trading, or other non-organic activities. However, Zhao also expressed long-term support for the project, in its bid to challenge Hyperliquid and become a leading perp DEX. Is ASTER undervalued? According to the recent X Spaces moderator Alex, ASTER has an extremely high mindshare, yet it is underperforming. The project has shown to be profitable from its initial trading days, easily challenging other perp DEX. The amount of mindshare aster has while the token price is moving slowly is very peculiar Somethings off… This token is gonna send Its too profitable and its too under priced Something is holding it back… cant put my finger on it… but dont get shaken out — Alex (@ShiLLin_ViLLian) October 1, 2025 The Aster perp DEX continues to produce fees of over $15M per day, with over $25M as of September 28, an all-time peak. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, Aster gained significant exposure from its fee generation. The trading of ASTER still depends on decentralized markets, which are more chaotic. Retail investors are also not always looking at the long-term value of the Aster project. ASTER also trades on the open market, unlike HYPE, which started out on its own native platform. Currently, ASTER relies on Bybit, Gate, and MEXC, though the token expects major listings in October. Can Aster challenge Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid still produces over $3M in daily fees, and continues to attract high-profile whales. For Aster, the initial growth in mindshare cannot translate into tracking whale positions, due to the structure of the DEX and its dark liquidity pools. For now, Aster still lags behind Hyperliquid , which carries over $12B in total open interest, while Aster is still at around $1.5B in open interest. Aster is also still relying on point farming, and offers no other services except perp DEX trading. Hyperliquid’s ecosystem has already added tokens, as well as NFTs, and retains its first-mover advantage. The coming weeks may change the ratio, if Aster continues its rapid growth. Currently, the new perp DEX advantage suggests ASTER is undervalued, based on the fee production. However, for now Aster traders have logged relatively smaller earnings when compared to top Hyperliquid whales. Despite this, whale trader James Wynn switched to promoting his Aster signup code, though still trading on Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid is also not giving up, as its token retains some strength. HYPE recovered to $45.61 following the latest downturn, expecting a bigger potential breakout. HYPE has also been challenged by other projects with a similar model, though their tokens have diminished over time. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

52517314,594250,1759320022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52517314.jpeg,Gary Gensler’s Vanishing Messages Trigger Republican Inquiry,https://bitcoinist.com/gary-genslers-vanishing-messages-trigger-republican-inquiry/,"Former Securities And Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler lost nearly a year of text messages after an automated IT action, a federal review found. According to a special review by the SEC’s Office of Inspector General, information technology staff triggered an automated “enterprise wipe” that erased text messages sent and received on Gary Gensler’s government phone between October 18, 2022, and September 6, 2023. The review says the device had not been backed up during that interval, and routine alerts and change controls were missed or ignored. Gary Gensler & The Missing Text: Inspector General’s Findings The OIG report found the wipe resulted from a poorly understood automated policy put in place by the SEC’s Office of Information Technology in August 2023. Based on the review, the wipe was avoidable and was compounded by weak change management, failures to act on vendor software flaws, and a lack of timely backups — gaps that left key messages unrecoverable. The report lists recommendations and said agency management has responded with corrective steps. Lawmakers See A Double Standard House Republican leaders are pressing the SEC for answers. Based on reports from the House Financial Services Committee, Republican chairmen have written to SEC Chair Paul Atkins seeking details about how the loss happened, what records were affected, and whether the agency’s recordkeeping met federal law. They point out that in fiscal year 2023 the SEC obtained more than $400 million in penalties tied to recordkeeping and off-channel communications by firms, and say the agency itself must meet the same standard it enforced on others. Political And Legal Stakes The missing messages overlap with a busy year of enforcement actions and policy talks at the SEC. Reports have disclosed that some deleted texts involved enforcement work tied to crypto cases and other high-profile matters, which could matter to litigants and to records requests under the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA . Across the industry, critics point to Gary Gensler as instrumental in an alleged Biden administration campaign to nudge banks into restricting services to crypto companies, and they charge that the SEC under his watch weakened the sector by bringing several lawsuits. What The Agency Has Said And What’s Next The SEC’s OIT and agency leadership have acknowledged the failures flagged by the OIG and have described steps to fix system controls and backup processes. The House committee’s letter asks for a full account and timelines, and signals lawmakers may follow up with additional oversight or hearings. For now, investigators and agency officials are focused on closing the technical gaps the report identified.

52517249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=830009,1759320057,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52517249.jpeg,"Bitcoin Will Go To $1 Million, Telegram Founder Durov Predicts",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-1-million-telegram-founder-durov/,"Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, used a wide-ranging conversation on the Lex Fridman Podcast to make one of his clearest long-term calls on Bitcoin yet: “I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” The remarks appear on Fridman’s newly released episode with Durov. Why Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million: Pavel Durov Pressed by Fridman on why he kept accumulating Bitcoin and whether he sees further upside, Durov traced his conviction to the asset’s earliest days and to its monetary design. “I was a big believer in Bitcoin since more or less the start of it,” he said, recalling that he bought “my first few thousand of Bitcoin in 2013,” around “$700 per Bitcoin,” and refused to sell even as the price later fell toward $300. Related Reading: Will October Crown Bitcoin Or Break It? Key Levels In Play “And my response to them was, I don’t care. I’m not going to sell it. I believe in this thing.” For Durov, the crux is Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and predictable issuance: “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange… The governments keep printing money like no tomorrow. Nobody’s printing Bitcoin. There is a predictable inflation and then it stops at a certain point. Bitcoin is here to stay.” Durov also drew a sharp line between his personal finances and Telegram’s operating economics, saying Bitcoin appreciation has effectively financed his lifestyle, not profits from the company. “Telegram is a money losing operation for me personally. Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat,” he noted, adding that his long-term horizon on the asset has not changed since his early purchases more than a decade ago. The timing of Durov’s $1 million thesis is notable given Telegram’s expanding role at crypto’s consumer edge. The company has progressively integrated the TON ecosystem into its product and business model, committing to Toncoin-based ad payments and revenue sharing for channel owners and opening its advertising platform to a broad set of markets. That TON-denominated ad infrastructure has been credited with catalyzing user and developer activity across Telegram’s mini-app economy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders At Cost Basis: SOPR At 1 Signals Mareket Equilibrium On the wallet side, Telegram’s crypto functionality—first rolled out internationally—extended to the United States in July 2025, with the TON community’s wallet mini-app enabling in-app transfers and payments. The US expansion followed what Telegram described as nine-figure global wallet activation metrics in 2024, underscoring the scale of a potential distribution channel for on-chain payments and games. As for the $1 million number itself, Durov anchored it in supply discipline and fiat debasement rather than in short-term market catalysts. His reasoning tracks with hard-cap arguments long advanced by Bitcoin’s most committed holders: issuance is programmatic and terminal, while fiscal and monetary expansion remains discretionary.

Nobody is printing bitcoin.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/AiDwr7xVkQ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 30, 2025 Whether that macro narrative alone can deliver seven-figure prices is a market question; what Durov made clear is that his own positioning reflects a decade of conviction. “Just look at the trends,” he told Fridman. “Bitcoin is here to stay. All the fiat currencies remain to be seen.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,372.

In a letter issued on September 30, the SEC’s Division of Investment Management responded to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP on behalf of financial advisers. The letter confirmed that, for now, state-chartered trusts may be treated as “banks” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 when safeguarding digital assets. Advisers Get Green Light to Store Client Crypto With State Trusts The decision means investment advisers and regulated funds may place client crypto holdings and related cash with such entities without breaching federal custody rules. The no-action position is significant because advisers under federal law must use a “qualified custodian” to hold client assets, typically a national bank or trust company with recognized fiduciary powers. Until now, state-chartered trust companies were not universally viewed as eligible custodians for crypto assets. The SEC’s guidance comes with conditions. Advisers must conduct due diligence to ensure the state-chartered trust is authorized by its state banking authority to provide crypto custody, maintains audited financial statements, and has internal controls verified by independent accountants. They must also confirm that the trust follows strict policies to protect private keys, segregate client assets, and prohibit rehypothecation without client consent. The letter emphasized that the SEC’s stance does not constitute formal rulemaking. “Our letter provides our position on enforcement action only and does not provide any legal conclusions,” wrote Taylor Evenson, senior counsel in the Division of Investment Management. He added that the position could change if facts differ or if the Commission pursues new custodial rules currently under consideration. Market analysts said the move could broaden the crypto custody market. BREAKING: The @SECGov has issued a no-action letter saying that investment advisers can use state-chartered trust companies as qualified custodians for crypto assets. What does this mean? Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, advisers must keep client assets with a… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) September 30, 2025 Bloomberg’s Eleanor Terrett noted that advisers and funds now have clearer assurance they can use state trust companies, which opens the door to greater participation from firms such as Coinbase, Ripple’s Standard Custody, BitGo, and WisdomTree. Brian Daly, director of the Division of Investment Management, said the additional clarity was necessary to address doubts about whether state-chartered trusts qualified. Industry reaction has been largely positive. ETF analyst James Seyffart described the letter as “a textbook example of more clarity for the digital asset space,” adding that it reflects the type of regulatory guidance firms have sought for years. This is a textbook example of more clarity for the digital asset space. Exactly the sort of thing the industry was asking for over the last few years. And it keeps coming. https://t.co/vIA9XQ0XMU — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) September 30, 2025 Daly also said the guidance was designed to meet current needs. “We believe the market will benefit from having this guidance for today’s products, today’s managers, and today’s issues,” he said. While the letter provides a near-term path for advisers, it stops short of providing long-term certainty. The SEC stressed that all existing custody requirements remain in force and that future rulemaking could revisit the treatment of crypto custody under federal law. SEC Signals Major Policy Shift Under Chair Paul Atkins, Softening Stance on Crypto The SEC is showing a major policy shift, moving away from the lawsuit-heavy approach of its previous administration and toward a more collaborative framework for crypto and corporate oversight. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who took office in April, said the agency will issue preliminary notices of potential technical violations before pursuing enforcement, giving companies up to six months to respond. “You can’t just suddenly come and bash down their door,” Atkins said, criticizing the enforcement-first approach of former chair Gary Gensler. SEC softens stance with warning notices before crackdowns, while Trump pushes an SEC shakeup and UK–US unite on stablecoins. #Crypto #Regulations https://t.co/OsAJZnw5fm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 19, 2025 During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC pursued lawsuits against Ripple, Binance, Coinbase, and others, cases Atkins said lacked predictability and legal grounding. Atkins has also rejected the view that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities. He voiced support for tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as stocks and bonds while dropping several high-profile cases inherited from the Gensler era. The SEC’s new Crypto Task Force will host a public hearing on October 17 to explore financial privacy and surveillance technologies. Beyond crypto, the SEC is weighing broader reforms to corporate disclosure rules. On September 19, Atkins confirmed the agency is prioritizing a proposal to give companies flexibility to move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reporting, aligning with a push by President Donald Trump. Republicans currently hold a 3-1 advantage at the agency, boosting the proposal’s chances. SEC Chairman @secpaulsatkins says the agency is preparing reforms for corporate disclosure rules, which could end mandatory quarterly reporting #SEC #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/1AwEdIW1bj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 19, 2025 The shift coincides with Trump’s August executive order opening the $12.5 trillion 401(k) market to alternative assets , including crypto. Lawmakers are urging the SEC to revise its accredited investor rules to expand access. Atkins has further signaled an “innovation exemption” for digital asset firms , expected by year-end, that would let new products launch without immediate regulatory burdens. Together, the changes mark the SEC’s most significant pivot toward crypto since its inception.

Instead of fading into routine end-of-month trading, XRP ended September 2025 with a close that has set a new record in its history, sparking discussions across the crypto community about what comes next for the digital asset. Xoom, a respected commentator on X, drew attention to the event, emphasizing its importance. Verified market data supports the claim: XRP closed Q3 2025 at approximately $2.84, the highest quarterly close the asset has ever recorded. This figure surpasses notable past benchmarks, including the December 2017 quarter-end level of around $2.30, when XRP was riding the momentum of the last major bull cycle. XRP just had its highest quarterly close EVER. pic.twitter.com/c8udX6tsOx — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 1, 2025 The Significance of a Quarterly Close Quarterly closes are not just calendar markers. These levels hold significant technical importance, reflecting where the market has stabilized after prolonged trading pressure. Unlike daily or weekly closes, quarterly finishes reflect sustained conviction from both buyers and sellers, offering a more reliable signal of long-term strength. By closing above previous highs, XRP has effectively reset its technical foundation. Traders now see $2.84 as a key reference point — a price level that could act as strong support in future retracements or as the springboard for the next major breakout. Such levels are closely monitored by institutional players and retail investors alike, making this close particularly influential for upcoming market behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context Within the Crypto Market This milestone arrives at a time of renewed optimism across the digital asset sector. Institutional adoption continues to expand, supported by developments such as ETFs and the growing integration of blockchain into payment systems and financial services. XRP, long positioned as a solution for fast and efficient cross-border value transfer, appears well-placed to benefit from this momentum. Yet, the achievement should be viewed with a balanced perspective. A record quarterly close does not guarantee uninterrupted growth. Historically, markets often experience increased volatility following such milestones, as profit-taking and speculative positioning create short-term fluctuations. For XRP, traders will be watching closely to see if volume and liquidity can sustain momentum above this new level. Looking Ahead The highest quarterly close ever recorded for XRP is more than a number on a chart — it represents renewed strength, broader acceptance, and a shift in how the asset is perceived within the market. Investors now have a fresh benchmark to measure future moves, and analysts will be scrutinizing Q4 performance to see whether XRP can maintain and build upon this foundation. As Xoom highlighted, the close of September 2025 will be remembered as a turning point in XRP’s journey. With Q4 underway, the key question is no longer whether XRP can set records, but how high it can climb from here.

With a market cap of over $1.5 billion, it is currently the 65th largest crypto. Top-performing cryptocurrencies. Source: CoinMarketCap Will Zcash hit $100? It is possible the sudden surge in ZEC activity isn’t mere short-term speculation, as the timing coincides with the ongoing debates around financial and digital ID surveillance. This is evident from the impact of the Zashi cross-chain swap update on September 16, which led to shielded transactions surging to 3.06 million ZEC and Google searches for “privacy coins” hitting record highs . However, the asset is not propped by mere panic alone, as technical indicators likewise suggest strong upward momentum. Namely, ZEC has skyrocketed way past the $56 resistance level dating back to June 2022. At the same time, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 83.69 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level of 7.95 reinforce the bullish picture. Crypto analyst and commentator Vini Barbosa discussed the climb in market cap, noting that ZEC had climbed past the likes of TRUMP ( TRUMP ) and Immutable ( IMX ), going from the 92nd to the 65th largest crypto in only nine days. JUST IN: $ZEC is ranked #65 @ $1.52B market cap 1 ZEC = $93.70 (+230% YoY, +130% MoM) > 18 hours ago, ZEC was #72 @ $1.19B, > only seven days ago it was #87 @ $880M, > nine days ago, Zcash was a #92 coin @ $775M Still below BONK, SKY, and Filecoin, passing TRUMP, JUMP, and IMX https://t.co/18lfWwIfhw pic.twitter.com/pIXp3L1DaC — Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) October 1, 2025 Accordingly, if the trend continues in the following days, a $100 price target appears more than likely, although any long-term strength will hinge on the positive reception of the new integrations and network upgrades.

ChatGPT Breaks It Down,https://cryptopotato.com/how-high-can-pi-network-pi-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down/,"“Uptober” has kicked off with a bang, with many leading cryptocurrencies experiencing substantial gains over the last several hours. Pi Network’s PI has also caught the green wave, but what is the maximum it can reach? Take a look at ChatGPT’s perspective on the matter. PI’s Potential The AI-powered chatbot estimated that the asset may experience a significant price pump if “Uptober” (October’s nickname across the crypto community) lives up to the hype. It outlined several potential factors, such as listing on a top-tier exchange, ecosystem developments, and a roadmap upgrade, which can act as catalysts for a possible bull run. ChatGPT predicted that the most optimistic outcome for PI is to rise in the $0.35-$0.45 range, potentially driven by positive news and a broad crypto rally. The asset currently trades at around $0.27 (according to CoinGecko’s data), with the chatbot indicating that the resurgence will heavily depend on a breakout above the psychological resistance level of $0.30. Moreover, it argued that if the “Uptober” enthusiasm accelerates and liquidity flows into speculative assets, PI could even aim toward the $0.50 region: “PI could break through key resistances and surprise investors with a rally into the $0.40–$0.50 range, establishing itself as one of the standout performers of the month.” Last but not least, ChatGPT touched upon Pi Network’s devoted community, which consists of millions of users. According to the chatbot, the vast base of Pioneers could be reenergized if the price starts climbing, and that in turn might lead to a further ascent. The Bearish Outlook At the same time, ChatGPT noted that the upcoming token unlocks, weak sentiment, and other bearish factors may prevent such a bull run for PI. “Realistically, a rally into the $0.30–$0.35 band might be possible in a strong scenario. But given the looming token unlocks, weak sentiment, and technical resistance, expecting a massive leap beyond ~$0.40 would be risky.” It is important to mention that almost 13 million tokens will be unlocked today (October 1): the record for the following 30 days. A total of 136.3 million PI will be released within that period, providing investors with the opportunity to offload assets they have been waiting to sell for some time.

However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213. The price fell to an intraday low of $204 on Wednesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $211, ultimately falling 0.77%. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL fell almost 9%, slipping below $200 and settling at $192. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising over 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $205. Price action was mixed over the weekend, with SOL falling 0.83% on Saturday to $203. However, it was back in positive territory on Sunday, rising nearly 4% and settling at $210. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 1% to $212. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to $208. The price has increased by almost 4% during the current session, trading around $216. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping over 2% to $1.683. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell almost 11% to a low of $1.413 before settling at $1.499. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2% to $1.468. TIA fell 1.20% on Wednesday and over 6% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, the price fell to a low of $1.337 before settling at $1.362.

Price action was mixed over the weekend as TIA registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising 0.32% on Sunday to settle at $1.419.

Here Are the Details…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/white-house-withdraws-cryptocurrency-friendly-names-cftc-chair-candidacy-here-are-the-details/,"Following the US budget crisis, which has been talked about for days as the 2025 fiscal year draws to a close, an agreement on a budget to fund the federal government has been reached. As a result, the US federal government has officially shut down. While the shutdown continues to be discussed on the US agenda, a new announcement came from the White House. The White House withdrew Brian Quintenz's nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Tuesday evening, Politico reported. “It was the honor of my life to be nominated to chair the CFTC and go through the confirmation process,” Quintenz said, confirming a report published in Politico on Tuesday. “I am grateful to the Chairman for this opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for considering it. I look forward to returning to my private sector work during this exciting time of innovation in our country.” Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC member and head of cryptocurrency policy at a16z, was widely supported by the crypto industry, but his nomination faced delays in Congress. Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss also opposed Quintenz's candidacy, arguing that past decisions involving Quintenz could create a conflict of interest. While the delays raise questions about Quintenz's nomination, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett recently reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the White House is considering nominating former CFTC chair Jill Sommers and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) President Kyle Hauptman for CFTC chair. Terrett noted that both support cryptocurrencies. Related News: Fox Business Reporter Reveals! White House Considers Two New CFTC Chairs Critical to Bitcoin and Altcoins!

52517894,594836,1759321350,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,La ripresa di Ethereum accelera grazie agli afflussi record negli ETF spot statunitensi,https://bitcoinist.com/la-ripresa-di-ethereum-accelera-grazie-agli-afflussi-record-negli-etf-spot-statunitensi/,"La ripresa di Ethereum si è rafforzata dopo che gli ETF spot su ETH negli Stati Uniti hanno registrato 547 milioni di dollari di afflussi netti in un solo giorno , ponendo fine a una serie negativa di cinque giorni consecutivi di deflussi. A guidare la giornata è stato il Fidelity FETH con 202 milioni di dollari, seguito dal BlackRock ETHA con 154 milioni di dollari. Attualmente, gli ETF su ETH gestiscono circa 27,5 miliardi di dollari, pari a circa il 5,4% della capitalizzazione di mercato circolante, un dato che segnala un rinnovato interesse istituzionale mentre il prezzo ha riconquistato il livello psicologico dei 4.000 dollari. Smart Money accumula Ethereum (ETH) mentre le riserve calano Dal punto di vista dei bilanci societari, le istituzioni continuano ad aumentare la loro esposizione. BitMine Immersion Technologies ha rivelato di detenere un tesoro aziendale di 2,65 milioni di ETH, il più grande tracciato tra i suoi pari, mentre Bit Digital prevede di raccogliere 100 milioni di dollari tramite una nota convertibile per acquisire ulteriore ETH, con la possibilità di scalare la classifica delle tesorerie più ricche. Sul fronte on-chain, i dati di CryptoQuant mostrano un calo delle riserve sugli exchange, segnale coerente con il trasferimento delle monete verso la custodia e lo staking: condizioni che storicamente riducono l’offerta circolante quando la domanda cresce. Previsioni Prezzo Ethereum: obiettivi a 4.500–5.000 $ Dal punto di vista tecnico, ETH ha registrato un rialzo di circa +250% dai minimi di ciclo. Alcuni analisti, come Ted Pillows, ritengono che una breve correzione potrebbe preparare il terreno per un movimento verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari, con la possibilità di raggiungere anche i 10.000 dollari in caso di condizioni macro e di liquidità favorevoli. Nel breve termine, mantenere chiusure sopra i 4.200–4.250 dollari manterrebbe i rialzisti in controllo; in caso contrario, il rischio è di una discesa verso l’area di supporto tra 3.800–3.600 dollari. Le integrazioni con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano Ethereum Oltre agli afflussi e alle tesorerie, progrediscono anche le integrazioni nel mondo TradFi. SWIFT ha testato la Layer-2 Linea di Ethereum insieme a BNP Paribas e BNY Mellon per la messaggistica di regolamento on-chain, mentre un progetto più ampio tra SWIFT e Consensys sta esplorando un registro blockchain per i pagamenti transfrontalieri 24/7. Se anche solo una piccola parte del volume di SWIFT si spostasse on-chain, potrebbe diventare un motore costante di domanda per lo spazio dei blocchi e per lo staking di ETH. Conclusione Afflussi record negli ETF, riduzione delle riserve sugli exchange e nuovi progetti con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano lo scenario rialzista di Ethereum sopra i 4.000 dollari. Sopra i 4.200 dollari, il percorso si apre verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari. Sotto tale livello, è probabile un sano retest nella fascia alta dei 3.000 dollari prima della prossima gamba rialzista.

Based on reports, the rebound followed a series of events that together eased selling pressure and drew fresh money into the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buyers Step Back After Failed Push Beyond $115,000: Data The move touched off debate among traders about whether this is a short-term bounce or the start of a stronger leg up into Q4 2025. Bitcoin’s strong rebound in late September 2025 was no accident, according to a recent analysis by XWIN Research Japan. It came from overlapping forces — a weaker dollar, record-breaking gold, steady inflows into large funds, and signs of renewed accumulation — that gave the rally a strong foundation. Macro Shifts Fueled The Move According to central bank announcements, the Federal Reserve’s September 17 rate cut weakened the dollar. Gold hit record highs as cash moved toward hard assets. XWIN Research said investors often park cash in gold first, then shift some of that capital into Bitcoin when they feel risk appetite returning. Add concerns about the growing US fiscal deficit. That pushed some investors toward assets seen as inflation-resistant, and Bitcoin was one of the beneficiaries. Institutional Appetite Added Momentum Reports have disclosed that the SEC eased ETF listing rules, clearing the way for new XRP and DOGE products. That change gave large funds more confidence to allocate to crypto. Major funds such as BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC continued to attract notable inflows. Money from big players matters. It signals that the move was not driven only by retail traders. Technical Signals And Market Mechanics Traders focused on a critical price barrier between $108,000 and $110,000, where it provided extreme support during the reversal. Simultaneously, momentum indicators led the oversight committee to see oversold conditions, leading to some short covering. Long-term holders had previously taken profits while short-term sellers largely capitulated which made it less likely for more individuals to add immediate selling pressure to the market and ultimately began to stabilize prices in the market. This combination of technical relief was compounded by changing trader behavior, and propelled the sentiment from fear towards cautious optimism.

As macro tailwinds buoy the broader market, Tapzi’s presale is accelerating. Early supporters who join the presale now could lock in 185% gains by the time the token hits exchanges. While many new coins struggle to articulate real value, Tapzi doubles down on structure, scarcity, and use case. In a market where hype often reigns supreme, this disciplined approach is capturing attention. Market Rebound Adds Fuel to Presale Sentiment This week witnessed a striking rebound across major cryptos. Bitcoin clawed back into the $116K range after earlier sliding near $109K. Ethereum followed suit, climbing above $4.3K after trading below $3.9K. A weakening US dollar and renewed ETF optimism could be key drivers behind the rally; the USD index is down roughly 6% since the beginning of the year. The market’s broader resurgence is strengthening risk appetite across altcoins and presales; the Altcoin Season Index remains firmly in Altcoin Season territory at 58/100. Against that backdrop, Tapzi’s structured trajectory is turning heads, with nearly 42% of the $TAPZI token presale already sold. Tapzi’s Presale Architecture: Scarcity Meets Discipline Tapzi capped its total token supply at 5B. Of that, only 20% is earmarked for the presale – offering a limited entry point for early participants. But the real strength lies in how $TAPZI is priced, and how those tokens unlock: Stage 1 price: $0.0035 Stage 2 price: $0.0045 Launch listing price: $0.01 That means, for early buyers, the presale structure delivers potential 3x gains before the token even lists. At launch, only 25% of presale tokens vest immediately. The rest unlock gradually over the ensuing three months. Team and development allocations are locked for six months and then distributed over 18 months. The staggered vesting aims to tame token inflation and avoid sudden sell pressure. In contrast to many speculative token launches, Tapzi chooses predictability over volatility, appealing to more sophisticated backers. It’s also a subtle way to indicate just what Tapzi prioritizes – skill, not luck; investment, not speculation. Skill-Based Gaming for the Web3 Era Tapzi’s core offering is a Web3 gaming hub built on the Binance Smart Chain, where players stake $TAPZI tokens to compete in games such as chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe, and rock-paper-scissors. $TAPZI also serves as the prize for those games. To strengthen retention and lower barriers to entry, Tapzi introduces: Gasless gameplay so casual users aren’t deterred by transaction costs Developer SDKs & staking modules enabling new game launches Prize-pool mechanics that grow with user engagement With forecasts projecting Web3 gaming to climb from $25B today to $300B by 2030 , Tapzi is positioning itself to bridge the gap between mainstream gamers and blockchain-native reward economies. Why Tapzi Could Be Among 2025’s Top Presales Every presale claims huge potential, but Tapzi backs its narrative with structure: Presale upside: Investors can lock in potential 185% returns before listing Scarcity and discipline: Fixed supply and vesting reduce inflation risk Utility-driven demand: Gameplay isn’t just a gimmick, but the engine of token demand As the major market rebound restores confidence, Tapzi’s presale trajectory becomes increasingly appealing to investors tired of blind hype. $TAPZI’s planned listing on PancakeSwap could unlock access to the broader market and spark further momentum. In 2025, the best crypto presales are among the hottest plays, but few combine fiscal discipline, real-world utility, and clear tokenomics. Tapzi is an exception, with the necessary scarcity, utility, and structure to make it not just one of the best presales of 2025, but a leading candidate for sustained growth beyond. You can learn more about Tapzi in the project whitepaper , or follow the project on X . Lock in 185% gains if you buy today. As always, do your own research. This isn’t financial advice.

As traders look for the next big opportunity, attention has shifted toward new tokens launching on base chain. The new base meme coins list highlights projects competing for visibility and adoption, while early presales continue to capture strong interest. With the right mix of community, innovation, and accessibility, certain tokens are shaping the conversation for 2025. Among them, Based Eggman is drawing interest with its presale momentum, while Brettcoin and Toshi remain notable names in the wider base meme ecosystem. Based Eggman Presale Leads the New Base Meme Coins List in 2025 Based Eggman has emerged as a standout among base meme coins with an active presale already surpassing $200,000. Positioned at the intersection of defi, gaming, and streaming, the project is building utility beyond typical meme token appeal. Its design places it in conversations around best web3 crypto projects, while traders searching for the best cheap cryptocurrency to invest in are increasingly looking at its entry price point. The presale is now in stage 2, offering a 30% bonus for early participants through the code GGS-30. By combining culture, entertainment, and blockchain applications, Based Eggman seeks to carve its own path within the new base chain meme coins environment. Its versatility makes it part of discussions about how to find crypto coins before they explode, as more investors track its progress through cryptocurrency events calendars. Key benefits of Based Eggman include: Active $200K+ presale progress, showing strong early traction Built with DeFi and streaming integrations in mind Gamified features attracting a broader crypto audience Early-stage pricing compared to established meme tokens Exclusive presale bonus for GGS-30 participants This combination of momentum, affordability, and multi-sector reach is helping Based Eggman shine over other Base Meme projects. Brettcoin Faces Challenges Among Established Base Chain Meme Coins Brettcoin ($BRETT) has gained attention as part of the growing base meme ecosystem, yet it illustrates the risks of relying on older meme tokens. Its live price currently trades near $0.0409 with a circulating supply of almost 9.91 billion tokens. While its earlier peak around $0.45 positioned it as a strong contender, sustaining that level has proven difficult. For those evaluating alt coins to buy in 2025, Brett represents both opportunity and caution. Some traders still believe in its revival, but the broader sentiment places it in the shadow of newer projects featured on the new base meme coins list. As more innovative meme tokens launch, Brett’s value proposition feels limited compared to ico cryptocurrency presales that deliver additional utility. This places Brett in a challenging position, as investors increasingly focus on the next base memecoins to list on Coinbase. Toshi Token Shows Momentum on the Base Meme Market Unlike Brett, Toshi ($TOSHI) is currently posting stronger performance within the base meme space. Over the past week, the token has recorded a 20.8% gain, reaching $0.00075. This level now acts as a support zone, indicating potential resilience in its price movement. The technical picture shows the 50-day EMA sitting below the candlesticks, pointing to active bullish momentum. If Toshi holds its support, analysts expect it could rebound toward $0.00086 and possibly test $0.00098. Such moves demonstrate that Toshi still has room to play a role among the best cheap cryptocurrency to invest in within the base chain ecosystem. While Toshi is not part of the ico cryptocurrency market, its ability to generate short-term returns has kept it in focus for traders watching the cryptocurrency events calendar. It highlights how established tokens can still attract attention even as new presales continue to rise. Conclusion: Choosing Between Base Meme Coins in 2025 The Base meme category is evolving fast, with projects like Based Eggman , Brett, and Toshi each highlighting different aspects of the market. Based Eggman’s presale status places it within discussions about the best web3 crypto projects, while Brett and Toshi reflect the current state of base chain meme coins already trading live. For traders comparing the new base meme coins list, the decision comes down to balancing early access opportunities with existing market performers. As the next base memecoins to list on Coinbase emerge, investors will need to track presales and live tokens carefully. If you want to explore new opportunities within Base meme categoy, now is the time to review ongoing presales like Based Eggman and evaluate where these projects fit in your strategy.

As we move toward 2025, certain tokens on base chains are garnering significant attention due to their unique value propositions and vibrant communities. Among these, Based Eggman emerges as a frontrunner, capturing the interest of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Meanwhile, Brettcoin and Toshi are also key players, each with distinct characteristics and market positions. The Rise of Based Eggman As a new contender, Based Eggman has quickly distinguished itself with a successful presale, crossing the $200,000 mark. This coin's integration into DeFi, gaming, and streaming sectors enhance its appeal, positioning it as a potentially transformative force within the meme coin domain. Investors are drawn to its multifaceted utility, cultural relevance, and the gamification of its features, which broaden its appeal beyond traditional cryptocurrency audiences. Aiding its ascent, the presale of Based Eggman offers a 30% bonus for early investors using the promo code GGS-30, highlighting its strategy to build early momentum and secure a robust initial user base. Brettcoin's Market Struggles Conversely, Brettcoin represents the volatility and challenges faced by older meme coins. Despite its peak trading price of around $0.45, the coin struggles to maintain its relevance as emerging tokens outpace it both technologically and culturally. This scenario underlines the importance of continuous innovation and community engagement in the meme coin sector. Toshi's Steady Performance Unlike Brettcoin, Toshi has demonstrated resilience and an upward trajectory in the meme coin market. With recent gains of over 20%, it shows potential as a stalwart investment among newer base chain meme coins. Such performance is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and for Toshi's sustainability in a highly competitive market. Investment Considerations for Base Chain Meme Coins For potential investors, the choice between these coins should be informed by their market performance, technological innovation, and community strength. Each coin has its trajectory and potential, with Based Eggman leading in innovation, Toshi in stability, and Brettcoin needing strategic pivots to reclaim its market position.

The digital asset, which has long been at the center of both market speculation and institutional interest, is once again in the spotlight following a bold projection from one of the industry’s most followed traders. The statement has sparked debates across trading circles, leaving many to weigh the feasibility of such a price target against the realities of today’s market structure. Cobb’s Q4 XRP Price Call Renowned trader Alex Cobb recently shared his forecast for XRP on the social media platform X, predicting it will reach $6.32 by the end of 2025’s fourth quarter. This figure represents more than a doubling from XRP’s current range, with live data showing the asset trading around the $2.80–$2.90 mark and maintaining a market capitalization in the low hundreds of billions. Translating Cobb’s call into performance terms implies a surge of over 120% within the coming months — a level of growth that, while ambitious, is not unheard of in crypto cycles. Q4 XRP $6.32 — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) October 1, 2025 Why $6.32 Could Be Within Reach The bullish projection is not entirely detached from market realities. Two significant developments continue to shape optimism around XRP. First, Ripple’s launch of RLUSD , its enterprise-focused USD stablecoin introduced in December 2024, has strengthened the ecosystem. RLUSD’s deployment across exchanges and payment corridors ties Ripple more firmly into institutional finance, with XRP serving as a bridge asset in many use cases. Second, the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle has lifted a cloud that weighed heavily on the token for years. The resolution removed regulatory uncertainty and gave financial institutions greater confidence in engaging with XRP-linked products. With a functional stablecoin and clearer regulations, Cobb’s target appears more grounded in reality than mere speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Challenges Ahead Yet, for XRP to double in value within Q4 2025, several headwinds must be overcome. Liquidity at higher price levels remains a concern, as does competition from other leading blockchains vying for capital inflows. The overall sentiment in the crypto market, influenced by Bitcoin’s price movements and macroeconomic factors, will also be a key determinant. Independent analysts caution that XRP must first consolidate above key support zones before any sustained rally toward new highs can materialize. The Bigger Picture Cobb’s prediction underscores a broader narrative that XRP’s best days may still be ahead. With institutional-grade infrastructure now in place and regulatory clarity achieved, the groundwork for growth is solid. However, like all high-conviction forecasts in the crypto market, the $6.32 target should be viewed as an informed opinion rather than an inevitable outcome. For traders and investors, Cobb’s projection serves as both a motivator and a reminder: opportunities abound, but so do risks. Sound strategy and prudent risk management remain as vital as ever.

Meme coins move fast because demand clusters around moments, not schedules. Order books thin out during shifts, which widens spreads and speeds direction changes. In the most volatile cryptos, process beats prediction. Define risk first. Use fixed position sizes, a hard invalidation, and pre-planned exits. Track funding, volume, and top holder activity. When studying a Meme coin Project like Based Eggman , compare on-chain activity to messaging so the thesis rests on observable use, not slogans. To aim for life changing results, compound small edges. Focus on liquid entries, measured adds, and disciplined distribution into strength. Keep a checklist for unlocks, treasury rules, and wallet hygiene. Compare setups across low cap altcoin gems with 1000X potential and keep a shortlist of the Best cheap cryptocurrency to Invest in. Your watchlist for the best crypto to buy now should include clear utility, transparent supply, and simple user steps. Treat every ICO cryptocurrency as an experiment, not a promise. The next altcoin to explode is rarely obvious in real time; it is visible only when data and discipline align. Review results weekly and cut losers without hesitation or regret. Final Words Volatility rewards discipline more than dreams. Start with a plan, not a hope. Map entries, invalidation, and targets before money moves. If you chase the best crypto to buy now, test ease of use, verify token supply, and read the contract. Simple steps lower mistakes. Real usage reduces noise. Compare activity across chains and note where value actually circulates. For meme coin project setups, track distribution, treasury wallets, and unlock calendars. Keep positions small until data confirms strength. Review results weekly and write down lessons to avoid repeat errors. When you hunt low cap altcoin gems with 1000X Potential inside the most volatile cryptos, your edge is patience plus exits. Treat every ICO Cryptocurrency as a live experiment with records. The Next Altcoin to Explode will stand out through numbers, not hype. Act today with care. Visit the official channels, read updates, and decide with intention.

Among these, meme coins like Based Eggman's $GGs stand out for their extreme price fluctuations and potential upside. The Intricacies of Based Eggman and $GGs $GGs, the native token of the Based Eggman ecosystem, plays a multifaceted role in gaming, tipping, and payment processes. This meme coin exemplifies how digital currencies can extend beyond simple financial tools to become integral parts of online communities and entertainment. In the gaming world, $GGs are not only a medium of exchange but also a badge of honor, often used to commend good gameplay or sportsmanship with the term ""GGs"" standing for ""Good Games."" Driven by a community-focused approach, Based Eggman aims to revolutionize crypto gaming by enhancing user engagement through interactive play, watch, and share experiences. Why Meme Coins are Market Movers Meme coins often experience rapid price changes, which can be attributed to their high speculative nature and the behaviors of their tight-knit communities. These assets are highly influenced by social media, trends, and influencer endorsements, leading to swift and significant market movements. Understanding the liquidity, supply dynamics, and utility of such tokens is crucial for investors looking to engage with these high-risk, high-reward assets. Strategic Investment in Volatile Cryptos Investing in volatile cryptocurrencies like $GGs requires a disciplined approach. Prospective buyers should focus on solid fundamentals like token utility, project roadmap, and community strength rather than just speculative potential. It’s also essential to maintain a diversified portfolio and implement risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders and taking profits at predetermined levels.

52519339,594916,1759324262,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52519339.jpeg,From Slow to Hyper: Bitcoin Hyper Tipped as Uptober’s Next 1000x Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/from-slow-to-hyper-bitcoin-hyper-tipped-as-uptobers-next-1000x-crypto/,"Bitcoin is the king of crypto. It’s the biggest, most trusted digital asset in the world. But let’s be real – using Bitcoin for fast payments or DeFi has always been a headache. It’s slow, expensive, and not built for the chaos of meme coins or dApps. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a new Layer 2 project that promises to give Bitcoin the facelift it has been waiting for. With speed, low fees, and full DeFi compatibility, Bitcoin Hyper might just be the next 1000x crypto in Uptober. The Problem: Bitcoin’s Scalability Gap Bitcoin has always been a store of value first, a payment network second. That worked when the main use case was simply ‘buy and hold.’ But as crypto culture exploded, Bitcoin’s limitations became obvious. While Ethereum and Solana were running meme coins, NFTs, and DeFi apps at full throttle, Bitcoin was left sitting on the sidelines. Fees spiked during bull runs, transactions slowed to a crawl, and forget about trying to run complex apps directly on the chain. Bitcoin might be the biggest crypto by market cap, but it couldn’t keep up with the modern demands of builders, traders, and degens. This lack of scalability is the exact gap Bitcoin Hyper is designed to fill. The Solution: Bitcoin Hyper Brings Speed and Power Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a real Bitcoin Layer 2 built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). That’s important, because it brings Solana’s lightning speed and cheap fees straight into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Here’s how it works: you bridge $BTC into the network, it gets verified and minted on the Layer 2, and then you can trade, stake, or run dApps instantly. Transactions are bundled with zero-knowledge proofs and regularly synced back to Bitcoin’s Layer 1 for security. What does this mean in plain English? You can move Bitcoin around in sub-seconds with near-zero gas fees, all while staying connected to Bitcoin’s base chain. Payments, DeFi, meme coins, even NFTs – it’s all on the table now for Bitcoin users. Finally, Bitcoin can do it all. Why $HYPER Is the Token to Watch Every transaction in this ecosystem runs on $HYPER. It’s the fuel for staking, governance, and app launches. That means the more people use Bitcoin Hyper, the more demand there is for the token. The presale numbers already tell the story: $19.5M raised so far, and you can buy $HYPER for $0.013015. At the same time, whale activity around Bitcoin has been heating up, with fresh buys of $12.3K and $10.9K recorded just last night – another sign that confidence in Bitcoin’s growth cycle is back on. Early buyers also get priority access to staking rewards, token launches, and governance. Think of it like a VIP ticket to Bitcoin’s new playground. And in Uptober, when the market heats up and everyone’s chasing the next big thing, $HYPER looks positioned to take off. If you’ve been looking for the best presale of the season, this project checks all the boxes. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin’s Second Act The wild part is what this means for Bitcoin itself. For years, Bitcoin has been called ‘digital gold.’ Great as a store of value, but boring compared to the best altcoins running the show in DeFi and memes. Bitcoin Hyper flips that script. It gives Bitcoin an execution layer where builders can launch dApps, DAOs, and meme coins directly tied to the world’s largest crypto. That could unlock new demand and push Bitcoin even further up the ranks. If Bitcoin is already the number one asset in crypto, imagine what happens when it becomes the most usable one too. It’s like giving a vintage sports car a brand-new turbo engine – the same classic design, but now it roars on the track. Bitcoin’s Next Big Chapter Starts Here Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is more than just a new crypto project. It’s a serious attempt to make Bitcoin relevant for the fast, experimental world of DeFi and meme culture. With a working solution, a huge presale, and Uptober momentum, $HYPER might just be the ticket to Bitcoin’s next big chapter. This article is for informational purposes only.

TRON currently hosts around $80 billion in USDT, providing SunPerp with a strong liquidity foundation. SunPerp supports BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, and BNB perpetual contracts settled in USDT. Early Momentum and User Activity Since launch, SunPerp has seen strong activity, particularly in deposit flows. On September 20, deposits peaked at 264 transactions, making up 74% of total flows that day and reaching $10.3 million in USDT, CryptoQuant reports. Deposits dominate on SunPerp. On Sept 20, they made up 74% of all flows, totaling $10.3M USDT. TVL has already climbed to nearly $30M, showing strong early demand for TRON’s perp trading. pic.twitter.com/OtKsev9jpu — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 30, 2025 The platform’s total value locked (TVL) has now climbed close to $30 million. TVL represents the net deposits that remain after withdrawals, and a growing TVL is often associated with increased trading volumes. For traders, higher TVL shows deeper liquidity and stronger collateral availability for leveraged positions. Competitive Edge: Technology and Cost Efficiency According to CryptoQuant, SunPerp is designed with several features that differentiate it from other decentralized perpetual platforms. One of its key advantages is deep aggregated liquidity, achieved by integrating with leading multi-chain liquidity providers. In terms of performance, the platform offers millisecond-level order matching and high-performance APIs, enabling both retail and institutional users to trade at scale. Intelligent on-chain routing technology further optimizes execution, improving reliability during fast-moving markets. Another standout feature is its zero-gas trading fee structure. By eliminating transaction costs, SunPerp significantly lowers the barrier for frequent trading and high-volume strategies, a critical factor for professional traders who rely on tight margins. Risk Management and Security CryptoQuant reports that security and risk mitigation are central to SunPerp’s architecture. The platform uses multi-source oracle real-time pricing and innovative anti-snipe mechanisms to minimize exposure to abnormal price fluctuations and front-running risks. These measures aim to protect traders during sudden market swings, a key concern for perpetual futures users. SunPerp stresses asset security by ensuring that user deposits remain fully transparent and traceable on-chain. With institutional-grade safeguards, the DEX is targeting both retail traders and professional participants who require higher levels of trust and efficiency in derivatives trading. Outlook for TRON’s DeFi Ecosystem SunPerp’s emergence signals an important step in the growth of TRON’s DeFi sector. With nearly $30 million in TVL and growing participation, the platform is positioned to attract more traders seeking high-speed, low-cost perpetual futures trading. If adoption continues to accelerate, SunPerp could become a cornerstone for derivatives within the TRON ecosystem, reinforcing the network’s derivatives infrastructure.

The initiative, led by VisionSys subsidiary Medintel Technology, is to begin with a plan to acquire and stake $500 million in SOL within the next six months, the company said in a press release . The firm teamed up with Marinade, one of the largest staking operators on Solana with a $2.2 billion total value locked on the protocol, to manage and generate yield on holdings. VisionSys AI's stock was down 20% premarket following the news, but has been a hot name this year, rising more than 300% since coming available for trade in April.

The move would mark a sharp break from its long refusal to support such products and a clear signal that even the most conservative firms are reassessing digital assets. Past Resistance Vanguard has resisted crypto for years, citing volatility and poor fit with long-term portfolios. It previously blocked access to spot Bitcoin ETFs, framing them as speculative and unsuitable for its investors. Reports suggest the firm would not create its own products but could open trading for third-party ETFs, though no timeline has been confirmed. Market Impact A reversal by Vanguard would give crypto ETFs greater legitimacy in traditional finance.

Timing matters more than ever in this market, and presales have become the launchpads for investors chasing 100x narratives. But here’s the catch: not every presale turns into a rocket. The real winners are the ones that combine meme culture with mechanics that can actually sustain growth. That’s why the hunt for the best crypto presales to buy now has intensified. Investors want more than hype; they want liquidity engines, built-in rewards, and systems that favor community over whales. When in doubt, zoom out: history shows the strongest presales are those that structure scarcity and reward conviction. Pepe and Notcoin are still commanding attention with their updates, but MoonBull is where the market’s spotlight is shining brightest. MoonBull’s Engine Makes It One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now MoonBull is more than just a meme; it’s a machine built to reinforce trust and fuel momentum. At the heart of this system is what could be called “The Bull’s Engine.” Every transaction strengthens the project, rather than draining it. A slice of each sale is allocated to the liquidity pool, maintaining deep and stable markets, while another portion is instantly redistributed to holders. Additionally, a cut is permanently marked, reducing supply and creating natural scarcity. It’s a closed loop that rewards the community, deepens liquidity, and sharpens token rarity over time, making MoonBull one of the best crypto presales to buy now for investors seeking sustainable growth Another standout feature is the referral system. Most referral setups are fluff, but MoonBull’s is structured to actually reward both sides. Anyone using a referral code gets a 15% bonus on their token purchase, while the referrer pockets 15% of that purchase instantly. To make things even more compelling, top referrers are ranked monthly and rewarded in USDC, with payouts as high as 10% for leaders. Backed by over 8 billion tokens reserved for this mechanic, the referral program scales with community growth, creating organic buzz without gimmicks. MoonBull Presale Numbers Show Why Early Entry Matters Stage 3 of the MoonBull presale is now live at $0.00004057, with over $180,000 raised and more than 600 holders onboard. The math is staggering: from Stage 3 to the confirmed listing price of $0.00616, the ROI potential clocks in at 15,000%. Early adopters have already secured 62.28% gains, and the next surge is projected at 27.40%. Momentum is not just hype, it’s written into the presale’s design, where every stage brings higher prices and tighter supply. Consider this scenario: a $1,000 allocation at today’s Stage 3 rate secures around 24.65 million MOBU tokens. By the time listing day arrives, that same bag could be worth roughly $151,900 in paper value. It’s the kind of asymmetric bet that excites presale hunters scanning for the best crypto presales to buy now. As one meme-style line goes: “This feels like buying Bitcoin when it still needed training wheels.” Pepe ($PEPE) Holds Meme Market Momentum Pepe Price Slips 0.97% in 24 Hours, dropping to $0.000009289. Despite this slight decline, Pepe still boasts a massive $3.81 billion market capitalization and maintains strong liquidity with $257.91 million in 24-hour trading volume. Ranked among the top meme coins under $1, Pepe’s scale and visibility make it one of the most heavily traded tokens in the market. The token’s real edge comes from its cultural dominance and global accessibility. Available on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, Pepe has secured broad exposure and trading depth that many meme projects never achieve. This ensures that even during dips, Pepe retains one of the healthiest liquidity profiles across meme assets. However, with competitors like MoonBull introducing features such as staking rewards, referral bonuses, and auto-liquidity, investor expectations are shifting. Pepe continues to dominate by sheer scale and recognition, but its long-term position may hinge on evolving beyond community-driven hype alone. Notcoin ($NOT) Faces Pressure But Holds Strong Notcoin Price Drops 4.47% as Trading Volume Dives, with the token sliding to $0.001513 in the past 24 hours. Ranked #275, Notcoin now holds a market cap of $150.52 million and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $154.99 million. Nearly the entire supply is already in circulation, with 99.43 billion NOT tokens out of a maximum supply of 102.45 billion released, giving it a more mature profile than many meme or social tokens that are still rolling out emissions. The sharper concern comes from its 24-hour trading volume, which plunged 94.89% to $27.55 million. This steep decline signals fading speculative activity, often a headwind for short-term price momentum. Still, with a volume-to-market-cap ratio of 18.32%, Notcoin remains actively traded relative to its overall size, which highlights underlying liquidity strength. For investors, Notcoin’s appeal comes from its accessibility and viral adoption. It rapidly rose into the mid-cap ranks, attracting casual traders worldwide. But sustaining that growth won’t be easy. As presale tokens like MoonBull roll out features such as auto-liquidity, staking, and referral rewards, Notcoin will need new catalysts to remain competitive in 2025. Conclusion Pepe remains a cultural force, and Notcoin continues to show mid-cap resilience, but MoonBull has stolen the spotlight. Its “engine” ensures every transaction feeds liquidity, rewards holders, and burns supply. Add to that a referral system that fuels organic expansion and presale numbers already pushing $180,000 raised with 15,000% ROI potential, and it’s clear why MoonBull presale tops lists of the best crypto presales to buy now. The presale is live, the numbers are climbing, and the design rewards early entry at every stage. Investors scanning for the top crypto to buy today don’t need to look far, MoonBull is charging full speed toward launch. Don’t get caught holding the bag after the run starts.

This comes as the UAE recently joined the CARF framework. In September 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Finance signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) and joined the global Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The UAE framework is scheduled to roll out in 2027, and then the UAE is expected to start sharing data with international tax authorities in 2028. CARF provides an international standard for the automatic exchange of crypto-asset-related information between tax authorities and is part of the global standards in the exchange of information for tax purposes. Close to 70 jurisdictions have committed to implementing CARF, with most preparing for their first information exchange in 2027 or 2028. According to SCA, the CARF regulatory initiative will effectively contribute to the development of clear and effective governance standards to enhance the UAE’s commitment to global standards. Feedback is required by November 8th, 2025. يسعد هيئة الأوراق المالية والسلع (SCA) أن تدعوكم للمشاركة في المشورة العامة التي أطلقتها وزارة المالية حول مقترح تطبيق إطار الإبلاغ عن الأصول المشفّرة (CARF) في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة. إن تعاونكم ودعمكم لهذه المبادرة التنظيمية سيسهم بشكل فعال في تطوير معايير حوكمة واضحة… pic.twitter.com/91EBjuXRIK — SCA UAE (@sca_uae) October 1, 2025 UAE forces exchanges to report crypto deals above $50K The SCA Consultation paper notes that CARF compels crypto intermediaries such as crypto exchange platforms and crypto custodians to report certain crypto payment transfers, such as disposals and acquisitions, especially those above $50,000. Under the OECD model, information on retail payment transactions reported under the CARF would be subject to de minimis thresholds, with values exceeding $50,000 requiring specific customer data. The customer in this instance is identified as a crypto-asset user, and their details are exchanged as well. As for transactions below $50,000, the customer is not reported, the transaction is treated as a transfer under the given rules, and only the recipient (e.g., the merchant) is reported as a crypto-asset user. UAE to address non-compliance with strong measures The SCA CARF consultation paper makes it clear that the UAE will take strong measures to address any instances of non-compliance by Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) and reportable users with penalties ranging from AED 20,000 ($5,000) to AED 250,000 ($68,000). The penalties would cover inaccurate or incorrect information in self-certification, up to failing to submit reports to the relevant regulatory authority, or violations of relevant provisions with the intent to circumvent the CRS regulations. In some instances, licenses might be suspended or withdrawn. Six Swiss Exchange , in March, published an article covering CARF, noting that one of the primary risks associated with it is the increased compliance burden on CASPs, as well as issues related to privacy infringements. Additionally, entities might seek jurisdictions with less stringent reporting requirements to avoid compliance, potentially undermining CARF’s effectiveness.

Buyers repeatedly defended the $0.229–$0.230 floor while rejection volume capped upside at $0.234. A late-session push showed momentum building, but conviction remains tethered to whether DOGE can sustain closes beyond resistance. News Background DOGE advanced 1.6% between Sept. 30, 9:00 AM and Oct. 1, 8:00 AM, recovering from a $0.227 low to close at $0.234. Institutional desks dominated flows, defending the sub-$0.230 zone during Asian and European hours. Resistance materialized at $0.234, where volumes exceeded the 24-hour average of 248.7 million tokens. Analysts said the session reflected growing institutional presence in a market once defined by retail participation. Price Action Summary The token traded inside a compressed $0.007 range, reflecting 3% volatility. Afternoon turnover spiked above 400M tokens — nearly double average levels. In the final hour, DOGE rose from $0.233 to $0.234, with a 15.3M surge accompanying a breakout attempt at 7:32 AM. Technical Analysis Support has been validated at $0.229–$0.230, where multiple defenses held against sell pressure. Resistance hardened at $0.234, with rejection prints capping rallies. The tight corridor suggests controlled price discovery dominated by institutional desks, rather than retail-driven volatility. While the late breakout shows momentum, strength above $0.234 is required to confirm continuation toward $0.240. What Traders Are Watching? Whether DOGE can close decisively above $0.234 to flip resistance. If institutional inflows sustain volumes above daily averages. Broader CD20 index reaction to DOGE’s relative resilience.

The combined market cap of these mining stocks rose 43% month-on-month to $56 billion in September, the bank noted. The move was driven by a number of announcements, including Cipher Mining's (CIFR) HPC colocation deal with Fluidstack, and IREN's (IREN) expansion of its Cloud Services business, the report said. The BItcoin hashrate also rose. The monthly average network hashrate ""increased ~82 EH/s (+9%) m/m to an average of 1,031 EH/s in September,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. Mining profitability fell for the second month in a row as the hashrate exceeded 1000 EH/s. The bank's analysts estimated that miners ""earned an average of $49,700 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in September, down 10% from August."" Daily block reward gross profit also slumped 17% from the month prior. Bitfarms (BITF) outperformed the group with a 110% gain, while Cango (CANG) underperformed with an 11% decline. Twelve of the fourteen miners in the bank's coverage outerformed bitcoin in September, the report added.

In an interview for Lex Fridman’s podcast, the tech entrepreneur discussed a number of topics around him, including his troubles with governments, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy. Durov bought Bitcoin early and kept buying Pavel Durov admitted he has been a big believer in Bitcoin since almost the very beginning of the leading cryptocurrency. He got his first bitcoins in 2013, at that time’s peak of $700, when he “just threw a couple of millions there.” When the following year, Bitcoin fell to around $300, he “didn’t care too much” and wasn’t going to sell anyway: “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you, for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange.” The Russian-born businessman revealed his Bitcoin investment, and not his Telegram business, helped him fund his lifestyle. “Telegram is a money-losing operation for me personally. Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat,” he stated, adding: “And I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” Durov suggested reading the trends: “Governments keep printing money like no tomorrow,” he pointed out, noting that at the same time, Bitcoin has a predictable inflation which stops at a certain point. He was positive Bitcoin is here to stay, while it remains to be seen whether this will be the case with all the fiat currencies in existence today. Telegram would rather leave than share info Answering a question he has likely heard many times before, Pavel Durov insisted “Telegram has never shared a single private message with anyone, including governments and intelligence services.” Emphasizing that data within the messenger is encrypted, he stressed that the system’s design makes it impossible even for Telegram to share user correspondence with state actors. Durov rejected any notion this could happen in the future and declared that the company would rather leave a jurisdiction than do that. Describing privacy protection as fundamental, he criticized authorities working against it: “You don’t like privacy, and you think you should ban encryption in your country, like the EU is trying to do now for all its member states? Well, go ahead. We’ll quit this market.” Durov commented on his recent woes in France, where he was arrested in August 2024 and spent time confined in a small cell, amid accusations of complicity with crimes allegedly enabled by his messenger. He also recalled attempts by the French government to exploit the situation he was in. For example, during Romania’s presidential election last year, he was asked if he was ready to shut down Telegram channels supportive of the conservative candidate or opposing “pro-European” candidates. Last week, the 40-year-old Russian accused the French intelligence of also pressing him to censor Telegram channels ahead of the presidential vote in Moldova, Romania’s close neighbor, in exchange for favorable treatment in his ongoing legal case in France, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Durov’s decision to make Telegram different finally delivers Pavel Durov owns 100% of Telegram and has invested millions of dollars of his own money into the messaging app, which only became profitable in 2024. The platform does not permit advertisement based on users’ private data and doesn’t show ads in private chats and small groups, neither has an intrusive news feed. Durov commented: “We had to innovate a lot in order to reach a point where we are profitable, without having to resort to dubious business activities involving exploiting personal data of users.” In 2022, Telegram introduced a subscription model, for certain additional features, and it now has over 15 million paid subscribers, having made more than $500 million from premium subscriptions this year alone. The messenger enabled in-app payments and purchases for its growing ecosystem of mini app developers, charging a reasonable commission, and is experimenting with blockchain technologies. Durov highlighted the development of the TON (The Open Network) blockchain, which started as a Telegram project but was eventually launched by the open-source community, without its direct involvement. He also recently noted the significant growth in prices of NFT gifts on Telegram, making TON one of the largest blockchains in terms of daily volume of non-fungible tokens.

The asset has posted 3% gains over the past day and week. Several analysts are pointing to bullish chart setups that could open the way for higher levels if confirmed. Inverse Head and Shoulders Forms on 4-Hour Chart Trader Tardigrade posted a chart showing Bitcoin shaping an inverse head and shoulders pattern (iH&S). This pattern features three troughs, with the middle one lower than the others, and is often tracked as a bullish reversal structure. The neckline sits between $114,400 and $114,800, acting as resistance. Bitcoin is now testing that zone. A move above it with follow-through would complete the formation.

Key level to watch for a breakout pic.twitter.com/8EgvVQIzdp — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) October 1, 2025 Moreover, analyst Lennaert Snyder noted Bitcoin’s trading range within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. The narrowing range signals compression ahead of a decisive move. Yesterday’s close added momentum, raising the chance of a test at $115,700. Key resistance sits at $119,200. A breakout above this level could trigger a new all-time high. Snyder explained , “Above $119,200 = new ATH imo. Lose $108,900 and $105,000 is next.” A breakdown below those supports could point toward the $100,000 region. Source: Lennaert Snyder/X Ascending Channel Points to $124K and Beyond Jonathan Carter highlighted Bitcoin’s move within an ascending channel since May. BTC recently rebounded from channel support and climbed back above the 50-day moving average near $113,500, a level that had capped upside attempts. Resistance is at $117,000, and clearing it could pave the way for higher targets around $124,000 and $131,300. Carter wrote that the setup shows “strong buyer accumulation building,” adding weight to the bullish case. Liquidity Zones Define Short-Term Focus Daan Crypto Trades noted that a liquidity cluster has formed in the $118,000–$119,000 range, which also matches a past high-volume zone. A breakout above this level could help Bitcoin move out of its current consolidation phase. Support sits around $107,000–$108,000, which matched lows in August and September. $BTC The picture is clear from a liquidity perspective.

The capital infusion, structured as a loan, comes ahead of Thumzup’s pending acquisition of DogeHash and is designed to accelerate deployment of next-generation ASIC miners. According to the press release , with this funding, DogeHash plans to add over 500 new mining rigs, potentially increasing the total operational fleet to more than 4,000 by the end of 2025. This step signals Thumzup’s strategic commitment to scaling its presence in the Dogecoin ecosystem. Expanding Mining Capacity The fresh funding enables DogeHash to deploy cutting-edge mining hardware quickly, enhancing efficiency and production. The move also aligns with Thumzup’s broader vision of becoming a leading player in cryptocurrency mining. Beyond the immediate operational benefits, expanding mining capacity positions both companies to capitalize on potential Dogecoin market rallies. Robert Steele, Thumzup’s CEO, emphasized that this initiative reinforces their goal of building a premier Dogecoin mining operation. Parker Scott, CEO of DogeHash, noted that the early capital helps accelerate operations during a pivotal period. With more rigs online, the company can increase mining output and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving Dogecoin market. This expansion complements Thumzup’s other initiatives, including DOGE treasury purchases and the launch of its Crypto Advisory Board, creating a multi-faceted approach to digital asset growth. Market Conditions and Dogecoin’s Price Action Dogecoin has seen an increase in value alongside this development. The token is currently priced at $0.2427 , reflecting a 5.73% rise in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization now exceeds $36.6 billion, driven by a circulating supply of 150 billion coins. Market analysts are closely monitoring this movement, with short-term and long-term technical indicators pointing to possible breakouts. Trader Tardigrade, a well-followed analyst, noted that Dogecoin is consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour chart. Support lies at $0.226, while resistance is positioned at $0.238. Source: X Breakout above the resistance zone could propel the coin higher, while a failure may test $0.222 again. The compression pattern reflects falling volatility, which often precedes decisive price swings. Long-Term Outlook and $1 Speculation Another market analyst Maximalist, projects a much larger upside for Dogecoin . According to his analysis, the coin has already broken free from a multi-year descending trendline. Currently consolidating in the $0.23–$0.24 range, Dogecoin faces key resistance at $0.28 and $0.45. A confirmed breakout above $0.45 could trigger a run toward $1, supported by Fibonacci extensions and previous cycle highs.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MINING|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-01 13:51:20

Nasdaq-listed Tron Inc., a toy and souvenir manufacturer that has transitioned into a crypto treasury, has seen its shares collapse by 85% from a June 20 peak of $12.80, according to TradingView data. In September alone, the stock fell 55%, erasing much of the gains that followed its entry into the market. Strategy, the software company now known as the largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies, has also shed about 30% of its value over the last three months. The Ethereum treasury, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, is down 67% over the same period. DATs hype is fading fast, analysts warn According to some market analysts, the decline of these stocks is attributed to a familiar monthly cycle of hype, frenzy, and eventual cooling that new financial products experience during their initial launch. Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Research, said that the surge in valuations came from excitement rather than fundamentals. “It is common for hype and frenzy to take over when a new meta is introduced,” he said in a recent interview. “As cooler heads prevail, the asset tends to find a stable footing, leading to a decline in its valuation. This year it happened with Circle’s IPO, and it is happening with DATs.” Strategy’s Michael Saylor was the first to bring the idea to publicly listed institutions when he began converting the company’s corporate cash into Bitcoin in 2020. Saylor transformed the financial intelligence firm, then known as MicroStrategy, into a proxy for BTC exposure and inspired more businesses that had hoped to replicate its success. Some firms in 2025 executed reverse mergers to quickly list on exchanges, while others broadened exposure to other tokens, including Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Healthcare company KindlyMD raised $51.5 million through a private share sale and an additional $200 million via convertible notes to fund its bitcoin treasury launch. The company’s enterprise value-to-net asset value ratio dropped from 75 in May to just 0.7 over the past week, according to data from K33 Research. DAT stocks falling due to execution missteps and regulations Some industry watchers believe the treasury strategy has been poorly executed by most companies, who they reckon got into the business blindly. Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, asserted that many firms rushed to market without a fully sustainable business plan. “The recent drop in crypto treasury companies was a result of bad execution and rushing to the market without fully fleshing out their strategy,” Gregory said. Moreover, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have opened investigations into suspicious stock trades linked to more than 200 companies that announced crypto treasury strategies. Even stocks of firms tied to digital assets, such as Trump Media & Technology Group, which is majority-owned by President Donald Trump, shed 3.8% in September alone. Market saturation shadows US government pro-crypto fueled rally The surge in crypto prices earlier this year, combined with new US accounting rules and favorable regulatory signals from the Trump administration, pushed more companies to launch digital asset treasuries. “The majority of the market can’t hold bitcoin, but they can hold equities,” crypto investor and prominent businessman Kevin O’Leary explained. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows that more than 180 public companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets so far, holding a combined 4.7% of the total supply. Nearly half of them are considered imitators of Strategy, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research at Norway-based K33. “The performance of some of these stocks earlier this summer was just mind-blowing,” Lunde said. “It’s been just a very wild ride, and now the bitcoin treasury space is getting quite saturated.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This week crypto and Web3’s most influential figures gathered at the CV Summit in Zurich, Switzerland. At the summit, known as Switzerland’s most reputable fintech event, a variety of important topics were addressed, but perhaps none more critical than the “the Valley of Crypto” potentially “on the brink of losing its status as a global Web3 hub.” The stark warning comes from Ilya Volkov, CEO and co-founder of YouHodler, who also serves as a board member of Switzerland’s Crypto Valley Association. With Asia’s Token2049 in Singapore happening now and Dubai’s rapid rise, a global shift is taking shape. Will Switzerland continue to innovate and dominate, or will other regions take the reins as the new global crypto hub? Switzerland’s Crypto Valley: How It Became The Global Web3 Hub Switzerland’s Crypto Valley emerged in the mid-2010s as one of the world’s first purpose-built hubs for blockchain and digital asset innovation. Centered in Zug, it quickly earned the nickname “Crypto Valley” by combining Switzerland’s reputation for financial stability with its signature open regulatory attitude. From its inception in 2015 to 2021, regulators were heavily involved in shaping the ecosystem. As Dr. Mattia Rattaggi and Hans Kuhn reflected during the CV Summit panel, Switzerland struck a delicate balance in those formative years. Bold experimentation was encouraged while paying close attention to governance was paramount to avoid unacceptable risk. This combination of pragmatism and foresight gave Crypto Valley credibility at a time when most jurisdictions were still hesitant to engage with cryptocurrencies. Today, that credibility is reinforced by Switzerland’s dense network of industry associations. Jérôme Bailly of the Crypto Valley Association (CVA) and Adriano Bertini of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland (BAS) both underlined how the Valley thrives not just on companies, but on cooperation between associations. The benefits of belonging to the Valley extend well beyond branding. Companies gain access to a globally recognized ecosystem that signals credibility to investors, partners, and regulators. This fosters knowledge-sharing, talent recruitment, and capital flows that would be difficult to replicate elsewhere. For founders and innovators, being part of Crypto Valley meant instant legitimacy and a platform that connects them to the broader global conversation. Yet, while Zug and Switzerland pioneered this model, other regions are now racing to replicate and surpass it. Singapore and Hong Kong have positioned themselves as gateways to Asia’s massive digital economy, while Dubai and Abu Dhabi have leveraged capital inflows and regulatory agility to attract global talent. The very ecosystem that once made Switzerland unique has inspired challengers abroad—forcing Crypto Valley to ask whether it can still stay ahead in the race for global Web3 dominance. The Global Web3 Race: Competing Crypto Hubs Emerge From Washington to Zug, from Singapore to Dubai, global hubs are vying to set the rules, attract talent, and capture capital flows. Each region brings its own distinct strengths—and its own vulnerabilities. The question is no longer who is in the game, but who will lead it. United States: The Incumbent Power The United States remains the world’s financial heavyweight, backed by deep capital markets and the supremacy of its tech giants. Names like VISA, Mastercard, Google, Coinbase, Kraken, and OpenAI aptly illustrate the breadth of American influence across both finance and digital innovation. Yet, despite this strength, the US suffers from several challenges and hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty and the aggressive posture of agencies like the SEC have created an environment where innovation often feels under siege. High-profile lawsuits and uneven enforcement have left entrepreneurs questioning whether the US truly offers a safe home for Web3 projects. As Hans Kuhn noted during the CV Summit, the central question lingers: Is the highly welcome shift of US policy in crypto matters really long-term, or will this policy be rolled back by the next administration? European Union & Switzerland: At a Crossroads The situation across Europe is quite different than in the US. Switzerland, long celebrated for its financial strength and as an early pioneer in crypto regulation, now faces the risk of stagnation. Industry experts, including CVA Board Member Ilya Volkov, openly question whether the country has become “a victim of its own success.” Meanwhile, the European Union has moved forward with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. To some, MiCA represents a potential blueprint for regulatory clarity. To others, including Adriano Bertini and Mattia Rattaggi, it risks suffocating innovation before it scales. “ MiCA does not seem to have been drafted with consumer protection, and small businesses in mind, ” explained Adriano Bertini. “ It seems instead to dramatically raise entry barriers and costs for small ventures to the benefit of large incumbent financial institutions. Thus increasing centralisation and systemic risk in the European crypto market ,” he added. “ While I commend the attempt of the E.U. to create a workable framework for entities operating in crypto markets, the regulation lacks clarity and technical depth in critical aspects, with some key definitions being too broad (e.g. crypto custodian). The result is a regulation that penalises new ventures in Europe, and their abilities to thrive in an industry that is globally ever growing in size and scope. We look forward to European regulators engaging industry experts to improve the regulatory framework and build more sensible regulation more aligned with the needs of consumers and the market as a whole ,” Bertini concluded. “ When I read the first proposals back in 2020 it appeared to me that the nature and extent of the proposed requirements raised an issue of adequacy vis-à-vis the reality of an industry that was and still is to a larger extent constituted by projects and micro firms, and not by SMEs able to tackle the requirements. ” Mattia Rattaggi added. Asia: Momentum Continues to Build While the West wrestles with figuring out regulation, Asia is capitalizing on clarity and ambition. Singapore and Hong Kong have emerged as leading gateways into the region’s digital economy, while Thailand and Vietnam are quietly building grassroots adoption at scale. The ongoing Token2049 conference in Singapore underscores Asia’s momentum, rivaling the scale of leading Western events and attracting global investors, builders, and policymakers. As Jérôme Bailly observed, the region benefits from three critical advantages: government support, regulatory certainty, and a population primed for rapid digital adoption. Together, these factors make Asia one of the most formidable challengers to Switzerland’s early lead. MENA: The Dark Horse Challenger While Asia grabs headlines, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is rapidly positioning itself as a global contender. Cities like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, and Manama (Bahrain) are competing aggressively to attract fintech talent, capital, and infrastructure. Ilya Volkov highlighted the region’s “ huge and rapid growth ” as a sign that MENA should not be dismissed. With vast capital reserves and a strategic geographic position bridging East and West, the Gulf states are well placed to play a central role in the next phase of Web3 development. Addressing Switzerland’s Challenges Despite its role as a Web3 pioneer, Switzerland now finds itself at a critical crossroads. The anxiety within the industry was captured in the 12-point manifesto published in May by CVA, BAS, and SBF—a collective call for policymakers to restore the country’s balance between stability and innovation. The message was clear: Switzerland risks slipping from leadership if it overregulates while ignoring the broader need to foster sustained growth. As experts stated during the session: “ We drifted into micromanagement of small risks. We have to restore the balance—few strong rules for management of big risks, and freedom to innovate by taking on small ones, ”. This cautionary tale resonates with founders and investors who fear that excessive oversight will choke off necessary experimentation. Stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) represent another area of contention. As Hans Kuhn and Adriano Bertini noted, Switzerland faces a choice between maintaining its pragmatic, market-led model or aligning with more rigid global approaches. Too much divergence could isolate the country, but too much similarity could dilute its competitive edge. Here, associations like CVA, BAS, and SBF play a crucial role: setting principles and advocating for sensible regulation while ensuring the creative energy of the ecosystem is not stifled. Their ability to maintain this balance will determine whether Crypto Valley remains a beacon or becomes a relic. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Crypto Valley? What will Crypto Valley become over the next 15 years? Mattia Rattaggi suggested that the very term “Crypto Valley” might soon feel too narrow, as blockchain, Web3, and AI converge into a broader technology ecosystem. The Valley’s strength lies not in a single industry label, but in its ability to evolve alongside innovation. Hans Kuhn pointed to Switzerland’s banking sector as both an anchor and a test. Can it embrace digital assets as a complement to its legacy strengths, or will it remain a drag on innovation? Adriano Bertini and Jérôme Bailly emphasized that the future is not just blockchain, but the integration of Web3 with emerging technologies like AI coupled with improvements in cryptography research that provide privacy enhancing tools to the benefit of consumers. This unique convergence could provide Switzerland with a new edge. “ Switzerland’s strengths, stability and trust, built over centuries—are our edge,” Jerome Bailly stated. “Keep a few strong rules for the big risks and stop micromanaging the small ones. Say ‘yes’ to responsible innovation with clear rules, bank participation at scale, and the courage to ship, ” he added. Conclusion The Crypto Valley Summit left participants with a sobering question, posed by Ilya Volkov: Can Switzerland keep its Web3 crown? Asia and MENA’s rise deserves respect rather than rejection. Their rapid growth reflects ambition, clarity, talent and capital flows that cannot be ignored. “ But Switzerland has to understand its unique role—offering credibility, neutrality, and a legacy of financial trust ,” said Ilya Volkov. The global race for fintech dominance is no longer a debate—it is a reality. Switzerland must decide whether to lead, follow, or be left behind.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|REGULATION|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 13:57:34

In an announcement on X, the official Shiba Inu account welcomed Arlo to the ecosystem, adding that the two teams are “teaming up to enhance the security of Shibarium through artificial intelligence.” Shiba Inu Brings Solana Grant Winner To Shibarium Arlo framed the collaboration as a retail-safety initiative that will extend its live beta—currently available on Solana and Base—to Shibarium. “ARLO has teamed up with Shiba Inu to launch our AI intelligence engine on Shibarium to bring retail safety to Shibarium,” the project wrote, describing a system that can “analyze 100+ data points for any Shibarium token, including on-chain analysis, whale movements, token audits & safety, market trends, risk signals, & influencer activity.” The team also reiterated that “STAKE-TO-ACCESS [is] coming soon,” and clarified in a follow-up that Shibarium support is “not yet live” but “will be launching… soon,” while the tool remains in open beta on Solana and Base. Arlo’s positioning as a Solana Foundation grant recipient is independently corroborated by recent press materials and its website, which highlight the project as “backed by the Solana Foundation” and identify Arlo as an AI token-analysis tool that has received Foundation support. A September press release noted Arlo as “the only AI token analysis tool to receive a Solana Foundation grant,” and the company’s site presents the same backing alongside its Solana contract address. While neither party published technical documentation alongside the posts, the stated scope suggests Arlo intends to provide a machine-learning overlay for token due diligence on Shibarium—surfacing heuristics around liquidity quality, ownership distribution, trading anomalies, and cross-platform sentiment—areas where retail users frequently struggle to separate legitimate launches from high-risk deployments. In response to a community question about coverage, Arlo said its “AI system will work on all tokens on Shibarium… including BONE ,” the network’s gas token, indicating that the toolset is meant to be chain-wide rather than curated for a subset of assets. The move comes as the Shibarium team has faced renewed scrutiny over security and validator resilience following the network’s bridge exploit via a flash-loan-enabled attack to the tune of roughly $2.4 million–an incident that amplified community calls for more robust risk monitoring and faster incident response. For now, the partnership is framed as a phased rollout: open beta on Solana and Base is live, with Shibarium support “coming soon,” and access features tied to staking are on the roadmap. At press time, the Shiba Inu token traded at $0.00001188.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|SOL|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-01 14:00:19

For many, the rebound highlights Bitcoin’s resilience and its ability to bounce after testing key support levels.

Several analysts warn that despite the recent upside, Bitcoin may still face the risk of a deeper correction. The recovery looks promising, but the broader structure remains fragile, and cautious voices continue to dominate discussions. A failure to hold above $115,000 could once again expose the market to volatility and downside pressure. Adding another layer of concern, key data shows that Galaxy Digital’s Bitcoin sales remain ongoing. These sales, taking place even as Bitcoin rises, highlight the complex dynamics at play and temper the optimism around the recent rally. Galaxy Sales Weigh On Bitcoin Top analyst Darkfost shared fresh data that revealed a significant move in Bitcoin markets yesterday. According to him, 1,190 BTC were sent mainly to Binance, most likely to be sold. At current prices, that transaction represents more than $135 million worth of Bitcoin, underscoring that large-scale institutional selling continues even as bulls fight to sustain momentum above $115,000. Such transfers often signal that sellers, in this case Galaxy Digital, are actively reducing exposure, which can pressure the market during sensitive periods. While Bitcoin has managed to rebound from its recent lows near $108,000, these heavy sales create an overhang of supply that traders must absorb before a convincing uptrend can take hold. The timing adds even more weight, as Bitcoin enters a new stage marked by macro uncertainty. The looming US government shutdown now stands as one of the biggest risk factors for global markets. Political deadlock in Washington threatens to disrupt financial stability and could trigger volatility across equities, bonds, and digital assets. For Bitcoin, this situation creates both risk and opportunity: on one hand, fear-driven selling could drag prices lower; on the other, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge may attract inflows from investors seeking protection.

The 8-hour chart highlights renewed bullish momentum, with price now pressing toward the key resistance zone at $117,500. This level has repeatedly capped rallies since late August, making it the line to watch for confirmation of a broader breakout. The recent move higher also pushed BTC back above its 50-period (blue) and 100-period (green) moving averages, both of which had previously acted as resistance. The price is now consolidating above these levels, showing that bulls are regaining short-term control. However, the 200-period moving average (red) sits just overhead near $115,000, and Bitcoin has only just cleared it — leaving the breakout unconfirmed.

A decisive close above $117,500 could invite stronger buying pressure, opening the door for a run toward $120,000 and potentially retesting the yearly highs near $125,000. Conversely, rejection at this level could trigger profit-taking, dragging the price back toward $114,000 or even $112,000.

52521004,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85004,1759327529,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Big XRP Whales Just Switched Sides. Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/big-xrp-whales-just-switched-sides-heres-what-happened/,"Whale activity often dictates short-term sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, and when a high-capital trader dramatically shifts position, the entire community pays attention. This week, a notable switch in XRP derivatives trading drew immediate reaction after STEPH IS CRYPTO revealed that a large market player had abandoned a multi-million-dollar bearish stance and pivoted aggressively bullish. The revelation has raised the question: is a broader reversal in motion, or is this simply another strategic maneuver in a volatile market? The Whale’s Position Flip According to Steph, a significant whale closed an XRP short position worth approximately $2.1 million before opening a long position totaling about $2.8 million. The transaction represents a net capital redeployment into a bullish outlook, highlighting the trader’s belief that downside risk may have diminished and that upside opportunity is preferable at this stage. Such a direct pivot, especially at scale, often draws comparisons to market turning points seen in other assets, where whale rotations have coincided with shifts in retail and institutional sentiment. The timing also coincides with XRP maintaining strength in the multi-dollar range, where leveraged plays can significantly influence price action. BREAKING: BIG #XRP WHALE JUST SWITCHED SIDES. CLOSES $2.1M SHORT, OPENS $2.8M LONG. BULLISH REVERSAL SIGNAL? pic.twitter.com/KDgv4EkvkO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 1, 2025 Why This Is Seen as Bullish A trader’s move from short exposure to leveraged long positions suggests he believes the bearish trend is losing steam and an upward shift is imminent. For XRP, this could act as a catalyst by putting pressure on remaining shorts, potentially triggering liquidations that accelerate upward movement. Historically, similar whale-side reversals in crypto markets have preceded relief rallies or larger breakouts, especially when aligned with rising spot demand and tightening liquidity. At present, XRP futures and options markets report billions in open interest, meaning large position changes can ripple through the order book quickly. Steph’s disclosure of this switch, therefore, carries particular weight for those watching near-term price trajectories. The Derivatives Market Context A single whale trade does not exist in isolation. Broader market data shows active participation across exchanges, with open interest climbing and funding rates fluctuating between neutral and positive. These indicators suggest that sentiment may be gradually shifting toward bullishness after a corrective phase.

Whales often rotate positions to manage exposure, pursue arbitrage opportunities, or hedge against correlated assets. This means not every position flip translates into straightforward directional conviction. A Note of Caution While Steph’s revelation has generated excitement, traders must remain cautious. Large actors are fully aware of how their movements are tracked, and sometimes their trades are designed to provoke reactions from retail participants. A dramatic short-to-long switch could be a genuine signal of confidence, but it could also represent a hedge against existing spot holdings or a short-term tactical play. The prudent approach is to treat this development as one input among many. Confirmation of a sustained bullish reversal will require follow-through in volume, stability in funding rates, and supportive on-chain data that reflects increased utility and adoption of XRP. The $2.1 million short closure followed by a $2.8 million long entry has placed XRP firmly back in the spotlight. Whether this sparks a broader rally or is a strategic move by large traders is uncertain, but it underscores the significant influence major traders have on market trends. For now, the community is watching closely to see if this switch truly marks the beginning of a bullish phase for XRP.
