Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00004137 to $0.00004728. In 2031, we expect the Bonk price to reach a maximum of $0.00007683 with an average of $0.00007388. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates an uptrend. This movement suggests a bullish trend as buying activity dominates selling activity. However, the chances of reversal seem high in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator defines market volatility. As the bands are expanding, this signals an increase in volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00001000. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000713. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bullish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has ascended to $0.00000793, as an upturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained positive. Technical indicators support the bears, but the price charts favor the bulls for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will approach $0.00008, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk up? After a significant dip from $0.00000802 to $0.00000768 over the past few days, BONK is now experiencing some recovery as stakeholders start buying again. Support still exists at $0.00000786 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000189. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00004 by 2028. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.0001. Recent news/opinions on Bonk BONK ETP goes live on six (6) Swiss exchanges.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of October, Bonk was trading near $0.00002056.

His projections suggest a period where blockchain infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and robotics advance simultaneously, reshaping digital markets and technology adoption. Yakovenko shared his outlook through a public post, forecasting that total stablecoin supply could exceed $1 trillion by 2026. Besides scale, his comments pointed toward limits in quantum computing progress, steady fusion challenges, and major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. He also projected shipments of roughly 100,000 humanoid robots within the same period. Stablecoin Growth Faces Conflicting Views Yakovenko’s trillion-dollar stablecoin forecast contrasts with estimates from major financial institutions. JPMorgan Chase expects global stablecoin supply to reach between $500 billion and $600 billion by 2028. The bank links most stablecoin expansion to crypto trading activity rather than everyday payment usage. Significantly, JPMorgan reported that stablecoin supply has grown by about $100 billion this year alone. That growth pushed total supply to roughly $308 billion. USDT and USDC drove most of the increase. Additionally, derivatives platforms added nearly $20 billion in stablecoin balances as futures trading activity expanded. However, JPMorgan analysts emphasized that higher transaction volumes do not automatically require higher supply levels. Faster circulation could reduce the need for large issuance increases. Moreover, banks continue developing tokenized deposits, while central banks explore digital currencies that could compete with private stablecoins. Solana Market Performance and Technical Outlook Solana’s market price moved higher alongside renewed discussion around network adoption. SOL traded at $123 , posting a daily gain of 1.08%. Consequently, its market capitalization stood near $69.3 billion, supported by a circulating supply of about 560 million tokens. Source: X Crypto Patel, a market analyst, commented on investor behavior surrounding Solana’s long-term narrative. He noted that many holders remain emotionally tied to a $1,000 price target. However, he stressed that price cycles never move in a straight line. According to Patel, Solana currently trades within a corrective phase. A breakdown below the $120 support could push prices under $100. That level, he suggested, may offer a stronger long-term accumulation opportunity. His accumulation range extends from $98 down to $50. Long-Term Expectations Remain Divided Despite near-term volatility, long-range projections remain optimistic among some analysts. Patel outlined a long-term valuation range between $500 and $1,000 for SOL.

XRP, in particular, is showing technical signals that suggest a potential bullish reversal could be imminent. While short-term volatility has spooked some traders, seasoned analysts highlight that price patterns, momentum indicators, and historical parallels point to a possible turnaround as XRP approaches key support levels. A recent post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X emphasized that XRP’s price action is testing a downtrend line from August 2025. Steph pointed out that the convergence of technical indicators—including a MACD bullish crossover and an RSI at 37, indicating oversold conditions—signals that downward momentum may be slowing and that buyers could step in, setting the stage for a sharp rebound into 2026. $XRP : MASSIVE TREND REVERSAL INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/zIC2ziNeHu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 26, 2025 Technical Analysis: Trendline, MACD, and RSI XRP’s daily chart shows the asset challenging a descending resistance line that has constrained rallies for months. The RSI, sitting near oversold territory , indicates that selling pressure may be near exhaustion, creating a potential entry point for bullish traders. Meanwhile, the MACD has signaled a bullish crossover, a classic momentum indicator suggesting that short-term averages are beginning to outpace longer-term averages, which often precedes upward price movements. Technical analysis also highlights that XRP’s trendline support has historically served as a pivot point where buyers emerge. Combined with oversold conditions, these signals indicate a higher probability of a bounce rather than a continuation of the downtrend. Historical Parallels: Lessons from 2022 Steph drew a comparison to 2022, when XRP broke a similar downtrend from $0.30. That breakout triggered a 150 % rally to $0.80 within months amid a broader crypto market recovery following the FTX collapse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While history does not guarantee future outcomes, this pattern suggests that prolonged downtrend tests followed by momentum confirmation can precede substantial gains. Market Context and Institutional Factors The broader crypto market context also supports the potential for a reversal. XRP has demonstrated resilience during Q4 2025 selloffs, holding above critical support levels despite macro pressures and risk-off sentiment in global crypto markets. Institutional interest in XRP, particularly for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and cross-border settlement, provides a structural floor for the asset, creating buying pressure when prices approach key technical levels. Outlook: Preparing for a Reversal If XRP successfully breaks above the descending trendline and confirms momentum across MACD and RSI indicators, a significant trend reversal may be underway . Traders should watch for increasing buying pressure and volume, as these factors often confirm a shift from consolidation to an uptrend. While volatility remains, the alignment of technical setups, historical precedents, and market fundamentals suggests that XRP could experience a substantial rebound in the near term.

As of press time on December 27, 2025, XRP was trading at $1.85, reflecting an 11% year-to-date decline. XRP YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold Based on this performance, XRP began the year at approximately $2.08, meaning a $1,000 investment made in early January 2025 would now be worth about $890, representing a loss of roughly $110 before fees or taxes. XRP 2025 performance This underperformance comes in a year that, on paper, should have been transformative for XRP. One of the most significant catalysts in 2025 was the final resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement brought long-awaited regulatory clarity, removing a major overhang that had restricted institutional participation for years and effectively reframing XRP’s status in the U.S. market. Historically, such clarity has been viewed as a potential turning point for digital assets seeking broader adoption. Ripple also made a decisive push into institutional finance during the year. The expansion of its prime brokerage and liquidity services signaled a clear strategy to position XRP within traditional market infrastructure. At the same time, XRP gained exposure through regulated investment vehicles, including the launch and approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) in select jurisdictions, lowering the barrier to entry for both professional and retail investors. Another notable development was the rollout and broader integration of Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. While the stablecoin itself is not XRP, its usage within the ecosystem indirectly supports XRP through transaction fees and liquidity mechanics, adding another layer to the asset’s long-term utility narrative. Despite these structural advances, XRP’s price struggled to sustain momentum throughout 2025. Market sentiment remained fragile for much of the year, with repeated failures to hold above key resistance near $2. Broader crypto market volatility, combined with periodic XRP escrow releases and cautious investor positioning, weighed on price action. By late December, XRP had slipped into negative territory for the year, erasing gains seen earlier in 2025.

Under the revised framework, the system must process single cross-border renminbi payments using real-time gross settlement, while batch transactions must clear through timed net settlement. As a result, payments now follow two clearly separated tracks. Individual transfers settle one by one, immediately and irrevocably, reducing settlement risk between counterparties. At the same time, high-volume batch payments move through scheduled netting cycles, allowing the system to offset obligations and improve liquidity efficiency. In addition, the rules give the CIPS operator flexibility to adjust netting frequency, settlement windows, and processing schedules when transaction volumes or market conditions shift. This design aims to keep the system stable during peak cross-border payment periods while maintaining predictable settlement outcomes for participants. Operational control and system evolution The revised framework also reflects how China’ s cross-border payment infrastructure has evolved since CIPS launched in 2015. Initially built to support basic offshore renminbi settlement, the system has expanded alongside the international use of the yuan in trade, investment, and financial transactions. By locking in real-time settlement for single payments, regulators reinforce a structure similar to major global payment systems, where immediacy and finality limit systemic risk. Meanwhile, net settlement for batches mirrors long-standing international practices used to manage liquidity across large transaction flows. Oversight remains centralized under the People’s Bank of China , which supervises system rules, risk controls, and settlement discipline. Historical data show that Chinese authorities have repeatedly adjusted payment infrastructure rules following periods of market stress, including reforms after the global financial crisis and later enhancements tied to RMB internationalization. Taken together, the changes do not introduce a new payment rail.

The forecast appears in the firm’s latest annual outlook and builds on the momentum seen since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the United States. Galaxy said U.S. spot crypto ETFs pulled in about $23 billion in net inflows during 2025. It now expects that figure to more than double next year as access broadens across traditional investment channels. According to the report, the shift reflects steady normalization of crypto products inside mainstream portfolio construction. At the same time, Galaxy framed the inflow growth as part of a longer institutional adoption cycle rather than a one time launch effect. It said 2026 could mark the first full year when crypto ETFs operate with fewer distribution limits across advisory platforms. Distribution Access Seen as Main Catalyst Galaxy pointed to easing restrictions at wirehouses and large advisory networks as a key driver of higher inflows. As more firms allow financial advisers to recommend spot crypto ETFs, Galaxy expects capital from managed portfolios to rise in size and consistency. In addition, the firm said large investment platforms are gradually expanding the list of approved crypto funds. That process, it noted, increases visibility among traditional investors who previously lacked direct access to spot products through standard brokerage accounts. Galaxy also highlighted product timing. New ETF launches often see strong early demand once distribution opens. The firm expects that pattern to repeat in 2026 as additional spot and non spot crypto products reach the market. Dozens of New Crypto ETFs Expected Beyond bitcoin and ether, Galaxy projects more than 50 U.S. spot altcoin ETFs could launch in 2026. These would be joined by roughly another 50 crypto related ETFs that do not track a single asset, including multi asset and leveraged products. Galaxy linked that outlook to a growing pipeline of regulatory filings. It said more than 100 crypto ETF applications are already in progress and argued approvals could accelerate if generic listing standards are finalized. The firm also tied ETF growth to broader capital markets activity. In the same outlook, Galaxy said it expects at least 15 crypto companies to pursue U.S. IPOs or uplistings in 2026, reinforcing the link between public markets and digital assets as crypto becomes further embedded in traditional finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 20:22:37

Binance BTC USD1 Pair Briefly Dropped as Traders Cited Thin Liquidity, Perera Says Shanaka Anslem Perera said a widely shared screenshot claiming Bitcoin fell to $24,000 on Christmas reflected a brief price wick on a single, illiquid Binance trading pair, not a broader market crash. In a post on X, Perera wrote that the BTC USD1 pair “wicked down” about 72% for roughly three seconds, while BTC USDT did not trade below $86,400. He said the move appeared limited to one order book and ended quickly as arbitrage activity closed the gap. Perera linked the volatility to a Binance promotion that he said offered 20% APY on USD1 deposits about 24 hours earlier. He said traders moved from USDT into USD1 to pursue the yield, which he claimed reduced sell side liquidity on the BTC USD1 market. Perera said a large market sell then hit a thin book, pushing the price down to the nearest bids, which he identified as $24,111, before prices normalized. Perera also said a similar spike occurred on Dec. 10, when BTC/USD1 briefly dropped from about $96,000 to $76,000. He argued that posts alleging “manipulation” did not provide on chain evidence, while posts calling it a “crash” drew major attention. Perera added that the episode highlights risks tied to newly listed stablecoin pairs, including liquidity gaps during promotional campaigns. He also said USD1 , the stablecoin used in the pair, is issued by Trump linked World Liberty Financial and has passed a $3 billion market cap.

This unprecedented transaction, reported by the blockchain monitoring service Whale Alert on March 21, 2025, represents one of the largest single-asset burns in decentralized finance (DeFi) history, fundamentally altering the tokenomics of one of the world’s leading crypto protocols. UNI Token Burn: Anatomy of a $592 Million Transaction The transaction originated from a wallet address directly associated with the Uniswap protocol treasury. Subsequently, blockchain explorers confirmed the destination as a verifiable burn address—a public wallet from which private keys are mathematically impossible to generate, ensuring permanent token removal. The 100 million UNI tokens constituted roughly 10% of the protocol’s total initial supply of 1 billion tokens. Consequently, this action immediately reduced the maximum potential circulating supply, creating a deflationary pressure mechanism that market analysts have been closely monitoring for years. Historically, token burns serve as a strategic tool within cryptocurrency ecosystems. For instance, Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a base fee burn mechanism, while Binance Coin (BNB) executes quarterly burns based on exchange profits. However, the sheer scale and one-time nature of this UNI transfer distinguish it from typical, scheduled burn events. The transaction required only standard network gas fees, demonstrating the efficiency of Ethereum’s underlying infrastructure for executing high-value, trustless operations. Decoding the Impact on Uniswap Tokenomics and Market Dynamics The immediate market reaction saw increased volatility in UNI’s trading price across major exchanges. More importantly, the burn triggers a fundamental recalculation of key token metrics. The reduction in total supply increases the scarcity of the remaining UNI tokens, potentially influencing their long-term valuation based on simple supply-and-demand economics. This event also directly affects the protocol’s governance structure, as the burned tokens can no longer be used to vote on future Uniswap Improvement Proposals (UIPs). Expert Analysis: Strategic Protocol Management Industry analysts point to several strategic rationales for such a significant burn. First, it can be a method of value accrual for existing token holders, akin to a stock buyback in traditional finance. Second, it may signal a maturation of the protocol’s treasury management, moving excess or unallocated tokens out of circulation. Third, it could be a proactive measure to align the token’s economic model with long-term sustainability goals, especially as the DeFi sector evolves beyond its initial growth phase. Notably, the action follows a broader trend of DeFi protocols optimizing their token supplies post the 2021-2023 market cycle. To understand the scale, consider this comparison of major historical token burns: Protocol/Asset Approximate Value Burned Year Nature of Burn Uniswap (UNI) $592 Million 2025 One-time treasury transfer Ethereum (ETH) ~$9 Billion (cumulative) 2021-2025 Continuous fee mechanism (EIP-1559) Binance Coin (BNB) ~$600 Million (largest single) 2021 Scheduled quarterly auto-burn Shiba Inu (SHIB) $~1.7 Billion (at time) 2021 Voluntary burn by Vitalik Buterin The mechanics of a burn are straightforward but final. Tokens are sent to an address like `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`. Crucially, this address has no known private key, meaning the assets are provably and permanently inaccessible. This transparency is a core feature of blockchain technology, allowing anyone to verify the event’s permanence. Broader Implications for the DeFi Ecosystem and Regulatory Landscape This event extends its influence beyond Uniswap’s immediate community. It sets a potential precedent for other large DeFi protocols with substantial treasuries, such as Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO. Market observers will now scrutinize their governance forums for similar proposals. Furthermore, the burn interacts with evolving regulatory frameworks. By reducing supply and potentially increasing token value, the action could attract different types of regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning securities law interpretations and market manipulation concerns, even though the transaction was fully transparent and on-chain. For UNI holders, the implications are multifaceted: Supply Shock: A permanent reduction in maximum supply increases the scarcity of each remaining token. Governance Shift: Voting power is now concentrated among the remaining circulating tokens. Value Accrual: The protocol’s value, measured by fees and usage, is distributed across a smaller token base. Market Perception: The move is widely interpreted as a confident, long-term commitment by the protocol’s stewards. Technologically, the event underscores the power and finality of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional finance, where actions can sometimes be reversed, this burn is immutable. It was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and will remain in its history forever, verifiable by any node on the network. This characteristic provides unparalleled certainty for all market participants. Conclusion The transfer of 100 million UNI tokens to a burn address marks a pivotal moment for Uniswap and the wider DeFi sector. This decisive UNI token burn, valued at nearly $600 million, demonstrates a sophisticated approach to protocol-owned liquidity and long-term tokenomics management. By permanently removing a significant portion of the supply, the action reinforces core principles of digital scarcity while providing a transparent case study in blockchain-based treasury management. As the DeFi landscape continues to mature, such calculated, large-scale economic decisions will likely play an increasingly critical role in defining sustainable value and governance for leading protocols. FAQs Q1: What does “burning” tokens mean in cryptocurrency? A1: Burning tokens refers to permanently removing them from circulation by sending them to a verifiable, inaccessible wallet address (a burn address). This reduces the total supply of the asset, making the remaining tokens scarcer. Q2: Why would Uniswap burn 100 million UNI tokens? A2: Potential reasons include: implementing a deflationary mechanism to increase token scarcity, managing the protocol treasury efficiently, accruing value to existing holders, and signaling long-term confidence in the protocol’s sustainable economics. Q3: Can the burned UNI tokens ever be recovered? A3: No. The tokens were sent to a cryptographically secure burn address for which no private key exists or can be generated. The removal is permanent and verifiable by anyone on the Ethereum blockchain. Q4: How does this burn affect the price of UNI? A4: While short-term price movements are volatile, the fundamental effect is deflationary. Reducing the total supply, all else being equal, increases the scarcity of each remaining token, which can create upward pressure on price based on supply and demand principles. Q5: Does this change how Uniswap governance works? A5: Yes. The burned tokens can no longer be used to vote on governance proposals. This concentrates the voting power among the remaining UNI token holders, potentially making governance more responsive to the active, circulating token base.

The law first came into effect in 1994, got updated in 2004, and was lightly amended in 2016 and 2022. But this year’s new rules follow the CPC Central Committee’s direction to “promote high-quality development” in China’s foreign trade. The Committee said:- “This is an important measure taken against the backdrop of profound changes in the global economic and trade landscape and the accelerated restructuring of international rules, and is of great significance for promoting high-level opening-up, maintaining foreign trade order, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign trade operators.” Law lays out legal structure, reform plans, and enforcement muscle The new law is made up of eleven chapters and eighty-three articles. The Committee said foreign trade must serve “national economic and social development” and push the goal of turning China into a “strong trading nation.” And yeah, it puts “national sovereignty, security and development interests” right up front. The law pushes reforms that will legally lock in newer trade models. According to the Committee: “Reform measures such as the negative list management system for cross-border service trade, support and promotion of the development of new forms and models of foreign trade, support and encouragement of the development of digital trade, and acceleration of the establishment of a green trade system have been elevated to legal systems.” A big chunk of the law is aimed at matching “high-standard international economic and trade rules.” Officials are now legally expected to align China’s rules with global standards, but only when it serves the country’s own plan. They’re also expected to help write new global rules, not just follow them. So if there’s a rulebook being passed around, China wants a pen. And if push comes to shove, the law gives China more tools to strike back. According to the Committee, it “improved corresponding countermeasures” and strengthened “legal responsibilities” tied to foreign trade fights. In short: China’s toolbox just got heavier. Beijing links law upgrade to struggling industries and falling profits All this comes as China’s industrial profits are tanking. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows profits fell by 13.1% in November compared to the same time last year. That’s after a 5.5% drop in October. For the first 11 months of 2025, profits are barely in the green, up just 0.1%, down from 1.9% earlier. Bloomberg Economics had expected worse, but a fall is still a fall. Companies are hurting from low demand at home and nasty industrial deflation . And yes, that’s happening even with a tariff truce with the US in place. Some sectors are holding on. Manufacturers posted a 5% rise in profits this year, mainly from tech-heavy industries like aerospace and electronics. Utilities are still growing. But miners are deep in the red, with double-digit losses. The back-to-back profit dips are bad news for future investment and hiring. But government officials haven’t pushed out new stimulus… yet. The growth target for the year is still around 5%, and they think they can hit it without pulling more levers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

At the same time, Tom Lee restated his bullish case that Ethereum could reach higher levels into 2026 as network usage grows. BitMine Stakes $219.2 Million in ETH, With Billions Still Unstaked BitMine staked about $219.2 million worth of Ether on Friday, according to on chain transfers shared by the X account @TedPillows. The transactions showed BitMine linked wallets sending large ETH amounts into staking deposit addresses within hours. On chain records listed several deposits in the same window, including transfers of roughly 16,992 ETH, 20,768 ETH, and 24,544 ETH. Together, the moves supported the claim that BitMine deployed about $219.2 million into Ethereum staking on the day. At the same time, BitMine still holds a much larger Ether position that remains unstaked. The post said the firm holds about $10.759 billion in Ethereum that it could stake later, which would far exceed the amount deposited so far. Ethereum staking locks ETH into the network in exchange for validator participation and rewards. As a result, large deposits often attract attention because they can shift a portion of supply out of liquid circulation while increasing long term exposure to the protocol. Tom Lee Keeps Bullish Ethereum Target for 2026 Meanwhile, Tom Lee reiterated a bullish view on crypto heading into 2026, saying Ethereum could rise from around $3,000 to $7,000 or $9,000 in early 2026, according to a clip circulated on X. Lee also said he still sees a path for Ethereum to reach $20,000 if the network becomes competitive with global payment rails. Lee tied the case to utility rather than trading momentum. In the clip, he pointed to scale, settlement, and real world usage as the main drivers, arguing that Ethereum could shift from a speculative asset toward financial infrastructure if it handles large transaction volumes reliably. He has made similar arguments in past market commentary, where he framed Ethereum’s long term upside around adoption and network effects. In that view, broader use by exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and tokenization platforms matters more than short term price action, because it increases demand for blockspace and settlement on the base layer and related networks. The latest comments came as crypto investors track whether Ethereum’s ecosystem can expand beyond trading and DeFi into payments and settlement for real businesses. That question often centers on fees, throughput, and user experience, since global payments require speed and predictable costs at scale.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 21:00:52

According to our technical indicators, ALGO is bearish, with the fear and greed index indicating an extreme fear sentiment among investors. The charts show that the price drop has slowed, and its volatility dropped as well. Why is Algorand down ALGO’s drop reflects technical triggers and macro headwinds outweighing incremental ecosystem progress. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will not break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains improbable for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment?

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history by CoinGecko Algorand conducted its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 per token. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. In 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January and $0.35 in February. It crossed into October, trading at $0.22. The coin later nosedived, and by December, it had dropped to $0.14.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 21:04:00

For holders of XRP, a critical structural pattern has recently resurfaced on weekly charts that could signal a pivotal moment in the token’s multi‑year cycle. Rather than mere price speculation, this pattern centers on how XRP behaves around its long‑term moving averages — a technical lens that many seasoned analysts consider essential for distinguishing between shallow corrections and deeper cycle lows. In a recent post on X by Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders, the significance of the 50‑week and 100‑week simple moving averages (SMAs) was brought to the forefront for XRP investors. Rietveld’s analysis suggests that how XRP interacts with these key moving averages — especially after prolonged periods below the 50‑week SMA — has historically preceded major shifts in trend direction and can offer insight into potential long‑term entry points for strategic holders. $XRP Holders YOU NEED To Know This! Comment “knowledge” and I’ll DM you access to my community! Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/3MwEx0MGWH — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 26, 2025 The Role of the 50‑Week SMA in XRP’s Market Cycles The 50‑week SMA is widely regarded among technical analysts as a structural divider between sustained bullish trends and extended bearish phases. Historical chart patterns indicate that when XRP trades below this moving average for an extended period (typically around 50–84 days) and then reclaims it on the weekly chart, strong upward momentum has often followed. In 2017, XRP spent roughly 70 days under this level before a notable rally, and in 2021, a shorter period below the SMA also preceded a significant rebound. The most dramatic precedent appeared in 2024, when around 84 days beneath the 50‑week SMA were followed by an approximate 850% surge into mid‑2025. This repeated configuration has led analysts to view extended stretches below the 50‑week SMA not only as periods of bearish pressure but also as potential setup phases for explosive rallies once that level is decisively reclaimed on the weekly timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Approaching the 100‑Week SMA: A Deeper Structural Indicator Beneath the 50‑week SMA lies the 100‑week SMA, another long‑term line that chartists interpret as a deeper measure of structural market floors. When price approaches this longer moving average, it often signals that the market is testing foundational support zones where significant investor capitulation can give way to renewed accumulation phases. Rietveld’s observation that XRP is nearing this level suggests a phase where long‑term buyers may begin positioning ahead of a potential cycle bottom, echoing patterns observed in previous bear markets. Taken together, these two moving averages frame a dynamic corridor in which XRP’s weekly price action unfolds. The interplay between them provides a roadmap of sorts: breaking below the 50‑week SMA typically denotes bearish compression, while proximity to the 100‑week SMA hints that structural lows may be in sight. Broader Market Context and What It Means for Holders It’s important to balance this moving average analysis with broader market indicators. XRP’s price has been under macro pressure along with the wider crypto market , and technical risks such as resistance at key price bands remain relevant. However, the historical consistency of the 50‑week SMA pattern offers a disciplined framework for interpreting price action beyond day‑to‑day volatility. For long‑term holders, understanding these structural benchmarks can be crucial. Rather than reacting to short‑term fluctuations, watching how XRP trades around these long‑term moving averages — particularly the 50‑week and 100‑week SMAs — may provide a more grounded perspective on when historic accumulation windows emerge and when potential trend shifts could unfold.

With the weekend likely to bring thinner liquidity, patience remains key as the focus shifts to waiting for a cleaner structure and a more reliable scalp opportunity to emerge. Tight Ranges Signal Indecision As Volatility Wanes Cryptowzrd went on to explain that Ethereum’s daily candle closed indecisively, mirroring the lack of clear direction seen across the broader market. ETHBTC also ended the session without conviction, reinforcing the idea that momentum remains muted for now. Related Reading: $6 Billion In Ethereum Options: What This Means For Price The uncertainty extended to the higher timeframes as well, with the weekly candle closing indecisively across most ETF and CME charts. This type of price behavior suggests hesitation among market participants, making it challenging to establish a strong directional bias in the near term. According to the update, healthier price action from ETHBTC will be required before Ethereum can develop a clearer trend. That process may take time, as the pair often leads Ethereum’s relative strength and overall structure. At the time of the post, Ethereum was trading close to the $2,800 support target zone. Holding this area maintains the broader structure, while a stronger bullish push in the future could open the door for a move toward the $3,700 resistance region. For now, the focus shifts to the lower time frame charts over the weekend, where short-term scalp opportunities may emerge. However, expectations remain measured given the indecisive conditions and typically lower liquidity during weekend sessions. Range-Bound Action Keeps Ethereum Traders On The Sidelines In a conclusive summary, the analyst observed that the intraday chart remains characterized by choppy and sluggish price action. The market is currently confined to a narrow range, lacking the decisive momentum required to establish a clear trend. This period of consolidation suggests a “wait-and-see” approach is necessary as the asset stabilizes between its immediate boundaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Specific price triggers have been identified to determine the next major move. A break below the $2,880 support level would likely signal a shift toward further bearish decline, whereas a move above the $3,060 resistance would open the door for sustained upside and new long opportunities. Ultimately, the analyst emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the current market environment requires a more mature chart structure before the next high-probability trade can be executed. Until the price breaks out of this intraday range and develops a more defined pattern, the strategy remains defensive to avoid the risks associated with the current volatility.

Critics argue that the banks lobbying to change the GENIUS Act are doing so in order to protect their profit margins from competition and not for safety like they claim. Why are banks trying to change the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is the result of several months of Congressional negotiation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation reached a compromise between banks and stablecoin issuers that prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders, but allows platforms and third-party services to offer rewards and yields. However, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and crypto advocate Max Avery, the banking lobby is now pushing to reopen these settled provisions. Avery posted on X that banks claim their lobbying efforts are due to “safety concerns” and worries about “community bank deposits,” but independent research shows no evidence that community banks are losing deposits at an unusual rate. The real issue is that traditional banks currently earn over 4% interest on customer deposits at the Federal Reserve while they pay customers approximately 0.01% interest on savings accounts. He went on to advise community members to be careful about amendments that would ban “rewards” instead of just directing interest payments from issuers, as that would effectively close the loophole that allows third-party platforms to share yields with stablecoin users. He also questioned whether legislators concerned about stablecoin yields have ever addressed why bank savings rates have remained stagnant for fifteen years despite significant changes in Federal Reserve rates. Why does Coinbase consider this a red line issue? Coinbase has declared that preventing any reopening of the GENIUS Act is a “red line issue” for the company. Coinbase joined other crypto companies in supporting a letter organized by the Blockchain Association, Stand With Crypto, and the North American Blockchain Association to show that the industry is against these lobbying efforts as a whole. Max Avery argues that if Congress allows the banking lobby to reopen and modify settled legislation, leading financial institutions can continuously chip away at frameworks designed to enable new competition. He pointed out that fintech companies considering entering U.S. markets are closely monitoring whether legislation “actually sticks” or can be repeatedly modified to protect current profit margins. Armstrong made a bold prediction that banks will eventually reverse their position and lobby for the ability to offer stablecoin yields once they recognize the market opportunity. He called the current banking lobby efforts “100% wasted effort” and “unethical.” “My prediction is the banks will actually flip and be lobbying FOR the ability to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in a few years, once they realize how big the opportunity is for them. So it’s 100% wasted effort on their part (in addition to being unethical). The innovator’s dilemma is undefeated.” He wrote . If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This New Crypto Could Surge 650%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-under-0-1-this-new-crypto-could-surge-650/,"Noise is not the way that some of the strongest crypto moves begin. They commence when infrastructure is almost exhausted and furnishment starts to die out. That is usually when more senior investors begin to listen attentively. According to market commentators, one of new DeFi crypto is currently entering that phase, where positioning is winning over publicity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): What It Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a DeFi crypto-centered on borrowing and lending. It aims at developing a protocol that humans use, not to trade. The platform will give users an opportunity to provide assets and receive yield as other users borrow against security. As an example, one may invest in ETH or USDT and become interested when borrowers get access to liquidity. Borrowers are forced to overcollateralize their positions and this assists the system in such price swings. Interest rates change depending on the degree of utilization of capital. Rates remain low when the liquidity is high. Liquidity becomes restricted and to stimulate repayments and new deposits, then the rates go up. The balance is meant to ensure efficient flow of capital. As per the documentation provided on the Mutuum Finance X account , the V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be released to the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Key characteristics are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator robot. The first available assets are ETH and USDT. Another big concern is security. Halborn Security is considering the lending and borrowing agreements of Mutuum Finance. Before any DeFi crypto goes live, it is significant to have a finalized code that is under formal analysis. Involvement and Price Advancement There have been significant inferences regarding Mutuum Finance. This project has garnered close to $19.45M in funds up to date and has created a community of approximately 18,650 holders. These statistics are important since they demonstrate pre-protocol activity. The first price of the token was $0.01 in early 2025. MUTM has since improved to be in the range of $0.035 which is a 250% appreciation. The move indicates increasing confidence because development milestones have been achieved. To most players in the market this kind of price movement indicates that perceptions are becoming premature. Buyers are positioning before activation instead of responding to a completed product. Such behaviour can frequently take place even before utility becomes live, rather than after. Supply Structure and Distribution Signals There are 4B fixed tokens in MUTM. Approximately 45.5% of that supply or about 1.82B tokens are to be allocated at early distribution stages. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. With tightening up, there is less supply to spare. In the past this is when the price sensitivity is high due to limited availability of the tokens at present levels. The site also has a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards the largest contributor to the protocol on a daily basis with MUTM at $500. The aspect will promote consistent attendance and not sharp peaks. It assists in smoothing out distribution and maintains the engagement. The other fact that is important is accessibility. MUTM is a card payment, which makes the entry of new players that are not so invested in crypto easier. This has the ability to get out to a wider audience than a usual DeFi user. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK token scan that has a score of 90 out of 100. This score shows good outcomes of various security checks. In the future, the Mutuum Finance will present an overcollateralized stablecoin. Stablecoins are essential to lending applications as it lessens volatility and aids predictable lending and inflation habits. This could boost daily usage and will render the protocol more appealing in times of uncertainty in the market. Why Timing is Attracting Urgency As Phase 6 is coming to an end, time has become one of the central issues being discussed by the onlookers. Purchases of whales have been reported as $100k in recent times meaning that there are bigger purchasers of whales who are positioning before the allocation closes. To minimize risk, whales usually wait until late and when the visibility is improving. Supply is tight. Infrastructure is soon to be launched. Security audits are underway. Mutuum Finance is mentioned in the discussion of the potential best crypto to buy now with developing use. At this stage, it is not the question, whether MUTM is early. It depends on whether retained supply would last till wider exposure comes.

This arrest comes after hackers reportedly bribed customer service representatives or contractors to gain access to customer information at the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. In May, Coinbase revealed that hackers bribed contractors or the company’s employees outside to steal sensitive user information. While the San Francisco-based crypto firm faced backlash for allegedly disclosing the data breach months after initial discovery, several employees of the US outsourcing firm TaskUs were laid off following the incident. Former Customer Service Agent Arrested In India On Friday, December 26, a Bloomberg report stated that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a former customer service agent had been arrested in India in connection with the data breach that occurred earlier in the year. The crypto exchange estimated at the time of the incident that this information leak could cost as much as $400 million. Earlier reports suggested that an India-based TaskUs employee was caught taking pictures of her work computer with her phone to sell it to hackers at the start of the year. The suspected employee and an accomplice were providing sensitive Coinbase customer data to malicious actors in return for bribes, Bitcoinist disclosed earlier. Armstrong said in a post on the social media platform X that the Hyderabad Police have picked up an ex-Coinbase customer service agent, with more arrests still to come. “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice,” the crypto CEO said. 2026, Start Of A New Coinbase Chapter? 2025 proved to be another challenging year for security across the global cryptocurrency industry, marked by several significant exploits and hacks that rocked the space. As Bitcoinist reported , over $3.4 billion worth of crypto assets were lost to hacks and exploits this year. However, this latest development would come as a positive step for Coinbase, which largely struggled with platform security in 2025. Earlier in February, an investigative report found that customers lost more than $65 million to social engineering exploits in just two months. Meanwhile, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man was indicted on 31 counts for allegedly operating a phishing scheme that defrauded about 100 Coinbase customers of approximately $16 million in cryptocurrency. Going into 2026, the cryptocurrency exchange would be hoping to offer a more secure platform for its users.",Coinbase|Brian Armstrong|coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency news|hacks,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 22:30:01

The regulator said the scheme operated from at least January 2024 to January 2025 and followed a familiar pattern seen in many modern online investment scams. Fake Crypto Platforms, Real Losses The SEC alleges that the defendants first attracted victims using advertisements on popular social media platforms, and promised easy profits and advanced, AI-generated investment advice. Interested users were then invited to join WhatsApp group chats, where scammers posed as experienced financial professionals and slowly built trust by sharing what they claimed were successful AI-powered trading tips. Once investors were convinced, they were encouraged to open accounts and deposit money on purported crypto trading platforms run by Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor. These platforms allegedly claimed to be properly licensed and regulated, including making false statements about government approval. The SEC says this was not true. The complaint further alleges that the investment clubs promoted fake “Security Token Offerings,” which they said were linked to real companies. In reality, no such companies or offerings existed, and no actual trading ever took place on the platforms. When investors later attempted to withdraw their funds, the defendants allegedly demanded additional upfront fees, a tactic often used to extract even more money from victims. According to the agency, all investor funds were ultimately misappropriated and funneled overseas through a complex network of bank accounts and crypto wallets. In a statement, Laura D’Allaird, chief of the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, said “Our complaint alleges a multi-step fraud that attracted victims with ads on social media, built victims’ trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals and promised profits from AI-generated investment tips, then convinced victims to put their money into fake crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated.” AI-Powered Fraud In addition to AI-generated investment advice, AI deepfakes have also increased significantly. Fraudsters are increasingly using artificial intelligence to produce realistic videos that appear to show well-known figures, such as X owner Elon Musk, endorsing bogus investment schemes on social media. Scammers are also exploiting AI to get around KYC checks, forge customer support conversations, and replicate platform dashboards to appear legitimate. In some cases, they have even abused Zoom meetings by sending fake invites that contain links to malicious software.

The Congress trades were executed within a narrow window in late November 2025, drawing scrutiny over timing and potential conflicts of interest. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal The disclosure shows McCormick purchased shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) in multiple transactions totaling up to $200,000. Two of the largest trades, each valued between $50,001 and $100,000, were executed on November 26 and November 28 but were not disclosed until December 26. Additional purchases included a $15,001 to $50,000 trade on November 25 and another $50,001 to $100,000 purchase on November 24, both filed on November 27. Performance data show mixed results, with the November 25 transaction posting a gain of approximately 2.29%, while the November 24 trade showed a loss of roughly 0.72%. Notably, scrutiny is heightened by McCormick’s role on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, which influences cryptocurrency regulation. To this end, Bitcoin ETFs are highly sensitive to regulatory signals, making such trades by policymakers contentious. McCormick’s other trades Meanwhile, the same December 26 filing also disclosed large municipal bond purchases earlier in the month, including up to $250,000 in Ohio State University general revenue bonds and up to $500,000 in Delaware County, Pennsylvania general obligation bonds on December 17, up to $250,000 in Pennsylvania state general obligation bonds on December 15, and up to $500,000 in Pennsylvania Turnpike municipal securities on December 10, all with coupon rates near 5%. Overall, the filings show a concentrated period of high-value investing across both volatile digital assets and conservative municipal debt, disclosed just after Christmas. Notably, there is no public evidence of any legal violation, and such trades are permitted under current law.

For months, both Bitcoin and major altcoins have struggled to regain their previous highs, while traditional markets have flourished. This difference in performance has sparked discussions about whether the old cycle rule still applies and what could come next for the broader market. Analyst Declares Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Dead A popular crypto analyst with over 227,000 followers on X, @theunipcs, has announced that the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. He stated that this market cycle is now unable to determine the behavior of BTC and many major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 2026 Overhaul Aims To Cut Costs, Boost Speed, Limit Censorship Traditionally, crypto’s four-year cycles have relied on the Bitcoin halving to reduce supply and trigger price surges. However, based on Unipcs’ analysis, these mechanisms no longer govern the market, especially as factors such as monetary policy, Spot ETFs, liquidity flows, macroeconomic factors, and dramatic liquidation events have significantly altered it. Unipcs emphasized that the market has been in a long phase of consolidation and accumulation, showing little of the explosive activity historically expected after halving events. He pointed out that the price of Bitcoin and leading altcoins have remained depressed for months, trading roughly 30% or more below their all-time highs. This decline stands in stark contrast to other major asset classes, which continue to climb. The analyst noted that Silver has been hitting record levels almost daily, while Gold continues to climb to new peaks. Additionally, major US stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, are hitting fresh highs, while crypto remains stagnant and underperforming. Notably, this extended period of weakness is highlighted by Bitcoin’s crash below $85,000 earlier this month after peaking above $126,000 during the first week of October. Many altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and others, have followed a similar trajectory, surging explosively before plunging to new lows. Technical indicators, such as the Fear & Greed Index, indicate that investor sentiment remains deeply negative, while analyst insights point to a bearish market structure. Overall, Unipcs’ analysis signals the possible end of the historically repetitive 4-year cycle, though he suggests it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase for crypto. What’s Next For BTC And The Crypto Market? Despite the prolonged slump, Unipcs believes that the ongoing accumulation trend could end soon, triggering an aggressive rally in the crypto market. He believes that once this happens, Bitcoin and major altcoins could surge explosively to new all-time highs once the dormant market transitions into a new bullish phase. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible While the timing of his optimistic outlook remains uncertain, the analyst is confident in the market’s potential for a decisive breakout and recovery.

The broader cryptocurrency space has also entered a period of weak momentum, with prices moving sideways after recent market declines. Despite this environment, some analysts argue that the current trend could be forming a base for the next major upward movement. One of such views was shared by market analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto), who referenced chart behavior he considers similar to the early stages of two previous XRP rallies. He suggested that the next major move could be significant, adding that many traders may underestimate the setup developing in the market. The most hated $XRP rally is about to start! pic.twitter.com/HTwbTIwxZ2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 16, 2025 Repeated Accumulation Behavior Identified Steph pointed to a recurring formation he classifies as an accumulation cycle. He compared the present structure to two previous periods in which XRP traded similarly before strong price increases. The first example covered early 2015 through early 2017 . During that stretch, XRP price action fluctuated within a narrow range, recording several pullbacks and extended consolidation. Toward the end of 2016, downward movement accelerated, and the asset declined to approximately $0.005 from about $0.00885. After that decline, XRP reversed its trend and later reached a peak of around $3.31 in January 2018. A second structure, according to Steph, developed between mid-2023 and late 2024. In that period, XRP again traded mostly sideways with intermittent drops. From August to November 2024, the token slipped from roughly $0.62 to $0.50 before demand returned. This preceded a surge that carried the price to about $3.4 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst Suggests Conditions Are Similar Again The chart shared by Steph shows that after XRP touched the $3.4 region early in 2025, the token entered what he describes as another accumulation band. The price has since declined gradually, intensifying from October 2025 when the asset fell from around $2.8 to its current level. Steph noted that both prior cycles were followed by major rallies, and he believes the same pattern may be unfolding. He warned that those exiting positions prematurely may be overlooking potential upside. Additional analysts also see room for a possible rebound. Chart Nerd recently stated that XRP may be undergoing an ABC corrective phase and pointed out that the $1.8 to $2 range now appears to be functioning as support instead of resistance. Based on this, he expects a positive shift in price action. In the wider community, commentators such as Zach Rector addressed investor frustration regarding the lack of a strong rally this year. Rector maintained that regulatory outcomes, including the resolution of the SEC case, progress toward XRP exchange-traded funds, and the proposed Clarity Act , could form the basis for growth in the coming year. While no outcome is guaranteed, historical accumulation patterns, renewed analyst optimism, and improving regulatory developments suggest that XRP may be entering a potentially decisive phase. Traders are watching closely to determine whether current market conditions will lead to another significant upward trend similar to previous cycles.

As a precaution, stakeholders have been advised to monitor updates closely. Once verified, the team is expected to provide further announcements that detail the cause and potential duration of disruptions to the Flow network. While the investigation is ongoing, speculation has continued. As of December 27, 2025, Flow (FLOW) is trading at $0.11, down from $0.17, some of the lowest levels the token has ever been.

Why did exchanges pause Flow token deposits and withdrawals? On Saturday, after the project flagged a potential security incident affecting its mainnet, crypto exchange Upbit issued a cautionary advisory for Flow (FLOW). According to Upbit, the situation is under review, and there is a possibility for the exchange to take protective measures, including warnings, trading restrictions, or ending support if necessary. Users holding FLOW are urged to be cautious.

A senior executive has now outlined conditions under which the company could reduce or potentially halt these sales. Ripple initially received an allocation of 80 billion XRP. To fund its operations, the company has periodically sold portions of these holdings on the open market. In 2017, Ripple implemented an escrow system that locked up 55 billion XRP and scheduled the release of 1 billion tokens per month. From these releases, a fraction was sold to support operational expenses. Over time, the escrow structure was adjusted, allowing up to 80% of the released tokens, approximately 800 million XRP, to be sold if necessary. These sales, however, have been a recurring concern for investors, with some arguing that steady liquidation pressures can negatively affect XRP’s market price. While these worries have eased in recent years, especially after analyses showed XRP largely tracks broader crypto market trends, periods of market weakness tend to reignite debates over Ripple’s role. I think this is fundamentally the wrong way to think about things, but even if you want to think this way, how is it better if Ripple feels more pressure to sell more XRP if the price drops? Wouldn't you think other sources of income reduce this pressure? — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) November 22, 2025 Reducing Dependence on XRP Sales Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently addressed how the company could lessen its reliance on XRP sales. During a community discussion, he emphasized that the key lies in establishing alternative revenue streams. By generating sufficient income from operations outside of XRP liquidations, Ripple would no longer need to sell tokens to fund its activities. Schwartz’s comments came in response to concerns that Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , could shift the company’s focus away from XRP. A community member suggested that because RLUSD is backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars, Ripple could rely on it for liquidity, thereby reducing its need to sell XRP, particularly if the token’s market price dropped sharply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz rejected the notion that RLUSD could replace XRP in Ripple’s operational strategy. Instead, he highlighted that developing new income sources, such as expanding payment services, licensing blockchain solutions, and supporting institutional adoption, would provide a more sustainable solution. This approach would naturally diminish the company’s reliance on selling XRP while maintaining its commitment to the token’s ecosystem. Investor Implications For XRP holders, Schwartz’s remarks signal a potential shift in the company’s strategy that could ease market pressures from ongoing token sales. If Ripple successfully diversifies revenue sources, the market may experience less volatility linked to routine XRP liquidation. Overall, while XRP sales remain part of Ripple’s operational framework, the executive insight underscores a pathway toward reduced dependence on these sales. By focusing on long-term business growth and alternative revenue models, Ripple could better balance operational funding with market stability, potentially benefiting both the company and XRP investors.

Years of regulatory uncertainty, legal scrutiny, and prolonged underperformance have tempered speculation and reshaped its investor base, leaving behind a market that appears more resilient than reactive. Why XRP No Longer Reacts To Every Negative Headline XRP is starting to trade like an asset that has already endured its hardest trials after years of regulatory overhang, which forced it to mature earlier than most digital assets. An ambassador at AstraAIofficial, Winny, revealed on X that the ETFs linked to the token are now live, providing traditional investors with regulated exposure without the operational friction of wallets or exchanges. At the same time, institutional inflows are rising, with managed assets tied to XRP surpassing $1 billion, a milestone that signals growing confidence. The supply on exchanges balances continues to thin, reinforcing the narrative. Long-term fund purchases don’t trade; they sit, which has changed the pressure dynamics, whether participants would admit to it or not. Most importantly, the regulatory clarity is finally improving, something that the altcoin has lacked for years. Winny concluded that this is about the altcoin graduating into a different market structure . Meanwhile, all this dynamic doesn’t mean the market will explode tomorrow, but it does mean the fundamentals are quietly shifting, and patience pays. Institutions Are Choosing The Altcoin For A Reason Crypto analyst Xfinancebull has explained why it will be too late if no one believes in XRP. The narrative was that ETFs were priced in, but the funds became the fastest altcoin ETF in history to hit $1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), with no outflows, no red days, and just steady institutional-sized capital moving in with conviction. The flow data shows that the funds have absorbed over $666 million in November, followed by another +$470 million in December, with no single outflow day. During the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw hundreds of millions in net outflows, while XRP quietly stacked over 30 consecutive green flow days. Currently, 686 million and 740 million XRP are locked, quietly reducing supply in real-time. However, the reason the altcoin is being chosen is that it solves what institutions actually need, which are complexity-ready settlement, on-chain liquidity, and global transaction speed. XRP’s price is currently down because the entire market is under pressure; that move is macro, not a failure. In Xfinancebull’s view, institutions are still accumulating the token with patience and intent. The markets often whisper before they move, but this time the data is screaming, and institutions are already stacked.",XRP|Altcoin|Assets Under Management|AstraAIofficial|AUM|bitcoin|Ethereum|ripple|Spot XRP ETFs|Winny|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 00:00:39

After the Trump-Melania memecoin drama, it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space.” None of my normie friends or family ask me anything about crypto anymore,” he added, highlighting the sentiment among retail traders following the price implosion of memecoins from the Trump family, which have declined by over 90% in value from their highs. The weak search volumes highlight subdued retail investor sentiment, as the crypto market continues to recover from October’s flash crash, one of the most severe single-day drops in its history. Crypto markets reel as fear lingers after October crash October’s market crash led to nearly $20 billion in leveraged liquidations and caused some altcoins to dip by as much as 99% in a single day. The crash also took BTC from a peak above $125,000 to a low of about $80,000 in November, with the price subsequently consolidating between $80,000 and $90,000 since then. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, an index that tracks sentiment about cryptocurrency, reached a yearly low of 10 in November, indicating “extreme fear” among investors, according to CoinMarketCap. According to reports, Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 is sharply divided as traders close the year. The coin was trading at $87,520 at the time of publication and is down 8% year-to-date since January 1. Market mood has been weak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached 20 on December 26, marking two weeks labeled as “extreme fear.” According to posts on X, Jan3 founder Samson Mow contends that 2025 marked the beginning of the bear market and that Bitcoin could be entering a bull run that lasts into 2035. The Fear and Greed indicator still reflects fear among investors, but also a slight improvement over the prevailing market sentiment over the last several months. Several prominent voices still expect sharp gains. Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered and Gautam Chhugani at Bernstein each forecast a price of $150,000 for Bitcoin in 2026. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, predicted a price of $250,000 by 2026 as supply and rising institutional demand are the primary drivers. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Just this one wild year. Both metals crushed everything else. Gold is up 4 times more than the S&P 500. Silver is up 8 times. This whole thing all started with the US Dollar falling apart, plunging down by 9% year-to-date in its worst yearly performance since 2017. Then came the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, which began in September, causing the dollar to lose more strength. And things got messier when President Donald Trump announced on December 12 that he simply wants “1% and maybe lower than that” from the Fed. China tightens silver exports as price hits $85 in Shanghai Silver is up 175% this year, running on an 8-month winning streak, something we haven’t seen since 1980. Just this month, silver prices are up 41%, heading for their best month since December 1979. The Shanghai price is now $85/oz, which is $5 higher than US spot prices and came right before president Xi Jinping’s new export rules kick in for 2026. These rules will force companies to get special government licenses before shipping silver out of the country. And now, everyone’s watching Shanghai as buyers rush in before the controls hit. In Q3 2025, the People’s Bank of China bought 118 tonnes, up 39% month-over-month and 55% compared to last year, though according to Goldman Sachs, China is “hiding” the real numbers. They officially said they bought +15 tonnes in September, but the actual number was closer to 10 times that. So far this year, China claims it’s bought 24 tonnes, but Goldman says the real total is probably closer to 240 tonnes. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down 6% in 2025. It was up 40% earlier this year, then tanked. Leverage killed it. The whole crypto market got wrecked and Cryptopolitan cannot tell you what 2026 might hold for the OG crypto.

As the market consolidates, these smaller assets could hint at early upside moves before BTC breaks out. Key Resistance In Focus: $90,588 And The Descending Trendline According to a recent update by Kamile Uray, there are no changes in the key levels being tracked on the daily chart, as the focus remains on the $90,588 level and the descending blue trendline. Unless BTC can close above these levels, the current decline may continue. Any upward moves below the blue descending trend are considered corrective rather than a trend reversal. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About The first support zone to monitor during the decline is between $83,822 and $82,477. A daily close below $82,477 would signal a continuation of the downtrend and could open the door toward the $74,496–$71,237 zone, marked by the blue box. This lower zone is viewed as a strong support area where buyers may step in. Thus, a clear reversal confirmation is key before considering any significant upward move. Once confirmed, a rally toward the blue descending trendline could follow, testing resistance levels along the way. For the uptrend to resume decisively, BTC would need to close above $90,588 and break the descending resistance. Meanwhile, a daily close above $94,130 would confirm that the blue descending trend has been broken, potentially signaling a shift to sustained bullish momentum. LTF Moves Show Less Impulse, But Structure Holds Crypto analyst The Penguin noted that the lower time frame (LTF) is showing slightly less impulsive action, though the overall count remains unchanged. The recent moves on the LTF appear more like noise and do not affect the broader wave count, and confidence in a leading diagonal for wave 1 remains intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Phase Begins: Weekly Support Holds, Momentum Fades Putting Elliott Wave analysis aside for a moment and leaning on standard technical analysis, BTC is clearly respecting a defined range. As a result, a minor deviation toward the 0.886 level marked on the chart is being closely watched as a potential entry point. Bullish confirmation will come if BTC manages to close and hold above $90,500, which would invalidate the current bearish scenario and signal the potential for a more sustained upward trend. Until then, the short-term fluctuations are considered normal noise, especially with the yearly open approaching. On the altcoin side, momentum appears to be holding, suggesting potential upside. Outperformance is already visible in altcoins like XPL, indicating that while BTC consolidates, some alts are starting to push higher.

Lummis made this statement after Waller released his new proposal to the public during the Payments Innovation Conference held in October of this year. According to reports, the Governor claimed that this suggestion would enable crypto and fintech startups, including banks that only conduct payment activities, to obtain accounts at the Federal Reserve, just like traditional banks’ “master accounts.” However, it was confirmed that this access would involve certain restrictions. Senator Lummis sparks hope for smooth operations in the crypto ecosystem soon Waller’s suggestion ignited heated discussions in the crypto ecosystem. To address this controversy, Senator Lummis issued a statement clarifying the proposal. In the statement, Lummis acknowledged that, “Governor Waller’s skinny master account idea ends Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and paves the way for real payment innovations. This means faster payments, lower costs, and better security — this is how we can responsibly create the future.” Earlier, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was perceived as a strategic approach aimed at hindering banking services, particularly for crypto firms and their founders. To support this claim, Marc Andreessen, a highly influential venture capitalist and staunch advocate for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, asserted that more than thirty tech founders were blocked from accessing banking services in the event of this operation. Meanwhile, reliable sources indicate that Waller’s new proposal marks a significant shift in how officials in the United States view digital assets and other emerging fintech startups. At this point, they perceive cryptocurrencies as essential aspects of the payment system and the future of finance. What still shocked the entire crypto community was the move to deny crypto firms access to banking services that took place even after US President Donald Trump issued an executive order in August instructing banks not to block services to Americans and businesses without a legitimate reason. The executive order further directed banking regulators based in the US, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to identify certain banks and financial institutions that had participated in debanking activities. To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, reports highlighted that the order illustrated the possibility of these institutions facing serious fines or other forms of penalties. Nonetheless, even with these efforts in place and Trump’s pro-crypto stance, sources close to the matter raised concerns that crypto executives, project creators, and Web3 firms are still subject to debanking issues. Analysts note an increasing debanking attempt impacting crypto firms Banks’ decision to block crypto companies from accessing banking services has become a growing concern in the crypto industry. This trend was noticed when crypto leaders began to report incidents of being victims of such attempts. An example is Jack Mallers, the CEO of the Bitcoin payment company Strike. Mallers claimed that JPMorgan , a massive and leading global financial services firm, decided to suspend its banking services in November without providing a valid reason for doing so. In a separate X post, the CEO highlighted that the sudden decision caught him by surprise, adding that, “Every time I asked them why, they replied the same way: ‘We aren’t allowed to tell you.’ In the meantime, apart from Mallers, recent reports mentioned that JPMorgan Chase had also blocked the accounts of BlindPay and Kontigo. These venture capital-financed stablecoin startups focus on global, specifically Latin American, payments infrastructure in December. Following this move, the largest bank in the US by assets alleged that it made this decision after discovering that these firms were connected to sanctioned areas as the justification.

The price rises first. Participation follows. Afterward, the attention comes at a later point. This trend is usually observed once the infrastructure is near maturity and risk begins to decline. One DeFi crypto is currently in that very window as per industry speculation in which early placement is underway prior to wider exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized financial protocol specializing in developing lending and borrowing. It is not constructed around the hype cycles but the organized usage. There are two central markets in the protocol. The former is a pooling based lending system, commonly referred to as P2C. In such a construction, users deposit assets such as ETH or USDT in common liquidity pools. They, in their turn, are provided with mtTokens. These mtTokens are their deposit that will increase in value, as their borrowers pay them interests. As one example, when a user deposits ETH, they can get a yield having a transferable token which keeps track of their position. The second market is peer-to-peer borrowing. In this case, customers will be able to borrow against their own collateral. The borrow rates will be determined by the type of asset and the risk profile. Less volatile assets can be used to fund higher Loan to Value ratios, and tokens which are more volatile need lower LTVs. In case of too low collateral values, the liquidation rules come into play to save the system. These two markets are working to reconcile flexibility and control of risk. This structure is important since lending of protocols can only scale in a case where there is trust between lenders and borrowers in the system. Mutuum Finance has raised approximately $19.45M so far and has got around 18,650 holders. The significance of these numbers is that it shows early implementation prior to the full establishment of the protocol. V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be launched in Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 with ETH and USDT being the initial assets, according to official statements posted on X. Growth and Increasing Demand MUTM is valued at currently $0.035 and it is at Phase 6. The maximum number of token supply is 4B. Approximately 1.82B tokens, which are about 45.5%of that supply, are to be distributed early. Approximately, 825M tokens were sold. Since the pricing of the token when the token was priced at $0.01 at the beginning of 2025, MUTM has gone up by 250%. This continuous growth indicates increased confidence with the achievement of development milestones. The participants of Phase 1 are positioned at approximately 500% MUTM appreciation in case the token is positively priced at its official launch at $0.06. The phases of price progression have been put in place. The next stage increases the cost progressively. The next Phase 7 will push the MUTM price to an approximate of 20% higher. This is important to early entrants since the price of entry has a direct and positive impact on long-term upside. With the tightening of the allocation, access becomes more difficult to supply at the existing level. Such a dynamic usually alters conduct. Buyers move faster. Greater allocations come up earlier. It is here that people think whale interest is taking shape. Risk Reduction and Security Stack Security is one of the reasons that some investors are now giving increased attention. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK token scanned where it has received a Test Score of 90 / 100. It means that there are good outcomes in various security examinations. Besides this, Halborn security is also doing an independent audit of the lending and borrowing agreements at Mutuum. It is a completed code that is in the process of formal analysis. To a DeFi crypto, this phase is paramount since it lowers the levels of uncertainty prior to the launch. Another aspect that was announced as part of the project was the $50k bug bounty initiative dedicated to the detection of vulnerabilities in code. Another protection level is brought by bug bounties which subject the system to external research to ensure it is stressed. Audits along with bounties facilitate the compression of risk. That is when long-term investors tend to get more comfortable to make increases in exposure. Why Urgency Is Building Now There are a number of indicators that there is an escalating urgency. Phase 6 is over 99% allocated. Recent whale distributions have been up to $100k. Such actions are frequently done in cases where the supply that is left is small but visibility is on the rise. Mutuum Finance is also sponsoring a 24 hour leaderboard that pays out the highest gross daily contributor with MUTM to the tune of $500. This keeps it active and promotes long-term participation as opposed to bursts of participation. The payment options can also be carried out using cards, which reduces friction to new entrants. For a project, the aspect of accessibility may be important when moving to the next stage of early adoption to more widespread recognition. The future of Q1 2026, according to numerous market pundits, is that Mutuum Finance is establishing itself in the market as a potential leading crypto as far as the DeFi crypto sector is concerned. There is almost prepared infrastructure. Information reviews are underway. Supply is tightening..

This transformation reflects a maturing venture landscape where investors prioritize sustainable business models over speculative growth, creating a distinct investment thesis for the world’s third most-funded startup market. India Startup Funding 2025: The Selective Capital Shift The total funding figure of $10.5 billion represents a modest 17% decline from 2024, but the real story emerges in deal-making patterns. According to Tracxn data, the number of funding rounds plummeted by 39% to 1,518 deals, indicating investors wrote far fewer checks while committing larger amounts to proven opportunities. This selective approach created a bifurcated market where capital flowed toward demonstrated success while experimental bets faced significant constraints. Seed-stage funding experienced the sharpest contraction, falling 30% to $1.1 billion as investors reduced exposure to unproven concepts. Similarly, late-stage funding cooled to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline, amid intensified scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved remarkably resilient, rising 7% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, signaling investor confidence in ventures that demonstrate clear product-market fit and revenue visibility. India Startup Funding Breakdown 2025 vs 2024 Stage 2025 Funding 2024 Funding Change Seed Stage $1.1B $1.57B -30% Early Stage $3.9B $3.64B +7% Late Stage $5.5B $7.43B -26% Total $10.5B $12.7B -17% AI Investment Contrast: India’s Pragmatic Approach Nowhere is the divergence from US investment patterns more evident than in artificial intelligence. Indian AI startups raised $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from the previous year. This capital distribution favored application-led businesses over capital-intensive model development, with early-stage AI funding reaching $273.3 million and late-stage rounds securing $260 million. This approach contrasts dramatically with the United States, where AI funding surged 141% to $121 billion across 765 rounds, overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals. “We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India generating $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame,” noted Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel. He emphasized that India lacks large foundational model companies and requires time to build research depth, talent pipelines, and patient capital for that competitive layer. Strategic Focus Areas Beyond Core AI Investors have redirected attention toward sectors where India possesses distinct competitive advantages. Venture capital increasingly flows into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors that face less global capital competition while leveraging India’s talent, cost structures, and customer access. Advanced manufacturing startups have increased nearly tenfold over four to five years, representing what Swaroop describes as a clear “right to win” for India. Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, observed that AI startups accounted for 30–40% of deals in India during 2025. However, he highlighted a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies catering to changing urban behaviors. Categories like quick commerce and household services play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley-style capital intensity, creating sustainable business models aligned with local market dynamics. Government Catalysis and Domestic Capital Strength The Indian government’s growing involvement has significantly influenced the startup ecosystem’s evolution in 2025. New Delhi announced a $1.15 billion Fund of Funds in January to expand capital access, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme targeting energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI. This governmental push catalyzed nearly $2 billion in commitments from US and Indian venture capital and private equity firms, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups. The initiative attracted Nvidia as an adviser and drew participation from Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the government co-led a $32 million funding round for quantum computing startup QpiAI, demonstrating unprecedented federal support for cutting-edge technology. Key government initiatives driving startup growth include: Fund of Funds: $1.15 billion to expand startup capital access RDI Scheme: ₹1 trillion ($12B) for research and innovation Deep-Tech Catalysis: $2B private capital mobilization Direct Investment: $32M in quantum computing startup QpiAI Exit Markets and Domestic Investor Maturation Reduced regulatory uncertainty has positively impacted exit markets, with 42 technology companies going public in 2025, representing a 17% increase from 2024. Domestic institutional and retail investors have driven much of the demand for these listings, easing longstanding concerns about excessive reliance on foreign capital for Indian startup exits. M&A activity also strengthened, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals. “This year has disproven that India’s public markets depend mainly on foreign capital,” stated Swaroop of Accel. He emphasized the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings, making exits more predictable while reducing reliance on volatile overseas flows. Women-Led Startups and Investor Concentration Funding for women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at approximately $1 billion in 2025, declining just 3% from the previous year. However, this headline figure masks a sharper pullback beneath the surface, with the number of funding rounds in women-founded startups falling by 40% and first-time funded counterparts declining by 36%. Overall investor participation narrowed significantly as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors participating in funding rounds—a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of this activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating, indicating local capital’s growing prominence as global investors turned cautious. Comparative Analysis: India vs United States Venture Landscapes Data from PitchBook reveals stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the US during 2025. US venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, compared with approximately $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period. However, this gap fails to capture fundamental differences in market dynamics and opportunity structures. Taneja cautioned against direct parallels between the two ecosystems, arguing that differences in population density, labor costs, and consumer behavior shape scalable business models. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found greater traction in India than in the US, reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors. Conclusion India’s startup funding landscape in 2025 reveals an ecosystem maturing through selective capital allocation rather than retreating from global competition. The $11 billion investment total, while slightly reduced from previous years, represents more deliberate deployment toward ventures demonstrating stronger fundamentals, clearer paths to profitability, and alignment with India’s unique market advantages. This evolution positions India not as a substitute for developed markets but as a complementary arena with distinct risk profiles, timelines, and opportunities shaped by domestic dynamics rather than global capital intensity trends. FAQs Q1: How much funding did Indian startups raise in 2025? Indian startups secured approximately $10.5 billion in funding during 2025, representing a 17% decline from 2024 but demonstrating increased selectivity in capital deployment.

Expert Explains What It Is Built For,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/what-does-xrp-really-do-expert-explains-what-it-is-built-for/,"Crypto analyst and XRP advocate Levi Rietveld recently shared a short post on X stating that “$XRP is built for this,” alongside a video clip of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaking about reviewing regulatory barriers around blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems like the crypto industry. Bessent’s comments focused on reforming financial infrastructure so capital markets can function more efficiently for mainstream users. In turn, Rietveld viewed those comments as closely matching the original purpose XRP was created to serve.

Bessent stated that officials will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems and consider reforms to unleash the power of American capital markets. Notably, this plan corresponds to a more crypto-positive approach adopted by the current US administration under President Donald Trump. $XRP Is Built For This! pic.twitter.com/WNDUoeFPC4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 22, 2025 These are a part of efforts by the US government to modernize crypto regulation and define clearer frameworks for digital assets, including proposed acts aimed at bringing clarity to markets and stablecoins. One example of this is the Clarity Act, a legislative proposal that aims to clearly define the regulatory treatment of digital assets, separate payment-focused tokens from securities, and assign clearer oversight roles to agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Bessent’s comments focused on improving payment systems and removing friction around new financial technology. XRP proponents like Levi Rietveld would quickly point out that the theme aligns closely with how the cryptocurrency and the XRP Ledger were engineered. The XRP Ledger works with transparent settlement, predictable transaction costs, and finality that does not depend on mining or complex smart contract execution. These characteristics are important for institutions that need clarity and reliability. In practice, XRP’s real-world role is most visible through payment solutions developed by Ripple. Banks and other financial institutions do not need to hold large balances of foreign currencies, since XRP can be used as an intermediate asset during settlement. XRP’s Current Regulatory And Institutional Position Progress on regulatory clarity has been helping real institutional infrastructure around XRP. Multiple Spot XRP ETFs have gained approval and launched in 2025 and early numbers are positive, with over $1.14 billion worth of inflows. Bloomberg estimates suggest these funds could draw $5 billion to $7 billion in institutional capital by 2026. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires?

Following his warning, Schiff expressed his belief that the cryptocurrency would face the reverse effect of silver’s surge. According to him, any adjustments could occur swiftly, as market downturns often accelerate under stress. This statement came after the prices of silver increased significantly in one day, boosting the metal to a record level above $79 per ounce, marking the first time in history. Silver’s surge prompts Schiff to issue a warning regarding Bitcoin Concerning Schiff’s warning, reliable sources reveal that the prominent financial expert shared an X post offering his insights at a time when investors witnessed silver rise by more than 10% in a short period. To clearly explain the situation, market data indicate that this rally pushed silver from a level of $78 to approximately $79 in about ninety minutes. The increase drew the attention of several individuals globally, as the metal had been demonstrating a steady rise for several months. Moreover, a TradingView chart showed a sharp breakout as the price surged to a new historical peak. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that silver’s surge had also played a crucial role in the metal ecosystem by improving the overall market sentiment towards metal assets. Interestingly, the substantial performance of tokenized commodities supported by cryptocurrency illustrates this trend, as reports pointed out that their total value nears $4 billion. This finding indicates that several investors prefer alternative assets. On the other hand, data from CompaniesMarketCap revealed Silver’s recent efforts to narrow the gap with NVIDIA in overall market value. This move has prompted analysts to suggest an increased likelihood of heightened demand from institutions and growing interest in commodities among investors. In the case of Bitcoin, sources reported that the cryptocurrency’s price remained close to $87,000, showing slight movement over the last 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap also revealed that major cryptocurrencies encountered minimal daily gains. The fate of silver and Bitcoin sparks debates in the industry The surge in Silver’s price has initiated heated discussions in the ecosystem as recently released updates intensify these debates. For example, a new chart from Ted Pillows noted that the metal’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) reached a new all-time high in forty-five years. As this reading showed a bullish trend, analysts commented that the big question raised in the industry is the duration of the trend. Another conclusion drawn from this reading was the dramatic progression of the current silver price breakout. In comparing the progress of Bitcoin to silver over many years, another chart highlighted that the cryptocurrency has substantially lost its relative gains that date back to eight years ago. Such a shift prompts individuals to believe that silver has surpassed BTC in the recent market rally. In the meantime, with silver priced at roughly $80, a model that compares silver to BTC estimates that the cryptocurrency’s value should be approximately $394,000. With this estimation in mind, traders raised concerns about whether the digital asset could catch up with silver, should market conditions change. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Some are steady, foundational, and reliable, like Ethereum, powering decentralized finance with strong security and a deep smart contract ecosystem. Others, like Cronos, focus on speed and accessibility, supporting efficient transactions and cross-chain connectivity. Then there’s APEMARS ($APRZ), a mission that doesn’t just move; it builds momentum. With the whitelist now live, APEMARS is opening the doors to early access ahead of its crypto presale, inviting supporters to align with the project before Stage 1 begins. Rather than positioning itself as a conventional token, APEMARS frames participation as a narrative-driven expedition where community energy helps shape each milestone of a 23-stage journey. For anyone tracking crypto presales , this is a chance to get in early on a project designed around structure, engagement, and engineered scarcity. Among the best presale crypto projects to watch in 2026, APEMARS stands out by combining a clear mission concept with a staged rollout that rewards early attention, setting the foundation for what could become the next major narrative-led launch. Stage 1 Launch: Board the APEMARS Mission and Multiply Your Rewards Momentum is everything, and APEMARS is building it well before launch. With the whitelist now live and Stage 1 approaching, the project is positioning itself ahead of most upcoming crypto presales by anchoring participation to a clear, milestone-driven mission. This isn’t passive interest; it’s early alignment with a journey where each stage matters and every token represents a deeper role in an unfolding narrative. Central to this structure is the Thermal Disposal Protocol, a precision-based scarcity mechanism built into the presale design. At Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23, any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. These scheduled burns progressively tighten supply, reinforce long-term value dynamics, and maintain momentum throughout the mission. It’s a deliberate system that reflects the planning seen in only the most strategically designed crypto presale projects. Complementing this is the APE Yield Station, which converts long-term commitment into measurable rewards. Offering a 63% APY, inspired by Mars’ average temperature of –63°C, the staking model allows early participants to position themselves from the outset. While rewards activate two months after listing to support supply stability, the structure is designed to compound over time, favoring those who align early and remain committed. No complex tracking, no additional actions, just a streamlined reward system built for participants who join the mission before liftoff. Pocket Change to $16K: The 32,000% ROI Trade Nobody Wants You to See Here’s what most people don’t realize: $50 at Stage 1 priced at just $0.00001699 per token locks in approximately 2,943,240 APEMARS. That’s less than your weekend takeout. Less than a tank of gas. Yet when this rocket lists at $0.0055, that throwaway fifty transforms into $16,187. A 32,269% ROI that makes early Bitcoin look tame. Let that number burn into your brain: sixteen thousand dollars from pocket change. Now scale that mental math. If $50 delivers five figures, what does $500 unlock? What about $5,000 when you catch Stage 1 at peak discount? This isn’t hype, it’s the kind of upcoming top crypto presale opportunity designed for strategic participants. Structured, deflationary economics with burn mechanisms and staking multipliers are baked into the mission. Every stage climbs. Every burn tightens the supply. Every minute you wait, someone else is stacking the position you’re debating. This upcoming presale offers a unique loop of value: scarcity from scheduled burns drives demand, while staking multiplies potential gains for those bold enough to join early. Stage 1 is coming soon, milestones are on schedule, and every token you hold places you at the heart of a community-powered journey toward a symbolic Mars landing. Missing the launch isn’t just a delay; it’s missing the opportunity to board before lift-off and witness one of the next big crypto opportunities in action. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the APEMARS whitelist is a simple step that positions you early ahead of the upcoming crypto presale. Interested participants can visit the official APEMARS website and submit their email address through the whitelist form. Once submitted, a confirmation email is sent to acknowledge successful registration. With the whitelist now live, this early step allows participants to stay informed, receive official updates, and be ready as Presale Stage 1 approaches, securing awareness of the lowest entry point before the mission begins. Ethereum: The Pillar of Decentralized Finance Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Its ERC-20 standard ensures security, scalability, and integration with thousands of dApps. Recent market movements show continued adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure, reaffirming Ethereum as a long-term powerhouse. Utility is its strength: Ethereum powers decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and smart contracts with battle-tested reliability. Its upgrade paths continue to enhance transaction speed and reduce gas fees, making it a practical option for both developers and participants. While crypto presales offer explosive early-stage potential, Ethereum’s stability and ecosystem dominance make it a foundational asset for any serious crypto portfolio. Cronos: Speed and Interoperability Across Chains Cronos excels in cross-chain operations, bridging assets between Ethereum, Cosmos, and Binance ecosystems. Fast confirmations and low fees make it ideal for users seeking quick, cost-efficient transactions. Its growing adoption in DeFi and NFT projects highlights the chain’s versatility and strong ecosystem support. Beyond speed, Cronos offers staking, native DEX support, and a focus on scalability, showing how mature networks balance utility and growth. In a market that moves quickly, observing such established chains reinforces a key insight: early participation in emerging projects can provide unique entry advantages. Low-entry presales, for instance, capture momentum before broader market recognition, a strategy that complements established holdings like Cronos. For investors looking to diversify, combining stable, high-performance networks with selective early-stage presales can position them to benefit from both reliability and rapid upside potential. Conclusion: Why APEMARS Stands Out Across Ethereum, Cronos, and APEMARS, the market presents diverse opportunities. Ethereum offers stability, Cronos offers speed, but APEMARS compresses narrative, scarcity, and explosive potential into a single, story-driven upcoming crypto presale. For those seeking crypto presales with symbolic design, structured growth, and immersive storytelling, APEMARS could be the next crypto to explode in 2026. Early-stage participation doesn’t merely position you in a market; it places you in a community-powered journey with mathematically reinforced opportunity. Whitelist 1 is live, the capsule is primed, and the countdown to Mars has begun. Join the mission, stake your position, and be part of the next big crypto phenomenon before the rocket leaves the pad.

Among upcoming crypto presales, the Stage 1 APEMARS launch stands out for momentum, scarcity, and community-driven rewards, making it a top choice for early participants. Which crypto has 1000x potential? The next big crypto often comes from structured presales with deflationary mechanics. APEMARS whitelist demonstrates exactly that potential. What is the biggest crypto presale in history? Past presales like Ethereum set records, but today’s best crypto projects like APEMARS combine narrative, staged scarcity, and staking rewards, offering a new benchmark in opportunity. Is it good to buy crypto in presale? Participating in crypto presales allows early access to tokenomics, staking rewards, and deflationary mechanics, creating a chance for exponential growth. Summary For investors exploring upcoming crypto presales and top altcoin picks, projects like APEMARS, Ethereum, and Cronos each offer distinct opportunities. Ethereum provides long-term stability and proven utility in DeFi and smart contracts, Cronos delivers fast, low-cost transactions with cross-chain interoperability, and APEMARS combines narrative-driven engagement, staged token burns, and 63% APY staking to create momentum and early participation advantages. By balancing established networks with innovative presale projects, investors can strategically position themselves for growth while participating in both reliable ecosystems and high-potential missions shaping the next big crypto landscape.

On-chain data from TradeFi.Network shows that total RWAs tokenized on the XDC Network have reached $717 million . More striking, however, is where that capital is concentrated: $345.3 million , roughly 48% of the network’s RWA , is now deployed through VERT Capital in USDC-denominated private credit pools. The data points to something more deliberate: institutional private credit moving on-chain at scale and selectively . (Source: TradeFi Network ) What the Data Signals Three signals emerge clearly from the numbers: Capital is consolidating, not diversifying. Nearly half of all RWAs on XDC are managed by a single private-credit allocator, suggesting conviction rather than experimentation. Private credit has overtaken other RWA categories. Unlike tokenized treasuries or commodities, these pools represent long-duration, yield-bearing credit instruments, traditionally among the least transparent corners of finance. Settlement risk is being minimized. The exclusive use of USDC indicates institutional preference for regulated, fiat-backed settlement over volatile crypto assets. Why XDC, and Why Now? Private credit markets exceed $1.6 trillion globally and are expected to reach $3 trillion, according to Moody’s analysis , yet much of the infrastructure remains manual and opaque. Tokenization does not change credit risk, but it radically changes settlement speed, reporting, and operational efficiency . (source: Moody ) The XDC Network has quietly positioned itself around those exact requirements: low transaction costs, predictable finality, and permission-aware infrastructure tailored for financial institutions. The result, according to TradeFi data , is not a surge of small issuers, but fewer, larger pools deploying meaningful capital . One of the largest concentrations of tokenized private credit has formed without marketing campaigns or retail incentives. If this pattern continues, the next phase of RWA adoption may be defined less by pilots and more by which blockchains quietly become settlement layers for institutional balance sheets .",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|MINING|XDC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-28 03:47:31

Trading followed a “low start, high finish” pattern, amidst tight macro liquidity early in the year and stronger risk appetite later on. CoinGlass said that the global derivatives market has “solidified into a stratified oligopolistic landscape.” Crypto Derivatives Trading in 2025 According to CoinGlass’ 2025 Crypto Derivatives Market Annual Report, derivatives continued to serve as the main venue for price discovery and risk management, and peak activity was recorded on October 10, when single-day volume surged to around $748 billion. Market share remained highly concentrated. Binance led by a wide margin, accounting for over 29% of global derivatives volume, or $25.09 trillion for the year. OKX, Bybit, and Bitget followed suit, and together with Binance controlled more than 62% of total volume. A sharp drop-off appeared beyond the top tier, as long-tail exchanges held marginal shares and weaker liquidity. Open Interest (OI) also showed extreme swings. After heavy deleveraging in Q1 pushed OI to a low of $87 billion, leverage rebuilt rapidly and peaked at a record $235.9 billion in early October before a sudden $70 billion wipeout in Q4. Despite this, CoinGlass found that year-end OI still rose 17% from the start of the year. Binance again led in leverage concentration, as it held about 28% of daily average OI, while the top five exchanges controlled more than 80% overall. Liquidity, Custody, and Risk Liquidity depth data further validated this dominance. Binance’s BTC order book depth far exceeded all peers, and OKX ranked a distant but clear second, especially for institutional-sized trades. User asset custody was found to be even more concentrated. Binance held over 72% of custodial assets, with an HHI score of 5,352, which indicated extreme oligopoly. OKX ranked second, while the remaining platforms shared a much smaller pool. Liquidations were nearly $150 billion in 2025, mostly routine, but systemic stress was concentrated in the October 10-11 event, when combined liquidations surpassed $19 billion in a single day following a major macro shock tied to new US tariffs on China. High leverage, crowded long positions, and strained liquidation and ADL mechanisms amplified volatility, especially in altcoins. While BTC and ETH suffered moderate drawdowns, many smaller assets collapsed.

The maiden cryptocurrency is presently consolidating within the $87,000, while investors patiently anticipate a clear market direction. According to pseudonymous analyst Sunny Mom, recent on-chain analysis suggests that bearish sentiment will remain dominant in the coming months following the initial extended correction in October and November. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Dead: Crypto Trader Explains What Happens Next Why Rising Short-Term Bitcoin Supply Is Flashing A Rare Bearish Signal In a QuickTake post on December 27, Sunny Mom draws attention to the BTC HODL waves, which show the rising share of short-term holders coinciding with falling prices, flipping a metric that typically supports bullish narratives. Historically, an increase in short-term holder (STH) supply, coins held for less than 155 days, suggests fresh capital is entering the market ahead of sustained rallies. However, the analyst described the current move as “passive bag-holding” rather than signaling “new blood.” This is because investors who bought during the $120,000 rally in October, driven by FOMO, alongside dip buyers in November, now sit on unrealized losses, thereby creating a price setup that alters market behavior. Sunny Mom explains that each relief rally is met with selling pressure as these holders attempt to exit at breakeven, effectively turning the expanding STH cohort into a ceiling rather than a floor. Therefore, price rebounds struggle to gain traction. The renowned analyst explains that the market is witnessing an emotional toll that is growing visibly on-chain. Notably, there have been repeated spikes in Net Realized Loss (NRL) since October liquidations, suggesting that capitulation is underway, with investors locking in losses after months of endurance. Sunny Mom describes the process as a “dull knife” finally cutting deep, an indication that weaker hands are being forced out, not through a single crash, but through prolonged exhaustion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Face Prolonged Pain As Key Metric Stays Red Bitcoin In Demand Vacuum As Likely Fall Below $80,000 Remains Active In further analysis, Mom attributes the current bearish setup to a demand vacuum. The market expert explains that exchange reserves are sitting near multi-year lows, signaling limited immediate sell-side liquidity. At the same time, long-term holders (LTHs) show little interest in distributing coins, reinforcing the view that conviction capital remains intact. Therefore, the problem lies on the demand side. With macro uncertainty still elevated, new buyers appear hesitant to step in, creating a demand vacuum. This also creates thin order books, meaning even modest sell pressure can push prices sharply lower. While some market watchers target a potential recovery in Q1 2026, citing expectations of rate cuts and improved global liquidity. Mom predicts Bitcoin may need a “final shakeout” to resolve the imbalance and reset the market for a bullish breakout. The analyst points to a potential move below $80,000 as a liquidity hunt that could flush remaining weak hands and allow larger holders to reaccumulate.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $640.49. In 2031, AAVE will range between $864.66 to $1,040.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $155.33 Market cap $2.361B Trading volume (24-h) $253.91M Circulating supply 15.19M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $154.69 24-hour high $157.10 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.57% (High) 50-day SMA $184.47 14-Day RSI 40.07 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $229.63 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways : AAVE is trading below the key daily resistance, maintaining a bearish trend. A break above $160 is required for upside continuation. A price drop below $152 risks further downside. Aave 1-day price chart As of December 28, AAVE is trading around $155 after a steep breakdown from the $180–$190 zone, confirming a short-term bearish trend structure. The price remains below the mid-Bollinger Band near $175, which now acts as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the lower band, around $137, marks the next downside risk if selling resumes. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering near 40, signaling weak momentum with no clear bullish divergence yet, and MACD remains deeply negative despite early histogram compression, suggesting bearish momentum is slowing but not reversing. The daily structure implies consolidation or a weak bounce is possible, but failure to reclaim $165–$170 keeps the broader bias pressured. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, AAVE is consolidating between $153 and $157 after a corrective bounce, aligning closely with clustered moving averages around $155–$156. This compression shows indecision rather than strength, with Balance of Power staying negative and volume flow flattening, indicating buyers lack conviction. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The recent lower high near $158 reinforces short-term resistance, while a loss of $152 would likely reopen the path toward $148 and potentially $145. Only a clean reclaim and hold above $160 would flip the intraday structure back in favor of bulls. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $211.46 SELL SMA 5 $186.11 SELL SMA 10 $184.89 SELL SMA 21 $184.85 SELL SMA 50 $184.47 SELL SMA 100 $214.86 SELL SMA 200 $229.63 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $176.46 SELL EMA 5 $186.70 SELL EMA 10 $212.48 SELL EMA 21 $246.85 SELL EMA 50 $271.74 SELL EMA 100 $270.87 SELL EMA 200 $254.72 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is transitioning from an impulsive downside to a consolidation phase, but without a decisive reclaim of $160–$170, any upside looks corrective rather than trend-changing. The market is watching for either a volatility squeeze breakout or a continuation breakdown toward lower daily support. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve.

According to him, this move has consequently yielded considerable wealth for the United States. Nonetheless, market indicators revealed that investors expressed their belief that there will be no reduction in the Federal Reserve’s interest rates in the near future. This message was initially posted on Trump’s Truth Social , where he related tariffs to improved national security and economic prosperity. The president also noted that the trade deficit in the US markets has drastically declined and that the country’s economy is expanding without encountering inflationary pressures. Trump praises his decision on tariffs as a significant milestone for the US Trump referred to tariffs as a game-changer for the US economy . He claimed that tariffs had led to the nation’s dramatic economic growth, the creation of general economic confidence, and the restoration of the nation’s international respectability. He made this statement at a moment when economic futures heavily influence the outlook of financial markets. Another reliable source highlighted that the US government plans on adjusting some of Trump’s tariff frameworks. However, even with this situation in place, sources claim that the overall market sentiment appears to take a different approach to the matter. This finding was noted after Polymarket forecasts centered on a decision made by the Federal Reserve in January showed just a 14% likelihood of an interest rate cut occurring. These results suggested an 85% chance among traders that interest rates will be maintained steady at the next meeting. These very low odds of a significant interest rate reduction led analysts to conclude that the situation demonstrates more caution than optimism. In the meantime, as Trump views trade and production as a great milestone for the country, investors have raised concerns about inflation and growing uncertainties surrounding the economy. Following this report, sources mentioned that investors responded similarly earlier when the cryptocurrency market surged after Trump announced the implementation of a $2,000 dividend tax on eligible American citizens. After considering several factors related to the current US market, analysts conducted research. They discovered that market expectations suggest that borrowing costs are likely to stay high in the long run. Some of the factors said to have set off this risk are rising tensions over cost stability and the fact that global economic growth has been sluggish Meanwhile, it is worth bearing in mind the contradictory part noted between what the US president believes in and the overall market sentiment. At this point, sources confirm that Trump’s remarks focus on policies and the economic rebound. At the same time, market trends suggest that policymakers and traders consider simpler financial conditions to be essential. The White House adopts backup plans in case the judge’s ruling does not favour them Several economists contributed to heated discussions over the fate of the Fed rate cut. They alleged that the prospect of interest rate cuts showed growing investor confidence in the economy. They also pointed out that if, by any chance, the likelihood of rate cuts declines, then the situation will indicate that inflation is being controlled. Nonetheless, it was also discovered that the situation might raise tensions among individuals regarding economic stability. Currently, most of the feedback gathered focuses more on pessimism than optimism. Meanwhile, a recent report claimed that the White House has started adopting several backup plans just in case the Supreme Court prohibits the Trump administration’s authority over tariffs. Agencies, on the other hand, reported that they were thoroughly investigating other available legal choices for assuming responsibilities. Polymarket traders participated in discussions regarding the Trump administration’s authority over tariffs. They drastically reduced the odds of a tariff victory after justices asked how far executive powers go in the matter, leading to a major change in the prices of cryptocurrency. At this point, Bitcoin experienced a surge because of new uncertainty.

According to Arkham, various Bitmine-linked wallets paid a large amount of Ether into a contract known as “BatchDeposit” on Sunday, approximately 74,880 ETH. Before this, though, the company had never staked its holdings, despite owning one of the largest ETH treasuries in the market. It recently reached a 4 million token count, having purchased close to 100,000 ETH in the past week at an average cost of $2,991 per token, bringing its holdings back into profit as ETH moved above $3,000 over the weekend. Bitmine intends to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply On-chain analyst EmberCN commented on Bitmine’s staking, saying, “The largest Ethereum treasury company BitMNR (BMNR) has finally started attempting to stake its held ETH to earn interest income. This is their first time staking, and they now hold 4.066 million ETH, with an approximate APY of 3.12%. If all of it were staked, they could earn about 126,800 ETH in interest over a year, which at the current price of $2,927 would be worth $371 million.” Since June, the firm has been performing exceptionally well, with shares surging 606%, as investors back the company’s concentrated exposure to Ethereum’s long-term value. The firm’s chairman, Tom Lee, affirmed their success, noting that the firm is consistently increasing its Ethereum exposure, reaching 4 million tokens just five and a half months after rolling out the plan. The company still plans to hold 5% of all Ether in circulation. Currently, it holds about 3.37% of Ethereum’s total supply. Even in November, the company announced that it would start Ether staking in Q1 2026 on its own Made-in-America Validator Network, beginning with an initial pilot effort involving three institutional staking partners. Under the program, the goal would be to create more customer-generated investment value through staking, all in concert with the company’s fundamental accumulation plan. Tom Lee estimates that Ethereum will reach $7,000 by early 2026 As year-end trading slows, ETH has remained between $2,900 and $3,000. Nonetheless, Lee is hopeful that by early 2026, Ethereum could reach $7,000–$9,000 through tokenization. Ethereum now has a market capitalization of $354 billion and is valued at $2,928, down approximately 1% over the previous 24 hours. Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of Sharplink Gaming , also expects Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) to grow tenfold by 2026 as institutions become more committed and new on-chain applications enter the market. Stablecoins are also fueling growth , he said, and he anticipated the market could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a 62% bump. With over half of stablecoin transactions hosted on Ethereum, constant issuance and activity could significantly drive its TVL higher. He also predicts that the stakes of sovereign wealth funds will rise five to ten times as tokenization expands, while Ethereum remains at the center (or basis) of blockchain development. He also noted that RWAs could surpass $300 billion by 2026, reflecting the increased participation of large financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock . He added, “Ethereum’s stronghold on stablecoins, RWAs, and the future of tokenized equities make it a core technology asset. It’s not only a bet on the future, it’s a hedge against globalization and technological shifts happening, and ensuring their principals stay involved in the economic upside.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-moonshot-incoming-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator Crypto Captain (@UniverseTwenty) recently posted a short but notable statement on X. He stated, “XRP Moonshot Incoming,” capturing the bullish sentiment surrounding the asset. While XRP has experienced months of sideways trading, several factors could push it higher in late 2025 and 2026. ETF Inflows Drive Demand Spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. have gained traction in late 2025. Multiple ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in inflows since their launch, with more than a month of consecutive net inflows . Institutional investors now have regulated access to XRP. These inflows provide steady demand and strengthen price support. These products also boast over $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). Analysts note that continued ETF purchases could maintain upward pressure on XRP, and the positive inflow data reinforces that belief. #XRP Moonshot Incoming pic.twitter.com/UObP7lzglD — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 25, 2025 Ripple’s Acquisitions and Partnerships Ripple has expanded its ecosystem through acquisitions and partnerships in 2025. The launch of Ripple Prime and prime brokerage services is a major one. However, the company has made quiet moves to give XRP a foothold in global finance and increase institutional access. Partnerships across Asia and Latin America enhance XRP’s use in cross-border payments. This growth adds practical utility to the token beyond trading. Integration into financial networks may encourage adoption and long-term holding. Regulatory Clarity Reduces Risk The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the SEC also ended in 2025 . After years of price suppression, XRP finally gained its full legal clarity in the U.S. This development removed uncertainty for many institutional investors and enabled spot ETF approvals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reduced regulatory risk attracts institutional capital. This gives the market more confidence to participate. With clearer rules, investors can enter the XRP market with less concern over sudden legal obstacles. What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s outlook in late 2025 and 2026 rests on multiple converging factors. ETF inflows provide access and liquidity for institutional investors. Ripple’s strategic acquisitions and partnerships add utility and adoption. Legal clarity reduces risk. Prolonged consolidation and reduced supply on exchanges have also created a foundation for a possible price surge. Whale accumulation and positive sentiment could further support upward movement. Investors are watching how these elements interact. With ETFs fueling demand, Ripple’s network expanding, and regulatory hurdles cleared, XRP could see renewed strength.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-daily-chart-looks-ready-for-massive-breakout-heres-why/,"XRP is trading at a critical technical level after months of controlled downside movement on the daily chart. Crypto analyst Crypto Captain (@UniverseTwenty) shared a chart highlighting a prolonged descending channel that has guided its price action and is now nearing a potential breakout point. XRP has spent the second half of the year trading lower in a structured decline. Sellers maintained control, and the downtrend remained steady. That behavior kept XRP compressed as volatility continued to fade. This compression now places the market near an inflection point. #XRP Daily Chart Looks Ready For Massive Breakout pic.twitter.com/TiKkU7IB2L — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 25, 2025 Descending Channel Nears Resolution The daily chart shows XRP trading inside a downward-sloping channel since its peak in July . Each rally stalled at descending resistance, and each pullback held above the lower trendline. This pattern produced a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a sustained corrective phase rather than a collapse. In recent weeks, XRP rebounded from support near $1.75. Buyers stepped in aggressively at that level. The price then pushed higher toward the resistance near $1.9. The distance between support and resistance has narrowed, signaling growing pressure, and markets rarely stay compressed for long. Crypto Captain described the setup as looking ready for a massive breakout . The chart supports that view by showing price now testing the same resistance that rejected every rally since October. A daily close above this level would break the pattern of lower highs and invalidate the channel structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Key Levels If Resistance Breaks A confirmed breakout above the channel could open the door to higher prices. The first area to watch sits between $2.1 and $2.3. XRP previously consolidated in this zone before accelerating lower. That makes it a logical area for the asset to revisit if momentum continues to build. Above that range, the next major resistance appears near $2.50. This level aligns with prior swing highs from November. Reclaiming it would mark a clear trend shift on the daily timeframe. Such a move would also restore bullish market structure after months of downside control. The final level is near $2.7 , as this level capped XRP’s rallies in October. If the asset can breach this level, it could target higher prices above $3, reclaiming levels not seen since early October. For now, market participants are focused on a breakout above the descending channel. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has accumulated $19,500,000 from its strategic presale, garnering 18,590 supporters for its upcoming launch. Solana’s network sees continued activity regardless of market volatility. Both of these assets are taking different stances in their industry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a dual-market lending protocol that includes an overcollateralized stable cryptocurrency and yield strategies. Traders are reassessing their investment strategies for year-end, and these assets are becoming hubs for DeFi crypto technology. Solana Faces Price Fluctuations Solana’s ability to handle millions of transactions every day throughout this year of 2025 has proven its technical strength even during times when the price of its token faced pressures. It has also been hosting numerous decentralized applications that range from trading platforms to NFT marketplaces and more. It’s considered one of the best cryptos that provide faster transaction processing times. The transaction costs are low compared to other competing blockchain systems, making it possible for Solana to support transactions that could not actually be economically feasible on other systems. Looking at the price trend recently, Solana is experiencing resistance points which have been used as regions of consolidation in the past. The Solana blockchain’s number of validators and distribution of stake is increasing. However, investors considering which cryptocurrency to invest in should note that Solana is established and thus its growth trajectory is different from that of other systems which are still at development stages. Mutuum Finance Presale is Almost Through Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has allocated 99% of its Phase 6 tokens, prompting investors to take advantage of the current price of $0.035. Phase 7 will start with a direct price hike to $0.04, signaling a 20% growth before the exchange listing. Since the token has given a 250% return on investment for investors who joined during the $0.01 price for Phase 1, the new investors will make at least 400% profit once the price is $0.06. Such an increase in price is based on a genuine demand within the marketplace, which is not a product of hype, seen by the steady increase through the six stages of presales. Investors are falling behind schedule and are about to miss the last chance to purchase tokens at less than four cents, given how fast Phase 6 is selling out. Launched through this project is an interactive dashboard showing top 50 holders, an element that promotes a competition mechanism to ensure heightened participation. Additionally, a 24-hour leaderboard has been incorporated whereby the top user qualifies for a $500 MUTM bonus, provided there has been at least one trade made within the 24-hour period. The leaderboard reloads every day at 00:00 UTC. In addition, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token has also made it possible for people to make payments using their cards, with no limitations on the transaction amounts, which previously hindered potential buyers who invested through crypto-wallet payments. Halborn Security audits the lending and borrowing contracts for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This is after the code is now finalized and is being formally analyzed for any issues that could concern new DeFi crypto projects’ investors. Last Chance Before Pricing Increases The closure of phase 6 will thus signal the end of prices below four cents for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It is thus providing a clear marker for investors to choose a cryptocurrency to invest in prior to 2026. Solana is a good network play, but Mutuum Finance offers earlier stage access with clear near-term goals. Positioning must be considered prior to Phase 7 Pricing.

56484394,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1424434,1766907084,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/56484394.jpeg,"The 2025 Bitcoin Report: Strategic Reserves, Record Highs, and Q4 Crash",https://cryptopotato.com/the-2025-bitcoin-report-strategic-reserves-record-highs-and-q4-crash/,"2025 has been a very eventful year for the Bitcoin network and BTC as an asset. The ecosystem recorded notable growth and expansion, alongside rising adoption from traditional finance entities. But it hasn’t been a smooth ride. As the year unfolded, Bitcoin experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly, from major wins and institutional adoption to setbacks, controversies, and unresolved challenges. The Good Shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, he approved the creation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a digital asset stockpile. This development set the stage for increased BTC adoption, with institutions and U.S. states opening their doors to the leading cryptocurrency. Flows into the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market rose and remained elevated. Several countries also enacted laws that comprehensively regulated Bitcoin and other digital assets. Most firms gained exposure to BTC via ETFs, while others became Bitcoin Treasury companies and acquired the digital asset directly. This consistent demand from institutions and retail investors fueled the momentum that drove BTC to multiple all-time highs (ATHs) this year. Between July and August, BTC went on a roll, becoming the fifth-largest asset by market cap in the world and surpassing Google. Before the market turned for the worse in October, BTC rallied to an ATH above $126,000. The Bad On the network front, the Bitcoin mainnet saw no major developments, aside from the adoption and scaling of layer-2 chains like the Lightning Network . Although developers are keen on expanding Bitcoin’s utility, the network’s programmability is somewhat limited. Bitcoin’s unique dynamics have made the network a bit distinct from the broader crypto ecosystem. In 2025, BTC’s correlation with the traditional finance sector increased, and the asset became more sensitive to macroeconomic catalysts. This growing correlation came from rising institutional investment as capital from corporate entities linked the crypto asset to traditional finance. Additionally, the Bitcoin network saw increased mining difficulty and expanded hardware. While this strengthened security, it also triggered miner capitulation, which forced some miners off the network. The Ugly Demand stopped growing after a major liquidation event that wiped out $19 billion in market value in early October. It marked the first negative October returns since 2018, and the big BTC buyers ghosted the market. BTC has dropped to prices below psychological levels and is currently struggling to stay above $90,000. With the bears dominating in recent months, the state of the market has dashed investor hopes of another rally before the bull phase ends. Currently, all technical indicators suggest the market is at the onset of a bear cycle, which has significantly impacted profitability for both miners and investors. Investors are shifting to traditional assets like gold. Interestingly, the four-year Bitcoin cycle may have died in 2025 – experts now insist that subsequent BTC rallies will be driven by demand waves, rather than the quadrennial halving events.

Key Takeaways: A former Coinbase support agent was arrested in India over a data breach affecting nearly 70,000 users. Coinbase rejected a $20M ransom and incurred $307M in breach-related costs. The incident adds to mounting legal and security pressure on the exchange. “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice,” Armstrong said in a post on X on Thursday. “Another one down and more still to come.” The breach, which Coinbase said began in December 2024, stemmed from a bribery scheme targeting offshore customer support staff. Coinbase Breach Exposed Data of Nearly 70,000 Users Cybercriminals allegedly paid customer service agents to access internal systems and extract sensitive user information, including names, addresses, phone numbers and government-issued identification. Coinbase disclosed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office that 69,461 users were affected. The attackers later demanded a $20 million ransom, which Coinbase refused to pay. Instead, the company launched a matching bounty program, offering rewards for information that could lead to arrests and asset recovery. A subsequent investigation by Fortune linked the incident to customer support agents working for TaskUs, a Texas-based business process outsourcing firm with operations in India. TaskUs said it had identified two employees who were allegedly recruited as part of a broader criminal campaign that also targeted other service providers supporting Coinbase. We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice. Thanks to the Hyderabad Police in India, an ex-Coinbase customer service agent was just arrested. Another one down and more still to come. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 26, 2025 Coinbase reported $307 million in breach-related costs in its second-quarter earnings, covering remediation efforts and reimbursements to affected customers. The company is also facing a shareholder class action lawsuit, which alleges that Coinbase failed to disclose the breach in a timely manner. The arrest in India comes just days after US prosecutors charged a Brooklyn resident with running a separate phishing scheme that allegedly stole $16 million from roughly 100 Coinbase users. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT played a role in identifying the suspect. Coinbase shares slipped about 1.2% to $236.90 on Friday. Indian law enforcement has not issued a public statement on the arrest. Brooklyn Man Charged in $16M Crypto Scam Targeting Coinbase Users As reported, US prosecutors have charged a 23-year-old Brooklyn resident , Ronald Spektor, with stealing roughly $16 million in cryptocurrency from around 100 Coinbase users through an alleged phishing and social engineering scheme. According to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, Spektor posed as a Coinbase employee and contacted victims claiming their funds were at immediate risk, pressuring them to transfer crypto to wallets he controlled. Authorities said the scheme relied on panic tactics rather than technical hacks. Operating under the online alias “lolimfeelingevil,” Spektor allegedly warned victims of imminent theft to override skepticism and force quick decisions. Once funds were transferred, prosecutors say he attempted to hide their origin by routing assets through crypto mixers, token swaps and online gambling platforms. Spektor was arraigned on 31 charges, including first-degree grand larceny and money laundering, following a year-long investigation. Law enforcement has seized about $105,000 in cash and $400,000 in digital assets so far, with efforts ongoing to recover more funds.

Could the digital currency bounce back to the $2.50 mark? The article delves into the factors at play, offering insights into what's driving interest and which cryptocurrencies show promise for growth. Uncover the dynamics influencing ATOM's future. Cosmos (ATOM) Displays Subtle Rebound Potential Amidst Market Turmoil Source: tradingview Cosmos (ATOM) is experiencing modest price movement, hovering in the $1.79 to $2.13 range. This shows a gradual rise above the 10-day average of just above $2. After a tough few months, with a nearly 50% drop in half a year, ATOM is now seeing a one-week uptick of just over 9%. The price needs to break through its nearest barrier at $2.31, aiming for the second one at $2.65, to possibly ignite a meaningful rally. A rise to the first resistance would be just a touch over 10%, offering some hope for upward momentum, though the journey remains cautious against recent downward trends. Conclusion The price of ATOM has shown signs of recovery. Positive market sentiment could help it reach $2.50 again. The coin's potential lies in its technology and community support. Improvements in market conditions are key factors. With continued progress, there is a possibility for ATOM to reclaim previous highs. Investors will be watching closely for any positive developments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Although 2025 and this bull cycle were not entirely positive for Ether (ETH), the network recorded significant upgrades that optimized the user experience. There are multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in the works as developers continue to work together to scale the network. The Good At the start of the year, developers prepared for the release of the Pectra upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet. Following the mainnet deployment of Pectra in early May, Ethereum users gained support for larger validator stakes, account abstraction, protocol efficiency, and scalability enhancements. Hence, Pectra was one of Ethereum’s wins in 2025, as the upgrade marked one of the network’s largest in years and also a stepping stone to future developments. After Pectra, developers focused on preparing for Fusaka and finally deployed the upgrade in early December. Fusaka focused on preserving Ethereum’s core features and delivering major scaling and data-efficiency improvements to the network. Amid the network upgrades and improvements, the second-largest crypto network also saw sustained stablecoin, decentralized finance (DeFi), and staking activity. Ethereum recorded significant adoption among institutions and traditional finance entities. This year witnessed the rise of institutional investment vehicles and Ethereum Treasury companies, as billions of dollars flowed into the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market. Dozens of companies, including Nasdaq-listed firms, jumped on the trend of holding ETH on corporate balance sheets. The Bad Although regulatory clarity from U.S. and European Union frameworks has made institutional engagement more compliant and encouraged crypto adoption, Ethereum still faces some regulatory uncertainty. Authorities have yet to decide whether ETH is a security or a commodity. While there is increased integration of digital rails for tokenized assets within the ecosystem, the Ethereum community is concerned that the network is usable only via layer-2 chains. Market experts feel there is a need to redirect developer focus back to the mainnet. There are also concerns about centralization due to the raised validator stake. Larger entities now dominate the staking scene, raising questions about the network’s decentralization. The Ugly Meanwhile, the growth recorded in the Ethereum network had no meaningful impact on ether’s price and value. Despite sustained demand from institutions and ETFs, the asset barely recorded any major price movements. In fact, Ether’s current all-time high (ATH) is less than $100 more than the asset’s peak during the 2021 bull run. In November 2021, ETH hit an ATH of $4,878; this time, data from CoinMarketCap shows the coin’s August 2025 high sitting at $4,953. Since then, it has tumbled below $3,000, and it even plunged under $1,500 in April. The poor price performance resulted in a loss of confidence in ETH among investors. The mismatch between network growth and prices has become hard for investors to ignore, prompting retail users to offload their assets, further depressing ether’s value. Investors are increasingly frustrated, and the narrative that ETH is losing its leadership momentum is prevailing.

Despite the turbulence, certain cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention. This article reveals which coins are catching the eye of savvy investors and poised for potential gains. Rising Star ENA: Why This Altcoin Could Shine in the Next Bull Run ENA is an altcoin that focuses on enhancing digital identity. It uses blockchain to make personal information secure yet accessible. This unique approach draws comparisons to successful privacy and identity projects from previous bull runs. With the current crypto market showing early signs of a turnaround, ENA's innovative tech could drive interest and adoption. Its recent partnerships and development updates indicate robust growth potential. As investors look for high-reward altcoins during market recoveries, ENA might appeal to those seeking a promising project with real-world applications. The coin's current low price could offer a striking entry point for future gains in the next alt season. Altcoins Ready to Bounce Back: Why WLD Could Shine WLD is the native token of Worldcoin, a project aiming to give everyone a piece of digital currency. Worldcoin uses unique technology to ensure fair distribution and privacy. Each person gets a share just by authenticating their identity. Even with recent market dips, WLD looks promising. It aims to expand access to cryptocurrency and increase adoption. The project mirrors early successful strategies from past bull runs. With the potential for mass appeal and solid tech backing, WLD could be an attractive choice in the current cycle. This altcoin could rise as the market gears up for a rebound, making it one to watch. Why TON Could Shine Bright in the Next Altcoin Season TON , short for The Open Network, is a decentralized blockchain originally designed by Telegram. It's built for speedy transactions and high security. What sets it apart is its focus on scalability, meaning it can handle lots of activity without slowing down. As we look at patterns resembling the 2021 bull run, TON stands out with its solid tech and robust community backing. Its ability to support decentralized applications makes it a strong contender in the current market cycle. With its promising technology and unique features, TON seems well-placed to attract attention and possibly shine in the next altcoin season. Conclusion Traders are showing interest in ENA, WLD, and TON even during market fluctuations. This selective accumulation suggests confidence in these assets. The focus on these coins highlights their potential for growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Chan plans to maintain this upward trend by strengthening the city’s role across three main areas: finance, technology, and trade. Earlier in February, he had estimated growth would land between 2 and 3 percent. Record year for stock listings Hong Kong led the world in new stock listings this year. Authorities want more companies from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to list on the exchange, Chan noted in a recent blog post. Additionally, the city will encourage broader worldwide acceptance of China’s currency. The plan places a significant priority on technological advancement. To remain competitive globally, Hong Kong plans to grow its biotech and artificial intelligence sectors. Authorities are equally committed to helping Chinese businesses expand into foreign markets by utilizing Hong Kong’s position as a center for regional trade. “Looking into next year, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to keep the good trend of growth,” Chan said. “Finance, tech innovation and trade will be Hong Kong’s key engines of growth as the city actively embraces China’s development strategy.” Market performance exceeds expectations The Hang Seng Index climbed 30 percent this year, making it one of the top-performing stock markets worldwide. Chan pointed to strong exports, active spending on buildings and equipment, and improving consumer spending as reasons the city did better than expected. To improve its financial center status, Hong Kong will make its stock market more competitive and grow trading in bonds, money markets, fintech, commodities, and gold.

Today, betting with BTC and USDT is a mainstream choice for players who value speed, privacy, and global access. Whether you prefer the volatility of Bitcoin or the stability of stablecoins, modern cryptocurrency betting sites now offer flexible tools built specifically for crypto-first users. But not every platform that accepts crypto is truly designed for it. Below, we review three trusted platforms for betting with cryptocurrency, focusing on real usability, transparency, and long-term reliability. What Makes a Crypto Betting Platform Truly Trustworthy? Before looking at specific sites, it’s worth understanding what separates reliable cryptocurrency betting platforms from risky ones. A trusted crypto betting site usually gets these fundamentals right: Clear licensing and operational transparency Fast BTC and USDT payouts without hidden delays Reasonable or no KYC policies, clearly explained upfront Crypto-native infrastructure, not fiat systems patched with wallets Fair odds and provable settlement logic, especially for live bets In short, betting with crypto should feel seamless — not like an experiment layered on top of a traditional sportsbook. 1. Dexsport — A Crypto-Native Platform Built for BTC & USDT Bettors Among platforms that truly understand betting with cryptocurrency, Dexsport stands out as a fully crypto-native ecosystem rather than a hybrid compromise. Dexsport is designed around instant access and user control. Registration takes seconds and can be done via email, Telegram, or a DeFi wallet — no identity checks, no document uploads, no friction. From there, users gain access to 10,000+ games, combining a full casino with a deep sportsbook. What makes Dexsport particularly strong for betting with BTC and USDT is its multi-chain support and real-time betting flexibility. Key strengths for crypto bettors include: Support for Bitcoin, USDT, and dozens of other cryptocurrencies across multiple networks In-play betting with Cash Out, allowing users to manage risk live Competitive odds across football, basketball, MMA, and esports Esports markets for CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and more Live streaming available even without a funded balance Bonuses are structured to reward activity rather than trap users. New players can unlock a 480% bonus across three deposits, plus free spins for casino games. Sports bettors also receive free bets and weekly cashback paid in stablecoins — a practical perk for anyone who prefers to bet with USDT instead of volatile assets. Transparency is another core advantage. Dexsport operates as a licensed platform and publishes real-time bet data through a public desk, allowing outcomes to be verified rather than blindly trusted. Independent audits further reinforce confidence in the platform’s infrastructure. In practice, Dexsport feels less like a “casino that accepts crypto” and more like a betting platform built from the ground up for crypto users. 2.Thunderpick — Esports-Driven Crypto Betting with BTC and USDT Thunderpick approaches cryptocurrency betting from a different angle. Its focus is firmly on esports, making it appealing to players who primarily bet with BTC or USDT on competitive gaming. The platform shines in titles like CS:GO, Dota 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, offering live betting, prop markets, and integrated streams. Deposits and withdrawals are crypto-only, which keeps transactions relatively fast and straightforward. That said, Thunderpick is more specialized. Traditional sports coverage exists but lacks the depth and market variety found on broader platforms. Some withdrawals may require additional verification depending on activity, which can be a downside for users seeking maximum anonymity. Thunderpick works best for: Esports-first bettors Players focused on in-play esports odds Users comfortable with a narrower betting scope 3. Vave — A Hybrid Sportsbook for High-Volume Crypto Betting Vave positions itself as a hybrid solution, combining casino entertainment with a large, traditional sportsbook offering. For players interested in betting with bitcoin across mainstream sports, Vave delivers a wide selection of markets, particularly in football. Live betting tools, cash-out options, and streaming are all present, and support for USDT and other major cryptocurrencies makes onboarding easy. However, Vave operates closer to a traditional sportsbook model. KYC is typically required at withdrawal stages, and bonus wagering requirements can be higher than crypto-native alternatives. For some players, that trade-off is acceptable in exchange for breadth and familiarity. Vave is generally suited for: High-volume sports bettors Players who prioritize market depth over anonymity Users comfortable with occasional verification steps BTC vs USDT: Which Is Better for Crypto Betting? Both options have clear advantages, and the choice often depends on betting style. Betting with BTC can amplify winnings during upward price movements, but volatility cuts both ways. It’s better suited for shorter sessions or speculative strategies. Betting with USDT, on the other hand, offers stability. Odds, bankroll management, and cashback rewards remain predictable — a major advantage for live betting and long sessions. Many experienced players combine both: Use BTC for selected high-risk bets Use USDT for consistent wagering and cashbacks Switch between assets depending on market conditions Which Platform Fits Your Betting Style? Maximum privacy & flexibility: Dexsport Esports-focused crypto betting: Thunderpick Wide sports coverage with crypto support: Vave Each platform serves a different type of crypto bettor, but Dexsport stands out as the most balanced option for users who want to bet with BTC and USDT without sacrificing control, speed, or transparency. Final Verdict Cryptocurrency betting is no longer about simply accepting Bitcoin. The best platforms are those that embrace crypto at every level — from registration to payouts and live wagering. Among today’s trusted options, Dexsport leads as a truly crypto-native platform, while Thunderpick and Vave serve more specialized roles. Choosing the right platform ultimately depends on how you prefer to bet, what assets you use, and how much control you want over your funds. For players serious about betting with cryptocurrency , the difference is immediately noticeable.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-28 08:00:32

Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a well-respected crypto analyst on X, has analyzed XRP’s liquidity charts, revealing its next steps to market participants. The analyst shared two liquidity charts for XRP that shift focus away from short-term noise. The charts highlight where capital has clustered, where it has thinned out, and where price could gravitate next. Rather than offering a near-term call, the analysis looks further ahead and identifies a minimum target for 2026. $XRP hourly and daily liquidity + minimum target for 2026 based on liquidity alone pic.twitter.com/0Z4x9yOiyB — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) December 26, 2025 Hourly Liquidity Shows Immediate Price Constraints The hourly chart provides the first layer of context. XRP trades within a tight range, with liquidity bands clearly stacked above the current price. These bands act as magnets during periods of expansion. They also cap upside during weak momentum phases. The hourly view shows XRP stabilizing after a prolonged decline, with its price hovering near $1.87. Liquidity below current levels has thinned considerably. That suggests less incentive for the asset to push lower unless new selling pressure enters the market . Above the current price, liquidity remains dense. This imbalance creates a directional bias. If momentum returns, the asset has a clearer path upward than downward on this time frame. The hourly chart does not define a long-term target for XRP. However, it establishes the structure that supports a broader move when market conditions align. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Daily Liquidity Reveals the Bigger Picture The daily chart shifts the focus from short-term reactions to structural positioning . Liquidity bands expand significantly as the time frame increases. On the daily chart, XRP sits beneath a wide zone of high liquidity that stretches well above $3. This zone has built up over months, and could give way to a rapid surge. Cryptoinsightuk highlights $4.32 as a minimum target derived from this daily liquidity concentration. He expects this to be XRP’s lowest level in 2026. The level stands out as a clear area where liquidity peaks relative to surrounding price zones. The chart suggests price has unfinished business there if XRP enters a sustained expansion phase. The targets on the way to $4.32 are $3.65, XRP’s all-time high , which it reached in July, and $4. These levels have the densest liquidity bands. Liquidity targets often act as checkpoints rather than endpoints. Crossing these levels could push XRP further, sending it to Cryptoinsightuk’s $4.32 target. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Today, it’s one of the most popular ways to bet with crypto, especially among players who value speed, flexibility, and real-time control. As more users explore how to bet with crypto during live matches, platforms built specifically for cryptocurrency betting begin to stand out. One of those platforms is Dexsport — a crypto-native sportsbook and casino designed around instant access, transparency, and live wagering with digital assets. Why Live Betting Works Differently with Cryptocurrency Live betting changes the entire logic of wagering. Odds move quickly, momentum shifts in seconds, and decisions often need to be made instantly. When you combine this with betting with cryptocurrency, the platform’s infrastructure becomes critical. In live crypto betting, three things matter most: Speed of balance updates — delays break the experience. Immediate settlement logic — especially important when markets suspend and reopen. User control — the ability to manage risk without waiting for final results. Dexsport is built with these exact requirements in mind, which becomes obvious the moment you place your first in-play bet. Dexsport Overview: Built for Live Crypto Betting Dexsport operates as a decentralized sportsbook and casino with official licensing and independent audits. Registration takes seconds and does not require identity verification. You can sign up via email, Telegram, or by connecting a DeFi wallet and start betting with crypto almost immediately. Here’s a concise overview of the platform’s core live-betting specifications: Feature Dexsport Platform Type Decentralized sportsbook & casino KYC Not required Cryptocurrencies 38+ coins across 20 networks Live Betting Yes, with Cash Out Transparency Public live bet tracking Audits CertiK, Pessimistic This structure makes Dexsport feel one of the true crypto betting websites , not a traditional sportsbook adapted to crypto payments. Live Sports Markets: Focused and Practical Rather than flooding the interface with low-liquidity events, Dexsport prioritizes sports where live betting activity is strongest. Football, basketball, tennis, MMA, boxing, hockey, and golf form the core offering, each supported by deep in-play markets. Live betting options often exceed 100 markets per match, covering everything from basic outcomes to advanced props. Odds remain competitive, and market suspensions are handled smoothly — an important detail for anyone serious about cryptocurrency for sports betting. Live streaming is also available, even without a funded account. This allows bettors to observe match flow before committing funds, which is especially useful in volatile live scenarios. Cash Out: Real-Time Risk Management Cash Out plays a central role in Dexsport’s live betting experience. Instead of waiting for an event to settle, users can actively manage their position. In practice, Cash Out is used in three main ways: Locking in profit when odds swing favorably Reducing exposure when momentum shifts Exiting high-risk positions during unpredictable phases of play For anyone learning how to bet with crypto in live markets, this level of control significantly lowers unnecessary risk. Live Esports Betting with Cryptocurrency Dexsport’s live betting isn’t limited to traditional sports. Esports markets are actively supported and updated in real time, including CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and cyber sports. Esports betting tends to move faster than traditional sports, which makes crypto a natural fit. Balance updates are instant, odds refresh smoothly, and in-play markets remain accessible throughout matches. This is where cryptocurrency betting feels genuinely native rather than experimental. Transparency and Verifiability One of Dexsport’s defining features is its public live bet desk. Bets and outcomes are visible in real time, allowing users to observe platform activity instead of relying on opaque settlement processes. This matters because live betting disputes are common across the industry. On Dexsport, transparency is not a marketing claim — it’s built into how the system operates. For players focused on betting with cryptocurrency, this level of openness builds long-term trust. Bonuses That Fit Live Betting Bonuses often interfere with live betting strategies due to rigid wagering rules. Dexsport’s incentive structure is more flexible. The platform offers a multi-stage welcome bonus, free bets for sports wagering, and weekly cashback paid in stablecoins. Cashback does not require additional wagering, which makes it usable even for conservative live bettors. There is also a Sports Club program that rewards consistent activity with guaranteed monthly free bets — a system designed for long-term users rather than one-time promotions. Why Dexsport Works for Live Crypto Bettors Dexsport succeeds because it aligns platform design with actual bettor behavior. There is no forced token economy, no unnecessary friction, and no artificial complexity. What you get instead is: instant access without KYC fast crypto deposits and withdrawals live betting tools that actually respond in real time transparent settlement logic support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies For users serious about betting with crypto and managing live positions actively, this combination is hard to ignore. Final Thoughts Live betting is where weaknesses in crypto sportsbooks become obvious. Delays, unclear settlement rules, and poor transparency quickly push users away. Dexsport handles these pressure points well. It offers a live betting environment that feels natural for cryptocurrency users — fast, flexible, and verifiable. For anyone exploring cryptocurrency betting beyond basic pre-match wagers, Dexsport stands out as a platform built for how modern crypto betting actually works.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-28 08:02:33

We talked numerous times about the major moves made by the Brad Garlinghouse-led company, which included the closure of the SEC lawsuit, impressive partnerships, and big acquisitions. The underlying asset benefited from some of those, as it pumped to a fresh all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July. However, it has slumped hard in the following months and now sits below a crucial support line at $1.90. Although it saw the release of five spot XRP ETFs since mid-November, its price performance has been quite underwhelming, losing roughly 25% of its value since the first one went live. With just days left of 2025, we asked a few AI projects about their predictions for the year’s end. How Will XRP End 2025? ChatGPT and Perplexity agreed with certain analysts’ claims that the fact that XRP dumped below $1.90 could spell further trouble in the following week. OpenAI’s solution outlined that the next significant support levels lie at $1.70-$1.75, which, if broken to the downside, might result in another pullback to and below $1.50. In case of a more profound price revival by the end of the year, the token would need to decisively reclaim the $1.90 resistance and aim for the next one at $2.00. If it’s successful, which seems rather unlikely at the moment, then it could go for $2.20. ChatGPT admitted that the overall market condition is quite unfavorable even for larger-cap alts, and added: “With Bitcoin steady but not especially bullish, XRP is lacking the external momentum needed for a strong year-end recovery.” Final Verdict 2025 has been spectacular , at least until the middle of it, for XRP, but mostly for the entity behind it. Now, the situation looks rather worrisome, and there’s little hope in the price predictions coming from the AI solutions. Grok joined the overall bearish side, indicating that a price drop to $1.60 is highly likely, especially if BTC is rejected once again at $88,000 or even $90,000, which has been the case over the past few weeks. Following each failed attempt, the altcoins fall even further, which is evident from the rising Bitcoin dominance. “Unless the bulls stage an unexpected comeback, XRP is likely to end 2025 in a consolidation or mild downtrend zone below $1.90. The breakdown of a major multi-month support level shifts the advantage firmly toward sellers, and only a strong reclaim of $1.90 would reverse short-term picture,” concluded Grok.

While the broader trend remains weak, technical conditions suggest downside pressure may be easing. This analysis piece is delivered by Outset PR , a web3 PR firm where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. Modest Bounce Within a Broader Downtrend SHIB gained nearly 1% over the past day, marking a modest recovery rather than a trend shift. Price action remains constrained by the broader downtrend, but the move signals tentative buyer interest after sustained selling. The token is currently testing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000752, a zone that often acts as a short-term inflection point during corrective phases. Momentum Indicators Approach Oversold Levels The 14-day Relative Strength Index stands at 34.49, placing SHIB near oversold territory. While not yet extreme, this level suggests selling momentum is weakening. At the same time, the MACD is showing early signs of bullish divergence, indicating that downside momentum may be losing strength even as price remains compressed. Such setups often precede short-term relief rallies rather than full reversals. Any rebound attempt faces immediate resistance at the 50-day exponential moving average near $0.00000807. This level has capped upside moves during recent recovery attempts and will need to be reclaimed to confirm a more sustainable bounce. Without a break above this resistance, upside moves are likely to remain corrective. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create. While most crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach. Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone. Case in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. Drive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech Outset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd Outset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like: domain activity month-on-month visibility shifts audience geography source of traffic By consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field. Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. SHIB Price Outlook Shiba Inu is approaching oversold conditions, with momentum indicators hinting at a possible short-term rebound. However, the broader trend remains bearish, and confirmation would require a move above the 50-day EMA. Until then, any upside is best viewed as a relief rally rather than a structural trend change.

What once felt experimental is now a stable ecosystem of platforms offering sports betting with Bitcoin, esports markets, and fast on-chain payouts. For players who prefer to bet with BTC instead of fiat, the key question is no longer “Can I use Bitcoin?” but “Which bitcoin betting site can actually be trusted?” Below, we review some of the most reliable bitcoin betting sites in Europe, focusing on transparency, payouts, betting depth, and real usability — not marketing promises. What Makes a Bitcoin Betting Site “Trusted”? Before choosing where to bet on sports with Bitcoin, it’s important to understand what separates trustworthy platforms from risky ones. A reliable bitcoin betting site usually delivers on several core points: Clear operational structure — licensing or at least transparent ownership Consistent BTC payouts without unexplained delays Real sports and esports coverage, not just token markets Predictable rules around KYC, limits, and withdrawals For users engaged in online sports betting with Bitcoin, trust is built through behavior over time, not just welcome bonuses. Dexsport — Bitcoin Betting Built for Speed and Transparency Dexsport stands out as a crypto-native sportsbook and casino where betting with bitcoin feels natural rather than adapted. The platform supports BTC alongside dozens of other cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin remains a core asset for both deposits and withdrawals. Registration is instant and does not require identity verification. Users can sign up via email, Telegram, or a connected wallet and immediately access sports, live betting, esports, and a large casino section. From a betting perspective, Dexsport focuses on quality markets: football, basketball, tennis, MMA, boxing, hockey, golf live betting with Cash Out esports betting with Bitcoin on CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant Transparency is a major differentiator. Dexsport operates a public live bet desk, allowing users to observe real-time bet activity and outcomes — a rare feature among bitcoin betting sites. For players who regularly bet with BTC and value speed, anonymity, and verifiable settlement, Dexsport fits naturally into the “trusted” category. Cybet — A Newcomer with Strong Bitcoin Support Cybet is a newer entrant in the European crypto betting space, but it has gained attention quickly. The platform combines a sportsbook, casino, and esports betting under one interface, with Bitcoin fully supported. BTC deposits and withdrawals are processed quickly, and the platform interface is clean and mobile-friendly. Sports coverage includes mainstream leagues and esports, making it suitable for users interested in betting on sports with bitcoin as well as competitive gaming. That said, Cybet is still building its long-term reputation. While functionality is solid, players looking for a long operational track record may prefer more established platforms. Betplay — Lightning Network Speed for BTC Bettors Betplay takes a different approach, leaning heavily into Bitcoin technology. The platform supports BTC both on-chain and via the Lightning Network, which allows for extremely fast deposits and withdrawals. This makes Betplay attractive for users who value transaction speed above all else. Sports coverage is broad, including over 40 sports, esports markets, and standard betting formats like handicaps and futures. However, Betplay operates without a traditional license, and wagering requirements can be higher than average. It’s best suited for experienced users who understand the trade-offs and want to bet with bitcoin as efficiently as possible. Lucky Block — Bitcoin Betting with High Bonuses Lucky Block is a well-known name in crypto gambling, offering a combination of sportsbook, casino, and esports betting. Bitcoin is fully supported, and payouts are generally fast. The platform stands out for its generous bonuses and low minimum deposits, which appeal to casual users exploring sports betting with bitcoin for the first time. Markets cover football, basketball, tennis, and esports, with live betting available. Some users have reported account reviews during withdrawals, so while Lucky Block is popular, it may not be ideal for those prioritizing maximum operational predictability. BetPanda — Anonymous Bitcoin Betting with Moderate Depth BetPanda offers anonymous betting with Bitcoin and a wide selection of cryptocurrencies. Registration is simple, and KYC is generally not required unless triggered by unusual activity. Bitcoin betting markets cover mainstream sports and some niche options. While the sportsbook depth is adequate, it does not offer the same level of live markets or streaming as more advanced platforms. BetPanda works best for users who value privacy and simplicity over advanced features when betting with BTC. Bitcoin vs Traditional Betting: Why BTC Betting Gaining Popularity Bitcoin remains one of the most widely used assets for crypto betting because it offers: global access without banking restrictions fast, borderless transfers independence from fiat volatility tied to local currencies For both sports betting with bitcoin and esports betting with bitcoin, BTC continues to be a practical choice — especially on platforms designed around crypto from the start. Final Verdict Europe offers a growing number of solid bitcoin betting sites, but not all are equal. Some prioritize bonuses, others speed, and a few focus on transparency and long-term trust. Dexsport stands out for its crypto-native design, live betting tools, and verifiable approach to wagering. Cybet and Betplay offer interesting alternatives depending on whether you value interface simplicity or Lightning-fast BTC payouts, while Lucky Block and BetPanda cater to more casual or privacy-focused users.

According to its statement, the AI model boasts more than 500 billion parameters that it can use to learn data. In the statement released on Sunday, the SK Telecom consortium, which consists of eight organizations including Krafton, Rebellions, Seoul National University, and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, jointly developed A.X K1. The statement highlighted that the model seeks to become Korea ‘s first AI language model and boasts a total of 519 billion parameters. Parameters are learned values that models use to analyze data, which are widely regarded as an indicator of their size or scale. SK Telecom consortium to unveil AI language model In its statement, SK Telecom noted that during inference, the model activates about 33 billion parameters, which allows it to maintain high performance while optimizing computational efficiency. This design provides the model with an environment to operate flexibly while carrying out different varieties of task execution, including heavy-duty training and lightweight task execution. “Developing Korea’s first 500-billion-parameter scale model marks a new turning point for the country’s ambition to join the global top tier of AI leaders amid fierce international competition,” said Kim Tae-yoon, SK Telecom’s head of foundation model division. “As Korea’s national AI champion, we’ll continue working to realize our vision of AI for everyone.” Given the benchmarks for global models with over 500 billion parameters, SK Telecom noted A.X K1 will be able to offer more stable performance in complex reasoning, math, and multilingual understanding than smaller-scale models. It also added that the model would be able to enhance use cases such as code generation and autonomous agent-based workflows. At that scale, the model can also serve as what it describes as a ‘teacher model,’ transferring knowledge to smaller and domain-specific models, which will make it an important part of the AI ecosystem. SK Telecom also added that its consortium has plans to extend research so that the model would be able to train smaller models that directly enhance daily life and drive industrial innovation across South Korea. A.X K1 was trained as a Korean language model Unlike most models that are trained in English, A.X K1 was originally designed to be trained in Korean from the beginning, allowing it to understand Korean language input naturally. This Korean first approach makes the model well-suited for building personalized services that reflect the culture, history, and economy of the Asian country. SK Telecom also plans to deploy the mode through its AI service A. (Adot), which has over 10 million subscribers. The development is expected to create an environment for people to access AI easily through calls, text messages, the web, and mobile apps. The company also plans to expand its application to other sectors, including Adot Biz for workplace productivity, AI solutions that improve manufacturing processes, Krafton’s game AI for real-time character dialogue and autonomous behavior, and humanoid robot technologies that extend AI models into physical and behavioral domains. A.X K1 is also expected to become the testbed for the semiconductor industry. As performance testing in AI chip development requires high volume and speed in transferring data, its scale is highly effective for verifying next-generation semiconductor performance. SK Telecom plans to open-source A.X K1 along with an application interface, which will provide local firms with an environment for developing artificial intelligence agents.

56485640,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-backed-eur-loans-on-clapp-terms-collateral-and-access,1766909932,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56485640.jpeg,"Crypto-Backed EUR Loans on Clapp: Terms, Collateral, and Access",https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-backed-eur-loans-on-clapp-terms-collateral-and-access,"Crypto-backed lending has matured beyond fixed loans with rigid terms. For European users, the focus has shifted to flexibility, cost control, and direct access to euros. Clapp approaches this demand with a credit-line model that treats crypto collateral as an ongoing liquidity base rather than a one-time loan trigger. This review looks at how crypto-backed EUR loans work on Clapp, with a focus on terms, collateral structure, and access. Credit line structure instead of fixed loans Clapp does not issue traditional fixed-term crypto loans. Instead, users open a revolving credit line secured by crypto collateral. A borrowing limit is set based on deposited assets, but funds are drawn only when needed. Interest accrues exclusively on the amount actually borrowed. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. When funds are repaid, the available credit is restored immediately, without reapplying or restructuring the position. There is no fixed repayment schedule. Borrowers can draw, repay, or rebalance at any time through the Clapp Wallet . This structure shifts borrowing from a one-off decision to an on-demand tool. Collateral options and multi-asset flexibility Clapp supports multi-collateral credit lines. Users can combine up to 19 assets into a single borrowing position. Supported assets include BTC, ETH, SOL, and major stablecoins. Collateral does not need to be locked into a single asset type. Users can adjust composition as markets move, without closing the credit line. This reduces the need to manage multiple isolated loans or manually rebalance positions. For users holding diversified portfolios, this approach simplifies liquidity management while maintaining exposure. EUR access and same-day availability Once collateral is deposited and the credit line is active, EUR access is available without waiting periods or manual approvals. Funds can be drawn directly from the credit line and accessed through the platform’s EUR rails. Because interest applies only when capital is in use, users can keep the credit line open without cost until liquidity is needed. This makes the setup suitable for short-term expenses, opportunistic entries, or bridging liquidity gaps. Availability is continuous, rather than tied to loan issuance cycles. Interest model and cost control Clapp’s interest model is usage-based. Borrowers are charged only for active borrowing, not for unused credit. This differs from fixed-loan models where interest applies to the full principal from day one. There are no penalties for early repayment, and no pressure to maintain borrowed balances. Costs scale with usage rather than commitment. For users who borrow intermittently, this can materially reduce long-term interest expense. Regulatory standing and platform scope Clapp operates under a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license issued in the Czech Republic. This confirms its status as a licensed crypto lending provider within the EU regulatory framework. While licensing does not remove market risk, it provides clarity around operational standing and jurisdiction. The platform is designed for European users who require EUR-denominated borrowing with predictable access and transparent mechanics. Closing view Clapp treats crypto-backed borrowing as an ongoing liquidity layer rather than a one-time loan event. By separating credit availability from credit usage, it gives users more control over cost, timing, and collateral structure. For European crypto holders who need flexible EUR access without committing to rigid loan terms, Clapp offers a clean and functional approach built around usage, not obligation.

Thousands of projects compete for attention, so public relations has become a key factor in determining which brands gain investor trust, media coverage, and long-term traction. Crypto PR agencies help blockchain startups, Web3 companies, and established crypto brands communicate complex ideas, manage reputation, and secure placements in top-tier media outlets. This article reviews three of the best crypto PR agencies shaping the industry in 2026. We assess their services, technologies, strengths, and where they fit best for different kinds of Web3 projects. 1. Outset PR – Best Overall Crypto PR Agency Taking the top spot is Outset PR , a data-driven crypto and Web3 public relations agency working with blockchain startups, scale-ups, and established crypto companies. The agency is based in Tbilisi and operates across global markets. Outest PR has helped clients secure organic, high-credibility media coverage across leading crypto and mainstream publications, including: Cointelegraph Forbes Bloomberg The Block crypto.news CoinDesk Business Insider Benzinga Decrypt The scope of its services stretches far beyond organic media coverage and press releases. Outset PR is the first agency to apply a data-driven approach in crypto PR. Data-Driven Media Strategy Outset PR uses its internal intelligence system - Outset Data Pulse . It provides analytics and media performance data to choose where to pitch and to access which narratives dominate the attention. Its another in-house technology, Syndication Map , models how placements spread across aggregators and feeds, and defines which outlets will maximize secondary exposure, helping teams plan more efficient campaigns. AIO and LLM Visibility Beyond traditional PR metrics, Outset PR emphasizes visibility in AI-driven discovery systems and search surfaces — including Google Discover and large language model (LLM) indexing. The goal is to ensure stories aren’t just published but found and amplified by algorithmic systems that power modern discovery. Key Services of Outset PR Press Office — a proactive media service for consistent, credible visibility. Coverage is earned, not bought — 100% organic, driven by relevance and expertise, not media spend. Traffic Acquisition & SEO-Driven PR — campaigns designed to get featured in Google Discover and other high-visibility feeds. Tier-1 Pitching & Newsbreak Promotion — targeted efforts to secure coverage in top outlets. Long-Term Support & Market Dominance — building sustained brand presence that compounds over time. Content Creation & Personal Brand Development — aligning narratives with founder visibility and thought leadership. Real cases: XPANCEO (2023–2025): Outset PR supported XPANCEO with expert proofreading and adaptation of complex AI and deep-tech content, alongside full Arabic localization of PR and business materials. This helped make advanced technologies accessible to regional audiences and strengthened market positioning in MENA. StealthEX (2024–2025): Through weekly trend-driven pitching and thought leadership, Outset PR reached over 400 journalists and editors, securing expert mentions in outlets such as Forbes, Business Insider, Decrypt, and The Independent. The campaign generated 90+ syndications, including Yahoo Finance and MSN, with estimated total reach exceeding 3.6 billion. Why Outset PR Ranks #1 Outset PR is an analytics-centric partner that blends media relations with search optimization, algorithmic discovery, and measurable business outcomes. Its approach helps clients achieve not only press mentions but sustainable visibility that drives real audience engagement. 2. TokenMinds – Full-Stack Crypto PR & Web3 Marketing Agency TokenMinds is a global Web3 agency that offers a blend of crypto PR, media relations, community growth, and content strategy — making it a strong contender for projects needing both visibility and engagement beyond standard press coverage. TokenMinds operates globally (with headquarters in Singapore and teams across regions) and works with blockchain and Web3 projects from early-stage startups to growth-stage protocols. The agency’s model combines media relations with custom content, SEO optimization, and community engagement, helping projects build visibility both in media and across online audiences. The agency pursues placements and mentions across a range of crypto and mainstream outlets, supported by an integrated strategy that includes: Media relations and press placement SEO and visibility optimization Community engagement and platform outreach Branded content and tailored visuals designed for crypto audiences Services Offered TokenMinds’ core offerings align with a broader Web3 growth approach, blending PR with performance marketing elements: Media Relations & Press Outreach – Strategic pitching to crypto and tech outlets. SEO & Visibility Optimization – Content designed to rank and surface across crypto platforms. Community and Forum Engagement – Amplifying visibility on key Web3 channels. Custom Content & Creative Assets – Tailored press materials, visuals, and narratives. Ongoing Support & Reporting – Continuous performance tracking throughout campaigns. Real Cases SwissBorg — TokenMinds supported the Web3 wealth management platform with PR and content marketing initiatives, contributing to broader media exposure and community engagement during growth phases. ICON Network — The agency worked on content creation and visibility campaigns to support ecosystem communication and maintain consistent exposure across crypto media and online channels. SingularityNET — TokenMinds assisted with content and outreach strategies aimed at strengthening awareness around the project’s AI-blockchain narrative. Considerations TokenMinds is suitable for Web3 projects that want a full-service communications and growth partner rather than a narrow press outreach firm. Its mix of SEO-oriented content and community engagement adds depth to traditional PR, though it may require broader budgets and clearer campaign alignment than agencies focused purely on tier-1 press placements. 3. NinjaPromo – Subscription-Based Crypto Marketing & PR Support NinjaPromo is a crypto-friendly digital marketing and PR agency with a broad service offering that includes outreach, media management, branding, and community engagement. NinjaPromo operates internationally with offices in cities like New York, London, Dubai, Singapore, and more. While its core focus spans broader digital marketing beyond PR, it has experience supporting blockchain and crypto projects with brand visibility and strategic outreach. Services Offered Digital Marketing & PR – Integrated media and narrative support. Content Creation & Design – Creative collateral to support campaigns. SEO & Social Strategy – Search optimization and social engagement. Community and Influencer Outreach – Support for community growth. Paid Advertising & PPC Campaigns – Digital ads to supplement press efforts. Real Cases HTX (formerly Huobi) — NinjaPromo contributed to marketing and PR efforts aimed at strengthening brand presence and engagement across digital channels. Affyn — The agency supported the Web3 gaming project with content, social, and visibility initiatives to expand reach during key growth stages. Lisk — NinjaPromo assisted with digital marketing and content strategies to support ecosystem communication and developer-focused outreach. Considerations NinjaPromo’s strength lies in its integrated marketing and PR ecosystem, making it a good fit for projects that want combined support across PR, SEO, content, and advertising. However, because it’s not a pure PR specialist, some projects seeking tier-1 editorial placements exclusively may find its offerings broader than necessary. What Is Crypto PR? Crypto public relations focuses on how blockchain and Web3 companies communicate with investors, users, regulators, and the wider public. Its goal is to translate complex technologies into clear narratives, build credibility, and support broader adoption. Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology — decentralized, peer-to-peer systems that aim to improve transparency and efficiency in finance and digital ownership. While innovations like Bitcoin and Ethereum have reshaped the financial landscape, mass adoption is still slowed by several challenges. These include the technical complexity of blockchain concepts, market volatility combined with past scams, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty across different regions. As a result, many audiences remain cautious or skeptical. This is where crypto PR plays a critical role. How Crypto PR Agencies Help Effective crypto PR strategies help projects overcome these barriers in three key ways: Fostering understanding: PR teams simplify complex ideas and present them in accessible formats through media coverage, educational content, interviews, and thought leadership. Building trust: By securing credible media placements and highlighting transparency, security, and real-world use cases, PR helps strengthen a project’s reputation. Crisis communication also plays an important role in managing negative events. Shaping perception and policy: Through media engagement and industry commentary, crypto PR can help influence broader narratives around regulation and innovation. Because the crypto industry evolves quickly and operates globally, PR efforts must be fast, adaptive, and tailored to diverse audiences. How Much Does Crypto PR Cost? The cost of crypto PR varies widely and depends on several factors: Agency expertise and reputation Scope of services required Campaign duration Geographic focus Specialization in areas such as ICOs, DeFi, or NFTs Common pricing models include: Monthly retainers: Typically starting around $8,000–$15,000 per month, with higher-tier agencies charging significantly more depending on scope and media targets. Project-based fees: One-off campaigns or launches may range from a few thousand dollars to higher five-figure budgets. Hourly consulting: Less common, usually reserved for strategy or advisory work. While crypto PR can represent a meaningful investment, experienced agencies bring industry knowledge, media relationships, and risk management expertise that can significantly impact a project’s visibility, credibility, and long-term success. Conclusion Choosing the right crypto PR agency depends on a project’s goals, stage of growth, and visibility priorities. While all three agencies reviewed offer valuable services, their approaches differ significantly. Outset PR stands out for its data-driven methodology, focus on AI and search visibility, and long-term media performance optimization. TokenMinds is a strong option for teams seeking a full-stack Web3 marketing partner that blends PR with community and content strategies. NinjaPromo offers a flexible, subscription-based model suited to projects that want integrated marketing and PR support under one roof. As competition in the crypto space intensifies, strategic PR is no longer optional. Working with an agency that understands both media dynamics and modern discovery channels can play a decisive role in building credibility, visibility, and sustainable growth.

Market conditions change quickly, expenses are not always predictable, and selling assets is often the least efficient option. A crypto credit line offers an alternative: access to euros when needed, secured by crypto, without exiting positions. Clapp.finance approaches this use case with a structure designed for immediate access rather than scheduled borrowing. This article explains how instant crypto credit lines work in Europe and how Clapp enables same-day access. What an instant crypto credit line actually means An instant crypto credit line separates availability from usage. Collateral secures a borrowing limit, but funds are drawn only when required. There is no need to initiate a new loan each time liquidity is needed. Instant access means: the credit line becomes active as soon as collateral is deposited funds can be drawn without approvals or waiting periods repaid amounts immediately restore available credit This model differs from fixed crypto loans, where funds are issued once and interest applies from day one. Clapp’s approach to instant access Clapp operates a revolving crypto credit line secured by digital assets. Once collateral is deposited, the credit line becomes available immediately. Users can draw euros at any time through the Clapp Wallet. Interest accrues only on the amount actually borrowed. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. There is no fixed repayment schedule, and users can repay partially or in full whenever they choose. This structure allows users to keep liquidity available without cost until it is needed. Multi-collateral setup for flexible borrowing Clapp supports multi-collateral credit lines. Users can combine up to 19 assets into a single borrowing position, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and major stablecoins. Collateral composition can be adjusted without closing the credit line. This allows users to manage exposure dynamically rather than locking into a static structure. For diversified portfolios, this reduces the need to manage multiple loans or rebalance manually across platforms. Step-by-step: accessing an instant credit line with Clapp The process is designed to minimize friction: Create an account and complete onboarding Deposit supported crypto assets into Clapp Wallet A credit limit is assigned based on collateral value Draw EUR instantly from the available credit line Repay at any time to restore available credit There are no draw schedules, loan issuance delays, or mandatory lockups. Regulatory footing Clapp operates under a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license issued in the Czech Republic. This confirms its status as a licensed crypto lending provider within the EU. While licensing does not remove market risk, it provides clarity around jurisdiction and regulatory alignment for European users. Risk management considerations Instant access does not remove risk. Liquidation risk remains tied to collateral value and utilization levels. Higher usage increases exposure to market volatility. Maintaining conservative loan-to-value levels and monitoring collateral health remain essential. Because Clapp restores credit immediately upon repayment, users retain control over risk reduction without structural friction. Final take Access to liquidity matters most when timing is uncertain. Clapp’s instant crypto credit line treats borrowing as an on-demand resource rather than a commitment. By combining immediate availability, usage-based interest, and multi-collateral flexibility, it provides a practical framework for European users who want EUR access without locking themselves into rigid loan structures.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.33 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $3.79. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3171 Market cap $316.72M Trading volume $57.75M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.3205 24-hour low $0.3117 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.81% (High) 50-day SMA $0.4025 14-Day RSI 37.95 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.6004 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF remains below key daily resistance, maintaining a bearish trend. Short-term consolidation signals exhaustion, not reversal. A move above $0.33 favors relief to the upside. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As seen on the 1-day price chart for December 28, WIF is trading around $0.318 after a prolonged downtrend from the $0.38–$0.40 region, with price firmly below the mid Bollinger Band near $0.356, keeping the daily structure bearish. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The lower band at $0.286 defines critical downside risk if support fails, while repeated small-bodied candles suggest selling pressure is weakening rather than accelerating. The RSI is stuck near 40, reflecting persistent bearish momentum without oversold relief, and the MACD remains negative, with only marginal histogram improvement, implying that downside momentum is slowing but still dominant. A daily close above $0.34 would be the first meaningful signal of trend stabilization. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, WIF is consolidating tightly between $0.315 and $0.320, with price trapped inside compressed moving averages around $0.317. This sideways structure reflects balance rather than strength, as the Balance of Power sits neutral and the MACD barely holds above zero, indicating a lack of conviction from both sides. Resistance remains layered at $0.325–$0.33, while a clean breakdown below $0.31 would likely accelerate a move toward the $0.30 psychological level. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4866 SELL SMA 5 $0.4272 SELL SMA 10 $0.4004 SELL SMA 21 $0.4024 SELL SMA 50 $0.4025 SELL SMA 100 $0.5179 SELL SMA 200 $0.6004 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3676 SELL EMA 5 $0.4019 SELL EMA 10 $0.4921 SELL EMA 21 $0.6227 SELL EMA 50 $0.7654 SELL EMA 100 $0.8314 SELL EMA 200 $0.9542 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is in a volatility squeeze after sustained downside, and while downside momentum is fading, bulls still lack confirmation. Traders can expect a sharp move once $0.31 or $0.33 decisively breaks. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $1 by the end of 2025 and between $3.4 and $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

On the first day, users were offered $500,000 worth of Dogecoin, a bunch of flashy physical prizes, and a five-minute window to grab it all. Though that window turned into a disaster for some, specifically those who showed up early, phones ready, but the Robinhood app crashed or froze. Robinhood $HOOD just announced their prizes for HOOD Holidays Day 2: – 5 people will win a trip to Hawaii for 2 – 1000 people will win Away suitcases – Everyone else will split $750K of Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/eMqvGcvgMg — WOLF (@WOLF_Financial) December 28, 2025 Some reportedly got stuck on a blank screen, while others were told they “missed the rewards” even though they were already in. And this happened during the one moment users were supposed to claim their prizes, according to multiple posts on X by users. Along with DOGE , Robinhood added luxury items to the mix. People could also win Rolex watches and Apple AirPods, turning what was supposed to be a crypto giveaway into a flex-off. Robinhood stock performance in 2025 has thrown Wall Street off a bit Away from the giveaways, Robinhood’s stock (HOOD) isn’t feeling festive. It closed at $118.13, down 1.92% from the previous day. That drop was worse than the S&P 500’s dip of just 0.03%. The Dow fell by 0.04%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.09%. Robinhood lost more ground than all of them. Over the past month, HOOD has dropped 6.05%, even as the finance sector gained 4.37% and the S&P 500 rose 2.57%. But earnings are coming up. Robinhood is expected to report Q4 2025 EPS of $0.57, which would be 5.56% higher than the same quarter last year. Revenue estimates sit at $1.29 billion, up 27.08% year-over-year. Still, some analysts remain optimistic. Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank still has a buy rating, and just bumped the target price from $150 to $160. TipRanks says Bedell has a 61.8% success rate and an average return of 19.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, financial analyst Carter Worth thinks Robinhood is in a “bullish-to-bearish” reversal, and could drop to around $100. Carter points out its weak performance compared to the S&P 500, and warns that the uptrend since April’s low is breaking. HOOD hit $29.66 back in April, then exploded to $153.86 in October, a 419% rally in just six months.

The real challenge is not borrowing itself, but controlling risk once market volatility enters the picture. In most cases, liquidation is triggered not by high interest rates, but by excessive leverage. This is where low Loan-to-Value (LTV) borrowing becomes relevant. Why LTV Matters More Than the Loan Size LTV measures how much you borrow relative to the value of your collateral. A low LTV means your loan is supported by a large buffer of collateral. A high LTV means that even a modest price drop can push the position toward liquidation. In crypto markets, price swings are structural. Sudden drawdowns compress collateral value quickly, raising LTV without any action from the borrower. Starting from a low LTV creates distance from liquidation thresholds and gives borrowers time to respond rather than react. Low LTV does not eliminate risk, but it dramatically reduces how often risk becomes urgent. Clapp’s Credit-Line Structure and Low LTV Clapp does not issue fixed-term loans. Instead, it offers a revolving crypto credit line where users lock crypto as collateral and receive a borrowing limit. Interest accrues only on the amount actually withdrawn. Unused credit carries 0% APR and does not increase LTV exposure. This structure makes low-LTV borrowing practical rather than restrictive. Users can keep liquidity available without paying for leverage they are not using. Because LTV is calculated in real time based on the drawn balance and current collateral value, borrowers always see how risk evolves as markets move. LTV-Based Pricing Encourages Conservative Borrowing On Clapp , interest rates depend on LTV. Lower LTV positions carry lower borrowing costs, while higher LTVs are priced higher to reflect increased risk. This pricing model reinforces safety-first behavior. Borrowers are not incentivized to maximize leverage, because doing so immediately increases cost. Maintaining a conservative LTV improves both stability and efficiency. Over time, this alignment between risk and pricing matters more than headline APRs. Managing Risk Without Rigid Loan Terms Low-LTV borrowing works best when positions can be adjusted easily. Clapp’s credit-line model allows users to repay part of the balance at any time, instantly restoring available credit. There are no fixed repayment schedules and no need to close and reopen loans to manage exposure. If market conditions change, borrowers can respond by reducing LTV incrementally rather than making all-or-nothing decisions. Clapp also supports multi-collateral credit lines, allowing up to 19 assets—such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins—to secure a single line. This can help smooth volatility and reduce the impact of sharp moves in a single asset. Risk Management and Monitoring Risk management does not end at loan origination. On Clapp, LTV is monitored continuously, and users receive advance notifications as their position approaches higher-risk levels. These alerts are meant to prompt early action, not last-minute intervention. Adding collateral or partially repaying the balance at this stage restores safety margins before liquidation becomes a threat. Final Thoughts Crypto lending becomes dangerous when leverage is treated as a default rather than a choice. Low-LTV borrowing flips that assumption. Clapp’s model supports this approach by separating access to liquidity from interest accrual, pricing risk transparently through LTV, and allowing positions to be adjusted without friction. The result is a borrowing framework designed for control rather than optimization. FAQ What does low LTV mean in crypto lending?Low LTV means borrowing a smaller amount relative to the value of your crypto collateral. This creates a wider buffer against price volatility and reduces liquidation risk. Why is low LTV safer for crypto loans?Because crypto prices can move sharply. A low LTV gives borrowers time and flexibility to react to market changes instead of facing immediate liquidation. How does Clapp support low-LTV borrowing?Clapp uses a credit-line model where interest accrues only on the amount withdrawn. Rates depend on LTV, and unused credit carries 0% APR, making conservative borrowing more efficient. Is there a fixed repayment schedule on Clapp?No. Borrowers can repay or draw funds at any time. Partial repayments immediately restore available credit without closing the position. Can I use multiple assets as collateral?Yes. Clapp allows up to 19 assets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins, to be combined into a single credit line. What happens if my LTV increases due to market moves?Clapp monitors LTV in real time and sends advance notifications before liquidation thresholds are reached, giving users time to add collateral or repay part of the balance. Who is low-LTV borrowing best suited for?Low LTV suits long-term crypto holders, users seeking fiat liquidity without selling assets, and anyone prioritizing stability over maximum leverage.

In a Sunday X post, he noted that gold and silver do not need to slow down for Bitcoin to perform well, and added that those who think otherwise may not fully understand these assets. Recent analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s value relative to gold could decline by as much as 50%. BTC currently trades at around 20 times the value of gold. However, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, believes it’s more probable for it to fall to 10 times the value of gold than rise to 30 times by 2026. He believes the token’s value compared to gold might be cut in half, even if its price in USD appears steady. Lyn Alden does not see Bitcoin and gold as market competitors Similar to James Check’s perspective , Macro strategist Lyn Alden said on a podcast that while many pit BTC against gold, she doesn’t share that view. She pointed out that the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has surged recently because BTC saw a relatively flat performance, while gold has had one of its best years. She insisted that both assets have strong long-term foundations, driving their value, and hinted that the two will continue to thrive. McGlone, however, has issued a warning indicating a lower Bitcoin-to-gold ratio at the end of 2025, a trend often linked to an economic downturn. He expects Bitcoin to drop to as low as $50,000 in 2026, a prediction also shared by veteran trader Peter Brandt. But Brandt earlier predicted that the token may fall to $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026 According to Trading Economics, on Friday, gold climbed to $4,533 and silver surpassed $77, hitting new all-time highs. However, BTC has declined by almost 30% from its all-time high of $125,100 on October 5, with its price currently at $87,613. Nonetheless, on Friday, Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, said he expects BTC to rise in tandem with gold. P eter Grant, VP and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals, also told reporters that the current market volatility in thin markets is being fueled by concerns over a potential Fed easing in 2026, the weakening of the dollar, and geopolitical uncertainty. Some bitcoiners believe BTC will post steady gains for the next decade From late 2022 through late 2024, the prices of gold and Bitcoin moved similarly, leading analysts to expect the trend to continue. So far this year, the correlation has waned, with gold rising 60% and BTC falling 7.2%. Moreover, the two markets are seeing very different sentiments. Saturday’s readings: Gold Fear & Greed Index was at 79 (“Greed”) while Crypto Fear & Greed Index was at 24 (“Extreme Fear”). Still, several BTC executives are optimistic that prices will recover in 2026. For instance, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise , stated on Friday that Bitcoin is expected to improve significantly next year and potentially achieve more stable returns over the next decade. Similarly, Jan3’s Samson Mow also thinks a ten-year bull run may be underway. Sebastian Beau, chief investment officer at ReserveOne, also noted that the fate of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is still uncertain. He described the sharp decline from October’s $125,000 high to roughly $87,000 as particularly painful. However, investors remain divided on whether the cycle is over, as Bitcoin’s October peak aligns with the peaks of the previous four-year cycles, suggesting that 2026 could be weaker.

Key Takeaways: Google search interest for “crypto” has fallen to a one-year low in the US, signaling weak retail engagement. Market crashes, memecoin losses and policy shocks have eroded investor confidence. Bitcoin’s prolonged consolidation has failed to draw retail traders back. Worldwide searches for the term “crypto” are hovering just above a one-year low, while search volume in the United States has already fallen to its weakest level in the past 12 months, suggesting muted investor sentiment across key markets. Google Trends data, which measures search interest on a scale from 0 to 100, shows global searches for “crypto” slipping to 26 on Monday, only two points above the yearly low of 24. US Crypto Search Interest Hits 1-Year Low as Retail Pulls Back In the US, search volume dropped to 26, marking a full one-year low. The decline reflects a broader pullback in retail engagement following months of market turbulence and fading enthusiasm for speculative trades. Search interest fell sharply during the April market sell-off triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policy, and has struggled to recover since. Commenting on the trend, crypto commentator Mario Nawfal said retail participation has all but disappeared. “There is close to no retail interest in crypto right now,” he said, adding that public trust was damaged by the collapse of high-profile memecoins linked to the Trump family, many of which have lost more than 90% of their value from peak levels. Nawfal noted that casual investors who once asked about crypto regularly have gone quiet, underscoring how deeply sentiment has shifted. The pullback in search activity mirrors broader market psychology, which remains fragile months after a violent downturn in October. There is close to no retail interest in crypto right now Do we need to start pumping the dino coins again to get retail to come back? After the Trump/Melania memecoin drama it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space None of my normie friends or family ask me… pic.twitter.com/ZNnOwT4FKe — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) December 27, 2025 That flash crash wiped out nearly $20 billion in leveraged positions in a single day, with some altcoins plunging as much as 99%. Bitcoin also suffered a steep reversal, falling from an all-time high above $125,000 to roughly $80,000 by November. Since then, the asset has traded in a narrow range between $80,000 and $90,000, offering few catalysts to reignite retail excitement. Crypto Fear Index Lingers in Fear Territory After November Low Other sentiment indicators paint a similar picture. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped to a yearly low of 10 in November, signaling “extreme fear” among investors. While the index has since recovered slightly to 28, it remains firmly in fear territory, suggesting caution still dominates market behavior. In October, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine chair Tom Lee suggested Bitcoin could still climb to $250,000 before year-end. Instead, Bitcoin is down about 3% over the past 30 days, with sentiment deteriorating through December. Last week, K33 also said Bitcoin’s prolonged sell-side pressure from long-term holders may be approaching its limits after years of steady distribution.

After multiple failed “super cycle” calls by other market enthusiasts, the anonymous market expert argues that Bitcoin’s defining breakout has yet to begin, highlighting a key market condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Face Prolonged Pain As Key Metric Stays Red Metal Market Downtrend, Bitcoin Supertrend According to KillaXBT in an X post on December 27, the real super cycle will only emerge when capital decisively rotates away from precious metals and into Bitcoin, marking a generational shift rather than a typical crypto rally. Unlike past “premature” super-cycle narratives, driven more by optimism, the analyst references a budding price structure similarity that indicates a massive Bitcoin price rally ahead. Notably, interest in precious metals is soaring after gold and silver recently reached new ATH prices of $4,500 and $77, respectively. Similar to most analysts, KillaXBT anticipates these precious metals will eventually slip into a multi-year downtrend that will force investors to explore other havens against inflation. In particular, the analyst expects older generations to remain anchored in gold, while a new cohort of capital increasingly chooses Bitcoin as its preferred store of value. As metals underperform, a scarce Bitcoin is tipped to record an unprecedented demand. The analyst draws a historical parallel between gold in early 1972 and Bitcoin’s current position heading into 2027. In this period, Gold entered a powerful multi-year run as capital sought protection from inflation and currency debasement. KillaXBT argues Bitcoin is approaching a similar inflection point and is set to outperform every major asset class in the next cycle. Interestingly, gold, long considered the ultimate store of value, is currently valued at an estimated $31.7 trillion in market cap value. Bitcoin, by contrast, sits near $1.83 trillion. KillaXBT explains that even at a Bitcoin price of $200,000, the network’s market cap would rise to roughly $5 trillion, still about six times smaller than gold, highlighting how early Bitcoin remains in the global asset hierarchy. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Slide Deeper Into Losses – What The Drop Below $3,000 Means This Is The Last Sub $100,000 Bear Market – Analyst In concluding notes, KillaXBT states that skepticism has accompanied every major Bitcoin rally, consistently peaking just before large upside moves. In past cycles, critics pointed to regulation, environmental concerns, and volatility risks. Today, the fear narrative has shifted to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The analyst suggests that these concerns may once again pressure investors out of the market prematurely. However, KillaXBT is taking a bullish stance as they believe the current phase could represent the final prolonged bear market in which Bitcoin trades below $100,000. However, they warn that investors should expect the supercycle boom in 2027, as 2026 is likely to be a bearish period.

Burry just put money down that shares of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies are going to tank. The two companies have helped push stock markets to new highs this year and are worth about $5 trillion together. But Burry, who’s mostly kept quiet for the past decade, says there’s a bubble here that’s going to pop. The catch? He doesn’t know when. The problem with timing “Michael, if he had one failing in the dot-com cycle, it was being early to the process. The housing bubble? It was being early to the process,” said Michael Green, a former hedge-fund manager who’s now chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. Green has warned against popular investment trends too, especially passive investing. “This is a significant issue, right? How quickly does this end?” After his housing market win, Burry picked up a serious online following. Fans dissect his posts on places like Reddit’s Burryology forum. Things are heating up for Burry now. Last month, he closed his hedge fund. Then he launched a newsletter where he said he’d share his big idea with investors—why AI stocks are going to deflate. Cassandra Unchained became one of the top-selling finance newsletters on Substack fast, pulling in some 171,000 subscribers. They’re paying $379 a year, which is actually pretty cheap compared to some competitors who charge more than $1,000 yearly. Burry ‘s pitch played into fears about AI companies investing in each other and real questions about data center limits. His main point isn’t that AI is bad, just that the market has gotten disconnected from reality. “This bubble looks an awful lot like the dot-com bubble,” he said on a podcast hosted by Michael Lewis, whose book first made Burry famous. “Which was not really a dot-com bubble. It was a data-transmission bubble.” Burry didn’t respond when asked for comment, but mentioned on Lewis’s show that he usually turns down reporters. Mixed track record fuels skepticism So far, his warnings haven’t done much to the stocks, though there’s been more talk about AI infrastructure concerns. Burry gets dismissed plenty on social media, where people crack jokes that he predicted 20 of the last two recessions. A lot of his big market crash predictions have been wrong over the past 15 years. In a Jan. 31, 2023, post he told his followers to “SELL.” Silicon Valley Bank went under two months later, but the S&P 500 index has gone up around 70% since then. He’s admitted that was the wrong call. Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive, called Burry “bats— crazy” on CNBC. On Nov. 3, Burry showed his hand against Nvidia, the chip maker that’s now the world’s most valuable company, and Palantir , a major AI software business. Together they’re worth about $5 trillion. His bets were pretty small, around $10 million in put options, but could turn into more than $1 billion if those stocks drop hard. “Palantir and Nvidia are the two luckiest companies on the planet,” he told Lewis. Why he’s betting against Palantir Burry said he’s shorting them for different reasons, though they’re connected. Palantir depends too much on stingy government contracts and gives too much to its executives, he said. He pointed to tough competition too, especially from International Business Machines. His bet pays if Palantir drops to $50 a share in 2027 from the roughly $200 it’s been trading around. Karp said on CNBC that he thinks Burry was trying to manipulate the market and shot down Burry’s take. Nvidia’s problems have to do with its customers, like Oracle and Meta Platforms, where Burry said he sees a bunch of issues. Nvidia has been helping fund some of their purchases in deals that, Burry said , look like how companies like Enron financially propped up its vendors buying its products. Burry’s also looked at the accounting at these companies and Nvidia about how long the chips last, saying this helps companies pump up their earnings. If the bubble bursts, there could be a domino effect of lower stated profits, falling share prices, and less investment that would hurt Nvidia’s future sales. Burry’s bet pays if Nvidia falls about 37%, to $110, by 2027. It’s around $190 now. Companies push back hard Nvidia has pushed back on Burry’s claims. “Nvidia does not resemble historical accounting frauds because Nvidia’s underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is complete and transparent, and we care about our reputation for integrity,” the company said in a memo that Barron’s reported on earlier. Nvidia and Palantir shares have fallen since Nov. 3, but the drops have been choppy. Right now, that might actually be helping investors who think there’s no end in sight. “I would actually argue that awareness of this has encouraged people to defect and basically become more convinced that stocks can go to unlimited levels,” Green, the chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said.

Recent reports suggest that the company is already in late-stage talks to go public in 2026 . Public listings are not casual moves, as they come with scrutiny, disclosure, and regulatory exposure. For firms deeply tied to financial infrastructure, that step usually signals preparation, not experimentation. That view was laid out clearly by crypto commentator Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle) in a recent video discussing XRP and the company’s direction. This Changes Everything for #XRP !!! pic.twitter.com/s9f3RLDWDn — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 26, 2025 Is Ripple Considering an IPO? Ripple Bull Winkle challenged a common perception that Ripple operates like a typical private crypto company. He argued that late-stage IPO discussions do not happen unless leadership sees favorable conditions ahead. As he put it, “Private firms usually stay private as long as possible.” An IPO brings regulatory oversight and constant attention from Wall Street. Companies avoid that unless they believe the environment supports growth. According to Ripple Bull Winkle, the fact that Ripple may be exploring an IPO now suggests confidence in regulation, infrastructure, and demand for its XRP-powered services. He stressed that “the timing isn’t random.” In his view, these conversations start long before expansion. That distinction is important for market participants interested in XRP’s future. Confidence Signals for XRP Ripple Bull Winkle sees the IPO discussion as a signal of maturity. He said it shows confidence that Ripple’s business model can operate under public market expectations. That includes compliance, transparency, and long-term scalability. Experts believe Ripple’s IPO can directly influence XRP’s price . Ripple Bull Winkle noted that once a company enters public markets, it undergoes formal valuation. That process forces institutions to assign clear value to the business and its associated network. He argued that when that happens, the underlying asset tied to that ecosystem gets revalued. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Investors Are Watching Now Ripple Bull Winkle made it clear that this phase does not revolve around charts alone. He said people paying attention “aren’t watching charts.” They are watching positioning. That includes how institutions prepare for regulatory clarity and public market exposure. The expectation he outlined was not immediate price movement. IPO discussions signal that Ripple believes the groundwork is close to complete. If true, that belief could shape how long-term capital views XRP . He closed by encouraging viewers tracking early developments to stay informed as the story evolves and we get closer to 2026.

Moving beyond the era of ‘Labor Income,’ where one had to work to earn money, the era of ‘Lifestyle Income’ where the act of enjoying life itself becomes wealth, has arrived. At the center of this massive shift is WonderChain. While existing blockchains were merely cold numbers on a monitor, WonderChain has entered the ‘real world’ where your heart beats. There is one single reason why the global community of 200,000 people and global VCs are enthusiastic about WonderChain right now. It is the most definite ‘Real Economy’ “Earning Money While Participating?”… The Web3.5 Ecosystem That Turned Imagination into Reality WonderChain is the world’s first project to implement the ‘Social Capital’ theory of renowned scholar Professor Robert Putnam into blockchain. However, what is more powerful than theory is the ‘tangible economy.’ True Value in Lifestyle : Within the WonderChain ecosystem, your shopping, travel, gourmet exploration, and cultural life do not end as simple participation. All this activity data is converted into value and rewarded in $WDC. Circular Economy : The rewarded $WDC is immediately used like cash within the ecosystem for shopping, hotel reservations, and airline ticket purchases. This suggests that WonderChain is a powerful alternative that perfectly solves the long-standing task of blockchain: “Mine in the virtual, spend in the real.” 3rd Massive Airdrop: “Those Who Enter Now Secure the Future” The successfully concluded 2nd airdrop was merely a prelude. Now, the eyes of all global users and holders are turned toward the upcoming ‘3rd Massive Airdrop.’ The community is already pouring out heated expectations, calling t his 3rd airdrop an “unprecedented opportunity and a moment that must never be missed.” Why Now? : This 3rd airdrop is not a simple free distribution. It is akin to distributing entrance tickets to become an ‘initial member’ of the massive real economy ecosystem built by WonderChain. Definite Reward for Contribution : Every act of participating in the community and contributing to the ecosystem is measured most fairly and transparently, returning as rewards. An industry insider predicted, “If Hyperliquid brought innovation to a specific financial sector, WonderChain aims for a fundamental civilizational transformation by turning the social value of all humanity into assets,” adding, “In terms of potential value and impact, it will surpass the success of Hyperliquid.” Why Top-Tier VCs and Exchanges Have Designated WonderChain as ‘Priority No. 1 for Listing’ The reason why Silicon Valley’s massive capital and top-tier exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Bitget are paying attention to WonderChain is cold and clear. ‘Real Data’ with Substance : WonderChain has 200,000 ‘real people’ who eat, travel, and enjoy shopping every day. ‘Living Assets’ Coveted by Exchanges : The tens of thousands of lively interactions created daily by these 200,000 people represent the guaranteed liquidity and sustainable fee model that exchanges crave most. Beyond a Cultural Phenomenon to an Economic Standard : If WonderChain dominated 1,007 global media outlets as a ‘cultural phenomenon’ in 2025, it is projected to establish itself as a ‘new standard’ of the global economy in 2026. Explosive Scalability : “Money gathers where people are.” The industry’s common view is that the current community of 200,000 will exceed 1 million in early 2026, expand to a digital empire of over 10 million and eventually 30 million within 2026, and that WonderChain will become the ‘core infrastructure’ supporting the real economy in 2026. Conclusion: Your Lifestyle, Now Put a ‘Price’ on It. According to WonderChain, “How much is your daily life worth?” They explain that while personal shopping, travel, and relationships have merely been ‘expenses’ or ‘memories’ until now, with WonderChain, every one of those moments becomes an ‘asset.’ It is projected that in 2026, a world will arrive where 10 million people worldwide travel and make payments through WonderChain. The choice of whether to remain a simple user or to participate in the ecosystem and become a master of this massive flow is ultimately up to the reader. WonderChain is waiting for everyone who wants to prove the value of their daily lives to join under the slogan, ‘Where Lifestyle Becomes Value.’ WonderChain Official Channels https://www.wonderchain.io This post “The Leader of 2026 is Set” WonderChain Opens the Era of the World’s First ‘Lifestyle Capital,’ Going Beyond Ethereum’s Scalability and Bitcoin’s Trust first appeared on BitcoinWorld .",Press Release|WonderChain,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-12-28 09:05:15

The company is reportedly in late-stage talks for a 2026 IPO, with multiple sources confirming active preparations that underscore a transformative moment for Ripple and the wider crypto-financial ecosystem. An IPO would be a turning point for Ripple. Going public brings stricter audits, enhanced disclosures, and continuous regulatory oversight, often seen as constraints, but ones that significantly boost credibility. Greater transparency and stronger governance can elevate institutional trust, making Ripple far more attractive to banks, payment providers, and large enterprises that typically require this level of accountability before deepening partnerships. This is where Ripple’s value proposition truly stands out. At its core is an XRP-powered payments network built for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Unlike many crypto projects driven largely by speculation, Ripple’s technology is already embedded in real-world financial systems. A public listing could further accelerate adoption, scale partnerships, and deepen institutional trust. If Ripple goes public, the ripple effects could be significant. Public-market transparency and governance would likely reassure banks and financial institutions, accelerating adoption of Ripple’s technology. As institutional use grows, payment volumes on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) would increase, driving real demand for XRP as a liquidity bridge. Well, this shift is crucial because when XRP is used for real-time cross-border settlements, its value becomes anchored in transaction utility and network flow rather than market hype. Over time, XRP’s narrative evolves from a volatile crypto asset to core financial infrastructure powering global payments. While the transition would be gradual, shaped by regulatory clarity and steady adoption, it could accelerate rapidly as network effects compound. As crypto-native firms like Ripple eye public listings, the divide between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure is rapidly narrowing. If Ripple’s rumored 2026 IPO comes to fruition, it could be a watershed moment, elevating not only the company, but also positioning XRP as a foundational asset in the future architecture of global finance. Conclusion Ripple’s late-stage 2026 IPO preparations could be a turning point for the company and the XRP ecosystem. A public listing would boost transparency, strengthen regulatory credibility, and attract wider institutional adoption, shifting XRP from speculative interest to real-world utility. As banks and payment providers increasingly integrate Ripple’s technology, XRP Ledger transaction volumes are set to rise, cementing XRP’s role as a core component of global payment infrastructure.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 09:11:54

This shows that individuals are fully aware of the utility provided through a two-way infrastructure for loaning. It should be noted that 1,850 wallets are involved, thus proving it’s more than just a gamble. Analysts of top cryptocurrencies who monitor DeFi developments have already named MUTM, also known as Mutuum Finance, one of the crypto to invest in before the end of the year since it has been deemed safe and its price won’t last long once Phase 7 is launched. The time to invest in Mutuum Finance at $0.035 is very short since afterwards its price will go high. Presale Structure Rewards Prompt Action Within this context, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized its fund-raising process to motivate proactive investors rather than those who only invest when market conditions suit them. Phase 6 is reportedly currently 99% full, with only below 1% tokens left at $0.035. When this phase is exhausted, Phase 7 will automatically start with a pricing plan of $0.04, which entails a 20% hike, thus making previous investors less attractive. Phase 1 participants who invested at $0.01 are already enjoying a 250% ROI and new investors will be able to enjoy a 420% ROI once MUTM exceeds its listing price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still remains one of the top crypto investments. This creates a supply-demand driving force for the token. Though regular tokens function on a speculation mechanism, there is a “buy-and-distribute” system on Mutuum Finance. This system creates market demand for MUTM regardless of market conditions. This system attracts a revenue-generating fee for each lending and borrowing process on the platform. From this revenue, MUTM is automatically purchased on open markets for distribution to mtToken liquidity providers. It solves a problem common among DeFi projects, where the success of the platform does not necessarily correlate to the price of the tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distributes benefits its token holders based on the increase in the number of loans, which in turn requires more buybacks of MUTM tokens. Yield-Generating Features The mtTokens earned from the deposits on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are interest-bearing tokens that signify a holder’s contribution to the lending pools. Such tokens earn interest automatically with the repayment of the same by the borrowers. Moreover, the mtTokens can be held in a wallet until the time of redeeming the initial amount and the interest incurred. Stablecoin Integration Addresses Volatility Concerns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced the imminent release of a stablecoin that shall be over-collateralized and anchored at a one-to-one price ratio to the value of the US dollar. Unlike the stablecoins that relied on algorithmic systems to manage the value and ultimately failed in the highly volatile market events of 2022, the stablecoin by Mutuum Finance shall be backed by the excess reserves provided by lending pools. The interest earned on the reserves shall be allocated to the treasury. This is anticipated to improve the position of Mutuum Finance in being one of the top crypto projects, since it will fill an essential demand within the DeFi market. Individuals will be in a position to take part in market positions without worrying about collateral value. It will be seamlessly integrated into both Peer-to-Contract lending markets and Peer-to-Peer lending markets. Time Limited for Optimization of Entries Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been able to raise $19.5 million funds and has been able to gain 18,590 supporters. Phase 6 is rapidly progressing, and the current price of $0.035 will no longer be available once Phase 7 is initiated. This is a good opportunity for investors for the crypto to invest in during a crucial marketplace state.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in September. In October, it rose above $30. It then reversed, and by December, it had dropped to $14.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIL|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-28 09:30:18

Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expects steady, lower-volatility Bitcoin gains over the next decade rather than explosive rallies. Hougan remains bullish on 2026, citing ongoing institutional buying despite recent price weakness. Some analysts warn Bitcoin could still face deeper downside if the cycle has peaked. Speaking on CNBC on Friday , Hougan described Bitcoin’s outlook as a prolonged upward trend marked by lower volatility and more measured returns. “I think we’re in a 10-year grind upward of strong returns,” he said. “It’s not spectacular returns, [but] strong returns, lower volatility, some up and down.” Bitwise CIO Sticks to Bullish 2026 Bitcoin Outlook Hougan reaffirmed his view that 2026 will be a positive year for Bitcoin, maintaining a forecast he first shared in July, months before the asset surged to a new all-time high of $125,100 in October. “I think next year will be up,” he said, despite growing debate over whether the current market cycle has already peaked. That debate intensified after Bitcoin pulled back sharply from its October highs. The asset is trading around $87,800 at the time of publication, down about 3.8% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. ReserveOne chief investment officer Sebastian Beau said the drop has revived questions about whether Bitcoin’s traditional four-year cycle remains intact. “All-time highs were 125,000… we are bordering on $87,000 today, down 30% relatively quickly,” Beau said, calling the move painful for investors. Some market participants note that the timing of Bitcoin’s October peak closely resembles past cycle tops, raising the possibility that 2026 could be a down year. Hougan acknowledged that retail behavior has played a role in the recent weakness, arguing that “fast-moving” retail investors rotated out late in the year in anticipation of a cycle-driven downturn. Still, Hougan believes Bitcoin’s downside has been cushioned by what he described as “persistent, slow-moving institutional buying.” Unlike previous cycles that saw drawdowns of 60% or more, Bitcoin’s current pullback has been comparatively shallow, a sign that long-term capital is providing support. Not all analysts share Hougan’s optimism. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has warned that Bitcoin could slide to $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026, highlighting ongoing risks tied to macro conditions and market structure. Bitwise CIO Sticks to Bullish 2026 Bitcoin Outlook Hougan also downplayed expectations that US politics will drive the next leg higher. While Bitcoin rallied to fresh highs earlier in 2025 following Donald Trump’s inauguration, Hougan said the administration is unlikely to unlock significant new upside. Looking ahead to 2026, the industry remains divided. Fidelity’s director of global macro research, Jurrien Timmer, has suggested 2026 could be a pause year, with prices potentially sliding toward $65,000. Others remain more optimistic. Strategy CEO Phong Le has argued that Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals held up throughout 2025 despite weaker prices, while Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier this year that he expects 2026 to be an “up year” for the asset. According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data.

While crypto prices often move on hype alone, long-term winners are usually built during quieter phases. That is exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently stands, positioning itself as a serious defi crypto contender while still being available at presale valuation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that will support both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. Its structure focuses on real usage rather than speculation, which is why many market observers are now projecting aggressive upside as adoption increases through 2026. Presale Drawing Attention Currently valued at $0.035, the MUTM token is making waves as it sails through its Phase 6 presale, showcasing a phenomenal 250% increase since its humble beginnings at $0.01. With a total supply capped at 4 billion, of which 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens are reserved for presale, Mutuum Finance is intricately designed for appreciation. This allocation ensures broad early participation while maintaining long-term ecosystem balance. What fuels urgency among investors is the staggered pricing structure that elevates prices by nearly 20% with each consecutive phase. This mechanism directly rewards early commitment and steadily raises the entry barrier as demand increases. How Lending Utility Will Drive 600% Demand and Revenue As part of its beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deploy V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. This testnet phase will allow users to interact early, provide feedback, and build confidence ahead of broader adoption. Deploying V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the protocol before the mainnet rollout. This phased release supports transparency, promotes hands-on user participation, and allows the team to refine the system based on real-world feedback. As engagement grows during the testnet phase, interest in the platform is expected to increase, helping reinforce long-term confidence and demand for the MUTM token. Mutuum Finance is being built around two lending models that will directly support usage-driven demand for MUTM. Every interaction within the protocol will require token engagement, reinforcing a circular economy that aligns users, liquidity, and long-term growth. In the peer-to-contract model, lenders will pool assets such as USDT and DAI alongside established cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access this liquidity by posting overcollateralized assets. Interest rates will dynamically adjust based on pool utilization, rising as demand increases and easing as liquidity expands. This mechanism will balance supply and borrowing efficiency without centralized intervention. For example, a lender supplying 10,000 USDT into a P2C pool will receive mtTokens representing their pool share and accrued interest. These mtTokens will also function as collateral, allowing the lender to borrow assets such as ETH without withdrawing their original position. At the same time, a borrower depositing $15,000 worth of ETH can borrow 9,000 USDT (depending on LTV ratio), maintaining a strong collateral buffer while accessing liquidity for trading or strategy execution. This structure rewards both sides through predictable yield and controlled risk. The peer-to-peer model will expand opportunities further by enabling lending for higher-risk or niche assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE). Instead of pooled liquidity, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates and durations that reflect asset volatility. For instance, a lender accepting DOGE as collateral can offer a short-term loan at a higher interest rate, capturing elevated returns while operating within clearly defined risk boundaries. This segmentation protects the core liquidity pools while unlocking yield avenues that traditional platforms often avoid. All loans across both models will rely on overcollateralization enforced by a Stability Factor. When collateral values decline beyond required thresholds, liquidation will activate automatically. Liquidators will repurchase outstanding debt at a discount, stabilizing the system and preventing bad debt from spreading across the protocol. Market volatility and liquidity management will play a critical role in sustaining protocol health. Adequate on-chain liquidity will ensure liquidations execute smoothly without excessive slippage. Loan-to-Value ratios will be calibrated based on asset risk, with lower-volatility assets like ETH and stablecoins sustaining higher LTVs, while volatile tokens operate within tighter parameters. Reserve factors will further protect the system, balancing security with participation incentives. In the final analysis, the current presale window is rapidly closing. Phase 6 is already 98% sold out, and the next phase will increase the token price by approximately 15%, moving MUTM from $0.035 to $0.040. For investors targeting 2026 exposure, this marks the final opportunity to secure entry at today’s discounted valuation.

56488529,649106,1766916026,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56488529.jpeg,Why Bitcoin Is Struggling Under Trump’s New Regime: Analyst,https://bitcoinist.com/behind-bitcoins-struggles-in-trumps-new-regime/,"Against widespread expectations, the second term of Donald Trump as the US President has yielded a positive effect on Bitcoin’s price. While the flagship cryptocurrency has recorded an all-time high since Trump’s inauguration in January, the market has mostly been in consolidation and range-bound phase, with the broader picture still taking on a bearish form. Crypto analysis page XWIN Research Japan recently offered a comparative analysis with the post-election euphoria seen in 2016, to explain why the post-2024 price action is without enthusiasm. Analyst Explains Why Bitcoin’s Structure Differs Sharply From 2016 In the Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, the research and education institution draws a critical comparison between the 2016 and 2024 post-election periods. Just after Trump’s victory in 2016, the crypto market operated within a low-inflation and low-interest-rate environment, one that is ideal for a market with growing liquidity. Also, the crypto market’s relatively small size allowed for quick accumulation of speculative liquidity. Hence, the market was able to get sufficient capital to serve as fuel for a prolonged, yet powerful, uptrend. However, early 2025 saw a different market environment and dynamic. The year began and extended into a high-rate period, where financial conditions increasingly became crippling. Also, the larger market size (compared to the post-2016 election market), alongside increased participation among several investors, has structurally reduced the stand-alone importance of political events on price movements. Simply put, policy implementations can barely move Bitcoin’s price alone, especially when encumbered by more liquidity constraints. LTH-SOPR Ratio Further Reflects Caution XWIN Research Japan also references data obtained from the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio (LTH-SOPR/STH-SOPR), which reinforces the cautious stance among investors following Trump’s second inauguration. The Bitcoin SOPR Ratio deciphers market sentiment by comparing whether long-term holders are realizing profits more aggressively than short-term holders, serving as an important indicator of whether a price trend is driven by institutional conviction or speculative trading. According to the research team, Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) are realizing their limited profits. Short-term holders, on the other hand, are trading within red territory. Historically, this condition is typically found when the market is about to embark on a prolonged journey of demand-supply adjustments. Based on historical data, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is currently within a fundamentally bearish structure. Although XWIN Research elucidates that “as long as long-term holders maintain relative dominance and short-term holder selling is absorbed, downside may be supported,” but this came with a caveat that upside leadership would likely also remain restricted. The analytics group further conjectures that a stable growth of Bitcoin ETF inflows, alongside a clear depreciation in LTH distribution, would be pivotal in rescuing BTC from its downward spiral. Until these happen simultaneously, bitcoin might remain in its current state of inertia, or — in the worst case — dive further south. At press time, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $87,623, recording a slight 0.5% loss since the past week, and a 0.6% ascent since the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin SOPR Ratio|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Donald Trump|XWIN Research Japan,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 10:00:26

In a recent post on X, he focused on how the XRP Ledger was built, arguing that its structure prioritizes security, scarcity, and reliability at scale. Rather than centering price action or market sentiment, his comments point to architecture as the deciding factor in XRP’s long-term role within global finance. The way this network was created will make $XRP the hardest currency that will ever exist. It's Necessary for network security, it has a fixed supply, and it's deflationary as a function and it has no counterparty risk. With these characteristics it will be designated as Tear 1… https://t.co/2tNDbnn678 — WhiteBeardedNinja (@WhiteBeardNinja) December 25, 2025 XRP’s Network Hardness WhiteBeardedNinja argues that the network’s design positions XRP differently from most digital assets. He describes XRP as potentially “the hardest currency that will ever exist.” The reasoning links directly to network security. XRP requires a small amount of the asset to create accounts and submit transactions. That design raises the cost of spam attacks and denial of service attempts. He also points to supply mechanics. XRP has a fixed supply, and no new tokens can be minted. Each transaction destroys a tiny amount of XRP. That function makes the asset deflationary by design . Over long periods, supply trends lower while usage can rise. Another core element is risk structure. WhiteBeardedNinja states that XRP carries “no counterparty risk.” Value transfer occurs directly on the ledger, and settlement does not depend on a third party fulfilling an obligation later. This design matters if the network reaches large-scale usage across financial institutions. He believes these traits will make XRP a tier 1 asset in the global economic system. Utility As The Primary Driver WhiteBeardedNinja’s post was a reply to SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher. SMQKE argued that XRP’s price is driven by utility, not hype, and attached a document to support his view. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP secures its network by requiring reserves and transaction fees. Those fees get destroyed. The cost remains low for normal users but rises for attackers attempting to flood the system. This mechanism supports stability while preserving speed. The document also outlines XRP’s role as a bridge asset . It facilitates value transfer between currencies without requiring pre-funded accounts. That function supports real-world payment flows rather than speculative loops. Both perspectives converge on one point. Design alone does not guarantee an outcome. WhiteBeardedNinja makes it clear that adoption determines everything, noting that the tier 1 status only follows if the network gains scale.

At least that’s what Coinbase Institutional is saying in their latest report. Colin Basco, an analyst, and David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, examined what is now driving the cryptocurrency markets. What did they learn? The period of the wild west is coming to an end. Retail traders and meme coin frenzy are giving way to professional trading infrastructure and institutional money. Derivatives markets run the show The key one is that trade activity on major exchanges is now dominated by perpetual futures. This fundamentally alters the way cryptocurrency prices fluctuate. In the past, it was straightforward: coins were purchased, and prices increased. Coins were sold, and prices decreased. Right now? Leverage, funding rates, and the liquidity of the derivatives market are crucial. Late 2025 saw massive liquidations that wiped out a ton of leverage in these markets. But Coinbase doesn’t see this as a bad thing. According to Duong and Basco, tighter margin requirements and better risk management are actually making markets healthier. When bad news hits, the crashes aren’t as brutal. And despite more regulation, derivatives still provide most of the liquidity traders need. Prediction markets go mainstream The second trend is that prediction markets are becoming real financial instruments rather than just places to bet on random objects. Both volume and liquidity are rapidly increasing. People use these marketplaces for knowledge gathering and risk reduction about unclear situations in addition to gaming. Right now, prediction markets are scattered across different platforms. For traders who can identify price disparities and take advantage of them, this opens up chances. There’s growing demand for tools that pull data from all these platforms in one place. Professional traders are becoming increasingly involved, and they are no longer limited to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This is especially true in regions where regulators are starting to provide clearer rules. Stablecoins move beyond trading Stablecoins and payments make up the third category . This is the point at which cryptocurrency becomes practical rather than just speculative. Stablecoin transactions are becoming more frequent, but this isn’t because traders are flipping them. Businesses utilize them for foreign payments, treasury management, and settlements. Important yet boring stuff. What’s interesting is how payments tie into everything else happening in crypto. DeFi protocols run on stablecoins. AI applications are starting to use them too. Coinbase pushes back on the idea that AI threatens crypto payments. They argue the opposite—AI needs the kind of programmable, 24/7 financial infrastructure that blockchains provide. Make or break year The ability of these three industries to continue expanding in the face of stricter regulations and increased professional scrutiny will be put to the test in 2026. For years to come, the answer will likely dictate how cryptocurrency develops. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The broader structure suggests the market is still in a corrective phase rather than transitioning into accumulation. XRP Price Analysis The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, XRP continues to trade within a well-defined descending channel that has been respected since the major breakdown earlier in the trend. The asset is currently hovering just above a key demand zone around the $1.80 area, which has acted as a buyer’s base during recent pullbacks. Despite this support holding for now, the overall structure remains weak, as XRP is still capped below the descending trendline and remains under both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The repeated failure to reclaim the former support-turned-resistance zone around $2.40 to $2.50 reinforces the bearish bias on the higher timeframe. Until XRP can decisively break above the descending structure and reclaim these dynamic resistance levels, any upside moves are likely to be corrective rather than trend-changing. As long as the price remains below the channel midline, the daily outlook favors continued consolidation or a gradual drift toward lower demand zones. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart provides more clarity on recent developments, showing XRP consolidating tightly after another rejection from the descending channel resistance. The price is currently compressing near the lower boundary of the channel, with sellers stepping in aggressively on minor rallies. This behavior indicates that bearish momentum, while slowing, has not yet been invalidated. The current price action suggests that buyers are defending the $1.80 region, but the lack of strong bullish displacement highlights weak follow-through demand. Without a clear break above the short-term descending trendline, XRP remains vulnerable to another downside expansion toward deeper demand levels. A confirmed breakout above the channel resistance would be required to shift the intraday bias and signal that sellers are losing control. Until then, the structure favors range-bound price action with downside risk still present.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $573.15, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,327.46 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that. Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $ 123.18 (+0.95%) Market Cap $69.30 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.56 Billion Circulating Supply 559.03 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $123.56 24-hour Low $121.86 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Neutral 50-Day SMA $135.96 200-Day SMA $174.06 Price Prediction $144.78 (17.77%) F & G Index 24.06 (fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 14-Day RSI 34.21 Solana price analysis: SOL falls below $125 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis confirmed a bearish sentiment as price falls below $125 The altcoin gained 0.94% of its value across last 24-hours. Support for SOL/USD is at $120. As of December 27, the Solana price analysis reveals a bearish market sentiment as the price falls below the $125 mark. SOL is now headed to the $120 mark where it finds short term support. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL holds above $120 The one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline is continuing with the drop below the $125 mark before the bulls found support, enabling recovery. However, after failing to climb past $140 the price was headed down below $125 but finds support at $120 that has enabled some recovery. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is narrow, leading to low volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $138.54 The indicator’s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $116.90. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the neutral area but leans close to the oversold level. The indicator’s value has increased to index 40.62, and its upwards curve suggests a support forming at the level. If selling activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows strong bearish activity at the current price level as bears continue to dictate the price action. The altcoin’s price has increased to $123 as bulls fight back. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $124.39, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $120.95, indicating support. The RSI indicator is in the oversold region. Currently at 49.59 the RSI curve is pointing down, confirming strong bearish pressure at the level. The curve on the indicator’s graph indicates resistance from the selling side of the market at the current price level. We can expect further decline if selling activities persist for a few more hours.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis suggests a mixed prediction based on ongoing market events for the day. The SOL/USD pair increased to $123 over the past 24 hours. If selling pressure continues, we might see the price fall below $120. On the other hand, if buyers return to control the price chart, we might see a price increase to retest the resistance level at $140. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for Solana’s growth and future growth. Why is SOL down? After failing to cross past the $140 mark, SOL declined rapidly to the $120 mark where it found support before climbing back to $123. However, the price still faces strong bearish pressure. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $113 with an average price of $126, driven by fundamental factors in the market. The price could reach a maximum of $178 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, which makes Solana an attractive investment. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark.

The meme coin has experienced notable activity in derivatives markets despite struggling to maintain upward momentum in recent trading sessions. Data from CoinGlass reveals substantial movement in SHIB futures contracts over the past day. The token recorded $6.71 million in futures outflows during this period. This figure represents approximately 933.89 billion SHIB tokens leaving futures markets. The outflow pattern indicates derivatives traders are taking buying positions. This activity occurs as Shiba Inu attempts to stage a recovery before the calendar flips to 2026. The token fell to $0.00000698 during the Christmas holiday period. Bulls tried to push prices higher but failed to establish a clear directional move. Price Action Reflects Cautious Market Sentiment Shiba Inu has settled into range-bound trading between $0.00000698 and $0.00000729. The token remains within this narrow band at the time of reporting. Current trading shows SHIB up 2.69% over 24 hours at $0.00000734. However, weekly performance paints a different picture with a 2.83% decline.

Most altcoins are in a similar situation, with little to no volatility from the larger caps. ZEC, DOT, UNI, CC, and NEAR have marked substantial gains from the mid caps. BTC Trades Sideways After a wild period that lasted for the past 10 days or so, BTC has expectedly calmed down during and after the Christmas holidays. In the past business week, it was rejected on a couple of occasions at $90,000, as the most violent one came after the US released the CPI numbers for November, which were much better than anticipated. Bitcoin quickly spiked to the $90,000 resistance, where it faced immediate selling pressure and plunged to a multi-week low of $84,400. The bulls finally intercepted the move after this decline and began a notable recovery that culminated on December 22 with a surge to $90,400. However, bitcoin’s inability to break through that level continued, and the asset dropped to $86,400 on Christmas Eve. It rebounded to $89,600 by Friday, where the bears resumed control and drove it to under $86,800 almost immediately. Since then, BTC has been rather calm in a tight range and now sits close to $88,000. Its market cap remains around $1,750 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins sits at 57.3%.

ETH is close to $2,950, XRP has defended the $1.85 level, BNB is back at $850, while SOL, TRX, DOGE, BCH, and LINK are up by 1-2%. ADA has emerged as the top gainer here, surging by 5% to $0.37. ZEC is up by over 5%, and so are UNI and NEAR. DOT and FIL have gained 8-9% each, while CC has skyrocketed by another 17%. As of press time, Canton’s token trades close to $0.12.

Separately, Bitwise’s Hougan claims that the four-year Bitcoin price cycle is less important now than it was in the past, and has been replaced by a ten-year grind. According to Hougan, significant new forces have emerged that threaten to render the four-year BTC price cycle obsolete since the launch of the ETF in 2024. Without going into much detail, he added that these forces were accelerated by the regulatory progress in January of this year, as well as the growth of tokenization and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Hougan noted that these forces were comparably bigger and stronger than the forces that drove the historical four-year BTC price cycle. However, he expects the BTC and crypto market in general to be up throughout the better part of next year. Hougan says 4-year BTC price cycle still matters in people’s minds Bitwise’s CIO , Matt Hougan, claimed that although the four-year Bitcoin price cycle is practically dead, the concept still resonates in people’s minds. He appears to believe that this is one of the primary reasons BTC prices have been suppressed this year. He also believes the new ten-year grind has been the reason behind Bitcoin’s lower volatility . On the other hand, ReserveOne’s Sebastian Bea also observed that humans are predictably irrational. He, therefore, believes it is still somewhat difficult to determine whether the four-year BTC price cycle is truly dead. However, Ryan Chow, the co-founder of Solv Protocol, explained that the traditional four-year trend is being replaced by more macro-correlated, liquidity-sensitive behavior. “It’s not officially over until we see positive returns in 2026. But I think we will, so let’s say this: I think the 4-year cycle is over.” – Matt Hougan , CIO at Bitwise Bea also noted that although the four-year BTC price cycle did not currently make sense, people could continue to react to the market based on this concept. He further noted that the severity of the upside or downside of these market reactions could differ from what typically occurs in a four-year BTC price cycle, as that trend may already have been phased out. Meanwhile, well-known crypto KOL Alex Wacy recently stated that the four-year cycle has not yet been broken. He emphasized that what has been broken is people’s expectations. He further noted that optimism has been replaced with plummeting altcoin prices, a lack of hype or altcoin season, and investors are only experiencing dullness and pain. DTCC to bring $99T of assets on-chain, possibly bringing a new cycle According to Bea, the announcement of DTCC plans to bring $99 trillion of assets on-chain could usher in a new BTC price cycle. He seems to believe that this massive capital injection could significantly tip the Bitcoin ownership distribution scale, as Chow appears to believe that the 70%-80% crashes will soon be a thing of the past. Data retrieved from River Financial shows that individuals hold the majority of Bitcoin, around 65.9% as of August 2025. Meanwhile, businesses (6.2%), ETFs & funds (7.8%), and governments (1.5%) hold smaller but growing shares. Satoshi still holds the highest BTC holdings at 968,000 BTC (~4.6% of the supply), while other entities account for approximately 1.4% of the supply (~287,000 BTC). Notably, 7.6% (~1.58 million BTC) of the BTC supply is lost, and approximately 5.2% (~1.09 million BTC) remains to be mined. Among the well-known individual Bitcoin billionaires are the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, who currently hold an estimated 70,000 BTC. The duo reportedly bought $11 million worth of BTC at an average price of $10 per BTC. VC titan Tim Draper is also another individual with massive BTC holdings. Despite losing 40,000 BTC initially purchased at the Mt. Gox exchange due to hacking, Draper bought 29,656 BTC in 2014 for $18.7 million, at an average of $632 per BTC.

The multi-chain self-custody platform confirmed that a specific browser extension version contained critical vulnerabilities, resulting in $7 million in user losses. Susbarium Shibarium Trustwatch, a dedicated watchdog account protecting the Shiba Inu community from scams and security threats, issued an urgent warning to all users. The alert targets users of Trust Wallet's web browser extension, specifically version 2.68. Critical Extension Vulnerability Identified Trust Wallet extension v2.68 contains a serious security flaw that puts user funds at risk. The vulnerability affects only this specific version of the Chrome browser extension. Users must disable the compromised version immediately and install the updated v2.69 release from the official Chrome Web Store. Mobile app users are not at risk from this breach. Other browser extensions remain secure and functional. The problem exists solely within the v2.68 web extension for Chrome users. Susbarium emphasized the urgency of this update in its community alert. The organization has established itself as a reliable source for security information within the Shiba Inu space. Earlier in December, Susbarium warned community members about fraudulent actors impersonating moderators and technical leads. These scammers operated on Discord and Telegram, sending fake notifications about wallet bugs to lure victims toward malicious websites. Financial Impact and Compensation Plans Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao publicly confirmed the extent of the damage. The breach resulted in exactly $7 million in losses across affected accounts. Trust Wallet corroborated this figure through its official channels. The wallet provider announced plans to reimburse all victims of the security incident. Trust Wallet stated it is working through the final stages of the refund process. Affected users will receive direct communication regarding progress and updates throughout the compensation timeline.

Volatility remains present, but longer-term structure is starting to dominate short-term noise. EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent analyst, shared a long-term view of the asset using a Gaussian Channel on the weekly chart. His analysis is based on where the price sits within that channel and what typically follows when XRP behaves this way. #XRP – Gaussian Channel Playbook (Simple View): When you zoom out, the chart is doing something we’ve seen before. Price is riding the upper side of the Gaussian channel, not breaking below it , that’s constructive. Historically, this phase leads to expansion, not collapse.… pic.twitter.com/cGNzRuTAfB — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 26, 2025 Gaussian Channel Context According to EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP is riding the upper side of the Gaussian channel without losing it. He described this behavior as constructive. In prior cycles, this zone preceded expansion phases. The Gaussian channel measures trend strength and direction over time. When the price holds above the midline and respects the upper band, it signals sustained bullish control. XRP has followed that pattern before major upside moves in past cycles, as shown on the chart. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasized that zooming out matters. The structure only becomes clear on higher timeframes . Short-term dips matter less if the channel remains intact. Growth Scenarios for XRP The analyst laid out two primary paths for XRP from here. In the first, the asset’s price bounces directly from the top of the Gaussian channel. That outcome assumes momentum holds and XRP continues higher without offering a deep pullback. He noted this scenario does not give traders a “perfect dip.” The second path involves a controlled reset. XRP could retest the yellow horizontal level shown on the chart. That line marks former resistance. A successful retest would turn it into support and clear the way for continuation. EGRAG CRYPTO described this as a healthy move rather than a breakdown. He also acknowledged a lower-probability outcome. If support fails, XRP could enter deeper consolidation before the trend resumes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Probability and Timing EGRAG CRYPTO assigned probabilities to each scenario. He put a 45% chance on a direct bounce from the Gaussian top. He gave a 40% chance of a pullback to the yellow level, followed by continuation. He assigned only 15% to deeper consolidation. He summed up the setup by stating that “trend bias remains UP.” He added that timing, not direction, is the real challenge. His message is based on patience during consolidation rather than panic during volatility. For investors watching XRP’s next phase, the key level is below the price. Holding support matters more than chasing breakouts. If history repeats , rapid expansion could follow. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The platform announced the breach in a post, noting that malicious code was embedded in version 2.68 of the software. The wallet provider urged users to disable the malicious version and move to version 2.69. The official statement also coincided with an update from on-chain researcher ZachXBT, who identified more than $6 million in stolen funds. ZachXBT claimed that hundreds of wallets, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana, were affected by the exploit. He noted that he was unsure if the exploit had compromised private keys themselves, but urged users to generate new wallets. While some users lost small amounts of BTC, the hacker was able to steal thousands of dollars from other users. Trust Wallet launches compensation package for its users In its statement, Trust Wallet mentioned that affected users can now submit claims through an official support form hosted on its portal. The process requires victims of the hack to provide their email address, compromised wallet addresses, country of residence, the hacker’s receiving addresses, and relevant transaction details. Trust Wallet has also promised to compensate every user affected by the mishap. “We are working around the clock to finalize the compensation process details, and each case requires careful verification to ensure accuracy and security,” Trust Wallet wrote on X. The wallet provider confirmed that approximately $7 million in digital assets were siphoned from different wallets across multiple blockchains. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, more than $4 million in stolen funds have been moved through centralized exchanges like ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, and KuCoin. The blockchain security firm highlighted that the hacker still holds more than $2.8 million in his wallets as of the last update. Changpeng Zhao, the co-founder and former CEO of Binance, which acquired Trust Wallet in 2018, confirmed on X that the company will cover all the affected losses. “So far, $7m affected by this hack. TrustWallet will cover,” Zhao wrote on X, assuring the public that user funds “are SAFU.” Speaking about the exploit, Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen noted that users who logged into the extension before December 26 at 11 AM UTC were potentially affected. Chen mentioned that during its investigation, the company discovered that a leaked Chrome Web Store API key was used to publish a compromised extension on December 24 at 12:32 PM UTC, bypassing the company’s internal release process. Hackers targeted users’ wallet seed phrases The malicious code was identified by SlowMist , with the blockchain security firm noting that it was designed to harvest wallet seed phrases using a modified open-source analytics library. Mobile application users and those running other versions of the browser extension were not affected by the incident. Trust Wallet’s Chrome extension has about one million users, according to its Web Store listing. This development comes at a time when Coinbase mentioned that it would reimburse more than $400 million to affected users and repair other damages after it apprehended a support agent who was linked to a massive security breach earlier this year in India. The arrest was confirmed by Coinbase and the Indian police and comes months after hackers bribed support staff to steal user information. The breach, which began in May, saw the hackers ask for a $20 million ransom, and the company faced a $400 million fallout. “What these attackers were doing was finding Coinbase employees and contractors based in India who were associated with our business process outsourcing or support operations, that kind of thing, and bribing them to obtain customer data,” said Philip Martin, Coinbase’s Chief Security Officer.

With the law set to go live in less than a month, the tech industry has voiced out the need for clearer requirements. The AI Basic Act is expected to go live on January 22, with the legislation facing criticism from all angles in the industry. Most industry participants are claiming that the law remains vague and its practice will be hard to implement. The decree recently underwent a 40-day legislative period, which was finalized on November 12 South Korean tech industry voices concerns Tech companies in South Korea have talked about the time they have to prepare before the law takes effect. While lawmakers are hailing the legislation as the first-ever nationwide law governing AI, the industry is concerned about provisions governing “high-impact AI.” This is defined as systems that could pose major risks to life, safety, or fundamental rights, and require disclosure when content has been generated using artificial intelligence. According to an official at a Korean firm, the situation is like being asked to construct a building without a blueprint. Under the new law, companies dealing in AI services will have to assess in advance whether their technology falls into the category. However, the firms in question have noted that guidelines for the category remain broadly defined. The law defines the range to include energy supply, biometric data used in criminal investigations, and other areas affecting human life or physical safety. Any company that falls into these categories is considered a high-impact AI firm and must follow the requirements, such as mandatory risk management measures. According to Jung Ju-yeon, a senior policy analyst at Startup Alliance, startups could be the most affected by the new law. She noted that the level of requirements that they must follow is higher than that of general AI. Ju-yeon also added that sectors where startups are active, including health care and education, could easily fall into that category. She mentioned that companies would be looking to avoid many of these areas due to the legal risks. According to a recent survey, only about 2% were preparing concrete response plans, with 98% noting that they had no concrete compliance strategy. Larger firms are also facing a similar challenge. According to an executive, the law would force companies to build Korea-specific compliance frameworks . He mentioned that the situation could delay the launch of new services in the country. The executive added that companies will have to build legal frameworks that only apply to the country, adding that the ecosystem thrives on relationships. The executive highlighted that with the close deadline and requirements remaining unclear, it is hard for companies to know how to prepare. He added that his firm plans to pause the launch of several products in Korea for the time being. In addition, the requirement to label AI-generated content has also caused uproar in the industry, with officials asking if the law would be able to protect users even if AI-generated content is labeled. Meanwhile, the Korean government plans to suspend fines under the AI Basic Act for the next year to reduce the potential side effects on firms. In turn, the companies have noted the move will not ease concerns. According to an industry official, there is a possibility of complaints and other negative aspects holding back business decisions and operations.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows a cautious short-term uptrend, holding above key support at $0.000007141 and approaching resistance at $0.000007391, indicating accumulation rather than speculation. While the controlled momentum suggests potential for gradual gains, SHIB remains highly volatile and speculative. It may appeal to investors with a high-risk tolerance, but caution and clear risk management are essential. Why is Shiba up today? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up today largely due to renewed buying interest and short-term bullish momentum, as it holds above key support at $0.000007141 and approaches resistance at $0.000007391. Traders are responding to the controlled price action and shallow pullbacks, which signal accumulation rather than panic selling.

Will SHIB reach $0.0001? Yes, according to crypto experts’ long-term predictions, SHIB’s role in the cryptocurrency market is projected to lead it to reach $0.0001 by 2031. Will SHIB reach $100? SHIB’s goal of reaching $100 is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market, which significantly influences the price movements of SHIB. Additionally, to get the $100 mark, SHIB would require a significant increase in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? The Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will also depend on macroeconomic factors, partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments that influence market cycles.

The developed blockchain had been experiencing weakness throughout December as it traded sideways without making any notable move upwards. Simultaneously, investors looking for the next crypto to breakout are changing focus to developing protocols which hold immense potential in terms of upside instead of focusing on risk management. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a cheap option that has attracted significant investment, raising $19,500,000 from 18590 investors, with Phase 6 having almost reached capacity with a price of $0.035 per token. Cardano Experiencing Technological Pressures and Depleting Momentum The daily chart of Cardano shows a typical “head and shoulder” with an inclined neckline, evidencing that investors are supporting prices at lower and lower levels. Crossing below that neckline would confirm this formation and would target a measured move to $0.24, reflecting an 18% depreciation from current prices around $0.35. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has been moving downwards, even as ADA has been trying to make a recovery, and it means that the inflow of money is gradually decreasing during the bounce attempts. Less spent coins are a sign of less selling pressure, and similar moves led to a temporary rebound in late November and early December. The coming days will be dependent on ADA’s ability to sustain above the support at $0.35 and push CMF above its trend line. Otherwise, it will confirm a breakdown scenario and set a target at $0.24 as investors look for different options for next crypto to breakout. Phase 6 Exhaustion Establishes Final Entry Opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been showing rapid presale activity over 2025, and as of now, Phase 6 is almost fully subscribed with just days to go before entering Phase 7. The market price of $0.035 reflects the absolute floor price; however, Phase 7 will begin with a price of $0.04 after all remaining coins has been exhausted. Additionally, it equates to a 20% price increase from here and will result in eroding the early-bird discount. Early supporters who joined during Phase 1 at a price of $0.01 have already experienced gains of 250% and are poised to capitalize on gains of 485% when the current price of MUTM hits the planned exchange listing price of $0.06. Currently, the presale has garnered a sum of $19,500,000 from 18590 holders. Investors sitting on their hands will see other people locking in the best prices, which will be unrecoverable once Phase 7 activates, a problem that has led to FOMO among people who did not act quickly during the earlier phases. For those seeking explosive growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) symbolizes the best crypto to invest in. Independent Audit In fact, security infrastructure is what separates feasible protocols from those that have not stood up to exploitation testing. A third-party security review for lending and borrowing contracts for Mutum Finance (MUTM) has already been initiated and is being carried out in partnership with Halborn Security. The process of an institution-grade security audit is what specifically addresses the key point of consideration for savvy investors in their assessment of new crypto investment opportunities. The protocol had already gone through a CertiK audit, which had given them a score of 90/100 on the Token Scan, a symbol of multiple verification tests run through various security companies. There is also a $50,000 bug bounty program in place to entice ethical hackers prior to its launch in order to test for vulnerabilities with rewards depending on the bug’s level of severity. Layer 2 Integration Enables Accessibility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also planning the integration of Layer-2 scaling solutions to improve transaction processing speed and minimize high fees that inhibit entry for smaller actors in the ecosystem. The integration with the existing Layer-2 scaling solutions will allow the network to process more transactions without sacrificing the level of decentralization that defines all valid DeFi networks. Additionally, micro-transactions will now be feasible. This scaling plan also sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) up for multi-chain launch momentum during future stages. The plan’s layout illustrates a progressive development that looks ahead and expects growth instead of accommodating constraints after the launch. Cardano is vulnerable to a technical breakdown as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) consumes the remaining tokens of phase 6. This price of $0.035 will not come back once phase 7 begins.

Trading volume is a respectable $13.6 billion, and Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $1.75 trillion, further confirming its dominance. There’s not a lot going on in the crypto space. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has been stuck in extreme fear since mid-December, so some people are cautious, but it hasn’t yet reached outright panic selling. That caution stems from a 30% drawdown from its all-time high of $126,080 in October. But when we look at price action over the last few sessions, it appears the price is stabilizing rather than people panicking and selling off. Trading has slowed a bit, but sellers haven’t been able to push the price below a key short-term support level yet. Institutional Support Shapes the Bigger Picture Strategy CEO Phong Le says that, even with the price down from its highs, Bitcoin’s fundamentals have rarely looked stronger. He was speaking on a Coin Stories podcast recently, and the gist of what he said was that short-term price swings and longer-term adoption trends often get confused with each other. Strategy itself has shown its commitment to Bitcoin, now holding a massive 671,268 coins worth around $58.6 billion. And at the moment, the stock is trading below the value of their holdings, which is a good indicator that people are more worried about the short term than the fundamentals. Le also mentioned that, from a banking perspective, things are really taking off. He said the interest shown by banks in the US and the UAE is unprecedented, and that this will play a much bigger role over the next couple of years. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Structure Signals Compression Looking at the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is still stuck in a descending channel, with the upper boundary around $94,600. We’re also seeing people buying at the lower boundary of around $86,300. The pattern of small candles, lots of spinning tops, and doji formations is a good indication that the momentum has stalled rather than turned. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview At the moment, Bitcoin is bouncing between the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, suggesting it might be about to break out. RSI has also levelled out a bit, and is hovering around 50, which is a good sign of balance rather than trend exhaustion. Outlook: Breakout or Deeper Reset? If Bitcoin breaks $88,600, the charts suggest it will rise to around $90,500, then to $92,500. But if it can’t hold at $86,300, then it’s going to expose $84,450, where a lot of people were buying in previous times. For now, Bitcoin isn’t in the kind of trouble you’d expect; it’s more like it’s paused, waiting to make its next move. Given that institutional support is deepening and supply levels are unchanged, this current consolidation is a good time to position for the next cycle, rather than getting too caught up in fear.

NGS Crypto is a digital asset platform that marketed itself as a crypto-based retirement solution. The federal court order was issued this week, after findings revealed that the Gold Coast-linked group operated an unlicensed financial services business. According to the court, the digital asset platform also posed what it described as a serious risk to investors and the general public. Australian court orders crypto platform to halt operations According to The Australian, NGS Crypto promoted what it called digital mining packages, telling investors that they could earn annual fixed returns of 16%, while also assuring them that their investment would be returned. The corporate regulator of Australia mentioned that those claims raised immediate red flags, noting that the court found that the company was operating without the required financial services license, breaching securities and consumer protection laws. Justice Berna Collier ordered the companies to wind up and permanently refrain from offering financial services, citing risks to retail investors and repeated violations of corporate regulations. The regulator highlighted that more than 450 investors put money into NGS Crypto and related entities over roughly six years. The administrators encouraged many investors to move their retirement savings into the scheme using self-managed retirement accounts similar to self-directed IRAs maintained in the United States. In her ruling, Justice Berna Collier said that the structure and conduct of the business posed grave risks to investors and warranted immediate intervention. Aside from winding up its operations, the court also permanently ordered the firm to desist from promoting financial products in the future. Meanwhile, court-appointed liquidators from advisory firm McGrath Nicol have so far identified just $4.4 million in digital assets, a fraction of what they believed investors gave to the firm. Liquidators face challenges in tracing funds In filings to the court, the firm warned that recovery efforts have faced major challenges. It claimed that crypto price volatility has affected the price of some of its assets, while others appeared to have been locked in long-term staking arrangements that may not unlock until 2037. The liquidators have also said that tracing ownership is difficult, noting that investor funds were moved to a single wallet and then across several other wallets, making attribution complex. Regulators also obtained freezing orders last year to prevent assets from being moved. The orders were obtained against the firm and its directors, Ryan Brown, Brett Mendham, and Mark Ten Caten. Authorities confirmed that they had seized Mendham’s passport. Ten Caten is believed to be outside Australia, while Brown’s last known address was in Brisbane, according to court records. The orders remain in place as liquidators continue tracing the flow of funds. Regulators claimed that the investigation was triggered by concerns from some investors that their funds were not being handled as represented by the company. Justice Collier said the lack of licensing, combined with the scale of funds raised, and the nature of the promises made to investors, justified her decision. She added that the company will remain in that state for the foreseeable future as the investigators continue moves to recover funds. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

He is using this cross-blockchain privacy technique to attack Bitcoin and the XRP Ledger. Midnight may help Cardano, but it may also improve the privacy of Bitcoin and XRP, according to Hoskinson. He thinks the technology can compete with the privacy tools available today. Privacy solutions for regulatory compliance The problem with XRP Ledger is that private transactions in decentralized finance that adhere to regulations are possible if Midnight connects to it. That may not sit well with traditional banks. Hoskinson believes that Midnight’s zero-knowledge proof technology could give Bitcoin the privacy that Satoshi Nakamoto initially desired. Hoskinson talked about what this does for Cardano. He expects Midnight will pump up Cardano’s decentralized finance – more monthly active users, more transactions, higher total value locked. “Adding Midnight to Cardano supercharges our DeFi ecosystem,” he said. In a December 27 post on X, he claimed it could multiply Cardano’s monthly active users, transactions, and total value locked by ten times. Cardano could be the first to market with large-scale privacy-focused decentralized finance. The protocol’s programmability excites Hoskinson. While maintaining compliance, decentralized applications can manage privacy in a variety of ways. This differs from Hoskinson’s typical methodology. He is introducing other networks to the Cardano ecosystem. Midnight on XRP and Bitcoin should attract customers and funds from sources other than Cardano’s typical user base. Institutional play: The $10 trillion RWA market Hoskinson also spoke about tokenized real-world assets, which he estimates could grow into a $10 trillion market. He believes Midnight’s privacy framework is well suited for institutional investors. At the same time, he sharply criticized traditional finance and permissioned blockchains such as the Canton Network , arguing that they fail to provide the level of privacy institutions actually require. “There are no half measures or half technologies,” Hoskinson said. He’s arguing institutions need full privacy solutions, not the partial fixes permissioned blockchains offer. His pitch is Midnight handles institutional demands better than what traditional finance companies use now. He mentioned successful rollout needs solid partners and active communities supporting the tech. NIGHT token faces volatility despite growing interest While Hoskinson promotes Midnight, the protocol’s token NIGHT has attracted speculators. Recent numbers show more searches for it on sites like CoinGecko, beating out Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token’s been trending on CoinGecko’s platform, which tracks what cryptocurrencies people look up most. But since its debut, NIGHT has experienced considerable price fluctuations. The currency fell more than 80% to $0.08. Although sharp price swings are normal when a new cryptocurrency launches, they show just how unpredictable the market can be for early-stage technologies. Still, the drop hasn’t dampened interest in Midnight’s potential. Many believe its privacy features could change how real-world assets are tokenized and how decentralized finance functions overall. Investors and industry watchers keep an eye on the token’s performance as it develops. Whether Hoskinson fulfills his commitments about cross-chain privacy and whether other blockchain networks truly implement Midnight as he plans are the true questions.

Here Are The Last Lines Of Defense",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-2000-here-are-the-lines-of-defense/,"The Ethereum price looks set to end 2025 with a double-digit loss, but its start to the new year appears to be the more worrying subject. A prominent on-chain analyst has identified crucial price levels that could decide ETH’s future in the next few months. 3 Critical Support Zones For ETH Price In a new post on the social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson warned the market of the potential risk of seeing the Ethereum price below the $2,000 mark again. According to the on-chain analytics expert, the price of ETH is currently holding on to three critical on-chain support levels. Firstly, Wedson highlighted that the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-Score, which offers insights into when an asset is overvalued or undervalued, suggests that the Ethereum price is sitting exactly on its final support cushion. According to the crypto founder, a failure of this level could see the price of ETH suffer an aggressive downside move. Wedson also mentioned that the Market Cap Growth Rate, which reflects the real expansion of Ethereum’s market capitalization over time, is testing a critical structural support level. The Alphractal CEO revealed that breaking below this support would suggest weakening capital inflows , signaling the potential imminence of downside pressure. Additionally, the crypto analyst noted that the Delta Growth Rate, a metric that measures the divergence between Realized Cap growth and Market Cap growth, which generates an on-chain alpha signal, is also at support. “A loss of this level would suggest speculative capital exiting the market, increasing the likelihood of a future capitulation phase,” Wedson added. According to the crypto pundit, there is a huge likelihood that the Ethereum price falls below the $2,000 mark if these on-chain foundations break. An over 30% correction from the current price point is even more probable as supply pressure increases against declining demand heading into the new year. The blockchain firm founder didn’t dismiss the idea of taking a long position in the Ethereum market at the current price levels, especially for investors with a higher risk appetite. At the same time, Wedson stated that the Ethereum price remains in a fragile position from a broader outlook. Ethereum Price Overview The price of Ethereum is currently down by more than 40% from its all-time high of $4,946. This record reflects the struggles of the second-largest cryptocurrency—and perhaps the broader market—in the final quarter of 2025. As of this writing, ETH is valued at around $2,940, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|crypto|crypto news|ETH|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 12:00:17

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/more-companies-will-adopt-xrp-in-2026-heres-why/,"A growing theme has begun to surface, as more market participants observe how companies approach digital assets on their balance sheets. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted this shift by pointing to documented cases where XRP has moved beyond speculative exposure and into formal treasury strategy. In the image he shared, XRP appears alongside other major digital assets that benefited from what is described as the digital asset treasury company narrative. The emphasis is not on trading activity, but on long-term balance sheet allocation and management. Expect more companies to adopt XRP as a core treasury asset in 2026. Alongside this, XRP ETFs/ETPs are expected to grow, and as XRPFi on XRPL matures, both trends act as liquidity catalysts driving capital into the XRP DeFi ecosystem. Documented. pic.twitter.com/7ucCX5z01e — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 26, 2025 Companies Position XRP as a Treasury Asset According to the material SMQKE posted, several firms have adopted XRP as a core treasury holding. Evernorth, a newly formed U.S. company, is cited as building a $1.1 billion war chest to acquire XRP. The document states that the company already holds 473 million XRP . That amount represents 0.473% of the total XRP supply. The image also references VivoPower as another notable participant. VivoPower gained exposure to a 211 million XRP position through a budgeted $100 million acquisition of Ripple shares at an 86% discount. Since then, the company announced partnerships with Flare and Doppler Finance to maximize returns tied to its crypto treasury strategy. ETPs and XRPFi The image further states, “We expect to see an expansion in XRP ETP listings in 2026, alongside the launch of additional XRP-focused DATs.” It also notes that as yield opportunities on XRPL develop through XRPFi, more DATs may allocate capital into the ecosystem to capture incremental returns. This section links institutional products with on-chain utility. Exchange-traded products expand access for traditional investors. XRPFi development increases potential use cases on XRPL. Together, they describe parallel channels for capital deployment rather than isolated trends. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for XRP Price Growth Treasury adoption changes supply dynamics. Coins held for strategic reserves tend to circulate less. That reduces available float during periods of rising demand. At the same time, ETP growth increases accessibility without requiring direct custody. Both factors can support sustained inflows rather than short-lived spikes. XRPFi adds another layer. Yield generation creates incentives to deploy XRP on-chain, rather than leaving it idle. That activity can deepen liquidity while increasing transaction volume across XRPL. What Comes Next? The timeline highlighted in the document points to 2026. That window aligns treasury adoption, product expansion, and on-chain financial development.

Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring the cryptocurrency’s recent performance, particularly in comparison to traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and silver. As gold and silver hit record highs, Bitcoin lags behind, sparking social chatter and speculation about its rebound potential. For instance, silver recently broke the $75 level with its year-to-date (YTD) hitting 158%. On the other hand, Gold recently surged to a new all-time high (ATH) of $4,486 per CoinCodex data. On the other hand, the discussion also shows Bitcoin’s unique scarcity, capped at 21 million coins, setting it apart from precious metals, whose supply can expand over time. Therefore, despite underperforming gold and silver, Bitcoin remains central to digital asset discussions. Seen as a key player in market rotations between crypto and traditional safe-havens, it draws bullish forecasts for substantial growth by 2026, highlighting its long-term potential as a store of value. Other cryptocurrencies are also seeing notable social chatter this weekend. Ethereum (ETH) continues to attract attention due to its robust smart contract ecosystem and growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi). Cardano (ADA) and Zcash (ZEC) are being highlighted for their unique technological propositions, while Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) maintain popularity among retail investors for their transactional speed and community-driven momentum. Well, Santiment’s social sentiment data shows a surge in cryptocurrency discussions, driven not just by price movements but by broader interest in digital assets as an evolving class. As a result, investors are evaluating Bitcoin’s scarcity, adoption, and hedge potential against traditional assets like gold and silver. The spike highlights the growing convergence of crypto and traditional markets, signaling that the next major rotation could offer opportunities across both sectors. Conclusion Bitcoin’s weekend surge in discussions underscores its lasting relevance, even as gold and silver hit new highs. Its scarcity, digital nature, and growth potential keep investors engaged, while social sentiment highlights the growing interplay between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Amid market rotations, Bitcoin and other major digital assets remain central to both retail and institutional investment strategies, as participants watch closely for the next opportunity in the evolving financial landscape.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 12:02:47

The upgrade has led to the burning of 100 million UNI tokens from its treasury, resulting in a surge in UNI’s price. Uniswap, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX), has burned 100 million UNI tokens from its treasury, valued at $635 million. The token burn comes after the protocol’s fee-burning “ UNIfication ” upgrade went live on mainnet. According to data from the Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, the burn took place on December 28 at approximately 4:30 AM UTC. The burning transaction marks the first large-scale burn on the ecosystem after the fee-burning proposal passed in a record governance vote. Uniswap’s ‘UNIfication’ upgrade goes live UNIfication has officially been executed onchain ✓ Labs interface fees are set to zero ✓ 100M UNI has been burned from the treasury ✓ Fees are on for v2 and a set of v3 pools on mainnet ✓ Unichain fees flow to UNI burn (after OP & L1 data costs) Let the burn begin pic.twitter.com/fcr3WY3gPc — Uniswap Labs 🦄 (@Uniswap) December 27, 2025 The proposal received near-unanimous support from its community, clearing the 40 million vote requirement. According to data from the Uniswap Foundation, the proposal received over 125 million votes, with only 742 opposing votes. UNI has surged by 5.4% in the 24 hours, marking a swift recovery from a 12% decline recorded in the last seven days. Data from crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap shows that the digital asset is up 30% since December 18, after nearly a month of a sell-off, and is currently trading for $6.34. In November, the proposal’s hype propelled UNI’s price by more than 70% in a single week, accompanied by a surge in whale activity on the protocol that reached a four-year high. According to data from Santiment, Uniswap had the highest number of new wallets created in three years, and daily whale transactions reached a four-year high. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the proposal’s implementation will ultimately tighten UNI’s supply and add long-term value to community members and supporters. The report highlighted that UNI’s supply in circulation would drop from 629 million to 529 million tokens after the burn. The proposal aims to transform Uniswap into a yield-generating ecosystem by implementing protocol fees and utilizing the proceeds to burn UNI. The upgrade will activate Uniswap’s v2 and v3 fee switches on the Unichain mainnet, imposing v2 pool fees of 0.25% for LPs and 0.05% for the protocol itself. Additionally, v3 protocol fees will be applied pool by pool, resulting in 16–25% of LP fees at each tier. The proposal also aims to incorporate Unichain sequencer fees into its burning ecosystem and develop protocol fee discount auctions to increase LP returns while allowing the protocol to internalize MEV. According to the proposal, the upgrade will roll out aggregator hooks to turn Uniswap v4 into an onchain aggregator that collects fees on external liquidity. The upgrade will also involve migrating governance-owned Unisocks liquidity from Uniswap v1 on mainnet to v4 on Unichain and burning the LP position. Uniswap rolls out Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCA) to streamline token offerings The news follows Uniswap’s partnership with Aztec, a privacy-native Layer 2 on Ethereum, to introduce Continuous Clearing Auctions in mid-November, streamlining token offerings on its exchange platform. Cryptopolitan recently highlighted that the CCA protocol will roll out a decentralized platform for developers to bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap v4 automatically. The report detailed that the tool is among the several tools that Uniswap developers are working on to provide deeper liquidity for token launches on the Uniswap platform. Aztec was the first DeFi project to debut through the CCA protocol. To use the protocol, project developers need to declare the number of tokens to sell, a starting price, and a timeframe for the sale. Auction users will place bids and specify a maximum price and total spend. The bids can only be withdrawn once prices fall outside the predetermined range. However, the auction participants can place as many bids as they want throughout the token offering.

BitMine (BMNR), now officially the world’s largest Ethereum treasury firm, has just made a major move by staking 74,880 ETH worth roughly $219 million into Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. This is a big deal because, to date, it’s the first time BitMine has staked any of its holdings, it marks a move away from simply holding onto ETH to now actively seeking to earn some return. 刚才 Bitmine 继续把 79,296 枚 ETH 存进了以太坊 PoS 质押。 他们今天到现在一共质押了154,176 枚 ETH ($4.51 亿)。 pic.twitter.com/fm70Ryyi4C — 余烬 (@EmberCN) December 27, 2025 According to on-chain data from Arkham , BitMine now has about 4.07 million ETH on its books. If it were to fully stake that amount at current yields of 3.12% APY, then that would generate an additional 126,800 ETH every year, a whopping $371 million a year at current prices. A return that’s going to start making people look at Ethereum not just as an asset that could grow in value, but as a genuine source of steady income. Institutional Investment in ETH is Steadily Climbing This staking move comes hot on the heels of fresh accumulation by BitMine – last week alone, they added 98,852 ETH at an average price near $2,976 – a purchase valued at about $294 million. Meanwhile, Bitcoin treasury firms like Strategy were largely sitting on their hands during the same time, but the Ethereum-focused treasuries are stepping up to the plate. A few key things have been happening in the recent treasury activity that are worth noting: BitMine now holds over 4 million ETH – the largest known stash of its kind held by a corporate firm. The fact that BitMine is staking ETH for the first time is a clear vote of confidence in the network’s overall stability. By staking ETH, BitMine is introducing a regular return into its treasury models, which will be a major change in how it uses ETH. For anyone investing at the institutional level, this is all about big picture thinking – not about short-term price moves but about getting your long-term positioning right. Ethereum’s Price Holds Firm Despite Wider Market Caution From a market perspective, Ethereum’s fundamentals are looking healthy. It remains one of the top 2 assets by market cap, with a valuation of roughly $355 billion and daily trading volumes exceeding $7.4 billion. Despite a general air of caution across the wider crypto market, ETH has held its ground above key support levels. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Price Chart: Hanging fire On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum price prediction seems bearish as ETH is bumping up against resistance around the $3,300- $3,350 region. At the moment, its price is stuck in a consolidation phase rather than being in a full-blown free fall. Each time the price approaches the $2,775 support zone, buyers step in and absorb that supply, which is a good sign. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Just now, the price is trading slightly beneath the 50-day EMA ($2,954) and the 100-day EMA ($2,982), and the narrowing gap between the two lines suggests the downward momentum is starting to slow. The RSI (a measure of overbought/oversold conditions) is in the 50 zone, which is another sign of balance, neither extreme nor orderly, showing neither excessive buying pressure nor a total collapse in demand. If the price breaks above $3,000, we can see an acceleration towards $3,170 – the next technical target would be the $3,300-$3,320 zone. But if the price were to break down below $2,775, it would leave it at risk of falling to $2,620. At the moment, all the signs point towards stabilization of current price levels rather than a breakdown. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale.

He highlighted that adoption in emerging market economies is expected to be a key driver of this expansion. Knutson’s forecast surprised many who hadn’t anticipated such momentum, yet it has generated excitement across the crypto industry as stakeholders prepare for another milestone next year. Meanwhile, just like any other market, the crypto executive noted in an interview that emerging markets are also experiencing challenges in their operations. These challenges include struggling to raise capital and finding it difficult to attract foreign investments. Knutson shares unexpected forecast about tokenized RWA market In a statement, Knutson highlighted that tokenizing real-world assets, which involves converting ownership rights to physical or financial items (such as real estate, art, or stocks) into digital tokens on a blockchain, addresses the challenges encountered in emerging markets . This is because the process enables capital to form on-chain effectively. Additionally, it eliminates the need for traditional financial middlemen. The crypto executive further asserted that emerging markets frequently overlook aging infrastructure that lags behind that of developed nations, and instead embrace digital systems, such as stablecoin settlement , more swiftly than areas with outdated financial systems. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of assets. According to Knutson, this move streamlines the process for regular investors to access investments that might otherwise be very costly. He also unveiled that firms find it easy to provide fixed returns to investors but struggle to acquire stable traditional funding to benefit most from asset tokenization. Currently, fixed-income instruments such as US Treasuries and money market funds dominate tokenization efforts in developed markets. In contrast, developing economies are increasingly focusing on tokenizing tangible assets, such as real estate and commodities. Following this finding, Knutson anticipated that the total market value of tokenized RWAs would expand to a record number of one trillion dollars within the next decade. Nonetheless, as the crypto ecosystem continues to achieve several accomplishments following Knutson’s prediction, reliable sources have noted that this growth, as anticipated, depends on leading firms shifting from testing phases to actual commercial products. Despite the promising outlook for the RWA market, reports still identified several key challenges in the market. Some of these challenges include ensuring that on-chain contracts can be lawfully enforced, offering sufficient liquidity for settlements without incurring losses, and adopting workable frameworks to safeguard investors, said Knutson. Knutson outlines challenges faced in the RWA market As Knutson outlined the issues faced in the RWA market, he mentioned that another major obstacle in this market is establishing a common way for various blockchain networks and platforms to collaborate, particularly when developing tokenized assets effectively. Even with these challenges in mind, the crypto executive still insisted that it is important to secure widespread acceptance. He argued that the various types of token standards and the contrasting nature between permissioned blockchains and open crypto systems pose a technical issue for RWA issuers. To maximize the full potential of on-chain assets, Knutson urged issuers to consider creating tokenized products that can be effectively transferred throughout different parts of the crypto ecosystem and later used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

The company’s latest Crypto Market Outlook suggests traditional cycle models now offer limited guidance. Instead, institutional behavior, market structure, and payment utility increasingly shape price action. The report , authored by Coinbase global research head David Duong and research associate Colin Basco, frames crypto as a maturing financial system rather than a retail-driven trade. Besides revisiting major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, the report emphasizes structural forces beneath market volatility. Coinbase expects macro conditions to remain supportive, although uncertainty will persist. Rising productivity and regulatory clarity could provide stability. Hence, the firm views early 2026 as constructive rather than overheated, with measured growth replacing speculative excess. Institutions and Regulation Redefine Market Dynamics Regulatory progress in 2025 laid the foundation for deeper institutional participation, according to Coinbase’s research team. Spot crypto ETFs, digital asset treasuries, and clearer compliance rules reshaped how capital entered the market. Consequently, institutions now focus more on risk management, liquidity, and operational efficiency. David Duong and Colin Basco noted that digital asset treasuries are evolving beyond accumulation strategies. In 2026, these entities may specialize in trading services, custody, and block space procurement. Significantly, Coinbase treats block space as a scarce economic resource, similar to bandwidth or cloud infrastructure. This shift could anchor token valuations to usage rather than narratives. Token design also continues to mature. Protocols increasingly connect fees, buybacks, and burns to actual platform activity. Moreover, clearer policy frameworks allow projects to align tokenholder incentives with long-term revenue generation. This trend could reduce volatility tied to hype cycles. Technology, Payments, and New Market Primitives Coinbase expects privacy technology to gain traction as institutions demand confidentiality. Additionally, advances in zero-knowledge systems and encrypted computation may support regulated privacy without sacrificing transparency. This balance could unlock broader enterprise adoption. AI-driven systems also feature prominently in the outlook. Autonomous software agents require programmable payments, which blockchain networks can provide. Hence, crypto rails may become essential for machine-to-machine commerce. Stablecoins remain the ecosystem’s most proven use case. Coinbase forecasts continued expansion in remittances, payroll, and cross-border settlement. Moreover, the firm’s models project stablecoin market capitalization could approach $1.2 trillion by 2028.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 12:21:46

This is particularly true for the two most prominent precious metals, as both have seen their best year to date. At the same time, the largest cryptocurrency is on its way to end 2025 with a modest loss, despite its surge to a new all-time high just a few months ago. So, how do these different asset classes compare now? Bitcoin Trails Silver and Gold Gold has been on the run for almost the entire year. It entered it at around $2,610/oz, but skyrocketed to a fresh all-time high of $4,550 erlier this week, representing a YTD surge of 75% – quite impressive for the world’s largest asset, which is known for sluggish but consistent price moves. Silver, on the other hand, had a more modest first half of the year. It was also in the green, but in a less spectacular manner. It entered 2025 at $29 and traded at $39 by late August. Then, it picked up pace, reaching around $50 by late November when investors went wild for it and pushed it to almost $80 by Friday’s close, shattering all previous records. This means a triple-digit rise of 172%. At the same time, BTC was quite volatile. It was already riding high in early 2025 and broke its ATHs on several occasions. The last one was in October when it surged past $126,000. Its market cap flew past silver’s at the time. However, the following two and a half months have been brutal, and it now struggles below $90,000. Its yearly performance is in the red at just over 6%. According to data from the Kobeissi Letter, this contrasting price performance between the two asset classes as of late has led to a dramatic shift in their correlation. The BTC-to-silver and BTC-to-gold ratios have dropped to multi-year lows. Bitcoin versus gold and silver: The Bitcoin-to-silver ratio is now down to 1,104, the lowest since September 2023. Since May, the ratio has dropped -67% as silver has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. At the same time, the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio is down to 19, the lowest… https://t.co/pd0RZP1s1H pic.twitter.com/1oAvo7QyQt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 27, 2025 Can BTC Catch Up in 2026? Given the way this year is ending, many crypto analysts have turned to previous cycles to try to figure out what’s next for the leading digital asset. And, many are hopeful that history will repeat itself. KALEO believes gold led the charge, followed by silver, and BTC will inevitably join the trend. Crypto Tony was more specific, indicating that if BTC is to mimic silver’s recent price performance, it would top $400,000 next year. Crypto Rover went back to the 2020 cycle when bitcoin went on a roll after gold topped, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might be on the verge of a similar surge.

While this may seem like a comedown, the crypto market is actually winning on an entirely different front. While this price stagnation may feel like a “winter” to retail traders watching the charts, the underlying industry is actually winning bigger than ever before. Away from the daily volatility of the spot markets, 2025 has become the year of the Crypto Megadeal, according to data retrieved from PitchBook. Driven by the “Trump Effect” and a regulatory overhaul that flipped enforcement into encouragement, the industry saw a record $8.6 billion in deal volume, which marks a roughly fourfold surge from the year before. Wall Street’s newfound conviction was most visible on the stock exchange. In a historic “rush for legitimacy,” 11 crypto firms went public or uplisted on major US exchanges, raising a combined $14.6 billion in IPOs. Here are the biggest Power Plays that stole the headlines this year and redefined the institutional playbook for digital assets. Coinbase & Deribit: $2.9 billion The crown jewel of 2025 was Coinbase’s $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, announced back in May, that marked the industry’s largest-ever crypto exchange takeover. The deal was structured with $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock. Strategically, this move solved Coinbase’s primary weakness: its lack of a dominant derivatives presence. By acquiring Deribit, which accounts for nearly 90% of all crypto options open interest, Coinbase has effectively positioned itself as the go-to “hedging desk” for Wall Street’s institutional traders, asset managers, and banks. Kraken & NinjaTrader: $1.5 billion Kraken made headlines in March when it acquired retail futures platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, securing one of the most pivotal licenses in the game. This deal was not about technology as much as it was about licensing, as by acquiring NinjaTrader, Kraken secured a CFTC-registered Futures Commission Merchant license that allows it to offer both crypto and traditional futures to its millions of users under one roof. As such, Kraken has issued a direct challenge to the CME Group and opened up access to the traditional $2 trillion futures market for the crypto-native crowd. Ripple & Hidden Road: $1.25 billion Blockchain payments giant Ripple surprised the crypto community in April when it announced that it was acquiring Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Hidden Road is a powerhouse “global credit network” that clears trillions of dollars annually for over 300 institutional clients, and that fits directly into Ripple’s long-term infrastructure play. Ripple became the first crypto company to own a multi-asset prime broker, and it is now using this infrastructure to deploy its enterprise-grade stablecoin, RLUSD, across Hidden Road’s massive institutional network. Hedge funds can now use stablecoins as collateral for high-frequency trading and real-time cross-border settlements. From magic money to blue chip Here are the biggest crypto IPOs that got Wall Street talking. Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL) Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, stole the headlines with the most significant public debut of the year in June. After a previously aborted SPAC attempt, Circle successfully priced its upsized offering of 34 million shares at $31.00 per share. The IPO was a landmark moment for Wall Street, with the listing being 25 times oversubscribed as institutions scrambled for exposure to a compliant stablecoin issuer. On its first day of trading, the stock (ticker: CRCL) saw explosive demand, skyrocketing 167% to close at $82.84 and valuing the company at over $18 billion by market close—more than double its initial target. Backed by a powerhouse underwriting syndicate including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, Circle’s debut signalled that public markets now see stablecoins as critical infrastructure for global payments, not just a side bet in crypto. Bullish (NYSE: BLSH) Bullish, a Peter Thiel-backed exchange, made its public debut in November, raising $1.1 billion by selling 30 million shares at $37.00 per piece. By the daily close, Bullish managed to secure a valuation of around $5.4 billion, establishing itself as a major player among listed crypto exchanges. Unlike retail-heavy platforms, Bullish marketed itself specifically to Wall Street as a high-performance, institutional-only venue for digital assets. At the time of listing, it held over 100,000 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, serving as a safety net for investors. Although accompanied by some initial volatility, the stock eventually settled as a staple for institutional portfolios seeking a regulated way to bet on exchange infrastructure. Its success proved that Wall Street is willing to pay a premium for platforms that prioritise deep liquidity and bank-grade compliance over speculative retail features. Figure Technologies (Nasdaq: FIGR) As a blockchain-based lending platform, Figure made its market debut in September after upsizing its offering to 31.5 million shares priced at $22.00, following an initially smaller raise target. It managed to raise approximately $693 million and clocked in with a $4.66 billion valuation, as it sold Wall Street on the “efficiency” of blockchain to automate home equity lines of credit and other lending products and save traditional banks billions in back-office costs. Investors aggressively bid up FIGR shares, which jumped 24% on opening day, as the company showed how blockchain can help traditional banks cut billions in back-office costs.

SEI is caught in a broader risk-off rotation. However, Ethereum L2s like Mantle show resilience, suggesting SEI’s performance is not chain-specific. Why is SEI down? SEI’s decline reflects a combination of technical triggers, sector-wide caution, and delayed price recognition of ecosystem growth as network activity increased – $699M in bridge inflows (within 30 days) and a $8.98B stablecoin market cap. Recent news DeFiLlama data shows ~1 billion SEI ($148 million) unstaked in November – the largest monthly withdrawal since 2023. This follows Aquiline Capital Partners’ $120M acquisition of SEI’s Archway platform, which may have prompted institutional profit-taking. Will SEI reach $1? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI will rise above $1 in 2028, when the coin will reach a high of $1.21. Can Sei Coin reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Will SEI reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SEI is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Does SEI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, SEI will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory Is SEI a good investment? SEI has growing utility, and its EVM compatibility helps it steal a share of Ethereum’s dominance. While the technical analysis is bearish, price predictions paint a different picture.

Despite a recent pullback to $87,829, according to CoinCodex data , Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its enduring appeal among both retail and institutional investors. The analysts on CNBC credit Bitcoin’s renewed momentum to an influx of organic buyers, signaling strong confidence in its long-term value. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s digital scarcity sets it apart from gold and silver. Amid record highs for precious metals, growing adoption and investor interest are fueling Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-growth asset. Advisor-led allocations are increasingly driving Bitcoin demand, as financial professionals recommend exposure to clients, signaling growing institutional confidence. Combined with strong retail participation, these allocations help stabilize the market during volatility, supporting measured accumulation and laying the groundwork for a potential surge above the $100K mark. Well, Bitcoin’s dip to $87,829 reflects a typical market correction, not a long-term decline. Historical trends show such pullbacks often precede strong recoveries, fueled by positive investor sentiment. Rising social engagement and online discussions signal renewed interest, illustrating growing attention from both retail and institutional participants. Therefore, Bitcoin’s trajectory hinges on macroeconomic trends and adoption rates. Inflation, interest rates, and market rotations may drive short-term volatility, yet the influx of organic buyers and advisor-led allocations underscores strong confidence in its long-term growth. As digital assets increasingly intersect with traditional markets, Bitcoin’s role as both a speculative asset and potential store of value grows. Despite temporary pullbacks, the structural momentum toward $100K remains intact. Conclusion Despite the current pullback, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain robust. New organic buyers and advisor-led allocations signal strong confidence, as both retail and institutional interest positions BTC on a clear path back toward $100K, solidifying its role as a leading digital asset.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 12:41:56

The 69-year-old doctor from Ahmedabad, who has been practising for three decades, reported the incident to the city cybercrime branch in the region. According to the complaint filed at the police station, the doctor was initially contacted on WhatsApp by an individual claiming to be an investment assistant from a prominent company. He introduced himself to the victim and introduced the kinds of assets they help people trade, listing stocks, digital assets, and others. The man claimed that he was assured of profits if he invested his funds in the company’s investment scheme . After a while, the doctor said the suspect impressed him, and he agreed to invest. Indian doctor loses funds to fraudulent investment scheme The Indian doctor claimed that after he agreed to the investment, the suspect added him to a WhatsApp group that had several members. He claimed that the group was made up of people who were interested in the investment, while others were already investing and reaping the benefits of their investments. He claimed that aside from the suspect, others were administrators on the WhatsApp group and directed the day-to-day affairs on the platform. While he was in the group, the Indian doctor claimed that some members flooded the group with screenshots showing what they had gained so far, while thanking the suspect and his accomplices. After a while, the doctor claimed that the criminals asked him to download an application and gave him specific steps to follow. He highlighted that after he carried out the steps and invested, the app showed his balance, which made him trust the suspects and the investment. Over time, the doctor claimed that he transferred Rs. 64 into several bank accounts provided by the scammers. However, the scam unraveled after the doctor tried to withdraw his funds. The scammers asked him to pay Rs. 16.91 lakh to access his funds. The Indian police also confirmed that a complaint has been registered under BNS Sections 316 (criminal breach of trust), 319 (cheating by impersonation), 336 (forgery), 340 (forged document or electronic record and using it as genuine), and 61(2A)(criminal conspiracy) against five people. India set to deploy federal agency to tackle criminal activities As another year winds down, the cybercrime epidemic in India has continued, with scammers wreaking havoc at any given opportunity. The scammers have been carrying out all sorts of criminal activities as the country continues to grapple with its failure to come up with the needed legislation to safeguard users in the industry. Over the last few months, scammers have carried out different kinds of attacks, stealing funds and digital assets from domestic and international victims. The country has also been able to register a degree of success against the criminals, with recent news highlighting how the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of India busted a sophisticated transnational criminal enterprise targeting United States citizens. The operation was carried out in collaboration with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), nabbing several suspects in its raid. Reports claimed that the network has been in operation since 2022, stealing about $8 million from these scams. Meanwhile, there are talks of the government bringing in a central agency to oversee the issue. These issues span several activities, including crypto theft, fake investments, digital arrests, and others. The report highlighted that criminals usually carry out these activities with the mindset of stealing from their victims. When the victims eventually send them money, they route it through several mule accounts before moving it into crypto and sending it out of the country.

Daily trading volume stands at a respectable $1.06 bn, indicating steady participation rather than some wild speculative fervor. As the 5th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $113.2 bn, XRP still has 60.57 bn tokens out of 100 bn in circulation, which gives it a fair bit of stability. Descending Channel Signals Compression On the 4-hour chart, XRP is still stuck inside a descending channel that has been dictating price action since that $2.11 peak earlier this month. Lower highs are still forming, but the channel’s slope is flatter than before, a sign that sellers are losing their grip. Candle patterns back this up, too. Lately, small-bodied candles, spinning tops & doji formations are dominating the show, all of which are classic signals of indecision. That sharp selloff in December has now fizzled out, and all we’re seeing is some sideways consolidation with price repeatedly bouncing back up off that $1.85-1.86 support zone each time it comes near. Each time it’s been the buyers that have jumped in, which suggests demand is quietly gathering strength. XRP/USD Technical Analysis: Why EMA Levels Could Decide the Next Move In terms of trend, XRP is still stuck below the 50 EMA at $1.88 & the 100 EMA at $1.92, so from a short-term momentum perspective, it’s still neutral. However, price is no longer drifting away from these averages – in fact, both EMAs are starting to flatten out, which often signals a big move is just around the corner. The momentum indicators are all telling the same story: RSI has pulled back into the low 50s, well away from oversold levels No bearish divergence is in sight, so breakdown risk is lower Momentum is picking up without any signs of getting out of hand So all in all, this is showing a balance rather than exhaustion. XRP Price Outlook and Key Levels Structurally, XRP price prediction looks like it’s getting ready to make a decision. According to 4-hour chart, a bullish scenario would start when the price breaks decisively above $1.92, opening the door to $1.96 & then $2.05. If that level can hold, then you can bet that $2.10 will be back in play. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the downside, if support at $1.85 fails then $1.77 is the next port of call, followed by $1.65 near the bottom of that channel. At the moment, XRP is looking more like a resolution is on the way rather than some continuation of the trend. As long as that support holds, the risk reward profile is looking pretty good, and this sideways consolidation may just be the catalyst that gets the momentum going once again.

Unfortunately, it has gone downhill for the premier cryptocurrency since reaching this peak, starting with the infamous October 10 market bloodbath. The general consensus in the crypto market has been that this price downturn was triggered by the increasing selling pressure. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin price has not seen significant selling pressure in years. Lack Of Selling Pressure Means No Distribution In BTC Market In a December 27 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. revealed that the Bitcoin price has not seen strong selling pressure since early 2023. This puts the market leader on the verge of a new record in terms of selling activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hovering In A Descending Range, But Alts Are Quietly Gaining Momentum The crypto pundit’s on-chain observation revolves around the Sales Pressure metric, which evaluates different indicators that track investor behavior and supply/demand dynamics. This metric tracks the movement of coins on the blockchain in real-time, providing insights into potential price movements. CryptoQuant’s data shows that the Bitcoin price has gone 1,079 days without strong selling pressure, nearing the current all-time high of seller silence of around 1,125 days. Ultimately, this suggests that the BTC price is yet to see the selling pressure often associated with bear markets. According to Adler Jr., the lack of strong selling pressure means that the Bitcoin price has not seen mass profit-taking, capitulation events, or distribution. The on-chain analyst did note that the absence of selling pressure doesn’t automatically mean price growth for the flagship cryptocurrency. However, Adler Jr. highlighted that periods of major selling pressure are often followed by significant price moves for Bitcoin. As shown in the chart below, the Bitcoin price historically tends to go on an extended rally after a period of significant selling pressure. The price of BTC was below $1,000 as the sales pressure subsided in late 2015, before running to around $20,000 in December 2017. A similar occurrence could be observed after the Bitcoin price came out from under the sales pressure of 2019, before surging to the then-all-time high of around $69,000. Strong sales pressure is looking imminent for the Bitcoin price, especially as the period of seller silence nears its record high of 1,125 days. While the market leader might struggle during the period of strong selling pressure, the coin would likely exit the phase with an upward bounce. Nevertheless, Adler Jr. concluded that the Bitcoin market remains structurally resilient in its current state. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $87,810, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

He focused on Canton and its partnerships with banks and financial firms. His message was clear: these efforts are trying to replicate what existing Web3 networks already accomplish at a far greater scale. Legacy Finance Replicating Web3 Hoskinson pointed out that projects like XRP and Midnight (on the Cardano network) are already operating at a level 100x beyond what legacy finance is attempting. XRP supplies fast, high-throughput settlement and liquidity. Midnight, built on Cardano, offers privacy, compliance, and smart contract capability. Both networks deliver solutions for institutions and users without restricting access. Canton has become the primary vehicle for these efforts. It allows regulated institutions to experiment with tokenization and settlement. Banks can coordinate, maintain compliance, and test digital asset workflows. Hoskinson’s comments made it clear that replicating Web3 processes does not make them as good as Web3. I love it when I see legacy finance come together with Canton and try to build what XRP and Midnight are already doing at a scale 100x beyond their ambitions. These guys never learn and don't understand what makes Web3 unique and meaningful. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 26, 2025 XRP and Midnight at Scale Hoskinson’s stance on XRP has evolved over the past year. While he was once hostile, he now supports the XRP ecosystem and has pushed for interoperability with Cardano . He recognizes XRP’s effectiveness in real-world financial infrastructure. The network supports cross-border transactions, high liquidity, and continuous settlement without requiring permission. Midnight provides advanced functionality for regulated use cases on Cardano. Both networks demonstrate that Web3 systems can meet institutional needs while remaining open and decentralized. By contrast, Canton represents a controlled replication. Its adoption by banks shows institutions understand the value of tokenization , but its design cannot match the scale, flexibility, and innovation of public networks. Hoskinson stressed that these systems may look impressive, but they cannot operate at the throughput or openness that XRP and Midnight already deliver. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding Web3 Hoskinson emphasized that legacy finance does not fully grasp what makes Web3 unique. Open access, decentralized governance , composability, and public liquidity are not features of Canton. These elements enable networks like XRP and Midnight to scale rapidly, innovate continuously, and provide solutions that go beyond improving existing processes. His comments highlighted the gap between legacy finance and true Web3 networks. Canton allows institutions to experiment, but XRP and Midnight operate at a much larger scale. They already provide the speed, openness, and composability that institutions now strive to replicate. Hoskinson’s comments underline the distinction between merely copying Web3 mechanics and delivering the capabilities that make public blockchain networks truly transformative.

In a proactive move, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is pioneering quantum-resistant transactions through the implementation of Dilithium cryptography, positioning itself as a frontrunner in next-generation blockchain security. RippleXity reports that XRP Ledger’s adoption of Dilithium cryptography prioritizes long-term resilience, providing quantum-resistant security essential for today’s enterprise-grade blockchain applications. Quantum-resistant security is no longer optional. As blockchains power banks, corporations, and critical infrastructure, vulnerabilities to quantum attacks could threaten transactions, assets, and trust. By integrating quantum-safe cryptography today, XRP Ledger safeguards its network for the future, staying ahead of evolving technological risks. Dilithium cryptography, a lattice-based algorithm built to resist quantum attacks, positions the XRP Ledger as a forward-thinking, secure blockchain. By adopting it, enterprises can trust that transactions and sensitive data remain protected, today and in the quantum future. XRP Ledger’s focus on quantum-resistant security underscores a pivotal shift in blockchain: robust protection is now essential, not optional. By proactively addressing emerging threats, it not only fortifies its network but also sets a new standard for the industry, leaving legacy-reliant projects at risk of lagging behind. This development coincides with Ripple’s latest Asian initiative, which explores XRP-based yield infrastructure and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger. As quantum computing evolves, quantum-resistant blockchains will shape the future of secure digital infrastructure. By adopting Dilithium cryptography, XRP Ledger showcases forward-looking security, establishing itself as a trusted platform for enterprises and investors seeking long-term protection in a complex technological landscape. Conclusion By adopting Dilithium cryptography, XRP Ledger leads in quantum-resistant, enterprise-grade security, protecting assets today while setting the standard for the next era of secure, resilient digital finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 13:08:23

The token is down nearly 10% year-to-date, trading around $1.8 at press time. Throughout the year, XRP has seen sharp volatility largely tied to broader cryptocurrency market swings. Notably, the asset has retreated from a yearly high of $3.55 reached in late July. XRP YTD price chart. Source: Finbold XRP prediction for 2026 Market views on XRP’s 2026 outlook remain divided. For instance, Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital asset research, back in March 2025, suggested that XRP could reach $8 by the end of 2026, citing expectations of institutional adoption and broader acceptance of crypto assets . This view rests on XRP’s role in cross-border payments, where Ripple positions the token as a bridge asset for fast, low-cost international settlements. Fundamentally, XRP’s strongest support remains its cross-border payments use case. The network is active across multiple regions, with rising transaction volumes pointing to real economic activity rather than pure speculation, an important factor for long-term value. Regulatory clarity has also improved. In this line, the resolution of prolonged legal uncertainty with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has reopened access through regulated exchanges and financial products, reducing barriers for banks and institutional investors . While this does not directly push prices higher, it has removed a key structural constraint on demand. On the other hand, spot XRP ETFs have added another layer of institutional access by offering regulated exposure without direct token custody. Since launch, these products have recorded steady inflows surpassing $1 billion , suggesting a shift toward longer-term holding behavior. Over time, this could help tighten tradable supply. However, ETF growth has not translated into immediate price gains. XRP has remained relatively subdued, highlighting that ETFs tend to support structural demand rather than act as short-term price catalysts. XRP price constraints On the flipside, XRP also faces clear constraints. Its large circulating supply means a move to $5 would require a substantial increase in market capitalization driven by genuine demand. Adoption remains the primary growth driver, while limited direct XRP usage by some Ripple partners and intensifying competition in cross-border payments continue to weigh on near-term prospects. Meanwhile, elevated interest rates and tight global liquidity dampen risk appetite, even as fundamentals improve. A more supportive macro backdrop would likely be needed for XRP’s utility and regulatory gains to translate into sustained price appreciation. Overall, XRP’s fundamentals are mixed but improving. They can support the possibility of a $5 valuation by 2026, but only if adoption accelerates, institutional inflows persist, and broader cryptocurrency market conditions turn favorable.

In a world chasing 1000x meme coin potential, excitement is spreading fast. Dogecoin and Pepe continue to capture attention, but APEMARS presale is live today, offering a rare early entry that could put early buyers ahead of the crowd. Momentum is climbing, communities are growing, and every new participant strengthens the energy around this project. If you have ever wished you had acted before a major breakout, this is your chance to step in early and secure $APRZ at the lowest Stage 1 price. The window for early buyers is limited, and demand is accelerating with every passing hour. Missing this moment could mean watching from the sidelines as visibility, hype, and token scarcity drive the next surge. APEMARS is not just another meme coin; it is building a community, a metaverse-like experience, and staking rewards that keep engagement high while delivering tangible opportunities for those who move fast. Why APEMARS ($APRZ) Is the Meme Coin to Watch APEMARS ($APRZ)stands out as a rare early-stage memecoin with a structured purpose and the possibility of real community-driven momentum. From its design, APRZ rewards holders not just with speculative potential but with engagement and reward mechanisms that add value beyond simple hype. Holders get access to a dynamic metaverse-style environment where missions, community events, and shared experiences create social energy and demand. As participation grows, the momentum builds organically and keeps drawing in new buyers. Add to that a staking reward system inspired by Mars’ temperature that offers a strong yield for committed holders. That kind of reward system gives holders an incentive to stay engaged for the long haul and not just trade on hype. This combination of social engagement and yield gives APRZ a foundation that supports both community growth and token demand. Lock In APRZ Early Before Prices Surge Picture this: you grab APRZ at the very first stage for just 0.00001699. The listing price is projected at 0.0055, creating a potential ROI of 32,269 percent from Stage 1. For example, investing 1000 dollars now could secure a huge stack of APRZ tokens. When the listing hits 0.0055, that same position could multiply dramatically. This is your chance to get in at the lowest entry before wider demand pushes prices higher. The presale is live, and supply is limited. Every stage that fills raises the cost of entry. Acting today ensures you capture early-stage advantage. Hesitate even briefly, and you risk missing the window that could turn a small early investment into substantial gains. Join the APEMARS Whitelist Today Early access can define your gains. To join the whitelist: Go to the APEMARS official site. Navigate to “Whitelist Now.” Provide your email and submit. Verify your registration via the confirmation email. Act now to lock in $APRZ at Stage 1 pricing and maximize your exposure to this emerging big crypto. Dogecoin Momentum You Cannot Ignore Dogecoin remains one of the most recognized memecoins globally. Recently, network activity surged with active addresses hitting the highest reading in three months, signaling renewed interest and on-chain engagement. Whales appear to be accumulating DOGE with hundreds of millions of coins moved among large holders over a short period. This renewed activity shows why many respect Dogecoin as a memecoin giant. But that momentum brings renewed attention to the memecoin landscape as a whole and primes the market for new entries with strong potential. That makes APEMARS presale all the more timely because it gives the chance to enter early while the memecoin atmosphere is heating up. Pepe Market Buzz and What It Means for New Buyers Pepe continues to ride waves of market interest, with recent reports showing large-scale accumulation by some holders despite chart volatility and technical uncertainty. This activity reflects ongoing speculative appetite for meme coins even when price patterns look unstable. For a new project like APEMARS that enters this landscape with a structured presale open now, this is a tailwind. The renewed interest in meme coins rekindles demand and increases the odds that early-stage projects with strong mechanics and community foundations can rise quickly. If Pepe gains traction or memecoin mania returns full force, the ripple effects may lift interest toward well-positioned early-stage coins such as APEMARS. That makes current timing particularly attractive for early entry into the APMARS presale rather than chasing later-stage momentum. Conclusion APEMARS Dogecoin Pepe together highlight the dynamic range of opportunities in the meme coin world. Dogecoin shows renewed on-chain activity, Pepe is stirring market interest, and APEMARS opens its presale right now, offering early-stage access to APRZ at a foundational price, making it a strong contender for the best crypto to buy now . For those seeking a 1000x meme coin chance and believing in early entry advantage, APEMARS presents a strong case. The whitelist is live, and the early window will not stay open forever. If you move now, you may secure a position before demand surges and token availability shrinks.

Stage 1 price equals 0.00001699, offering the earliest and lowest entry point before listing. This is the moment to secure APRZ before demand drives prices higher. When does the presale end?

According to reports, the 29-year-old Lithuanian national stands accused of using malware to secretly alter the wallet addresses where digital assets were meant to be sent. The development was announced by the National Office of Investigation (NOI), a division under the Korean National Police Agency, on Sunday, highlighting that the Lithuanian national had been extradited from Georgia. The NOI claims that the suspect has been fingered in a campaign that stole digital assets from victims in Korea and other countries. South Korea extradites hacker to face the law According to reports , the suspect carried out his operation from April 2020 to January 2023, targeting unsuspecting victims by distributing malicious software called KMSAuto disguised as a Microsoft Windows activation tool. Investigators claimed that malware, which was shared more than 2 million times worldwide, employed a memory hacking technique that automatically replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses with the hacker’s during transactions. The scheme targeted only users who did not use licensed activation software. Reports claimed that more than 3,100 wallets were infected worldwide, and the criminal was able to intercept digital asset transactions 840 times, with the total of those transactions coming to 1.7 billion won. Among his victims were eight Korean nationals, who authorities claimed lost a combined 16 million won. Police mentioned that the hacker first appeared on their radar in August 2020 after receiving a report from a user who claimed to have lost one Bitcoin. The digital asset was worth 12 million won at the time, with the user claiming that they sent the asset to a known wallet, but the transaction was redirected to the wrong wallet address. Investigations traced the stolen digital assets to six countries, including domestic exchanges, and identified seven more Korean victims. After several investigations, the Koreans claimed that they were able to identify the suspect. The police said it carried out a coordinated operation with Lithuania’s Ministry of Justice, prosecutors, and police in December last year. During the joint operations, local authorities in Lithuania raided the suspect’s residence and seized 22 items, including several mobile phones, laptops, and other items. To pursue prosecution in Korea, the police also requested a red notice from Interpol . Police promise to respond strongly to cybercriminals The suspect was eventually apprehended by Georgian authorities after he entered the country in April. Korean authorities requested an extradition from Georgia, and after a five-year and four-month investigation, the police were able to bring the suspect to Korea, where he was arrested pursuant to a court-ordered warrant. In its statement, the Korean police urged residents to be at peace, assuring them that they will apprehend criminal elements targeting them. In addition, Park Woo-hyun, head of cyber investigations at the National Police Agency, thanked the countries involved for their cooperation on the issue. He also mentioned that Korea will continue to respond strongly and firmly to borderless cybercrime through global law enforcement collaboration and extradition. Meanwhile, residents have been warned to be watchful when using digital assets and report to the police once they discover that they have become a victim of theft. The Korean police have also warned residents to desist from illegal activities and affiliations with questionable characters. The statement was made in response to a conviction of a South Korean native who lost an appeal over his collaboration with a North Korean hacker to keep an illegal online game server running. Authorities claimed that the defendant and the hacker exchanged multiple messages and received security-disabling software for which he paid a total of $16,300.

Like it always is. This article introduces an actionable, customizable approach to managing it. These 10 ETFs are my ""core"" and I will rotate between them throughout 2026. I'll also replace 1 or 2 if I think there's a major upgrade to be had. These 10 ETFs cover a lot of ground in a market that gets more correlated by the day. I can pursue gains in stocks, bonds, commodities and a bear market. How do you earn a competitive return in the new year, while managing risk? And, do it in a way that plays to your personal strengths, as an investor and as an emotional being. For instance, in my case, I'm so risk averse, I build entire systems around it. Because as I see it, I'm at the point in life where 10 years of zero return, as awful as that would be on paper, would not change my life much. For others, they seek or ignore risk (or both), because they are confident that time and their investing acumen will win out. I hope it does. But I'm a risk manager first. This article is about one way I'm attempting to manage risk at a most unique time in market history. At the same time, I want to exploit all the return potential I can, in as many market areas as I can. But there's only so much time to do research and make ongoing decisions. So for a part of my portfolio, one that sits alongside my bond ladder and collared S&P 500 and other macro ETF positions, I created a 10-ETF portfolio. And I'll keep returning to it during the year here. Not to the extent I will for my investing group, but in a way that at least keeps a stream of high-level insights for the broader audience here. ETF portfolios: from 2 to 10 I wrote recently about a 2-ETF portfolio concept. Emphasis on ""concept."" I do plenty of investing and trading, such that if I tried to write a 1,000 word article here on everything I do with my own money, I'd never sleep. Or eat. Two ETFs can handle a lot of the load as markets continue to act in a ""binary"" risk on/risk off fashion. But there are naturally inherent limits to a 2-ETF portfolio. So I also created a broader, more granular 10-ETF version. That's what I'll present below, after making sure to clarify what it is and isn't, and what the mission is here. What I'm most focused on heading into 2026 is combining my most tenured skill set: PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT, with identification of and commentary about, some of the many tickers I scout regularly throughout each year. I chart about 1,000 stocks regularly, and hundreds of ETFs. And that has led me to the broader view that going forward, and until further notice (if ever), investing is more of an organized casino. In that it doesn't matter as much which table or wheel and chair you sit at. It is understanding how to play the game all night and go home with no less than what you came in with. This is easier in investing than in a casino. Though I have heard the stock market referred to as ""a casino with better lighting."" And the way it operates today, with leverage, options, algorithms, AI and indexing a.k.a. the ""passive flow,"" I see that characterization more every day. I will be devoting A LOT of time during 2026 to teach investors the concept of the 2-ETF portfolio. The main reason: as many commenters on my last article here about 2-ETF portfolios noted, this portfolio building and rotation/allocation aspect of investing is not frequently taught to DIY investors. They have to learn it on their own, by wading through a sea of gimmicks, Tic-Toc and Instagram con men, and a lot of hype aimed at selling to their greed, and not the investing version of their so-called ""better angels."" The responses to that article and others I've written like it, here and elsewhere, has convinced me that after five years of looking for where my experience can be most useful, the crowd is telling me it is exactly where I hoped it would be. To summarize before we move on to the details: there's no shortage of ""timely picks."" There IS a shortage of how to run a portfolio like a business. Or more like a sports team, where the ETFs are the players. The mission is to have them work together toward a common goal. YOUR goal. And as was made abundantly clear in the comments to that last article, there is a wide range of ways people want to use portfolio construction. So much so that our best foot forward is for me to show what I'm doing as a TEMPLATE, an example to be learned from, using real live examples. Then its up to each DIY investor to put that ""Y"" to work. And do it ""yourself."" OK, that's the necessary preamble, since without it, the specifics below won't mean nearly as much. When someone here writes an article about ""why I think this stock is going up,"" we all know instantly what's going on. What's going on here? Choosing, using and not losing How's that for a rhyme? But it is a succinct way to explain what my 10-ETF portfolio is about. More on this below, including a glimpse at the list of 10. This is less the focus, as it is the rotation among them that likely produces higher returns with lower risk of major loss. Choosing a set of 10 ETFs, which can be adjusted but not frequently. Hopefully no more than once a year, and then perhaps just one or two of them. Here's the current basket. Next to the tickers is the most and least I'll own of each at any time. And the ""neutral"" weighting, which is my best guess as to what the long-term allocation to each would be, assuming no changes to the players here. ETFYourself.com Using them all at all times, but putting guardrails around how much or little of each to own. That's part scientific (I'm 32 years into the art of portfolio building with ETFs), but much more about personal preferences. So while I always invite other folks' ideas about what else to include in a portfolio, there's no such thing as ""that's a bad ETF to use for this."" It is personal preference, and perhaps to some degree the results you get will be a direct result of how effective your ETF selection was. More likely, the risk is assuming that you have ""diversification"" where in fact you have ""de-worse-i-fication,"" in that you mistakenly think you are diversified. But in fact, you have a lot of parts that move together. So why have several of them? Not losing is what this is designed for. If your main reaction to this 10-ETF portfolio is ""I would never buy XYZ"" or ""use ABC instead of XYZ,"" you are missing the point. This is a structure, and I'm showing you the results of my research into it, backed by tons of committed time. It works for me in concept and historically in bottom-line, based on where it got me in career and life. But don't use my specifics any more than you wish to. This is about learn to use ETFs as the flexible vehicle they are. These modern tools are often overused or underused. An ETF is a just a wrapper around a set of assets with a pre-determined purpose: to track a segment of the investment markets. It is also about playing offense and defense… at the same time. I've labeled the 10 ETFs under offense or defense. What does that mean? I’m always invested to participate in a rising market. However, I’m also hedged. Always. Sometimes, the “defense” part of the portfolio can overcome the weakness of the offense side in rough markets. If you buy into that concept, you have a fighting chance to make money in ANY market. Something most investors can’t do. The other thing, as I emphasize in my live sessions with the group all the time, is this: be humble and curious throughout the process. We all have shorter attention spans than when we were kids. And unfortunately, we now live in a most arrogant and skeptical world. I ask that you approach building a portfolio like it's a business. Your business. And in business, the first goal is to stay in business. And to treat the journey as critical to reaching the destination. You don’t need to become a market and ETF expert. You just need to avoid being overconfident. Building an ETF portfolio. Simply and effectively. I landed on my final 10 for now based on a lot of analysis and soul-searching. There are 50 others I could use. But my process was to keep eliminating anything that was too highly correlated to the others. That's easy to identify now, in a market that leaves no prisoners every time it melts down. Here's a summary of some key questions I pose in this 10-ETF portfolio creation process, and my personal answers to them. Yours can be whatever you want them to be. Based on your comments, I'll determine how much effort I should devote to this ""know thyself"" part of the process. ETFYourself.com Now, let's summarize the players, and how I came down to these for now. OFFENSE ETFs Core Equity (QQQ and DIA) The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ( QQQ ) tracks the Nasdaq 100 and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust ( DIA ) tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Why not just use an S&P 500 ( SPY ) ETF as I do in a 2-ETF portfolio? Because the Allocation portfolio aims to be a bit more granular in its approach. Because you can do that with 10 ETFs instead of two. Over time, the rise of QQQ has made it highly correlated with SPY. So I don’t feel I need both. And I like the Dow Industrials ( DIA ) because it is a 30-stock index, and thus easy to peer inside of to see what’s carrying it. Most importantly, over time QQQ and DIA have made very effective pair to rotate among. Note that I’m not choosing between them as in one or the other. I am allocating among them. Here's an article I wrote on this a while back. Data by YCharts Supplemental Equity Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ( RSP ) is the S&P 500, but weighted equally. So the giant stocks do not dominate. As such, it is more an indication of how smaller companies within the S&P 500 are doing, without dropping down to very small stocks. It thus represents a high-level complement to the team of QQQ and DIA. And I dislike small caps, and now realize that most often, those ETFs and RSP move in sync. And quite unlike QQQ. Data by YCharts Commodities ( PDBC ) PDBC invests in a broad basket of commodities, with an emphasis on energy. There’s some gold, silver and copper in here as well, in addition to some agricultural commodities. An inflation-fighter, and part of the offense squad. Bitcoin ( IBIT ) IBIT is the largest ETF tracking the spot price of Bitcoin, and while I’m not a huge crypto fan, I just don’t think we can exclude it in this era. At least for now. If we reach the point where Bitcoin acts too much like the stock market, I won’t need it. DEFENSE ETFs Core Bond ( GOVI ) GOVI invests in US Treasury securities, from 1 year to 30 years’ maturity. That gives me diversification across most of the Treasury yield curve. Why no corporates, municipals or high yield bonds here? Because to me, we are so far into an era of excessively friendly credit conditions, all I need this part of my portfolio to do is act as a stabilizer versus stocks. Cash & Equivalents ( BIL ) This is the other part of the Treasury curve: the shortest part in terms of maturity, though not always the lower yielding. This is the one ETF that is common to both the 2-ETF portfolio and this one. Gold ( GLD ) I noted above that the commodities ETF includes some gold. However, not enough to make a full position unless I held a lot of PDBC. That’s not likely most of the time, so I isolate gold in this defense section of the Allocation portfolio. Hedge/Inverse ( TBF ) I have been investing in ETFs that essentially provide a “short” position that profits from declines in stocks or bonds since before ETFs existed. OK, not technically. But I started using inverse mutual funds. And the mutual funds I managed back in the day included inverse securities. To me, risk management means you are NEVER “all in.” Or all out. To help manage the spectrum in between, I have some ETFs that capitalize on rising market areas, while at the same time have some that can capitalize on falling market areas. I could easily have an inverse stock ETF here. But in modern markets, hedging interest rates covers a lot of ground. This one, TBF, essentially profits from rising long-term Treasury bond rates. But as shown here, it also frequently provides a less-obvious hedge on the equity market. Data by YCharts As I see it, much of the time, the risk of stocks is countered either by what TBF does, or by what GOVI does, even though those two ETFs move opposite each other. My solution: allocate between them, but with an emphasis on the one that has the trend in its favor. Data by YCharts Wildcard The last position in this 10-ETF allocation portfolio is the “wildcard.” That means it is likely something that I will typically take a very small position in, but which can move dramatically at times. The current occupant of this roster position is the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF ( VIXY ), which profits from rising stock market volatility. The stock market is nearly always more volatile when it is falling. So VIXY is a compact way to hedge a large amount of stock exposure. This shows just how volatile VIXY is, but also that it is a nice little offset to equity exposure. Data by YCharts Because in times of market disruption (2025, 2022, 2020, 2000-2003, etc.) it typically responds by spiking higher in value. But given its large price swings, this is a small position, a “tail” in the portfolio if you will. Speaking of 2020, and the pandemic crash, that gain in VIXY is so big, putting it on the page with the last five years' chart above made all the numbers look to small. So here it is, isolated: Data by YCharts That's only about four weeks' time. SPY fell by 29%. How much did VIXY gain? 405%! In other words, it did a ""5X"" up move. I sometimes use SPY put options in this wildcard slot, but VIXY is a great surrogate. At least unless and until something more precise comes along. I only want one thing from VIXY, as it is usually the smallest portfolio member among the 10 ETFs. I want it to spike temporarily when the market freaks out. Because in the future, I'm not counting on ""buy the dip"" to work as well as it has. How defense and offense work together That's the 10 ETF portfolio construction. This article simply aimed to introduce it, the rationale, and the players (the ETFs I'm using). This is a version of what I've done in different forms, all the way back to when mutual funds were the tools, since there were only a few ETFs. The key is not what ETFs I own, it is how they work together, and play their respective roles. And, how I (or you) raise and lower these 10 ""levers"" to make the machine go the way you want it to. For me, risk management is ALWAYS the priority. It doesn't have to be for you. A final thought on ""tail risk"" Think about it this way: if I even have 1% in VIXY, and a repeat performance in the markets as in early 2020 were to happen, 1% of my portfolio just moved to 5% of the total portfolio's value. That means the other 99% of portfolio, which has plenty of defensive tools already, could lose nearly 4% of its value and I'd still be break-even. That's a microcosm of how I was able to do this (from my broader audited returns from back in my advisory days). From 2/19/20 through 3/23/20, VIXY, BIL, and lighter stock exposure were part of what allowed my then-clients to sidestep that messy market. I have the full performance and auditor's letter, and we've put it on our website, as I suspect some will want to verify something like this (I would too). Sungarden Investment Publishing I had similar experiences in early 2025, 2022, 2008 and 2000-2003. Have I missed out some upside? You betcha! But I did it willingly. And now, with the influx of ETFs with leverage, and the growth of options availability to investors, it is much easier than ever to try to capture more of that upside without putting a lot of capital in harm's way. Next up: the ongoing story of the 10-ETF portfolio And, the 2-ETF portfolios I built and continue to build. 2026 is likely to be a year in which some investors will succeed beyond what they thought was possible. That might be because the S&P 500, Bitcoin and other offense ETFs continue to fly higher. Or it could be because people learn more about how to play true defense, alongside their offense. The macro environment is going to be the key to the new year. And with this 10-ETF setup, and the ability to rotate within that basket, I feel set for whatever comes our way.",PDBC|IBIT|GOVI|BIL|GLD|TBF|IBIT:CA|QQQ|DIA|SPY|VIXY|VOO|IVV|IWM|SP500|SPX|NDX|DJI,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-28 14:00:00

56497136,649129,1766930428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56497136.jpeg,Santa Didn’t Come For Bitcoin ETFs: $782 Million Walks Out The Door,https://bitcoinist.com/santa-didnt-come-for-bitcoin-etfs-782-million-walks-out-the-door/,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs suffered heavy withdrawals over the Christmas week as investors pulled about $782 million from the products, according to data from SoSoValue. Bitcoin’s market price stayed roughly near $87,000, even as the funds lost cash. The drop trimmed total net assets in US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs to about $113.5 billion, down from levels above $120 billion earlier in December. Major Funds Lead The Withdrawals Friday was the worst single day of the stretch, when ETFs recorded a combined $276 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for nearly $193 million of that exit, while Fidelity’s FBTC lost about $74 million. Grayscale’s GBTC saw more modest redemptions during the same period. Friday also marked the sixth straight day of outflows — the longest streak since early autumn — with more than $1.1 billion draining out across that run. Seasonal Pressure Or A Bigger Shift According to Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, holiday moves and thin market depth can cause short-term withdrawals as desks close for the holidays. He expects institutional flows to come back when trading desks reopen in early January and thinks a shift toward Fed easing in 2026 — markets are pricing roughly 75–100 bps of cuts — could lift demand for ETFs. Based on reports from Glassnode, however, the trend looks broader than holiday noise: the 30-day moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs has been negative since early November, signaling sustained outflows by institutional players. Metals Take Center Stage Meanwhile, gold and silver enjoyed a banner run while crypto saw pullbacks. Gold futures climbed above $4,550, hitting multiple records this year. Silver topped $75 per ounce and has gained about 150% year-to-date. That rally has prompted some investors to reallocate away from crypto. Market experts like Louis Navellier said that with central banks active in the metal markets and volatility lower, gold has attracted flows that might otherwise have gone into digital assets. Outspoken critic Peter Schiff wrote on social media that Bitcoin’s inability to rise alongside other risk assets raises doubts about its near-term upside. What This Means For Institutional Demand ETFs are widely watched as a proxy for institutional appetite. Based on the latest figures, institutions appear to be pulling back after a period when they were a key driver of crypto markets. The divergence between rising precious metals and a modest decline in Bitcoin — about 6% year-to-date — has reinforced that view. Some of the selling likely reflects rebalancing and cash needs during the holidays. Some of it may reflect a rethinking of risk allocation by large allocators. Reports suggest flows could normalize when trading activity returns to normal after the holiday break. If rate markets continue to price in easing and bank-led crypto infrastructure becomes easier for big investors to use, ETF inflows might resume.

Unless there’s enhanced volatility in the few remaining days of 2025, the S&P 500 is about to close with an 18% surge, the Nasdaq Composite with a 22% increase, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a 15% jump. And then, there are the precious metals. The two largest – gold and silver – had their best year to date , with multiple new all-time highs. Gold is up by 75% YTD, while silver has become the third-largest global asset after a 172% surge since January’s opening price as its market cap has shot up to $4.5 trillion. If there’s one big disappointing asset class, it’s actually cryptocurrencies. Although BTC and several altcoins marked fresh peaks throughout the year, most are about to end 2025 in the red. But now, the popular analysts at the Kobeissi Letter believe 2026 will be even better, and the question is: can crypto overperform? 2026 to Be Incredible? 2026 is going to be incredible: Trump is calling for interest rates to 1% and promising stimulus checks, AI CapEx is nearing $1 trillion per year, and precious metals are making history. All as mass de-regulation is in full swing and the US and China are in an all-out AI arms… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 27, 2025 Some of the reasons why the analysts believe investors should expect a massive 2026 include the AI boom, including the China-US war on it, the mass deregulation in the sector, midterm elections in the States, growing retail participation in certain markets, and the Fed’s policy. The US central bank has already reduced the key interest rates three consecutive times in 2025, and it ended its quantitative tightening policy. It’s expected to continue cutting the rates next year, especially with a new Fed Chair on board. Trump has called for 1% interest rates and has also promised stimulus checks from the tariffs. Will Crypto Join? As mentioned above, bitcoin and the altcoins have mostly underperformed on an annual basis. If all the factors above align, risk-on assets like the digital asset industry should thrive, at least in theory, especially if US borrowing becomes even cheaper, and other asset classes, such as precious metals and stocks, reach a decisive peak . Experts anticipate capital rotation into more lucrative industries, including crypto. AI would likely continue to be the most favorable niche, but BTC has become a lot more legitimate among institutional investors, especially since the Trump administration took office. In any case, 2026 is indeed shaping up to be quite eventful for all financial markets, but bitcoin and the altcoins have a long path to catch up after the controversial 2025. Or, perhaps they now have more room for growth.

Here’s Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-back-at-a-major-horizontal-support-zone-heres-next-target/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) published a new weekly chart analysis of XRP showing a potential turning point for the asset. His post focuses on price positioning, momentum indicators, and a horizontal support zone that has held across multiple market cycles. At first glance, the weekly structure appears heavy. XRP continues to drift lower from its peak in July , with red candles dominating recent weeks. The move lacks the sharp volatility often seen at major turning points. However, the analyst reveals a crucial setup beneath the surface. On the weekly chart, $XRP is back at a major horizontal support zone while momentum indicators are flashing extreme oversold conditions. The Stochastic RSI is sitting at extreme oversold levels, showing that selling pressure has already done a lot of work. Markets don’t… pic.twitter.com/d2YWUwcoRI — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 27, 2025 XRP Returns to a Key Weekly Support Zone The chart puts XRP directly on a long-standing horizontal support level near $1.90. This zone previously acted as resistance during earlier consolidation phases and later flipped into support during expansion. The asset has now returned to that area after months of decline. According to the chart, this is not a random level. It marks a region where buyers previously absorbed supply. Stochastic RSI Signals Selling Exhaustion The analyst pairs this level with momentum data from the Stochastic RSI on the weekly timeframe. The indicator sits deep in oversold territory . The Stochastic RSI is at 0.41, which reflects sustained downside pressure rather than a brief pullback. His post stresses that this condition already reflects heavy selling. He writes, “The Stochastic RSI is sitting at extreme oversold levels, showing that selling pressure has already done a lot of work.” The emphasis stays on exhaustion, suggesting XRP is near the end of this extended bearish phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Context Reinforces the Setup The chart also highlights a historical comparison. Earlier oversold Stochastic RSI readings appear near previous cycle lows. In those cases, the asset did not reverse because conditions looked strong. Reversals followed once sellers lost momentum. Steph Is Crypto addressed this directly, stating, “Markets don’t turn because things look ‘bullish.’” He added, “They turn when there’s little fuel left on one side.” The chart shows that the downside move has run out of fuel. Focus Remains on Structure That perspective aligns with the chart’s structure. The weekly candles are compressing near support, and volatility is contracting. None of this confirms a reversal, but it signals balance shifting after an extended move. If XRP can begin a breakout from this phase, the current setup could supercharge that move, sending the asset to new heights.

And while the common feeling may be that the list of crypto tax havens is shrinking, economic sense, although not that common anymore, still prevails in some European and other capitals. Ahead of the New Year’s Eve, when the time is ripe for the right decisions, coin owners across the Old Continent brace for what often seems as inevitable – taxation, especially given the growing enforcement of the EU’s new rules for the market that affect this area, too. The next tax filing season is set to begin soon in many countries, and while most crypto enthusiasts will part with a portion of their wealth, others won’t. The latter scenario is still perfectly legal in certain jurisdictions, as a number of nations in Europe and around the world recognize the benefit of having Bitcoin in their systems without taxing it too much. First things first – how is crypto taxed? The taxation of crypto depends on how it’s treated. While it’s unlikely to be recognized as money or currency, it’s often accepted as a capital asset or property, sometimes used for payment and remuneration. For individuals, there are two main levies – personal income tax and capital gains tax. Salaries, staking and mining rewards as well as earned interest are often subject to the first. Selling coins for fiat, and crypto swaps in some cases, falls into the second category. The same applies to purchases made with cryptocurrency, which involve conversion that may carry profit. Crypto incomes and profits deemed resulting from business activities are usually taxed as such. Companies pay corporate taxes and collect value-added or sales tax. Permanent residence, and even citizenship, is the key condition to take advantage of favorable tax regimes, which means spending a number of days in a country each year, typically around 180. Holding periods also matter as many crypto-friendly governments relieve long-term investments from taxation, while only a few provide the benefits regardless of the time of ownership. Starting January 1, Europeans will also face new tax reporting requirements under the EU’s Directive on Administrative Cooperation ( DAC8 ), on top of the rules already introduced with the Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) legislation, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Under the regulation, crypto service providers such as exchanges and brokers will have to report user and transaction data to tax authorities, which in turn will improve information sharing between governments. Companies have until July 1, 2026, to comply. A few European nations still offer crypto tax exemptions Germany is perhaps Europe’s best-known example of the holding rule. Investors in the Federal Republic do not owe tax on their profits from trading digital assets if they are sold at least a year after purchase. Capital gains under €1,000 from the short-term sale of coins are also exempted. Despite multiple attempts by some political factions to scrap the benefit, most recently by the Green Party and the Left, it still holds. However, crypto-related income, including from staking and mining rewards, is taxed, and the rate may reach 45% as per Germany’s progressive scale, depending on gross annual income. Portugal is another EU member state that refrains from taxing year-old investments in crypto. It used to be one of the most tax-friendly places in the Union, but in 2023 Lisbon slapped a flat 28% tax on profits from assets held for less than 365 days. The gains on those kept for longer remain exempted. At the same time, income linked to cryptocurrencies is taxed, between 14.5% and 53% in the case of salaries paid in digital coins, as well as revenues from mining or professional trading. Passive income, including staking rewards and interest from lending, is taxed at 28%. Malta , which has attracted a significant volume of blockchain business over the years, does not tax long-term crypto investments either. However, frequent transactions are considered trading, and the profit from such is viewed as business income, taxed progressively up to 35%. The crypto-friendly British territory of Gibraltar , not part of the EU, does not tax gains from holding, selling or trading crypto assets, except when they constitute business activity, in which case income and corporate taxes apply. Moving to the East, historically crypto-friendly Slovenia will slap a 25% capital gains tax on profits made when selling or spending crypto on January 1. The small nation is clearly losing its crypto tax haven crown amid reforms driven by the implementation of EU law. A new tax on profits from coin disposals, set at an 8% flat rate, will hit crypto investors in Cyprus, also on the first day of the New Year. Until now, private individuals trading cryptocurrencies were spared from the capital gains tax, while those involved in business activities weren’t. Switzerland, at the heart of Europe and home to its Crypto Valley, though not a member of the EU, classifies investors differently, depending on their status. Individual “private” traders are exempt from the duty to pay capital gains tax on cryptocurrency sales. However, they are subject to a wealth tax on their holdings as well as tax on income from staking and mining. Professional investors are obliged to pay income tax on all profits. Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Georgia collects neither capital gains tax nor personal income tax on trading profits from individuals, as this kind of income is generally considered foreign-sourced. Income from mining, however, is deemed domestic and subject to a 20% income tax. Cryptocurrency remuneration received by freelancers or employees is viewed as regular income and taxed accordingly, although a simple registration as an individual entrepreneur ensures preferential treatment, with just 1% charged on annual turnovers of up to 500,000 lari (approx. $185,000). Asian countries lead in terms of crypto-friendly taxation Asia is now home to a number of tax-friendly destinations. For example, income tax and capital gains tax for individual investors are set to 0% in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), part of which is crypto hub, Dubai. Mining is not taxed, unless it’s a commercial activity, when corporate tax is applicable. On the other end of the vast continent, in Hong Kong , long-term crypto investments of individuals are not taxed, but frequent trading bearing the features of a business is. Up to 17% is charged in this case. Crypto income received in the form of salaries, payments and rewards is taxable, too. Crypto taxation follows similar principles in Singapore and Malaysia, where buying, holding and selling digital assets in the case of long-term individual investments are non-taxable events, while receiving crypto as income from business activities is taxed. Thailand is attracting a growing of number of crypto investors and people involved in the industry with its crypto-friendly tax regime. This year, the country introduced a five-year personal income tax exemption for profits from coin and token trading. However, this is only valid for transactions carried out through domestic platforms, exchanges or brokers licensed by the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Profits generated on foreign and decentralized platforms or derived from peer-to-peer trades are not covered. The exemption does not apply to other sources of crypto income either, such as yields from crypto lending, interest on deposits, and profits from derivative instruments. In these cases, progressive rates can reach a maximum of 35%. Holders of Thailand’s Long-Term Resident (LTR) visa, including those that fall in the category “Work-From-Thailand Professional,” are exempt from personal income tax even if their income is foreign-sourced, when it’s transferred to a Thai-based trading venue. Which are the most exotic crypto tax havens? Among nations in the Americas, El Salvador offers both residents and foreign investors a tax-free experience regarding capital gains. The country, which recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, does not tax crypto income, including from mining or staking, if it’s not stemming from business activities. Residents of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico can rely on a 0% capital gains tax rate, but only on the gains accrued after establishing residency on the island. What’s more, they are not required to pay U.S. federal tax on locally sourced income. Three British Overseas Territories – namely, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands – complete the picture of tax havens in the wider American region. In all of them, crypto activities such as buying, holding, and selling crypto assets for profit are exempt from income or capital gains tax.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $4.22 Market cap $88.76M 24-hour trading volume $12.18M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $1.41 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $4.29 24-hour low $4.14 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 5.06% (High) 50-day SMA $4.35 200-day SMA $7.53 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Fear and Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) ORDI price analysis On December 28, ORDI’s price rose by 1.71% in 24 hours following a sell-off that had lasted months. Its trading volume fell 27.26%, showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart indicates that ORDI has been in a bearish trend since late September. It now trades along the Williams Alligator trendlines, signaling a potentially uneventful market after the price dropped below support levels (78.60% Fibonacci level) and key moving averages. The coin had little momentum this week, slowing its drop. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index (RSI) is in neutral territory at 52.24. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart indicates that ORDI is moving upwards at the $4.20 mark with MACD confirmation (0.075). The William Alligator trendlines indicate that its volatility is rising.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating an extreme fear sentiment among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which has risen above $87,000, following a brief recovery. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it vulnerable during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity amplifies price movements. Recent news BitVMX has launched the first cross-chain bridge connecting Bitcoin Ordinals to Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. Concurrent upgrades to Unisat Wallet’s UTXO management improved user experience for BRC-20 token interactions. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or stringent regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction indicates how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17.

While the rest of the market looks on, the big-money players have quietly gone on a $350 million spending spree since December 26 . The money flow index You can see this pretty clearly in the data. The Money Flow Index, which tracks how money moves in and out, shows that smaller investors aren’t really putting real cash behind these price moves. In other words, when Ethereum goes up, they’re not rushing in to buy. From December 18 through 24, Ethereum’s price went up, but the Money Flow Index went down. That’s backwards from what you’d want to see. It show s re gular folks just don’t trust what’s happening with the price right now. Retail investors are unlikely to begin purchasing until the Money Flow Index rises over 37, according to experts. It’s still below that as of right now, which raises the question of whether Ethereum can maintain its value without the small players entering the market . What the charts are saying Chart users believe they are aware of what the whales are viewing. An inverted head-and-shoulders pattern may be emerging on Ethereum’s chart. It may sound complicated, but it simply means that if specific conditions are met, the price may shift from falling to rising. There’s another clue worth noting. What traders refer to as a bullish divergence is being displayed by the Relative Strength Index, or RSI. Ethereum’s price reached a lower low between November 4 and December 25, yet the RSI actually reached a greater low during that time. Even if the price hasn’t yet shown it, this typically indicates that selling pressure is beginning to lessen. But Ethereum’s got some walls to break through first. The biggest one right now is $3,050. Get past that, and the next stop is $3,390. If Ethereum can punch through $3,390, the chart guys think it could run all the way to $4,400. That’s what the pattern suggests anyway. Of course , things coul d go the other way too. Drop below $2,800 and this whole setup falls apart, potentially sending prices down to $2,620. This year, futures trading has been just insane. According to CryptoQuant researcher Darkfost , Binance processed more than $6.74 trillion in ETH futures in 2025. That is about twice as much as we observed the previous year. Price vs. network performance As we’re closing out 2025, Ethereum’s stuck under $3,000. The second-biggest crypto is trading about 41% below where it peaked in August. That’s pretty rough considering how much the network itself has improved. However, the real utilization figures paint a different picture. Ethereum reached a weekly average of over 1.73 million transactions on December 24, making it a record day. It was at its highest point ever. This expansion is being driven by stablecoin transactions, DeFi technology, and Layer-2 networks. Big players making moves However, a few major players are taking significant steps forward. On December 28, BitMine Immersion Technologies purchased about 103,000 ETH, boosting their staked holdings to 257,600 coins, or around $750 million. This places them among the largest institutional holdings, with over 4 million ETH in total. Other prominent figures are pursuing other tactics. Erik Voorhees of Venice AI transferred roughly $5 million in ETH to Bitcoin Cash, while Arthur Hayes has been funneling Ethereum funds into other DeFi ventures. Tokenization of real-world assets is one element that keeps the bulls enthusiastic over the long run. In 2025, this market surged from $5.6 billion to over $18.9 billion. With more than $12 billion in tokenized assets, Ethereum dominates this market, outperforming rivals like Solana and BNB Chain. Additionally, the network manages stablecoins valued at around $170 billion. Experts in the field believe this trend has significant longevity. Tom Lee of Fundstrat predicts that Ethereum will reach between $7,000 and $9,000 in early 2026, citing the adoption of blockchain technology by traditional finance. This isn’t simply cryptocurrency hype, as evidenced by the DTCC’s announcement that they will tokenize US Treasury assets on the Canton blockchain. What happens next Chart-wise, Ethereum’s stuck in a box between $2,900 and $3,000. Market conditions are still pretty choppy. More than 40% of ETH holders are sitting on losses, and there’s high leverage in derivatives markets. The Fusaka upgrade went smoothly in early December, proving the technology keeps advancing, but turning that into price gains probably depends on institutional money flowing back in next year. Whether Ethereum can break out of this range will mostly come down to two things: if big institutional investors start buying again, and if everyday traders regain some confidence and jump back in. Right now, the whales are betting yes, but they’re mostly flying solo. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The data is collected from phishing attacks and is considered the first step in a complex supply chain of thievery. The price of a single crypto account ranges between $60 and $400, according to SecureList. Hackers capture crypto data, monetize it immediately, or keep it in a database. The final destination depends on the type and quality of the captured data. How stolen crypto data leaves phishing sites The captured crypto data leaves a phishing page in three ways: email delivery, Telegram bot delivery, or admin panel upload. The attackers also abuse legitimate services to hide their activity. These include Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, GitHub, Discord, and other similar platforms. In email delivery, the data is collected from fake HTML forms and then sent to a server-side script, usually PHP. The script then forwards the stolen details to an attacker-controlled email address. A phishing kit has a file to host the fake login page, a script to process the form, and a third file containing the attacker’s email address. However, email delivery is declining because of delays, provider blocking, and poor scalability. Instead of email, many kits now send data directly to Telegram bots. The malicious script calls the Telegram API using a bot token and chat ID. Sometimes the API call is embedded directly in the HTML code. Telegram has become a preferred channel for hackers. Stolen data arrives instantly. Operators get real-time alerts. Bots are disposable and hard to trace. And hosting does not matter much. Advanced attackers prefer admin panels. They are part of a framework or a skeleton that captures crypto data and sends it to a database. The attacker manages the data via a web interface. Admin panels provide live stats by time and country. Automated checks for credentials are included. The framework also exports data for resale or reuse. These panels are essential for organized phishing operations. Selling stolen crypto data Crypto data is valuable because it often leads to funds. The stolen data could be sold in real time or enter a resale pipeline, according to Kaspersky’s SecureList. Hackers go after exchange logins, wallet access , and fiat onramp accounts. Other targeted data includes account credentials, phone numbers, and personal details. Wallet logins with one-time codes or accounts linked to fiat onramps qualify for real-time sales. The remaining data is used for follow-up attacks. Phone numbers could be used for SMS scams or 2FA interception. Personal data is utilized for social engineering. Identification documents, voice, facial data, or selfies with documents are used for high-risk abuse. The resale pipeline starts with dump sales. Data is bundled into large archives or dumps. These contain millions of records from phishing attacks. Middlemen buy dumps for as low as $50. Offers of hacked crypto social media data. Source: SecureList . Once a dump is acquired, middlemen filter and test the data. Then, automated scripts check whether credentials still work or not. The code also sees where else they can be reused. Password reuse makes old data valuable. A login stolen years ago can still unlock a different account today. Then, the data from multiple attacks is merged. A password, phone number, and old employer record can create a single user profile. Once the stolen data is cleaned and organized, it’s ready for resale to scammers. The verified data is sold on dark web forums and Telegram channels. Telegram often acts as a storefront with pricing and buyer feedback. Prices vary based on account age, balance, linked payments, and 2FA status. Typical price ranges: Crypto accounts: $60 – $400. Social media: cents to hundreds of dollars. Messaging apps: cents to $150. Personal documents: $0.5–$125. Kaspersky’s analysis showed that 88.5% of attacks target account credentials. Around 9.5% steal personal identity data, while a mere 2% collect bank card details. The cybersecurity firm analyzed phishing attacks from January to September 2025. Stolen crypto data is a valuable asset to cybercriminals. It is stored, evaluated, traded, and reused. One phishing mistake can lead to major crypto hacks, even years later.

This milestone marks a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, reflecting renewed institutional confidence and shifting macroeconomic winds. Consequently, analysts are closely examining the drivers behind this ascent, which follows a period of consolidation. This price action represents Bitcoin’s highest valuation in the current market cycle, drawing global attention from investors and regulators alike. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Resistance at $88,000 The breach of the $88,000 level is a technically significant event. Market data from multiple exchanges confirms this upward movement, with Binance serving as a primary liquidity hub. Historically, Bitcoin has faced strong resistance near round-number psychological barriers. Therefore, a sustained hold above this level could signal further bullish momentum. The rally appears broad-based, with notable volume increases accompanying the price rise. For context, Bitcoin’s trading volume spiked by approximately 35% in the 24 hours leading to the breakout, indicating strong buyer participation. Several concurrent factors likely contributed to this surge. Firstly, recent filings for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) by major traditional finance institutions have created a sustained narrative of institutional adoption. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions, including evolving monetary policy expectations, have influenced asset allocation. Finally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for 2024, continues to shape long-term supply dynamics. The table below outlines key price milestones in Bitcoin’s recent trajectory: Date Price Milestone Primary Catalyst Q3 2023 Break above $30,000 Initial ETF application wave Q1 2024 Surpass $60,000 First spot ETF approvals Today Break above $88,000 Macro shifts & institutional inflows Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market Rally Bitcoin’s movement often sets the tone for the broader digital asset market. In this instance, the rally has shown a partial correlation with major altcoins. However, Bitcoin’s dominance index—measuring its share of the total crypto market capitalization—has also increased slightly. This suggests capital is prioritizing the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin amidst the volatility. Market structure analysis reveals that open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen cautiously, avoiding the extreme leverage that preceded previous major corrections. The current environment differs markedly from the 2021 bull market. Regulatory frameworks, particularly in the United States and European Union, are more defined. Furthermore, the market infrastructure is more robust, with established custodians and regulated trading venues. These developments contribute to a more mature trading landscape. Key on-chain metrics to watch include: Exchange Net Flow: A negative flow, indicating more BTC leaving exchanges, often suggests long-term holding sentiment. MVRV Ratio: This metric compares market value to realized value, helping assess whether the asset is over or undervalued relative to its cost basis. Active Addresses: An increase signifies growing network usage and user adoption. Expert Perspective on Sustainable Growth Financial analysts emphasize the importance of sustainable volume and derivative market health. “A price move supported by spot market buying and real capital inflow is fundamentally healthier than one driven by perpetual swap funding,” notes a market strategist from a leading crypto research firm. Data from Glassnode indicates that the proportion of Bitcoin supply last active over a year ago remains near all-time highs, pointing to strong conviction among long-term holders. This holder behavior creates a potential supply shock, reducing sell-side pressure. Simultaneously, macroeconomic analysts link the move to shifting expectations around interest rates and currency debasement concerns. While past performance never guarantees future results, the convergence of technical, on-chain, and macro factors provides a multifaceted explanation. The rally’s sustainability will likely depend on continued institutional adoption and the absence of negative regulatory shocks. Global adoption metrics, such as Bitcoin as legal tender in certain nations, also contribute to its foundational narrative as a decentralized asset. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $88,000 represents a major milestone, underscoring its resilience and growing integration within the global financial system. This move is supported by technical breakout patterns, institutional investment flows, and a maturing market infrastructure. While volatility remains an inherent characteristic, the current advance appears grounded in a broader set of fundamentals compared to previous cycles. The Bitcoin price action will continue to be a critical barometer for digital asset sentiment and the evolving narrative of decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to rise above $88,000? The rise is attributed to a combination of factors: increased institutional adoption via ETFs, favorable macroeconomic shifts, technical buying after breaking key resistance levels, and long-term positive sentiment around the upcoming halving event. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Investment decisions depend on individual risk tolerance and financial goals. The current price is at a cycle high, and while the trend is positive, cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy. Q3: How does this price affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often leads the market. A strong BTC rally can boost overall sentiment and capital inflow into the crypto sector, but “altcoin” performance varies based on their individual project developments and market cycles. Q4: Could the price drop back below $88,000? Yes. Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. A price breakthrough needs to be confirmed over time. Retests of previous resistance levels, which now become support, are common technical phenomena. Q5: What is the significance of the Bitcoin halving in relation to this price? The halving, which reduces the block reward for miners, cuts the new supply of Bitcoin. Historically, this scarcity mechanism has been a bullish catalyst in the months following the event, as it alters the supply-demand equilibrium.

However, the new rapidly growing cheap cryptocurrency is Mutuum Finance. The project is priced only at $0.035 during the current presale phase and is yet available for purchase before mainstream exposure to the marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is picking up pace at a dramatically faster rate than anticipated, where the altcoin has been able to raise a staggering $19.5 million in funding at a time when Presale Phase 6 is at 99% sold out status, meaning investors have less time remaining before it closes. Contrary to Ethereum, the new crypto, selling at a relatively much lower price, offers levels of potentially skyrocketing leverage, compared to its established direct competitors. Ethereum (ETH) Faces Buildup Around Significant Support Level Prior to Future Rally Ethereum’s (ETH) recent move showcased a sweep of liquidity and a clear transition in the market structure based on a demand zone. This correction indicates nothing but sound risk management on the part of the market players, who are simply absorbing the liquidity instead of selling it off. It is also worth noting that if ETH returns to the lower demand zone and is accepted materially well in the region, it may open the gates to a rotation towards the $3,300-$3,400 supply zone, in which the market momentum accelerates. For cryptocurrency traders on the lookout for investment ideas, the sound market action of ETH indicates a solid market trend. Simultaneously, projects like MUTM are in the radar of traders who are on the lookout for asymmetric investments in the upcoming bull trend. 99% of Phase 6 sold Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully raised an astonishing figure of $19.5 million from its presale phase, which is in phase 6 and is reaching its completion phase. From an initial price of $0.01 in phase 1 to $0.035 in phase 6 and finally to $0.06 for its listing, MUTM is expected to see an incredible growth of 600%. Only $800 million tokens are already sold, and there are a staggering 18,590 holders of its tokens. Phase 6 is well over 99% sold out with just a few tokens left for sale at this price. Phase 7 is just around the corner with an expected 20% price rise scheduled, there is no better time to buy than now. Mutuum Finance is the next big crypto and it’s making its niche in the DeFi space while providing early investors with not just usage but tremendous growth. Roadmap Milestones: From Code to Mainnet Mutuum Finance has started moving through Phase 2 – “Building Mutuum”, concentrating on fundamental technological development: Completing smart contract programming Thorough testing of protocols internally Front and Back End Development for the Decentralized Platform Implementation of sophisticated risk management systems for safe and efficient operations After completion of Phase 2, Phase 3 – “Finalizing Mutuum Finance” shall enter into effect, which shall include testnet launch before the launch of its mainnet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the next-big crypto that can potentially outperform Ethereum (ETH) with regard to percentage growth. Phase 6 is more than 99% sold out with $19.5M raised and over 18,590+ holders, which presents an exceptional opportunity for early investors to acquire tokens for $0.035, approximately 50% less than its launch price of $0.06. MUTM has a dual P2C & P2P based lending system with real DeFi use cases and an aggressive development roadmap that is going towards testing and mainnet launch phases.

According to market trackers, the token is down about 30% in the fourth quarter of 2025, yet some analysts say the current weakness may be part of a larger build-up that has preceded strong rallies before. Investors and commentators are watching price action closely as debate grows over whether the token is setting up for a sharp rebound or more weakness. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecasts For 2026 Range From $65K To $250K As Sentiment Hits ‘Extreme Fear’ Historical Accumulation Patterns Based on reports from chart watchers, XRP has shown what some call repeatable accumulation phases in past cycles. One run of consolidation unfolded from early 2015 through early 2017. During that span a steep drop took XRP from $0.00885 to $0.005, and later it rallied hard, climbing to about $3.30 by January 2018. A second cycle ran from mid-2023 into late 2024, where an August to November slide saw prices fall from $0.62 to $0.50, before a quick push up to roughly $3.4 in January 2025. Analysts point to these past moves as a pattern that could provide clues about what happens next. Recent Downtrend And Support Levels Reports show that since October 2025, XRP has fallen from about $2.8 to the current price near $1.84. Technical commentators have highlighted that the $1.8–$2 band, which acted as resistance earlier, may now be acting as support after recent trading. One analyst framed the present setup as an ABC reset, a short-term corrective structure that sometimes precedes renewed upward movement. Still, traders are split; some see a base forming, while others view the decline as evidence of continued selling pressure.

The potential end of a long-running SEC case, the arrival of XRP-focused ETFs, and pending legislation known as the Clarity Act were all cited as items that might change investor sentiment. One market watcher went so far as to say this could become the “most hated” rally, a phrase meant to describe a sudden surge that comes while many remain doubtful and frustrated. Utility Versus Price Several observers have urged a focus on real-world use. According to Aljarrah, the token’s value comes from practical utility and improved liquidity, which allows larger transfers with fewer tokens and makes the payment rails more efficient. People obsess over price, but XRP’s value is in its utility. A higher price strengthens liquidity, efficiency, and adoption. Let the tech and leadership do the work, short-term noise doesn’t matter. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 21, 2025 Related Reading: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026 Price moves matter, he said, but not as speculation—rather as a factor that can broaden adoption by improving liquidity and network function. Traders should note that past patterns do not guarantee future results. While the accumulation thesis rests on historical parallels and technical charts, the market remains sensitive to news and flows. Selling now could mean missing gains if a rally follows, some warn; others say patience and careful sizing remain essential. For investors, the coming weeks may tell whether the current slump is the end of a retracement or the start of another climb.

Crypto commentator Amonyx (@amonyx) shared a chart highlighting one of these shocking events from November on the Kraken exchange. The chart shows XRP briefly trading as high as $91 during a short-lived pricing glitch. His post paired the image with a simple line: “Are you mentally prepared?” The message relied on the chart itself to do most of the talking. Are you mentally prepared? #XRP pic.twitter.com/EnbKcT89HM — Amonyx (@amonyx) December 27, 2025 Attention Drawn to the Kraken Chart The chart Amonyx posted shows XRP/USD on Kraken, using Heikin Ashi candles . One candle stands apart from the rest. It stretches vertically to a marked high of $91.62990, while surrounding price action remains far lower. The spike occurred during a technical error that caused momentary dislocations in reported prices. By reposting the chart, Amonyx highlighted a historical data point that many traders remember, but few revisit. The image serves as a reminder that XRP has already printed extreme rallies on a major exchange, even if briefly and under abnormal conditions. Is XRP Going to $91 Again? The Kraken spike was not the result of organic buying pressure across the market. It occurred during a glitch that affected order books and executions. The digital asset’s price reverted quickly, and liquidity remained thin at those elevated levels. While most analysts understand that this event was a temporary glitch, they still believe XRP can reach that level. Amonyx did not argue that the same mechanics would repeat under identical circumstances. However, his post suggests that the XRP army should stay ready, as the asset has limitless potential. Experts have set high targets for XRP for years, with some surpassing $100. While the event on Kraken was temporary, it could be a sign of things to come for XRP.

They point to liquidity limits and the scale required to sustain such values. Supporters, however, see XRP as the future of global finance and believe it could reach thousands of dollars . They reference historical events, like the $91 Kraken spike, as evidence that extreme outcomes are possible. For supporters, the post reinforced a belief that XRP’s upside cannot be easily boxed into conventional assumptions.

By mirroring the trades of experienced traders, retail investors can participate in markets that are often complex and volatile. This approach has opened doors for many people to explore crypto investing while leveraging the skills of professionals or seasoned enthusiasts. What is Copy Trading? Copy trading is a strategy where an investor replicates the trades of another trader in real time. When the trader being copied opens or closes a position, the same action is automatically executed in the account of the copier, typically proportionally to the amount of capital allocated. In the crypto space, copy trading platforms have become increasingly popular. Exchanges and third-party platforms now offer systems where users can follow professional traders, review their past performance, and allocate funds to copy their strategies automatically. This approach is particularly attractive for beginners who may lack the technical knowledge to analyze charts, monitor markets, or develop a trading strategy. Pros of Copy Trading One of the main advantages of copy trading is access to expertise. Novice investors can benefit from the experience of traders who have spent years understanding market dynamics, technical analysis, and risk management. By copying these traders, newcomers can potentially achieve results that would otherwise take much longer to reach through self-study. Another benefit is time efficiency. Crypto markets operate 24/7, and staying on top of price movements can be exhausting for individual traders. Copy trading automates the process, allowing investors to follow successful strategies without actively monitoring the markets around the clock. Diversification is also a significant advantage. Many platforms allow users to copy multiple traders simultaneously, spreading risk across different strategies, coins, and timeframes. This can reduce exposure to a single trader's poor decisions while enhancing potential returns. Finally, copy trading can serve as an educational tool. By observing the trades of experienced traders, beginners can learn about entry and exit points, risk management techniques, and various strategies that they might eventually apply independently. Cons of Copy Trading Despite its benefits, copy trading is not without risks. One of the primary drawbacks is over-reliance on others. If the trader being copied makes a mistake, all followers are affected proportionally. There is no guarantee of profits, and losses can accumulate rapidly if risk is not managed. Another concern is lack of control. While automation is convenient, it also means that investors have limited influence over the trades being executed. Rapid market fluctuations or sudden news events can trigger trades that may not align with the copier’s risk tolerance or investment goals. Fees and platform costs can also impact profitability. Many copy trading platforms charge commissions, spreads, or performance fees, which can reduce net returns. Additionally, past performance of a trader does not guarantee future results, making it essential to remain cautious and realistic about potential outcomes. How to Find a Trader to Copy Finding the right trader to copy requires careful research and due diligence. Start by evaluating the trader’s track record. Look for consistent performance over a significant period rather than short-term gains, and check metrics like win rate, average return, and maximum drawdown to understand their risk profile. Consider the trader’s strategy and style. Some traders focus on day trading or scalping, while others adopt long-term investment approaches. Make sure their strategy aligns with your own goals, risk tolerance, and available capital. Community feedback and reviews can also provide valuable insights. Many platforms allow users to rate traders or provide commentary on their performance, giving potential copiers a sense of reliability and credibility. Trial and Monitoring is essential. Start with a smaller allocation to test the trader’s approach before committing larger amounts of capital. Monitor performance regularly and be prepared to adjust or stop copying if results are not meeting expectations. Risk Management Tips Even when copying experienced traders, it’s important to implement personal risk management measures. Allocate only a portion of your capital to copy trading, diversify across multiple traders, and set limits on losses. Regularly review performance and remain informed about market conditions to make timely decisions if needed. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The exchange executive highlighted the need for them to meet the same rigorous standard s that ce ntralized exchanges (CEXs) are subjected to. According to Xu, a lot of existing DEX bot products require that users upload their private keys to centralized servers, where they are stored in plaintext or decryptable form. In Xu’s estimation, he believes that it creates a centralized private key risk that elevates their vulnerability to the level of CEXs in the case of a compromise. Because of this, Xu says there is a need for such products to be able to meet exchange-level security standards to protect their users. As far as he is concerned, products like DEXs and DEX bots are not truly self-custodial in the way they’re touted to be and, as a result, can potentially trigger regulatory obligations like KYC/AML in many jurisdictions as crypto continues to signal adoption. OKX’s Star Xu fire s a sh ot at DEX products In Xu’s post , he outlines wallet compromise risks, including code vulnerabilities, data leakages, and device malware, while highlighting some solutions the team at OKX is working on to address these issues, like the concept of smart accounts. According to documentation, smart accounts are a feature the team plans to introduce on the OKX wallet and will utilize TEE technology to automate trading custody keys, proving that security and usability don’t have to be mutually exclusive. For now, Xu says OKX Pay is still a conceptual product. However, over the next year, he says the team will continue to introduce more powerful capabilities to better safeguard asset security for ordinary users. Xu’s comment comes after hacking incidents reported by Cryptopolitan over the weekend that targeted DeBot, a DEX trading bot, and Flow , an L1 built for consumer apps, resulting in the loss of millions. How much was lost in the Flow exploit? According to a recent update from the Flow team, an attacker targeted a vulnerability in its execution layer and moved approximately $3.9M in assets off-network before validators caught it and executed a coordinated halt. The Foundation’s security team confirme d $3 .9 million got drained, primarily routed through bridges — Celer, Debridge, Relay, and Stargate. The attacker’s wallet has been identified and flagged, and active laundering via Thorchain/Chainflip is reportedly being tracked in real-time with freeze requests submitted to Circle, Tether, and major exchanges. Forensic analysis is also ongoing. The team claim s co ntainment is now complete as well, with the network halt validators implemented, severing exit paths while remediation is in progress. No further unauthorized activity is allegedly possible. According to the post, the confirmed funds exited represent a manageable amount and do not threaten network solvency or user funds. As such, the immediate priority is remediation and a safe restart. As for when a restart can be expected, the team claim s th ere is already a protocol fix in place that is about to enter final validation. The restart is scheduled to happen within hours pending a successful testnet validation. However, it will not happen until the fix has been fully validated.

This executive role represents one of the most significant safety positions in the AI industry today. CEO Sam Altman publicly acknowledged that advanced AI models now present “real challenges” requiring specialized oversight. The recruitment effort follows notable executive departures from OpenAI’s safety teams and comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of AI systems worldwide. OpenAI Head of Preparedness Role Defined The Head of Preparedness position carries substantial responsibility for executing OpenAI’s comprehensive safety framework. This framework specifically addresses “frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.” According to the official job description, the executive will oversee risk assessment across multiple domains. These domains include cybersecurity, biological threats, and autonomous system safety. The role requires balancing innovation with precautionary measures. Furthermore, the position demands expertise in both technical AI systems and policy development. OpenAI established its preparedness team in October 2023 with ambitious goals. The team initially focused on studying potential “catastrophic risks” across different time horizons. Immediate concerns included AI-enhanced phishing attacks and disinformation campaigns. Longer-term considerations involved more speculative but serious threats. The framework has evolved significantly since its inception. Recent updates indicate OpenAI might adjust safety requirements if competitors release high-risk models without similar protections. This creates a dynamic regulatory environment for the new executive. Evolving AI Safety Landscape and Executive Changes The search for a new Head of Preparedness follows significant organizational changes within OpenAI’s safety structure. Aleksander Madry, who previously led the preparedness team, transitioned to focus on AI reasoning research in mid-2024. Other safety executives have also departed or assumed different roles recently. These changes coincide with growing external pressure on AI companies to demonstrate responsible development practices. Multiple governments are currently drafting AI safety legislation. Industry groups have established voluntary safety standards too. Sam Altman’s public recruitment message highlighted specific concerns driving this hiring decision. He noted AI models are becoming “so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.” This creates dual-use dilemmas where defensive tools could potentially be weaponized. Similarly, Altman mentioned biological capabilities that require careful oversight. The mental health impacts of generative AI systems represent another priority area. Recent lawsuits allege ChatGPT reinforced user delusions and increased social isolation in some cases. OpenAI has acknowledged these concerns while continuing to improve emotional distress detection systems. Technical and Ethical Dimensions of AI Preparedness The Head of Preparedness role sits at the intersection of technical capability and ethical responsibility. This position requires understanding how AI systems might identify software vulnerabilities at unprecedented scale. It also demands insight into how conversational AI affects human psychology. The ideal candidate must navigate complex trade-offs between capability development and risk mitigation. They will likely collaborate with external researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations. This collaborative approach reflects industry best practices for responsible AI development. Several independent AI safety researchers have commented on the position’s importance. Dr. Helen Toner, former board member at OpenAI, emphasized that “frontier AI labs need dedicated teams focusing on catastrophic risks.” Other experts note the challenge of predicting how AI systems might behave as capabilities advance. The preparedness framework includes “red teaming” exercises where specialists attempt to identify failure modes. It also involves developing monitoring systems for deployed AI applications. These technical safeguards complement policy work on responsible deployment guidelines. Mental Health Implications of Advanced AI Systems Mental health concerns represent a particularly complex dimension of AI safety. Generative chatbots now engage millions of users in deeply personal conversations. Some individuals develop emotional dependencies on these systems. Recent research indicates both therapeutic benefits and potential harms. Certain users report improved emotional wellbeing through AI conversations. Others experience negative outcomes including increased anxiety or social withdrawal. The variability stems from individual differences and system design choices. OpenAI has implemented several safeguards in response to these concerns. ChatGPT now includes better detection of emotional distress signals. The system can suggest human support resources when appropriate. However, challenges remain in balancing accessibility with protection. The new Head of Preparedness will likely oversee further improvements in this area. They may commission external studies on AI’s psychological impacts. They might also develop industry standards for mental health safeguards in conversational AI. Cybersecurity Challenges in the Age of Advanced AI AI-enhanced cybersecurity represents another critical focus area for the preparedness team. Modern AI systems can analyze code and network configurations with superhuman speed. This enables rapid vulnerability discovery that benefits defenders. However, the same capabilities could empower malicious actors if misused. The dual-use nature of security tools creates complex governance challenges. OpenAI’s framework aims to “enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can’t use them for harm.” The cybersecurity dimension involves several specific initiatives. These include controlled access to vulnerability-finding AI systems. They also encompass partnerships with security researchers and government agencies. The preparedness team develops protocols for responsible disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities. They establish guidelines for which organizations should receive advanced security tools. These decisions balance competitive advantage against broader security benefits. The new executive will refine these protocols as AI capabilities continue advancing. Comparative Analysis of AI Safety Approaches Organization Safety Team Structure Key Focus Areas Public Transparency OpenAI Preparedness Team + Superalignment Cybersecurity, biological risks, autonomous systems Framework published, limited incident reporting Anthropic Constitutional AI team Value alignment, interpretability, harmful outputs Technical papers, safety benchmarks Google DeepMind Responsibility & Safety teams Fairness, accountability, misuse prevention Research publications, ethics reviews Meta AI Responsible AI division Bias mitigation, content moderation, privacy Transparency reports, open models The table above illustrates different organizational approaches to AI safety. Each company emphasizes different aspects based on their technical focus and corporate philosophy. OpenAI’s preparedness framework stands out for its explicit attention to catastrophic risks. However, critics note the framework relies heavily on internal assessment rather than external verification. The new Head of Preparedness may address this through increased transparency measures. They might establish independent review processes for high-risk AI capabilities. Conclusion OpenAI’s search for a new Head of Preparedness reflects the evolving maturity of AI safety practices. This critical role addresses genuine concerns about cybersecurity, mental health impacts, and other emerging risks. The executive will navigate complex technical and ethical challenges while balancing innovation with precaution. Their decisions will influence not only OpenAI’s products but potentially industry-wide safety standards. As AI capabilities continue advancing rapidly, robust preparedness frameworks become increasingly essential. The successful candidate will help shape how society harnesses AI’s benefits while mitigating its dangers responsibly. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the OpenAI Head of Preparedness do? The Head of Preparedness oversees OpenAI’s safety framework for identifying and mitigating risks from advanced AI systems. This includes assessing cybersecurity threats, mental health impacts, biological risks, and autonomous system safety while developing protocols for responsible AI deployment. Q2: Why did the previous Head of Preparedness leave the role? Aleksander Madry transitioned to focus on AI reasoning research within OpenAI in mid-2024. This reflects organizational restructuring rather than dissatisfaction with the preparedness approach. Other safety executives have also moved to different roles as OpenAI’s research priorities evolve. Q3: How serious are the mental health risks from AI chatbots? Research shows mixed impacts: some users benefit emotionally from AI conversations while others experience negative effects including increased isolation or reinforced delusions. OpenAI has implemented better distress detection and human resource suggestions, but challenges remain in balancing accessibility with protection. Q4: What are “catastrophic risks” in OpenAI’s framework? These include both immediate concerns (AI-enhanced cyberattacks, disinformation) and longer-term speculative risks (autonomous weapons, biological threats). The framework uses probability and impact assessments to prioritize different risk categories for mitigation efforts. Q5: How does OpenAI’s safety approach compare to other AI companies? OpenAI emphasizes catastrophic risk prevention more explicitly than some competitors, though all major AI labs now have safety teams. Differences exist in transparency levels, technical focus areas, and governance structures across organizations developing advanced AI systems.

It rarely happens at the peak of excitement. Instead, it starts when large-cap coins slow down and attention begins to drift elsewhere. Right now, many market watchers believe that shift may be underway again. While established networks face resistance, a newer DeFi crypto is starting to attract growing interest beneath the surface. Solana (SOL) Solana remains one of the most recognized smart contract platforms in the market. Its market cap places it firmly among top cryptocurrencies, and early investors remember its rapid rise during previous cycles. SOL delivered explosive gains when adoption accelerated, drawing in developers, users, and liquidity at a fast pace. However, scale brings limits. Solana has struggled to regain momentum above the $150 resistance zone. Each attempt to break higher has faced selling pressure. With a large circulating supply and a high market cap, price expansion now requires much more capital than it did during its early surge. Market commentators suggest that this is a common phase for mature networks. Growth slows. Upside becomes more measured. For investors asking what crypto to buy now or which crypto to buy today for long-term growth, this often sparks a search for alternatives with smaller valuations and clearer expansion paths. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One project increasingly mentioned in that context is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Unlike Solana, MUTM is still in its early stage. It is an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing, designed to support both liquidity providers and borrowers within a structured framework. The project has been gaining traction during its presale. Over $19.45M has been raised so far, with around 18,650 holders participating. The current token price sits near $0.035, after rising roughly 250% since early 2025. Phase 6 of the presale is now over 99% allocated, signaling strong demand. Security has also been a visible focus. Mutuum Finance holds a CertiK token scan score of 90/100, and an independent audit by Halborn Security is currently in progress. A $50k bug bounty has been launched to further test the protocol’s contracts. MUTM vs SOL: Two Very Different Growth Profiles Comparing SOL and MUTM highlights how different stages of growth shape opportunity. Solana already commands deep liquidity and widespread recognition. That strength also creates limits. For SOL to double from current levels, billions in new capital would need to enter the market. This makes short-term explosive growth less likely. Mutuum Finance operates under different dynamics. With a much smaller valuation, price sensitivity is higher. Smaller inflows can have a larger effect. Some analysts believe this asymmetry is what draws early capital away from large caps during certain phases of the cycle. An $800 investment illustrates the contrast. In Solana, such an amount mainly tracks broader market moves. Upside exists, but it is often incremental. In MUTM, the same $800 enters a project still forming its full market value. While risk is higher, the potential return range is wider, especially once the protocol gains traction after launch. Why MUTM’s Structure Attracts Attention Mutuum Finance is built around lending markets that generate ongoing usage. Users can supply assets and receive mtTokens, which represent their position and accrue yield. Borrowers access liquidity through overcollateralized loans, using defined Loan to Value limits and automated liquidation mechanisms. This structure matters because it ties token demand to real activity. Revenue is not based on attention alone. It comes from lending and borrowing volume. Through the buy-and-distribute model, a portion of protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM on the market and distribute it to users staking mtTokens. Some analysts view this as a long-term demand driver rather than a short-term incentive. V1 Launch and Phase 6 Momentum Another factor shaping sentiment is timing. According to statements from the official Mutuum Finance X account, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core components include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT as initial assets. Phase 6 of the presale is now nearly complete, with only a small allocation remaining. The next phase will introduce a nearly 20% price increase, which some early investor sentiment suggests is adding urgency. A 24-hour leaderboard rewards top daily contributors with $500 in MUTM, further boosting participation. As Solana consolidates below key resistance, many investors are reassessing where asymmetric growth may come from next. For those tracking crypto news today or scanning crypto charts for emerging trends, the contrast between SOL’s maturity and MUTM’s early momentum has become harder to ignore. Whether this shift continues will depend on execution. But for now, the comparison highlights why some believe the next crypto phase of growth may come from smaller, utility-focused DeFi crypto projects rather than established giants.

This appears to be a fresh strategy from the digital asset treasury (DAT) firm, which has managed to stay relevant in a nascent, uncertain sector of the cryptocurrency industry. How Much Would BitMine Make From Ethereum Staking? In the early hours of Saturday, December 27, on-chain analyst EmberCN revealed that BitMine has finally started attempting to stake its Ether holdings to earn interest income. The largest Ethereum treasury firm deposited 74,880 ETH (equivalent to $219 million) into an Ethereum PoS contract. In a later, separate transaction, BitMine went on to deposit 79,296 ETH (worth about $232 million) into Ethereum PoS staking. This brings the firm’s total stake in the ETH network to 154,176 ETH (roughly $451 million) in the past day and so far. EmberCN added in the post on X: They [BitMine] now hold 4.066 million ETH, with an approximate APY of 3.12%. If all of it were staked, they could earn about 126,800 ETH in interest over a year, which at the current price of $2,927 would be worth $371 million. Earlier in November, Bitmine had disclosed its plans to start Ether staking in 2026’s first quarter through a dedicated in-house setup called the Made-in America Validator Network (MAVAN). At the time, the Ethereum treasury firm stated it had selected three institutional staking providers for a pilot program, using a small portion of its ETH to test performance, security, and operational quality before scaling. Meanwhile, the treasury firm has not stopped accumulating Ether tokens despite the not-so-optimistic signs in the crypto market. The recent buying spree took BitMine’s Ethereum holdings to a whopping 4.066 million ETH. As it appears, staking presents an opportunity for the largest corporate ETH holder to earn passive income from its Ethereum holdings, especially as the general market continues to underperform. With crypto prices in a downward trend, shares of most DATs have not been able to enjoy the required tailwind to soar to new heights. BMNR 2025 Price Recap As of this writing, the BitMine stock (ticker: BMNR) is valued at around $28.31 per share, closing with an almost 4% decline on the last trading day. A broader look at the stock shows that the past few months have been rough for the digital asset treasuries sector. According to data from TradingView, BMNR’s value has dropped by nearly 43% in the past three months. However, its is worth noting that the stock has grown by almost 2.5x in the past year.",Ethereum|BitMine|BMNR|ETH|ETH Price|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 16:00:43

This significant retreat highlights a deeper truth: headline highs have masked a deeply fractured market where most cryptocurrencies have been left in a prolonged chill. A Stark Divergence in Performance Analytics platform SoSoValue’s recent review of the 2024-2025 period quantified this split with a clear experiment. What would happen to $10 invested across major crypto sectors at the cycle’s start in early 2024? The results are sobering. As SoSoValue stated, “Two years later, the answer is stark: That same $10 starting point turned into $28 in some pockets, while in others, only $1.20 remains.” The firm defined the period as a “belated, cruel coming-of-age ceremony” for crypto, where selective capital, not broad optimism, drove outcomes. According to the study, the key catalyst was the January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. While hailed as a landmark, it created a “compliance loop” that isolated institutional money. “ETFs broke this chain,” SoSoValue explained. Capital now flows into regulated products and stays there, rarely trickling down to the wider ecosystem. This erected a strict “boundary of allocatable assets.” The platform’s data shows U.S. Bitcoin ETFs hold roughly $115 billion, dwarfing Ethereum’s $18 billion. The firm reported that other approved tokens received minimal institutional interest, disrupting the historical trend where Bitcoin’s strength benefited everyone. Winners, Losers, and a Market Transformed The experiment revealed a market divided into clear camps, with sectors tied directly to compliant capital or dominant market positions thriving. Centralized finance (CeFi), powered by Binance’s BNB, gained over 180%, while assets like XRP, with cleared regulatory hurdles, also excelled. In stark contrast, sectors reliant on venture capital narratives and retail speculation faced a wipeout. Layer-2 networks fell 87%, GameFi dropped 85%, and NFTs declined 68% from the $10 baseline. SoSoValue pointed to the collapse of the “VC cabal — tech narrative — high valuation financing” model, where constant token unlocks from early backers met zero new demand. Even meme coins, a traditional retail refuge, offered little safe harbor. While the sector’s index nearly broke even over two years, it hid a punishing 80% fall in 2025 alone, transformed into a “highly efficient ‘harvesting machine’” by celebrity and political pumps. Bitcoin’s journey from its October high to current levels mirrors this new reality. According to SoSoValue, its record peak was a product of concentrated institutional inflow through ETFs, a strength that did not spread. The subsequent cooling reflects both natural market cycles and the absence of a vibrant, capital-flushed altcoin ecosystem to sustain momentum. However, per the analytics company, the bull market’s riches were not shared; they were funneled into a narrow corridor, leaving the rest of the market to question what comes next in an era that’s slowly being defined by rigor over rumor.

This feature is drawing interest from traditional financial groups seeking a compliant entry into the digital assets market. These steps adopted by the company position it as an attractive choice for significant financial groups seeking to make large investments in regulated digital assets. However, data from CoinGecko sparked debates in the crypto industry after highlighting that Korbit’s share of the cryptocurrency trading market in South Korea is relatively small compared to its rivals. To support this claim, reports disclosed that Korbit only managed to generate $5.75 million out of approximately $1.21 billion in total trading volume recorded across six Korea-based exchanges over the last 24 hours. Ideally, Korbit’s figure represented less than 1% of all trading activity. On the other hand, Upbit , South Korea’s largest and leading cryptocurrency exchange, secured the top position in the market with a daily volume of over $768 million. The next in line is Bithumb, with approximately $298 million, followed by Coinone with nearly $135 million. Meanwhile, analysts acknowledge that Mirae Asset Group’s move demonstrates a growing trend in the crypto industry whereby significant firms in South Korea tend to expand their operations through acquisitions. This trend is also evident in Naver Financial’s intention to acquire Dunamu , a major South Korean financial technology company known for operating Upbit, through a stock-swap agreement worth approximately 15.1 trillion won, equivalent to about $10.3 billion. Notably, this news comes just after reports leaked information regarding Mirae Asset Group’s discussion to acquire Korbit. Under this deal, Naver Financial is expected to establish 87.56 million new shares for Dunamu’s shareholders. This move will change Dunamu to become a fully owned subsidiary. Naver Financial considers securing an acquisition deal Regarding Naver Financial’s acquisition deal, reports have highlighted that shareholders from both firms will vote on the agreement on May 22, 2026. The share exchange, on the other hand, is scheduled to take place on June 30. Nonetheless, sources mentioned that this deal still requires approval from regulators. Interestingly, this is not the first time the acquisition deal has been announced. Back in September, Naver Financial made the agreement public. At that time, it was announced that Naver Financial would immediately launch a stablecoin initiative backed by the Korean won, as well as other digital finance sector initiatives, once the acquisition is completed. Meanwhile, as Naver Financial prepares for the completion of the acquisition, the firm also prepares for the full implementation of new regulations set to be implemented by authorities in South Korea, particularly for cryptocurrency exchanges. This new rule will hold the exchanges responsible for losses incurred, much like regular banks. The authorities arrived at this decision this month after Upbit recently encountered security issues. Following this update, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) stated that it was exploring suitable new guidelines to ensure exchanges compensate clients in the event of any losses incurred due to a hacking incident or technical issues, even if the exchange is declared faultless.

While the altcoin hovers around the $1.80 price level, recent on-chain evaluation shows that the XRP price could be in a precarious situation. Bearish Divergence Materializes Between RSI And XRP Price In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted that there is a convergence of both technical and on-chain events, which reveal an imminent bearish phase for the XRP price. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Addresses ADA Dump Rumors, Is He Behind The 80% Price Crash? The analyst first pointed out that the XRP price is painting an unsettling picture on its weekly chart, basing this hypothesis on the technical context. While the XRP price hovers near recent highs, indicating intentions to recover previous levels, its momentum tells a contrasting story. CryptoOnchain explained that a bearish divergence has formed between the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the XRP price. So, as the XRP price appears to target recent highs, the RSI has taken on a clear downturn, creating lower highs progressively. Usually, this type of divergence indicates weakening buying strength and dwindling momentum. Interestingly, historical data reveal that this pattern has often preceded significant price corrections. At the same time, the XRP price happens to be retesting the psychological and technical key level at $1.80. The market quant explained that in the event that $1.80 fails to hold, the altcoin could quickly see the beginning of an unbridled dump. Looking at the broader technical context, it becomes apparent that any significant upside attempt depends on improving momentum. Open Interest On Binance Cascades To New Low CryptoOnchain also cites a shocking development underneath the surface. The relevant indicator here is the Open Interest, which tracks the total value of all outstanding XRP derivatives contracts (on Binance) that have yet to be closed, settled, or liquidated at a given time. XRP’s open interest recently fell to as low as $450 million, a point marking the lowest level since November 2024. A sharp decrease in Open Interest typically points out that there’s been a significant efflux of leveraged capital from the futures market. Related Reading: XRP Stochastic RSI Just Touched 0.0 For The Second Time In History This kind of unchecked contraction suggests that XRP traders are either forcefully exiting the market or abandoning their positions out of fear. Moreover, the decline in Open Interest alongside weakening price momentum paints a narrative on investor interest; it shows that market participants are stepping back due to a lack of conviction, rather than positioning for upward continuation. With these signals converging to expose a strong bearish scenario for XRP, market participants are advised to act with caution, as the $1.80 key level’s defeat could mean serious trouble for the token’s price. As of this writing, XRP is valued at approximately $1.87, with a 1.5% price jump in the past 24 hours.

To short-term traders, this extended consolidation may appear uninspiring. However, history suggests that some of the most significant market moves are often preceded by long periods of silence, where structure quietly forms and conviction is tested. EGRAG Crypto, a widely followed XRP technical analyst known for long-cycle and fractal-based analysis, argues that this is precisely what is unfolding on XRP’s monthly chart. Rather than signaling exhaustion, he believes the market is still in a disciplined accumulation phase that aligns with XRP’s historical behavior before major expansions. #XRP – We Are Still accumulating, This is my stance: pic.twitter.com/iCCJnWgM7k — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 28, 2025 A Prolonged Accumulation Above Key Psychological Levels According to EGRAG Crypto, XRP has spent roughly 13 months consolidating above the $2.00 psychological zone on the monthly timeframe. In classical technical analysis, prolonged sideways movement following a strong advance is often interpreted as absorption, where sellers gradually lose influence while long-term participants build positions. Although XRP is trading around $1.87 as of report time, EGRAG emphasizes that minor deviations below round-number levels do not invalidate the broader structure. His analysis prioritizes candle behavior and closing levels over short-term volatility, particularly on higher timeframes. The “Bifrost Bridge” as Macro Structural Support A defining element of EGRAG Crypto’s chart is the ascending diagonal support he refers to as the “Bifrost Bridge.” This trendline connects major historical lows across multiple market cycles, forming a long-term structural guide for XRP’s price action. Each time XRP has interacted with this support in previous cycles, it has eventually transitioned into a new expansion phase. The current monthly candles remain positioned above this diagonal line, reinforcing the argument that the macro trend structure is still intact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Monthly Candle Positioning and Breakout Potential EGRAG places notable emphasis on the current monthly candle, which sits near the upper boundary of the consolidation range. A confirmed breakout above local resistance, particularly on a monthly close, could open the door to a move toward the $2.60 region. This level is derived from historical price interactions rather than speculative projections. Importantly, EGRAG frames this outlook as conditional, stressing that confirmation, not anticipation, is what validates technical scenarios. A Long-Term View Amid Short-Term Uncertainty EGRAG Crypto’s stance underscores a disciplined, long-term approach to XRP’s market cycle. While short-term price action remains muted, the underlying structure suggests accumulation rather than distribution. For long-term holders, the message is clear: consolidation does not necessarily signal weakness—it may be the foundation for the next phase of XRP’s market evolution.

One top crypto, which has recently gained popularity with regard to mainstream industry attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is priced under the $0.05 benchmark, accessible in a presale process, where Phase 6 is sold out 99%. Currently accumulating over $19.5 million, amidst a firmly developing ground for its rising popularity, MUTM has gained popularity regarding its utility-center strategy for both lending and borrowing operations associated with a full-fledged DeFi technological platform. Experts continue to cultivate a sense of FOMO with regard to the possibility of a 5,000% breakout, which will propel MUTM prices likely to trade within the ranges of $2.50 from the current ranges below $0.05. XRP Attempts Rebound XRP is now stabilizing around the channel support and appears to be on course for a possible resurgence, thanks to buying momentum aimed at protecting this pivotal level of support. Technical analysts are of the view that should this level of demand remain in place, a correction towards the downward-sloping resistance line could potentially start to form in order to provide some short-term gains in this overall consolidation trend. XRP is establishing itself in a descending triangle and is now in a basing process, which remains favorable from a technical perspective so long as its major level of support below remains in place. The descending resistance appears to be an essential spot for traders to reach in order to start gaining traction. For those investment minds searching for further opportunities in this market amidst XRP’s recovery, utility cryptos such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have also garnered interest. $0.035 Altcoin– Last Chance to Buy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as one of the most prospective DeFi projects of 2025. Phase 6 tokens are currently more than 99% sold out with over 18,590 participants and $19.5M raised. The current token price remains at $0.035, providing an opportunity for purchasing before Phase 7 prices at $0.04, moving towards the launching price set at $0.06. As Phase 6 of MUTM is almost entirely sold out, it remains one of the last chances for purchasing at a discounted price before the next market bull run. While speculative tokens are more focused on speculation, Mutuum Finance has set the score by adoption. As far as investors interested in adoption and appreciation are concerned, MUTM is one of the best cryptocurrency to buy and the top crypto in 2025. Flexible Lending Mutuum Finance has designed not one but two revolutionary lending solutions for growth and stability. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) gathers assets into a liquidity market where users get distributed mtTokens in a 1:1 ratio, enabling users to gain dynamic APYs through lending, ensuring guaranteed passive income. For less conventional or volatile tokens, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending contracts are offered. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best cryptocurrency to buy in the market with a price of less than $0.05 and has immense potential. As phase 6 is over 99% sold out, with $19.5M raised, and over 18,590+ holders, investors now also have the opportunity to purchase holdings at $0.035. Additionally, with immense predicted gains of 5,000% and the price target reaching around $2.50 per token, an investment of $2,000 will soon hit $100,000, making MUTM have asymmetrical growth. The presale opportunity is soon to be over, and smart investors won’t want to miss another bull market.

56506809,649115,1766944825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56506809.jpeg,"Hoskinson Says Bitcoin Could Hit $250K In 2026, Lays Out How Altcoins May Finally Decouple",https://bitcoinist.com/hoskinson-says-bitcoin-could-hit-250k-in-2026-lays-out-how-altcoins-may-finally-decouple/,"Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson has shared an interesting outlook for the crypto market in a recent YouTube interview by Altcoin Daily, projecting a major upside for Bitcoin in 2026 while also outlining a way capital flows into altcoins. His comments touched on institutional demand, decentralized finance, and why the next crypto market phase may soon decouple from Bitcoin. Bitcoin At $250,000 And The Bridge Into DeFi When asked about if he is still bullish on Bitcoin in 2026, Hoskinson said he expects Bitcoin to reach around $250,000 in 2026, pointing to persistent institutional demand as the core driver. This prediction is interesting, especially given the current context of Bitcoin’s price action, which is currently stuck below $90,000. It is also not a new stance for Hoskinson, who previously floated the same target during an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box. In the YouTube interview with Altcoin Daily, Hoskinson noted that the missing piece has been a credible way for Bitcoin’s enormous stored value to interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem. He explained that Bitcoin holders are very cautious about handing custody of their assets to third parties, which has limited how much BTC can be deployed productively. The solution, in his view, lies in non-custodial credit systems. Hoskinson described a future where Bitcoin can be lent in a non-custodial manner to access stablecoins , which are then deployed across DeFi to generate yield. If the yield generated exceeds the cost of credit, Bitcoin holders gain predictable passive returns without sacrificing control of their holdings. Once such mechanisms mature, trillions of dollars in Bitcoin value could gradually spill into altcoins, and this will provide a stronger foundation for real-world adoption across the altcoin sector. Solana Versus Ethereum As 2026 Nears Hoskinson also shared his perspective on the comparison between Ethereum and Solana, explaining that the difference comes down to how each network can grow from here. He said Ethereum is, in many ways, a victim of its own success. After years of growth, it has become a huge ecosystem that is naturally harder to move and adapt quickly. Solana, on the other hand, is a faster-moving chain that can experiment and adopt new ideas more easily. According to Hoskinson, Solana may be better positioned for growth over the next few years due to its tighter leadership and more agile development approach. Still, he was careful to give Ethereum its due credit, noting that it continues to carry much of the foundational work among altcoins and DeFi. When asked about Cardano and Midnight , Hoskinson said his optimism is rooted in different fundamentals for each, although Midnight still has much more room to grow. Cardano focuses more on long-term infrastructure and research-driven development, but Midnight represents something new for the industry. Midnight is a recently launched partner chain created by Cardano’s creators, and it functions as a complementary network to Cardano. In the interview, Hoskinson described Midnight as part of a fourth generation of cryptocurrency design, positioning it as a first mover that could capture a big market share if development and adoption move quickly enough.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-hold-your-position-buy-the-dip-heres-why/,"Markets are often efficient at pricing narratives, but far less reliable at valuing infrastructure. History shows that foundational technologies tend to look stagnant before they become indispensable. In crypto, where attention gravitates toward rapid price swings, long-term architecture frequently develops outside the spotlight, creating a widening gap between perception and underlying progress. That gap is precisely what X Finance Bull addressed in a recent post on X, arguing that XRP’s current valuation does not accurately represent the role it is being positioned to play in the evolving global payments system. Rather than viewing XRP through a speculative lens, the analyst frames it as a core liquidity component in a network that is still being understood by the broader market. If the market were rational, $XRP wouldn’t still be cheap A global value network is unfolding and it sounds a lot like Interledger. Neutral liquidity. Tokenized assets. Fiat-to-fiat without friction. Ripple didn’t wait to build this. XRPL already fits the model. RLUSD… https://t.co/xW0xEzDieM pic.twitter.com/Lsq0DNG9Mk — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 27, 2025 Interoperability Is Becoming the New Standard Global finance is steadily moving toward interoperability, where value flows seamlessly across different ledgers, currencies, and asset types. Interledger, Ripple’s protocol for connecting disparate payment networks, closely mirrors this direction. Its design enables neutral liquidity, allowing assets to move across systems without forcing participants into a single blockchain or currency. This model aligns with the growing push toward tokenized assets and real-time settlement. As financial institutions explore blockchain-based infrastructure, the ability to connect legacy systems with digital rails is becoming more important than isolated performance metrics. XRPL Was Built for This Environment The XRP Ledger was not adapted to meet emerging institutional requirements; it was engineered with them in mind. Its fast finality, low transaction costs, and built-in decentralized exchange make it suitable for high-volume, cross-border value transfer. These characteristics support XRP’s use as a bridge asset, particularly in scenarios where direct fiat pairs are illiquid or inefficient. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to X Finance Bull, this structural readiness explains why XRP continues to be referenced in discussions around global settlement architecture, even when its market price appears disconnected from that narrative. RLUSD and Live Payment Corridors Ripple’s launch of RLUSD in December 2024 added another operational layer to this ecosystem. The dollar-backed stablecoin is already active within payment corridors, supporting regulated fiat settlement while working alongside XRP rather than replacing it. This approach reinforces XRP’s role as neutral liquidity within multi-currency flows. Meanwhile, broader financial rails are evolving. ISO 20022 adoption across banking systems and ongoing SWIFT infrastructure upgrades signal a shift toward richer data and faster settlement. While XRP is not part of SWIFT, its compatibility with these standards positions it to integrate with, rather than disrupt, existing financial networks. Why the Market May Be Missing the Signal X Finance Bull emphasizes that price often lags utility when the infrastructure is early. Markets tend to reward visible demand before structural importance becomes obvious. In that context, accumulation during periods of consolidation is framed not as momentum trading, but as positioning alongside a foundation still being laid. The argument is not that XRP’s value is guaranteed, but that its architecture is increasingly aligned with where global finance is heading. For long-term holders, the message is simple: volatility reflects sentiment, while infrastructure reflects intent—and the two rarely move in sync.

In 2027, it will range between $100.22 and $119.01, with an average price of $109.61. In 2031, it will range between $225.49 and $244.28, with an average price of $234.88. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Hyperliquid Token HYPE Price $25.86 (-1.02%) Market Cap $8.77B Trading Volume $101.85M Circulating Supply 339.34M HYPE All-time High $59.30 (Sep 18, 2025) All-time Low $3.2 (Nov 29, 2024) 24-hour High $26.26 24-hour Low $25.41 Hyperliquid Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $19.42 (-25.26%) Price Volatility (30-day variation) 12.54% 50-Day SMA $32.26 200-Day SMA $34.09 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) Hyperliquid Price Analysis: HYPE finds resistance, sinks toward $25.86 TL;DR Breakdown: Hyperliquid price analysis confirms a downward trend at $25.86. Cryptocurrency has lost 1.02% of its value. HYPE token faces resistance around the $27 range. On December 28, 2025, Hyperliquid price analysis revealed a downward trend for the altcoin. The coin is trading at $25.86 after finding resistance at $26.02. From an overall perspective, the currency lost 1.02% in its value in the last 24 hours. The decrease creates relatively unfavorable circumstances for investors, as the altcoin is now shedding value. HYPE/USDT 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of Hyperliquid Coin confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value slightly decreased to $25.86 during the day, as bears strive to suppress the price further. At the same time, red candlesticks on the price chart signify the presence of bearish elements. Sellers are leading the price action, as the coin is losing value as a result of the return of the bearish trend. HYPEUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility levels, as the bands are far apart. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating resistance, has shifted to $30. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $22. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the lower half of the neutral region. The indicator’s score has decreased to 43 today. This condition is reflected by a downward-pointing RSI curve. If selling activities continue to intensify, the indicator’s reading can decrease further towards the index 35. HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of Hyperliquid indicates positive sentiment in the market. The HYPE/USD price has increased to $25.85 over the past few hours as buying interest triggers again. However, the comparatively low volatility also suggests a lower probability of an imminent reversal or significant price appreciation. HYPEUSD 4-hour price chart.

Hyperliquid price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value decreased to $25.86 in the past 24 hours, as it is receiving negative sentiment today. According to an overall analysis, the currency lost 1.02% in its value today. Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts showcase a bearish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid down? The cryptocurrency market is showing negative trends, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH a few weeks ago, on September 18, 2025. However, from a broader perspective, the HYPE price decreased to $25.86, shedding 1.02% in its total value today. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025 once again, as it did in September and October. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2027. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $119.01. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan’s HYPE price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $244.28, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $244.28 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025, which significantly decreased the market capitalization.

APEMARS Whitelist Filling Fast While Established Coins Like Bitcoin and Cardano Hold Steady Ground,https://timestabloid.com/next-100x-crypto-presale-alert-apemars-whitelist-filling-fast/,"The crypto market is witnessing a fascinating convergence. Bitcoin continues its institutional march, Cardano expands real-world utility, and APEMARS is preparing to launch what many are calling the most compelling 100x crypto presale of this cycle. While established giants maintain their ground, opportunity hunters are gravitating toward a narrative-driven mission that compresses the excitement of an interplanetary journey into 23 presale stages. The question facing investors today isn’t whether to enter the crypto market. It’s where the biggest upside multipliers exist right now. With Stage 1 pricing that won’t return and a launch timeline measured in weeks, not years, the clock is already ticking on what could become one of 2026’s breakout stories. Stage 1 presale is going live soon, and you can whitelist today to receive updates before it starts. Top Meme Coins 2026: Why APEMARS Could Be the Next 100x Crypto Presale of the Cycle APEMARS is different from other crypto meme coins. It enters the scene with a story that grabs attention instantly. Commander Ape, an unauthorized test subject, accidentally launched himself toward Mars in a prototype capsule. He survived 225 million kilometers of space chaos, landed flawlessly, and sent back one message: “Earth was too small anyway.” Now, the community replicates that mission through a structured presale. Twenty-three weekly stages mirror the journey’s symbolic segments. This isn’t a static launch. The 100x crypto presale is coming soon, and whitelisting now ensures you receive priority updates. Two Mission-Critical Features Setting APEMARS Apart First, each stage lasts seven days or sells out early. Stage 1 pricing starts at $0.00001699, and whitelist members will be first to know when it goes live. Stage 2 will be higher, making Stage 1 the most attractive entry. The presale design creates urgency by design. Whitelisting ensures you won’t miss the lowest entry point. Second, APEMARS executes burns at Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23. Every unsold token from each segment gets permanently removed from circulation. These aren’t small burns. They’re massive supply reductions that tighten scarcity as the mission approaches Mars. Traditional projects burn tokens after launch when momentum fades. APEMARS burns during the presale while attention is peaking. It’s a deflationary mechanism designed to protect early adopters and amplify the impact of listings. $1,000 in Stage 1 Could Become $323,719 by Q1 2026 The mathematics behind APEMARS rewards early commitment. A $1,000 investment at Stage 1 pricing of $0.00001699 could secure 58,858,152 APEMARS tokens, which at the confirmed listing price of $0.0055 could be worth $323,719.84. Whitelisting today ensures you are among the first to receive updates and secure access to this Stage 1 entry point, which will not last once the presale goes live. Early participation is crucial, as Stage 1 allocation is limited and the opportunity to maximize potential returns depends on acting before the stage officially launches. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Before Stage 1 Launch Getting whitelisted for the APEMARS 100x crypto presale is simple, and it’s your first step to being notified before Stage 1 goes live: Visit the official APEMARS website: This is where all whitelist registrations take place. Enter your email address: Provide your email address and be among the first to get presale updates. Cardano’s Real-World Expansion: DeFi Growth and Identity Solutions Cardano ($ADA) has evolved from blockchain theory into a tangible application. The network now processes over 106 million transactions and supports more than 2,000 active projects. This isn’t speculative development. It’s real infrastructure serving real users. Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem has also matured significantly. Protocols like Minswap attracted over $1.2 billion in total value locked by mid-2025. The network’s formal verification framework prioritizes security, making it attractive for institutional participants wary of smart contract vulnerabilities that plague faster chains. With its proof-of-stake consensus, academic research foundation, and emphasis on sustainable scalability, $ADA positions itself as the methodical alternative in a market often driven by hype. The network’s focus on compliance and long-term stability attracts investors seeking established infrastructure rather than explosive short-term gains. Bitcoin’s Institutional Evolution: From Digital Gold to Payment Infrastructure Bitcoin’s (BTC) 2025 narrative centers on institutional adoption and expanded utility. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold over $27 billion in professional investor capital. This institutional custody growth reflects Bitcoin’s transformation from an internet experiment to a recognized asset class. The Lightning Network has dramatically altered Bitcoin’s practical use cases. This Layer-2 solution enables near-instant transactions with negligible fees, making Bitcoin viable for everyday payments and micropayments. Platforms like Strike and BitPay now facilitate Bitcoin spending at major retailers, including select Whole Foods and Starbucks locations. Cross-border remittances represent another growing use case. In countries like Nigeria and the Philippines, Bitcoin facilitates cheaper, faster international transfers compared to traditional banking. For regions experiencing currency instability or inflation, $BTC provides an alternative store of value outside government control. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot Before Stage 1 Takes Off Bitcoin and Cardano have proven their staying power. They’ve survived multiple market cycles, regulatory scrutiny, and technological competition. Their place in crypto history is secure. But their massive market capitalizations limit explosive growth potential. APEMARS enters at ground level with $0.00001699 Stage 1 pricing, and whitelisting now ensures you’re first to know when it goes live. The 23-stage mission creates constant momentum. Every seven days brings a new stage, a new price tier, and renewed attention. For investors seeking the next upcoming 100x crypto presale before it becomes obvious to everyone else, the whitelist is now open. The mission progresses whether you’re part of the crew or watching from the sidelines. In crypto, timing separates life-changing returns from regret.

They tend to surface when attention starts shifting, but before prices fully adjust. That moment often comes when familiar names slow down and newer projects begin to show stronger signals beneath the surface. As the market looks toward the next crypto cycle, a small group of cryptocurrencies is being discussed more often, with one new altcoin drawing particular focus as its allocation window tightens. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin remains one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. Its early surge was dramatic, driven by viral attention and rapid community growth. That move pushed PEPE to a large market cap in a short time, rewarding early buyers who entered before mainstream exposure. Today, PEPE faces a different reality. Its price behavior is heavily tied to sentiment rather than utility. Without a clear product or revenue model, demand depends on renewed hype cycles. Market commentators suggest that as meme-driven momentum fades, price recovery becomes harder to sustain. While PEPE can still move during strong market rallies, its long-term growth profile appears limited by the absence of fundamental drivers. This has led some early participants to reassess where new upside might come from, especially as capital becomes more selective. Solana (SOL) Solana represents the opposite end of the spectrum. It is a high-utility blockchain with a large market cap and a strong history of adoption. Early SOL investors benefited from one of the fastest growth phases of the last cycle, as usage and developer activity expanded rapidly. At current levels, SOL trades under a clear resistance zone around $150. Each attempt to push higher has struggled to hold. Analysts often point to scale as the main factor. With a large valuation already in place, Solana requires significant inflows to deliver another strong move. For many holders, SOL is now viewed as a mature asset. It offers stability and continued development, but the explosive upside seen in its early days is harder to repeat. This has prompted some investors to look for projects that are earlier in execution but still grounded in real use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) That search has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into focus. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto building a lending and borrowing protocol designed around practical financial activity. Instead of relying on narrative cycles, it aims to generate usage through supplying assets, borrowing against collateral, and earning yield. Mutuum Finance is currently priced at $0.035 and is in Phase 6 of its presale, which is now over 99% allocated. The presale began in early 2025, and since then the token has climbed 250% from its initial phase. The project has raised over $19.4M and attracted more than 18,600 holders. Rather than framing this as early speculation, many observers see MUTM as entering a transition phase. Development milestones are in place, participation is growing, and supply at the current price is becoming scarce. Why Analysts See MUTM Differently Analysts comparing these three assets often focus on structure rather than popularity. PEPE’s growth depends on renewed attention. SOL’s growth is constrained by size. MUTM sits in a different position. First, Mutuum Finance has defined utility. Its lending protocol is designed to support ongoing borrowing and lending activity, which can generate repeat usage. Second, it is still early in its lifecycle, meaning price behavior is not yet limited by a large market cap. Third, its supply is still being distributed, which often precedes sharper price adjustments. To illustrate the contrast, consider a simple example. A $600 position in PEPE today relies almost entirely on sentiment shifts. A $600 position in SOL depends on broader market expansion. A $600 position in MUTM is tied to an upcoming execution phase, where utility is expected to activate and participation may increase. This is not a guarantee of performance, but it highlights why some analysts believe the risk-reward profile differs. V1 Launch and Security as Key Catalysts Execution remains the main focus. According to official statements shared on Mutuum Finance’s X account , V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidation tools, with ETH and USDT as initial supported assets. Security has also been prioritized. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. In addition, Halborn Security is conducting an independent review of the protocol’s lending and borrowing contracts. A $50k bug bounty is active to identify code vulnerabilities ahead of wider use. For a developing DeFi crypto, these steps matter. Lending protocols depend on trust, accurate pricing, and robust safeguards. Many investors wait for this layer of validation before increasing exposure. Why Early Investors Are Watching Closely When comparing PEPE, SOL, and MUTM, the differences are clear. PEPE represents past momentum. SOL represents established infrastructure. MUTM represents a new crypto moving toward execution with defined utility and tightening supply. For those tracking crypto prices today and asking what crypto to buy now, this explains why Mutuum Finance is increasingly mentioned among top crypto discussions. It is not about replacing large-cap assets, but about identifying where the next phase of growth might form. As Phase 6 nears completion and V1 approaches, Mutuum Finance enters a stage where attention often accelerates. For early investors, that timing is what makes this new DeFi crypto stand out alongside more familiar names.

The findings highlighted a sharp contrast with Circle’s USDC, which froze $109 million across just 372 addresses during the same period, pointing to two very different enforcement philosophies shaping the stablecoin market. Two Distinct Paths for Stablecoin Policing AMLBot’s data, shared this month alongside an updated Dune dashboard, painted a clear picture of scale. USDT freezes outpaced USDC by roughly 30 times in both address count and value. Much of that difference came from Tron, where there’s $1.75 billion in USDT sitting in blacklisted wallets, reflecting the network’s heavy use in Asia, peer-to-peer markets, and cross-border settlements. Tether’s model centers on frequent coordination with authorities. The issuer works with more than 275 law enforcement agencies across 59 jurisdictions and can restrict wallets not only after court orders, but also following notifications tied to hacks or ongoing probes. In July 2024 alone, USDT freezes topped $130 million, including $29.6 million on Tron, linked to Cambodia’s sanctioned Huione Group. Social media reactions at the time were mixed, with some users praising faster victim recovery while others warned about the reach of centralized issuers. A distinctive feature of USDT is its burn-and-reissue process. After an investigation, frozen tokens can be destroyed and replaced with clean ones sent back to victims or authorities. AMLBot’s report noted notable burn activity in late 2025, with single-month totals above $25 million. Still, the same system has drawn criticism. In April 2025, a Texas-based firm sued Tether after $44.7 million was frozen at the request of Bulgarian police, arguing proper international procedures were not followed. Circle’s approach stands in contrast, with USDC freezes often following explicit legal or regulatory triggers such as court orders or sanctions listings. On-chain data shows fewer events that arrive in batches rather than a steady flow. Once an address is blocked, funds remain locked until legal clearance is granted, with no burn-and-reissue option. Why the Divide Matters for Stablecoin Adoption The timing of this report is notable as Circle pushes deeper into regulated markets. Earlier in the month, the firm announced a wide-ranging partnership with Bybit to make USDC a default stablecoin across the exchange’s trading, payments, and savings products. The strategy leans heavily on predictability and compliance, traits institutions often favor. At the same time, recent incidents underscore the value of rapid intervention. After a trader lost nearly $50 million in USDT to an address-poisoning scam a few days ago, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao renewed calls for wallet-level protections and shared blacklists. Episodes like this explain why some users view Tether’s hands-on posture as a practical defense, even as privacy concerns persist. The data shows that stablecoin enforcement is no longer a niche topic, given that these tokens are moving further into everyday finance, meaning that the balance between user protection, legal certainty, and centralized control will remain one of the industry’s most contested questions heading into the new year.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has posted a marginal recovery over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens trading in positive territory. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Reaches $0.00024394 Husky Inu AI has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00024300 to $0.00024394. The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project has raised $907,935 so far, and crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. The project’s official launch date is under four months away, but the team has not ruled out moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Recovers Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market shrugged off persistent selling pressure and returned to positive territory, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins recovering over the past 24 hours. BTC dipped to a low of $86,708 on Friday before reclaiming $87,000 and moving to its current level $87,740. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up over the past 24 hours. ETH followed a similar trajectory, dropping to a low of $2,918 before recovering and reaching an intraday high of $2,948 before moving to its current level. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $2,938. Ripple (XRP) is up 1.41% at $1.87, and Solana (SOL) is up almost 1%, trading around $124. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up nearly 1% while Cardano (ADA) has registered a substantially larger jump of almost 5% to $0.369. Chainlink (LINK) is also trading in positive territory, up over 2%. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable increases over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is up 0.50% at $2.97 trillion. However, 24-hour trading volume is down nearly 43% at $47 billion.

Recent technical analysis suggests the popular meme coin could experience significant price appreciation, with some analysts projecting a potential climb to $1 by 2026. The broader cryptocurrency market shows signs of strength, with total market capitalization reaching $2.97 trillion. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1242, marking a 1.02% increase over the past 24 hours. The token faces immediate resistance at $0.13, with solid support established at the $0.12 level. Breaking through these technical barriers could determine the asset's short-term trajectory. DOGE’s price action over the past 24 Hours (Source: CoinCodex ) Technical Analysis Points to Bullish Momentum Multiple technical indicators suggest strengthening momentum for Dogecoin. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays early signs of a bullish crossover, with the MACD line moving above the signal line. This configuration typically signals building upward pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 44, below the neutral 50 threshold but trending upward. The indicator's movement away from oversold territory indicates increasing buying interest. These technical patterns mirror previous cycles where DOGE experienced substantial price appreciation. Source: TradingView Chart patterns reveal a price fractal similar to historical rallies that preceded major gains. The 4-hour chart shows consolidation between key levels, suggesting accumulation before a potential breakout. Market participants watch these technical formations closely for directional cues. Path to $1 Requires Sustained Market Support Reaching the $1 price target demands substantial market conditions and sustained demand. With a circulating supply of 168.08 billion tokens, Dogecoin requires significant capital inflows to support such valuation levels. The mathematical feasibility exists, but execution depends on multiple factors aligning favorably. The token's previous all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 demonstrates that ambitious price targets remain within reach. Historical performance shows DOGE can rally dramatically during periods of heightened retail participation and social media engagement. A broader crypto market recovery led by Bitcoin could trigger renewed interest in meme coins. Capital rotation from large-cap assets to high-beta altcoins often occurs during bull market phases. Dogecoin historically benefits from this dynamic, posting outsized gains when market sentiment turns decidedly positive. Institutional adoption could provide additional support. Potential inclusion in exchange-traded funds alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana might drive fresh demand. Such developments would represent a significant milestone for a token originally created as a lighthearted cryptocurrency experiment. Open interest rose 1.68% to reach $1.51 billion, indicating traders are adding positions in anticipation of price movement. This metric suggests growing conviction among derivatives market participants. Source: Coinglass However, on-chain data presents a contrasting narrative.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-creator-now-fights-for-xrp-heres-what-happened/,"A rare and revealing confrontation on X has ignited fresh debate about who is truly building for the future of global finance. In an industry often defined by tribal rivalries, one of crypto’s most outspoken founders unexpectedly defended a long-time rival , drawing sharp reactions from institutional blockchain advocates and refocusing attention on utility over narrative. The exchange began after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson criticized legacy finance initiatives attempting to replicate blockchain innovation within permissioned systems. His remarks quickly escalated into a public clash with Canton Network CEO Yuval Rooz, turning the discussion into a broader argument about scale, credibility, and readiness for the coming tokenization boom. Hoskinson Challenges Canton’s Vision Hoskinson aimed for Canton Network’s approach to real-world asset infrastructure, arguing that traditional finance is “reinventing” capabilities that already exist on public blockchains. JUST IN: #Cardano Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson Clashes With #Canton Network CEO Yuval Rooz Over $XRP already doing at a scale 100x beyond Canton ambitions. pic.twitter.com/mkZCZuYZCm — RippleXity (@RippleXity) December 27, 2025 He specifically highlighted the XRP Ledger and Cardano’s Midnight sidechain , asserting that both are already delivering financial settlement and privacy features at “100x” the scale of Canton’s ambitions. Framing the debate around the projected $10 trillion real-world asset market, Hoskinson emphasized that success in tokenization requires more than partial solutions. According to him, only fully integrated, end-to-end blockchain strategies backed by strong communities can meet global demands. His statement, “You can’t fake Cardano or XRP Nation,” stood out as an unusually direct endorsement of XRP from a historically competing ecosystem. RippleXity Brings the Exchange to Light As reported by RippleXity, the comments triggered an immediate response from Yuval Rooz, who dismissed Hoskinson’s claims and questioned Cardano’s real-world impact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rooz challenged Hoskinson to disclose decentralized exchange and DeFi volumes, suggesting that Cardano’s version of “Web3” has primarily benefited retail speculation rather than institutional adoption. RippleXity framed the exchange as a rare moment where a Cardano founder openly defended XRP’s technological maturity, underscoring how shifting market priorities are blurring old rivalries. Canton Network and the Institutional Divide Launched in 2024, Canton Network is a permissioned blockchain supported by major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Its goal is to enable interoperable tokenized assets within regulated environments. While this design appeals to banks, critics argue it sacrifices the openness and network effects that give public blockchains their global reach. Hoskinson’s critique reflects that tension, suggesting that institutional chains risk lagging by avoiding the very decentralization that enables scale and innovation. What the Clash Signals for Crypto’s Future Beyond the personalities involved, the dispute highlights a broader shift in crypto’s evolution. Hoskinson’s praise for XRP shows growing recognition that networks already moving value at scale, like XRP, may be better positioned for institutional finance than newly launched, closed systems. Hoskinson and Rooz’s clash illustrates a key question for crypto’s next phase: will tokenized finance be built on proven public rails like XRP, or on controlled replicas designed for legacy comfort, as the industry shifts from speculation to infrastructure?

The National Office of Investigation (NOI) announced the extradition on Sunday, following a five-year investigation that spanned multiple countries. The suspect allegedly used malicious software to redirect cryptocurrency transactions from intended recipients to his own wallets. His operation targeted users across South Korea and several other nations between April 2020 and January 2023. Malware Disguised as Legitimate Software Authorities revealed the hacker distributed malware called KMSAuto, which masqueraded as a Microsoft Windows activation tool. The software attracted users seeking to bypass licensing requirements for the Windows operating system. Investigators determined the malware was downloaded over 2 million times globally. Once installed, it employed memory-hacking techniques to swap cryptocurrency wallet addresses during transactions automatically. The manipulation occurred in real-time, redirecting digital assets to the hacker's control without the victims' knowledge. The scheme specifically targeted individuals using unlicensed Windows activation tools. More than 3,100 cryptocurrency wallets worldwide fell victim to the infection. The hacker successfully intercepted 840 transactions, accumulating 1.7 billion won in stolen digital assets. Eight South Korean nationals lost a combined 16 million won to the operation. The investigation began in August 2020 when a victim reported losing one Bitcoin, valued at 12 million won at the time. The victim had sent the cryptocurrency to a known wallet address, only to discover it had been redirected elsewhere. International Cooperation Leads to Arrest Korean authorities traced the stolen assets through domestic exchanges to six different countries. The investigation expanded as seven additional Korean victims came forward with similar complaints. Police identified the suspect through extensive digital forensics and international collaboration. In December of the previous year, Korean authorities coordinated with Lithuania's Ministry of Justice, prosecutors, and police to execute a raid on the suspect's residence. Lithuanian officials seized 22 items during the operation, including multiple mobile phones, laptops, and other electronic devices. Korean police requested a red notice from Interpol to facilitate the suspect's eventual prosecution.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 19:06:52

After months of movement, price action has slowed and many traders are reassessing where fresh momentum could come from next. This type of pause often leads investors to look beyond large caps. When upside feels limited at the top, attention shifts toward smaller assets that are earlier in their growth cycle. One new DeFi crypto has started to stand out during this rotation. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is currently trading around $2,900, supported by a market cap that remains one of the largest in crypto. The network continues to lead in smart contracts, DeFi, and stablecoin activity. However, price action has struggled to push cleanly above the $3,000 resistance zone. Market commentators suggest that size is now Ethereum’s main constraint. With such a large valuation, even strong demand leads to slower price movement. A move from $2,900 to $3,500 requires massive capital inflows. Because of this, some investors are exploring lower priced cryptocurrencies where smaller inflows can have a larger impact. This does not mean Ethereum is losing relevance. It means the growth profile has changed. Investors seeking higher upside potential often look for assets that are still forming their market structure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) That search has brought attention to Mutuum Finance , a DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing. Mutuum Finance is building a protocol with two core markets that support different user needs. The first is a pooled lending model. Users can supply assets into shared liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent the supplied position and grow in value as interest accrues. For example, a user supplying ETH into the protocol receives mtETH. Over time, mtETH increases as borrowers pay interest. This creates a clear and simple yield path. The second is a peer to peer borrowing model. Here, users can borrow assets directly against collateral with defined terms. Borrow rates depend on asset type and demand. Loan to Value levels are set to manage risk. Lower volatility assets can support higher LTVs, while more volatile assets use lower LTVs. If collateral value drops too far, liquidations help protect the system. Presale Progress and Why It Matters Mutuum Finance is currently priced at $0.035. The presale began in early 2025 and has already seen the token rise 250% from its Phase 1 price of $0.01. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, signaling strong demand at current levels. So far, the project has raised around $19.45M and attracted more than 18,650 holders. Out of a total supply of 4B tokens, 45.5% are allocated to the presale, which equals about 1.82B tokens. Around 825M tokens have already been sold. These figures matter because they show distribution. Wide holder participation can reduce concentration risk. As supply at this price level tightens, new participants often enter at higher stages. Mutuum Finance also runs a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM. This feature encourages steady participation rather than short bursts of activity. Security Focus Builds Confidence Security is critical for any DeFi crypto, especially a lending protocol. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. This helps boost confidence around the token structure. In addition, Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts. According to official updates, the code is finalized and under formal analysis. A $50k bug bounty is also active to identify vulnerabilities before broader usage. For many investors, this level of security preparation reduces uncertainty and supports long term participation. V1 Launch and Stablecoin Plans Utility activation is the next major step. Mutuum Finance has announced that V1 of its lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Initial assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. Beyond V1, the roadmap includes stablecoin integration and layer 2 expansion. Stablecoins are crucial because they support predictable borrowing demand. Layer 2 deployment can reduce fees and improve speed, making the protocol more accessible for daily use. As these pieces come together, some analysts believe Mutuum Finance could see increased activity shortly after launch. Combined with the buy and distribute mechanism, where part of protocol fees are used to buy MUTM tokens from the market, this creates ongoing demand tied to real usage rather than attention alone. Why Investors Are Watching Closely With Ethereum slowing near $2,900 and facing resistance at $3,000, many investors are asking what crypto to buy now. Lower priced assets with defined utility often move into focus during these phases. Mutuum Finance fits this profile for some market participants. It is a new crypto with a clear DeFi use case, strong presale participation, completed and ongoing audits, and an approaching V1 launch. Phase 6 supply is almost fully allocated, which adds to the sense that the current price window may be closing. In a market where large caps consolidate, this is why some see Mutuum Finance as a cheap crypto worth watching as 2026 approaches.

As part of its efforts to recover, the Flow team has suggested a rollback, which has raised eyebrows as critics like Smirnov, whose company deBridge, is integrated with Flow, claimed to have received no communication or coordination from the Flow team. This is even though Flow claimed they were synchronizing with critical partners. Why is deBridge’s Smirnov concerned about Flow? According to Smirnov, the decision to roll back has been rushed and will likely result in financial damage far exceeding the impact of the original exploit . “A rollback introduces systemic issues that affect bridges, custodians, users, and counterparties who acted honestly during the affected window,” Smirnov explained before urging all Flow validators not to validate transactions on the rolled-back chain until some crucial questions are clearly answered. One of those questions is how Flow plans to handle doubled balances for users who bridged out of Flow during the rollback window and got their balances doubled because of the revert, and how users who bridged into Flow during the rollback window will be reimbursed. Another question he wants answers to is how ecosystem custodians like LayerZero will handle cases of transactions that were executed right inside the rollback window. Smirnov highlighted similar incidents, claiming they were handled far more professionally, with the hackers getting isolated without the need for a rollback. “Why is Flow taking a different approach?” He asked. “Who specifically made the decision to roll back the chain?” Smirnov has urged Flow validators to pause nodes and halt validation until clear remediation plans have been communicated by the team, ecosystem partners have been properly coordinated and security groups like Security Alliance have been engaged. In a separate tweet, Smirnov doubled down on the futility of Flow’s solution by highlighting that the attacker has already “bridged out ~$4M and consolidated the funds at this address before moving further.” “At this stage, a rollback has zero impact on the Flow attacker and instead harms only innocent users, liquidity providers, and ecosystem partners who acted honestly during the rollback window,” he wrote . Flow claim s ro llback is the safest way to proceed According to the Flow team, it does not have any other logical way forward other than to restore the network to a checkpoint prior to the exploit. The plan is to remove unauthorized transactions from the ledger. The rollback window will cover transactions submitted between approximately 11:25 PM PST (December 26) and the network halt at 5:30 AM PST (December 27) will need to be resubmitted after the restart, including any legitimate users who the proposed remedy will inconvenience. Validators have accepted and deployed the Mainnet-28 fix, but the network is still in read-only mode for synchronization with bridges, CEXs, and DEXs to avoid state mismatches. As of December 28, synchronization has been extended to ensure all partners reset to the pre-exploit state. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Long before the internet reshaped global commerce, it was widely misunderstood, dismissed, and underestimated. Today, similar arguments are resurfacing around XRP, as market signals, regulatory momentum, and real-world adoption quietly converge beneath the surface. That framing was laid out by Digital Asset Investor in a detailed video shared on X, where he connected XRP’s current market behavior with deeper structural changes unfolding across finance, regulation, and blockchain infrastructure. XRP Price Levels and Quiet Accumulation Digital Asset Investor pointed to XRP trading around the $1.85 range as a psychologically important zone. Rather than expressing concern over short-term volatility, he described the price action as a potential accumulation window ahead of broader developments. In his view, temporary dips matter far less than positioning before regulatory clarity and institutional deployment arrive. 1996 XRP Moment , Ripple CTO Warning & Fed 2.0 Attempt (Includes Paid Promotion) pic.twitter.com/G11vYB2pYH — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) December 27, 2025 Supporting this outlook, he highlighted Switzerland’s leading retail chain, Spar, confirming XRP acceptance for payments . The move, while modest on the surface, was framed as a meaningful signal of organic adoption—real usage beginning at the edges before expanding into the core financial system. Venture Capital Tensions and Narrative Control A central argument in the video focused on why XRP and Cardano have faced sustained criticism from venture capital circles. According to Digital Asset Investor, both projects deviated from traditional VC-driven token distribution models that prioritize early insider access and post-launch exits. As a result, he argued, they were excluded from the narrative protection often afforded to other networks. He contrasted this with what he described as coordinated promotion across Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana ecosystems, suggesting much of crypto’s perceived consensus is shaped by paid media and influencer pipelines rather than neutral assessment. Controlled Decentralization and Regulatory Reality Digital Asset Investor also challenged the idea that extreme decentralization was ever compatible with global finance. He argued that regulatory involvement was inevitable and that success would come from “controlled decentralization,” where blockchain networks operate within defined legal frameworks while preserving efficiency and neutrality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In this context, Ripple’s long-term strategy was likened to building railroad infrastructure—slow, capital-intensive, and often overlooked until the system becomes indispensable. Unlike networks focused on speculative applications, Ripple’s emphasis has remained on payments, liquidity, and institutional interoperability. Ripple CTO Warning and Infrastructure Risks Adding urgency to the discussion, Digital Asset Investor referenced a recent warning from Ripple CTO David Schwartz . Schwartz cautioned crypto wallet providers against mandatory firmware updates, noting that forced updates can place users under pressure and increase security risks. The comment reinforced Ripple’s focus on cautious, user-centric infrastructure design rather than rapid, disruptive changes. The “1996 Moment” Thesis Looking ahead, Digital Asset Investor tied these developments to anticipated U.S. crypto legislation, arguing that regulatory clarity could act as a catalyst similar to the late-1990s internet boom. In his view, XRP is positioned as foundational infrastructure for the “internet of money,” not a speculative trend. If history follows familiar patterns, today’s skepticism may later be remembered as the calm before a financial transformation few truly saw coming.
