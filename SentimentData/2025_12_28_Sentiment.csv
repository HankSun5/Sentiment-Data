Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00004137 to $0.00004728. In 2031, we expect the Bonk price to reach a maximum of $0.00007683 with an average of $0.00007388. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates an uptrend. This movement suggests a bullish trend as buying activity dominates selling activity. However, the chances of reversal seem high in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator defines market volatility. As the bands are expanding, this signals an increase in volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00001000. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000713. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bullish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has ascended to $0.00000793, as an upturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained positive. Technical indicators support the bears, but the price charts favor the bulls for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will approach $0.00008, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk up? After a significant dip from $0.00000802 to $0.00000768 over the past few days, BONK is now experiencing some recovery as stakeholders start buying again. Support still exists at $0.00000786 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000189. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00004 by 2028. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.0001. Recent news/opinions on Bonk BONK ETP goes live on six (6) Swiss exchanges.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of October, Bonk was trading near $0.00002056.

His projections suggest a period where blockchain infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and robotics advance simultaneously, reshaping digital markets and technology adoption. Yakovenko shared his outlook through a public post, forecasting that total stablecoin supply could exceed $1 trillion by 2026. Besides scale, his comments pointed toward limits in quantum computing progress, steady fusion challenges, and major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. He also projected shipments of roughly 100,000 humanoid robots within the same period. Stablecoin Growth Faces Conflicting Views Yakovenko’s trillion-dollar stablecoin forecast contrasts with estimates from major financial institutions. JPMorgan Chase expects global stablecoin supply to reach between $500 billion and $600 billion by 2028. The bank links most stablecoin expansion to crypto trading activity rather than everyday payment usage. Significantly, JPMorgan reported that stablecoin supply has grown by about $100 billion this year alone. That growth pushed total supply to roughly $308 billion. USDT and USDC drove most of the increase. Additionally, derivatives platforms added nearly $20 billion in stablecoin balances as futures trading activity expanded. However, JPMorgan analysts emphasized that higher transaction volumes do not automatically require higher supply levels. Faster circulation could reduce the need for large issuance increases. Moreover, banks continue developing tokenized deposits, while central banks explore digital currencies that could compete with private stablecoins. Solana Market Performance and Technical Outlook Solana’s market price moved higher alongside renewed discussion around network adoption. SOL traded at $123 , posting a daily gain of 1.08%. Consequently, its market capitalization stood near $69.3 billion, supported by a circulating supply of about 560 million tokens. Source: X Crypto Patel, a market analyst, commented on investor behavior surrounding Solana’s long-term narrative. He noted that many holders remain emotionally tied to a $1,000 price target. However, he stressed that price cycles never move in a straight line. According to Patel, Solana currently trades within a corrective phase. A breakdown below the $120 support could push prices under $100. That level, he suggested, may offer a stronger long-term accumulation opportunity. His accumulation range extends from $98 down to $50. Long-Term Expectations Remain Divided Despite near-term volatility, long-range projections remain optimistic among some analysts. Patel outlined a long-term valuation range between $500 and $1,000 for SOL.

XRP, in particular, is showing technical signals that suggest a potential bullish reversal could be imminent. While short-term volatility has spooked some traders, seasoned analysts highlight that price patterns, momentum indicators, and historical parallels point to a possible turnaround as XRP approaches key support levels. A recent post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X emphasized that XRP’s price action is testing a downtrend line from August 2025. Steph pointed out that the convergence of technical indicators—including a MACD bullish crossover and an RSI at 37, indicating oversold conditions—signals that downward momentum may be slowing and that buyers could step in, setting the stage for a sharp rebound into 2026. $XRP : MASSIVE TREND REVERSAL INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/zIC2ziNeHu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 26, 2025 Technical Analysis: Trendline, MACD, and RSI XRP’s daily chart shows the asset challenging a descending resistance line that has constrained rallies for months. The RSI, sitting near oversold territory , indicates that selling pressure may be near exhaustion, creating a potential entry point for bullish traders. Meanwhile, the MACD has signaled a bullish crossover, a classic momentum indicator suggesting that short-term averages are beginning to outpace longer-term averages, which often precedes upward price movements. Technical analysis also highlights that XRP’s trendline support has historically served as a pivot point where buyers emerge. Combined with oversold conditions, these signals indicate a higher probability of a bounce rather than a continuation of the downtrend. Historical Parallels: Lessons from 2022 Steph drew a comparison to 2022, when XRP broke a similar downtrend from $0.30. That breakout triggered a 150 % rally to $0.80 within months amid a broader crypto market recovery following the FTX collapse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While history does not guarantee future outcomes, this pattern suggests that prolonged downtrend tests followed by momentum confirmation can precede substantial gains. Market Context and Institutional Factors The broader crypto market context also supports the potential for a reversal. XRP has demonstrated resilience during Q4 2025 selloffs, holding above critical support levels despite macro pressures and risk-off sentiment in global crypto markets. Institutional interest in XRP, particularly for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and cross-border settlement, provides a structural floor for the asset, creating buying pressure when prices approach key technical levels. Outlook: Preparing for a Reversal If XRP successfully breaks above the descending trendline and confirms momentum across MACD and RSI indicators, a significant trend reversal may be underway . Traders should watch for increasing buying pressure and volume, as these factors often confirm a shift from consolidation to an uptrend. While volatility remains, the alignment of technical setups, historical precedents, and market fundamentals suggests that XRP could experience a substantial rebound in the near term.

As of press time on December 27, 2025, XRP was trading at $1.85, reflecting an 11% year-to-date decline. XRP YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold Based on this performance, XRP began the year at approximately $2.08, meaning a $1,000 investment made in early January 2025 would now be worth about $890, representing a loss of roughly $110 before fees or taxes. XRP 2025 performance This underperformance comes in a year that, on paper, should have been transformative for XRP. One of the most significant catalysts in 2025 was the final resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement brought long-awaited regulatory clarity, removing a major overhang that had restricted institutional participation for years and effectively reframing XRP’s status in the U.S. market. Historically, such clarity has been viewed as a potential turning point for digital assets seeking broader adoption. Ripple also made a decisive push into institutional finance during the year. The expansion of its prime brokerage and liquidity services signaled a clear strategy to position XRP within traditional market infrastructure. At the same time, XRP gained exposure through regulated investment vehicles, including the launch and approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) in select jurisdictions, lowering the barrier to entry for both professional and retail investors. Another notable development was the rollout and broader integration of Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. While the stablecoin itself is not XRP, its usage within the ecosystem indirectly supports XRP through transaction fees and liquidity mechanics, adding another layer to the asset’s long-term utility narrative. Despite these structural advances, XRP’s price struggled to sustain momentum throughout 2025. Market sentiment remained fragile for much of the year, with repeated failures to hold above key resistance near $2. Broader crypto market volatility, combined with periodic XRP escrow releases and cautious investor positioning, weighed on price action. By late December, XRP had slipped into negative territory for the year, erasing gains seen earlier in 2025.

Under the revised framework, the system must process single cross-border renminbi payments using real-time gross settlement, while batch transactions must clear through timed net settlement. As a result, payments now follow two clearly separated tracks. Individual transfers settle one by one, immediately and irrevocably, reducing settlement risk between counterparties. At the same time, high-volume batch payments move through scheduled netting cycles, allowing the system to offset obligations and improve liquidity efficiency. In addition, the rules give the CIPS operator flexibility to adjust netting frequency, settlement windows, and processing schedules when transaction volumes or market conditions shift. This design aims to keep the system stable during peak cross-border payment periods while maintaining predictable settlement outcomes for participants. Operational control and system evolution The revised framework also reflects how China’ s cross-border payment infrastructure has evolved since CIPS launched in 2015. Initially built to support basic offshore renminbi settlement, the system has expanded alongside the international use of the yuan in trade, investment, and financial transactions. By locking in real-time settlement for single payments, regulators reinforce a structure similar to major global payment systems, where immediacy and finality limit systemic risk. Meanwhile, net settlement for batches mirrors long-standing international practices used to manage liquidity across large transaction flows. Oversight remains centralized under the People’s Bank of China , which supervises system rules, risk controls, and settlement discipline. Historical data show that Chinese authorities have repeatedly adjusted payment infrastructure rules following periods of market stress, including reforms after the global financial crisis and later enhancements tied to RMB internationalization. Taken together, the changes do not introduce a new payment rail.

The forecast appears in the firm’s latest annual outlook and builds on the momentum seen since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the United States. Galaxy said U.S. spot crypto ETFs pulled in about $23 billion in net inflows during 2025. It now expects that figure to more than double next year as access broadens across traditional investment channels. According to the report, the shift reflects steady normalization of crypto products inside mainstream portfolio construction. At the same time, Galaxy framed the inflow growth as part of a longer institutional adoption cycle rather than a one time launch effect. It said 2026 could mark the first full year when crypto ETFs operate with fewer distribution limits across advisory platforms. Distribution Access Seen as Main Catalyst Galaxy pointed to easing restrictions at wirehouses and large advisory networks as a key driver of higher inflows. As more firms allow financial advisers to recommend spot crypto ETFs, Galaxy expects capital from managed portfolios to rise in size and consistency. In addition, the firm said large investment platforms are gradually expanding the list of approved crypto funds. That process, it noted, increases visibility among traditional investors who previously lacked direct access to spot products through standard brokerage accounts. Galaxy also highlighted product timing. New ETF launches often see strong early demand once distribution opens. The firm expects that pattern to repeat in 2026 as additional spot and non spot crypto products reach the market. Dozens of New Crypto ETFs Expected Beyond bitcoin and ether, Galaxy projects more than 50 U.S. spot altcoin ETFs could launch in 2026. These would be joined by roughly another 50 crypto related ETFs that do not track a single asset, including multi asset and leveraged products. Galaxy linked that outlook to a growing pipeline of regulatory filings. It said more than 100 crypto ETF applications are already in progress and argued approvals could accelerate if generic listing standards are finalized. The firm also tied ETF growth to broader capital markets activity. In the same outlook, Galaxy said it expects at least 15 crypto companies to pursue U.S. IPOs or uplistings in 2026, reinforcing the link between public markets and digital assets as crypto becomes further embedded in traditional finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 20:22:37

Binance BTC USD1 Pair Briefly Dropped as Traders Cited Thin Liquidity, Perera Says Shanaka Anslem Perera said a widely shared screenshot claiming Bitcoin fell to $24,000 on Christmas reflected a brief price wick on a single, illiquid Binance trading pair, not a broader market crash. In a post on X, Perera wrote that the BTC USD1 pair “wicked down” about 72% for roughly three seconds, while BTC USDT did not trade below $86,400. He said the move appeared limited to one order book and ended quickly as arbitrage activity closed the gap. Perera linked the volatility to a Binance promotion that he said offered 20% APY on USD1 deposits about 24 hours earlier. He said traders moved from USDT into USD1 to pursue the yield, which he claimed reduced sell side liquidity on the BTC USD1 market. Perera said a large market sell then hit a thin book, pushing the price down to the nearest bids, which he identified as $24,111, before prices normalized. Perera also said a similar spike occurred on Dec. 10, when BTC/USD1 briefly dropped from about $96,000 to $76,000. He argued that posts alleging “manipulation” did not provide on chain evidence, while posts calling it a “crash” drew major attention. Perera added that the episode highlights risks tied to newly listed stablecoin pairs, including liquidity gaps during promotional campaigns. He also said USD1 , the stablecoin used in the pair, is issued by Trump linked World Liberty Financial and has passed a $3 billion market cap.

This unprecedented transaction, reported by the blockchain monitoring service Whale Alert on March 21, 2025, represents one of the largest single-asset burns in decentralized finance (DeFi) history, fundamentally altering the tokenomics of one of the world’s leading crypto protocols. UNI Token Burn: Anatomy of a $592 Million Transaction The transaction originated from a wallet address directly associated with the Uniswap protocol treasury. Subsequently, blockchain explorers confirmed the destination as a verifiable burn address—a public wallet from which private keys are mathematically impossible to generate, ensuring permanent token removal. The 100 million UNI tokens constituted roughly 10% of the protocol’s total initial supply of 1 billion tokens. Consequently, this action immediately reduced the maximum potential circulating supply, creating a deflationary pressure mechanism that market analysts have been closely monitoring for years. Historically, token burns serve as a strategic tool within cryptocurrency ecosystems. For instance, Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a base fee burn mechanism, while Binance Coin (BNB) executes quarterly burns based on exchange profits. However, the sheer scale and one-time nature of this UNI transfer distinguish it from typical, scheduled burn events. The transaction required only standard network gas fees, demonstrating the efficiency of Ethereum’s underlying infrastructure for executing high-value, trustless operations. Decoding the Impact on Uniswap Tokenomics and Market Dynamics The immediate market reaction saw increased volatility in UNI’s trading price across major exchanges. More importantly, the burn triggers a fundamental recalculation of key token metrics. The reduction in total supply increases the scarcity of the remaining UNI tokens, potentially influencing their long-term valuation based on simple supply-and-demand economics. This event also directly affects the protocol’s governance structure, as the burned tokens can no longer be used to vote on future Uniswap Improvement Proposals (UIPs). Expert Analysis: Strategic Protocol Management Industry analysts point to several strategic rationales for such a significant burn. First, it can be a method of value accrual for existing token holders, akin to a stock buyback in traditional finance. Second, it may signal a maturation of the protocol’s treasury management, moving excess or unallocated tokens out of circulation. Third, it could be a proactive measure to align the token’s economic model with long-term sustainability goals, especially as the DeFi sector evolves beyond its initial growth phase. Notably, the action follows a broader trend of DeFi protocols optimizing their token supplies post the 2021-2023 market cycle. To understand the scale, consider this comparison of major historical token burns: Protocol/Asset Approximate Value Burned Year Nature of Burn Uniswap (UNI) $592 Million 2025 One-time treasury transfer Ethereum (ETH) ~$9 Billion (cumulative) 2021-2025 Continuous fee mechanism (EIP-1559) Binance Coin (BNB) ~$600 Million (largest single) 2021 Scheduled quarterly auto-burn Shiba Inu (SHIB) $~1.7 Billion (at time) 2021 Voluntary burn by Vitalik Buterin The mechanics of a burn are straightforward but final. Tokens are sent to an address like `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`. Crucially, this address has no known private key, meaning the assets are provably and permanently inaccessible. This transparency is a core feature of blockchain technology, allowing anyone to verify the event’s permanence. Broader Implications for the DeFi Ecosystem and Regulatory Landscape This event extends its influence beyond Uniswap’s immediate community. It sets a potential precedent for other large DeFi protocols with substantial treasuries, such as Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO. Market observers will now scrutinize their governance forums for similar proposals. Furthermore, the burn interacts with evolving regulatory frameworks. By reducing supply and potentially increasing token value, the action could attract different types of regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning securities law interpretations and market manipulation concerns, even though the transaction was fully transparent and on-chain. For UNI holders, the implications are multifaceted: Supply Shock: A permanent reduction in maximum supply increases the scarcity of each remaining token. Governance Shift: Voting power is now concentrated among the remaining circulating tokens. Value Accrual: The protocol’s value, measured by fees and usage, is distributed across a smaller token base. Market Perception: The move is widely interpreted as a confident, long-term commitment by the protocol’s stewards. Technologically, the event underscores the power and finality of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional finance, where actions can sometimes be reversed, this burn is immutable. It was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and will remain in its history forever, verifiable by any node on the network. This characteristic provides unparalleled certainty for all market participants. Conclusion The transfer of 100 million UNI tokens to a burn address marks a pivotal moment for Uniswap and the wider DeFi sector. This decisive UNI token burn, valued at nearly $600 million, demonstrates a sophisticated approach to protocol-owned liquidity and long-term tokenomics management. By permanently removing a significant portion of the supply, the action reinforces core principles of digital scarcity while providing a transparent case study in blockchain-based treasury management. As the DeFi landscape continues to mature, such calculated, large-scale economic decisions will likely play an increasingly critical role in defining sustainable value and governance for leading protocols. FAQs Q1: What does “burning” tokens mean in cryptocurrency? A1: Burning tokens refers to permanently removing them from circulation by sending them to a verifiable, inaccessible wallet address (a burn address). This reduces the total supply of the asset, making the remaining tokens scarcer. Q2: Why would Uniswap burn 100 million UNI tokens? A2: Potential reasons include: implementing a deflationary mechanism to increase token scarcity, managing the protocol treasury efficiently, accruing value to existing holders, and signaling long-term confidence in the protocol’s sustainable economics. Q3: Can the burned UNI tokens ever be recovered? A3: No. The tokens were sent to a cryptographically secure burn address for which no private key exists or can be generated. The removal is permanent and verifiable by anyone on the Ethereum blockchain. Q4: How does this burn affect the price of UNI? A4: While short-term price movements are volatile, the fundamental effect is deflationary. Reducing the total supply, all else being equal, increases the scarcity of each remaining token, which can create upward pressure on price based on supply and demand principles. Q5: Does this change how Uniswap governance works? A5: Yes. The burned tokens can no longer be used to vote on governance proposals. This concentrates the voting power among the remaining UNI token holders, potentially making governance more responsive to the active, circulating token base.

The law first came into effect in 1994, got updated in 2004, and was lightly amended in 2016 and 2022. But this year’s new rules follow the CPC Central Committee’s direction to “promote high-quality development” in China’s foreign trade. The Committee said:- “This is an important measure taken against the backdrop of profound changes in the global economic and trade landscape and the accelerated restructuring of international rules, and is of great significance for promoting high-level opening-up, maintaining foreign trade order, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign trade operators.” Law lays out legal structure, reform plans, and enforcement muscle The new law is made up of eleven chapters and eighty-three articles. The Committee said foreign trade must serve “national economic and social development” and push the goal of turning China into a “strong trading nation.” And yeah, it puts “national sovereignty, security and development interests” right up front. The law pushes reforms that will legally lock in newer trade models. According to the Committee: “Reform measures such as the negative list management system for cross-border service trade, support and promotion of the development of new forms and models of foreign trade, support and encouragement of the development of digital trade, and acceleration of the establishment of a green trade system have been elevated to legal systems.” A big chunk of the law is aimed at matching “high-standard international economic and trade rules.” Officials are now legally expected to align China’s rules with global standards, but only when it serves the country’s own plan. They’re also expected to help write new global rules, not just follow them. So if there’s a rulebook being passed around, China wants a pen. And if push comes to shove, the law gives China more tools to strike back. According to the Committee, it “improved corresponding countermeasures” and strengthened “legal responsibilities” tied to foreign trade fights. In short: China’s toolbox just got heavier. Beijing links law upgrade to struggling industries and falling profits All this comes as China’s industrial profits are tanking. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows profits fell by 13.1% in November compared to the same time last year. That’s after a 5.5% drop in October. For the first 11 months of 2025, profits are barely in the green, up just 0.1%, down from 1.9% earlier. Bloomberg Economics had expected worse, but a fall is still a fall. Companies are hurting from low demand at home and nasty industrial deflation . And yes, that’s happening even with a tariff truce with the US in place. Some sectors are holding on. Manufacturers posted a 5% rise in profits this year, mainly from tech-heavy industries like aerospace and electronics. Utilities are still growing. But miners are deep in the red, with double-digit losses. The back-to-back profit dips are bad news for future investment and hiring. But government officials haven’t pushed out new stimulus… yet. The growth target for the year is still around 5%, and they think they can hit it without pulling more levers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

At the same time, Tom Lee restated his bullish case that Ethereum could reach higher levels into 2026 as network usage grows. BitMine Stakes $219.2 Million in ETH, With Billions Still Unstaked BitMine staked about $219.2 million worth of Ether on Friday, according to on chain transfers shared by the X account @TedPillows. The transactions showed BitMine linked wallets sending large ETH amounts into staking deposit addresses within hours. On chain records listed several deposits in the same window, including transfers of roughly 16,992 ETH, 20,768 ETH, and 24,544 ETH. Together, the moves supported the claim that BitMine deployed about $219.2 million into Ethereum staking on the day. At the same time, BitMine still holds a much larger Ether position that remains unstaked. The post said the firm holds about $10.759 billion in Ethereum that it could stake later, which would far exceed the amount deposited so far. Ethereum staking locks ETH into the network in exchange for validator participation and rewards. As a result, large deposits often attract attention because they can shift a portion of supply out of liquid circulation while increasing long term exposure to the protocol. Tom Lee Keeps Bullish Ethereum Target for 2026 Meanwhile, Tom Lee reiterated a bullish view on crypto heading into 2026, saying Ethereum could rise from around $3,000 to $7,000 or $9,000 in early 2026, according to a clip circulated on X. Lee also said he still sees a path for Ethereum to reach $20,000 if the network becomes competitive with global payment rails. Lee tied the case to utility rather than trading momentum. In the clip, he pointed to scale, settlement, and real world usage as the main drivers, arguing that Ethereum could shift from a speculative asset toward financial infrastructure if it handles large transaction volumes reliably. He has made similar arguments in past market commentary, where he framed Ethereum’s long term upside around adoption and network effects. In that view, broader use by exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and tokenization platforms matters more than short term price action, because it increases demand for blockspace and settlement on the base layer and related networks. The latest comments came as crypto investors track whether Ethereum’s ecosystem can expand beyond trading and DeFi into payments and settlement for real businesses. That question often centers on fees, throughput, and user experience, since global payments require speed and predictable costs at scale.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 21:00:52

According to our technical indicators, ALGO is bearish, with the fear and greed index indicating an extreme fear sentiment among investors. The charts show that the price drop has slowed, and its volatility dropped as well. Why is Algorand down ALGO’s drop reflects technical triggers and macro headwinds outweighing incremental ecosystem progress. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will not break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains improbable for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment?

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history by CoinGecko Algorand conducted its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 per token. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. In 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January and $0.35 in February. It crossed into October, trading at $0.22. The coin later nosedived, and by December, it had dropped to $0.14.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 21:04:00

For holders of XRP, a critical structural pattern has recently resurfaced on weekly charts that could signal a pivotal moment in the token’s multi‑year cycle. Rather than mere price speculation, this pattern centers on how XRP behaves around its long‑term moving averages — a technical lens that many seasoned analysts consider essential for distinguishing between shallow corrections and deeper cycle lows. In a recent post on X by Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders, the significance of the 50‑week and 100‑week simple moving averages (SMAs) was brought to the forefront for XRP investors. Rietveld’s analysis suggests that how XRP interacts with these key moving averages — especially after prolonged periods below the 50‑week SMA — has historically preceded major shifts in trend direction and can offer insight into potential long‑term entry points for strategic holders. $XRP Holders YOU NEED To Know This!

Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/3MwEx0MGWH — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 26, 2025 The Role of the 50‑Week SMA in XRP’s Market Cycles The 50‑week SMA is widely regarded among technical analysts as a structural divider between sustained bullish trends and extended bearish phases. Historical chart patterns indicate that when XRP trades below this moving average for an extended period (typically around 50–84 days) and then reclaims it on the weekly chart, strong upward momentum has often followed. In 2017, XRP spent roughly 70 days under this level before a notable rally, and in 2021, a shorter period below the SMA also preceded a significant rebound. The most dramatic precedent appeared in 2024, when around 84 days beneath the 50‑week SMA were followed by an approximate 850% surge into mid‑2025. This repeated configuration has led analysts to view extended stretches below the 50‑week SMA not only as periods of bearish pressure but also as potential setup phases for explosive rallies once that level is decisively reclaimed on the weekly timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Approaching the 100‑Week SMA: A Deeper Structural Indicator Beneath the 50‑week SMA lies the 100‑week SMA, another long‑term line that chartists interpret as a deeper measure of structural market floors. When price approaches this longer moving average, it often signals that the market is testing foundational support zones where significant investor capitulation can give way to renewed accumulation phases. Rietveld’s observation that XRP is nearing this level suggests a phase where long‑term buyers may begin positioning ahead of a potential cycle bottom, echoing patterns observed in previous bear markets. Taken together, these two moving averages frame a dynamic corridor in which XRP’s weekly price action unfolds. The interplay between them provides a roadmap of sorts: breaking below the 50‑week SMA typically denotes bearish compression, while proximity to the 100‑week SMA hints that structural lows may be in sight. Broader Market Context and What It Means for Holders It’s important to balance this moving average analysis with broader market indicators. XRP’s price has been under macro pressure along with the wider crypto market , and technical risks such as resistance at key price bands remain relevant. However, the historical consistency of the 50‑week SMA pattern offers a disciplined framework for interpreting price action beyond day‑to‑day volatility. For long‑term holders, understanding these structural benchmarks can be crucial. Rather than reacting to short‑term fluctuations, watching how XRP trades around these long‑term moving averages — particularly the 50‑week and 100‑week SMAs — may provide a more grounded perspective on when historic accumulation windows emerge and when potential trend shifts could unfold.

Critics argue that the banks lobbying to change the GENIUS Act are doing so in order to protect their profit margins from competition and not for safety like they claim. Why are banks trying to change the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is the result of several months of Congressional negotiation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation reached a compromise between banks and stablecoin issuers that prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders, but allows platforms and third-party services to offer rewards and yields. However, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and crypto advocate Max Avery, the banking lobby is now pushing to reopen these settled provisions. Avery posted on X that banks claim their lobbying efforts are due to “safety concerns” and worries about “community bank deposits,” but independent research shows no evidence that community banks are losing deposits at an unusual rate. The real issue is that traditional banks currently earn over 4% interest on customer deposits at the Federal Reserve while they pay customers approximately 0.01% interest on savings accounts. He went on to advise community members to be careful about amendments that would ban “rewards” instead of just directing interest payments from issuers, as that would effectively close the loophole that allows third-party platforms to share yields with stablecoin users. He also questioned whether legislators concerned about stablecoin yields have ever addressed why bank savings rates have remained stagnant for fifteen years despite significant changes in Federal Reserve rates. Why does Coinbase consider this a red line issue? Coinbase has declared that preventing any reopening of the GENIUS Act is a “red line issue” for the company. Coinbase joined other crypto companies in supporting a letter organized by the Blockchain Association, Stand With Crypto, and the North American Blockchain Association to show that the industry is against these lobbying efforts as a whole. Max Avery argues that if Congress allows the banking lobby to reopen and modify settled legislation, leading financial institutions can continuously chip away at frameworks designed to enable new competition. He pointed out that fintech companies considering entering U.S. markets are closely monitoring whether legislation “actually sticks” or can be repeatedly modified to protect current profit margins. Armstrong made a bold prediction that banks will eventually reverse their position and lobby for the ability to offer stablecoin yields once they recognize the market opportunity. He called the current banking lobby efforts “100% wasted effort” and “unethical.” “My prediction is the banks will actually flip and be lobbying FOR the ability to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in a few years, once they realize how big the opportunity is for them. So it’s 100% wasted effort on their part (in addition to being unethical). The innovator’s dilemma is undefeated.” He wrote . Get seen where it counts.

With the weekend likely to bring thinner liquidity, patience remains key as the focus shifts to waiting for a cleaner structure and a more reliable scalp opportunity to emerge. Tight Ranges Signal Indecision As Volatility Wanes Cryptowzrd went on to explain that Ethereum’s daily candle closed indecisively, mirroring the lack of clear direction seen across the broader market. ETHBTC also ended the session without conviction, reinforcing the idea that momentum remains muted for now. Related Reading: $6 Billion In Ethereum Options: What This Means For Price The uncertainty extended to the higher timeframes as well, with the weekly candle closing indecisively across most ETF and CME charts. This type of price behavior suggests hesitation among market participants, making it challenging to establish a strong directional bias in the near term. According to the update, healthier price action from ETHBTC will be required before Ethereum can develop a clearer trend. That process may take time, as the pair often leads Ethereum’s relative strength and overall structure. At the time of the post, Ethereum was trading close to the $2,800 support target zone. Holding this area maintains the broader structure, while a stronger bullish push in the future could open the door for a move toward the $3,700 resistance region. For now, the focus shifts to the lower time frame charts over the weekend, where short-term scalp opportunities may emerge. However, expectations remain measured given the indecisive conditions and typically lower liquidity during weekend sessions. Range-Bound Action Keeps Ethereum Traders On The Sidelines In a conclusive summary, the analyst observed that the intraday chart remains characterized by choppy and sluggish price action. The market is currently confined to a narrow range, lacking the decisive momentum required to establish a clear trend. This period of consolidation suggests a “wait-and-see” approach is necessary as the asset stabilizes between its immediate boundaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Specific price triggers have been identified to determine the next major move. A break below the $2,880 support level would likely signal a shift toward further bearish decline, whereas a move above the $3,060 resistance would open the door for sustained upside and new long opportunities. Ultimately, the analyst emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the current market environment requires a more mature chart structure before the next high-probability trade can be executed. Until the price breaks out of this intraday range and develops a more defined pattern, the strategy remains defensive to avoid the risks associated with the current volatility.

This New Crypto Could Surge 650%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-under-0-1-this-new-crypto-could-surge-650/,"Noise is not the way that some of the strongest crypto moves begin. They commence when infrastructure is almost exhausted and furnishment starts to die out. That is usually when more senior investors begin to listen attentively. According to market commentators, one of new DeFi crypto is currently entering that phase, where positioning is winning over publicity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): What It Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a DeFi crypto-centered on borrowing and lending. It aims at developing a protocol that humans use, not to trade. The platform will give users an opportunity to provide assets and receive yield as other users borrow against security. As an example, one may invest in ETH or USDT and become interested when borrowers get access to liquidity. Borrowers are forced to overcollateralize their positions and this assists the system in such price swings. Interest rates change depending on the degree of utilization of capital. Rates remain low when the liquidity is high. Liquidity becomes restricted and to stimulate repayments and new deposits, then the rates go up. The balance is meant to ensure efficient flow of capital. As per the documentation provided on the Mutuum Finance X account , the V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be released to the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Key characteristics are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator robot. The first available assets are ETH and USDT. Another big concern is security. Halborn Security is considering the lending and borrowing agreements of Mutuum Finance. Before any DeFi crypto goes live, it is significant to have a finalized code that is under formal analysis. Involvement and Price Advancement There have been significant inferences regarding Mutuum Finance. This project has garnered close to $19.45M in funds up to date and has created a community of approximately 18,650 holders. These statistics are important since they demonstrate pre-protocol activity. The first price of the token was $0.01 in early 2025. MUTM has since improved to be in the range of $0.035 which is a 250% appreciation. The move indicates increasing confidence because development milestones have been achieved. To most players in the market this kind of price movement indicates that perceptions are becoming premature. Buyers are positioning before activation instead of responding to a completed product. Such behaviour can frequently take place even before utility becomes live, rather than after. Supply Structure and Distribution Signals There are 4B fixed tokens in MUTM. Approximately 45.5% of that supply or about 1.82B tokens are to be allocated at early distribution stages. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. With tightening up, there is less supply to spare. In the past this is when the price sensitivity is high due to limited availability of the tokens at present levels. The site also has a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards the largest contributor to the protocol on a daily basis with MUTM at $500. The aspect will promote consistent attendance and not sharp peaks. It assists in smoothing out distribution and maintains the engagement. The other fact that is important is accessibility. MUTM is a card payment, which makes the entry of new players that are not so invested in crypto easier. This has the ability to get out to a wider audience than a usual DeFi user. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK token scan that has a score of 90 out of 100. This score shows good outcomes of various security checks. In the future, the Mutuum Finance will present an overcollateralized stablecoin. Stablecoins are essential to lending applications as it lessens volatility and aids predictable lending and inflation habits. This could boost daily usage and will render the protocol more appealing in times of uncertainty in the market. Why Timing is Attracting Urgency As Phase 6 is coming to an end, time has become one of the central issues being discussed by the onlookers. Purchases of whales have been reported as $100k in recent times meaning that there are bigger purchasers of whales who are positioning before the allocation closes. To minimize risk, whales usually wait until late and when the visibility is improving. Supply is tight. Infrastructure is soon to be launched. Security audits are underway. Mutuum Finance is mentioned in the discussion of the potential best crypto to buy now with developing use. At this stage, it is not the question, whether MUTM is early. It depends on whether retained supply would last till wider exposure comes.

This arrest comes after hackers reportedly bribed customer service representatives or contractors to gain access to customer information at the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. In May, Coinbase revealed that hackers bribed contractors or the company’s employees outside to steal sensitive user information. While the San Francisco-based crypto firm faced backlash for allegedly disclosing the data breach months after initial discovery, several employees of the US outsourcing firm TaskUs were laid off following the incident. Former Customer Service Agent Arrested In India On Friday, December 26, a Bloomberg report stated that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a former customer service agent had been arrested in India in connection with the data breach that occurred earlier in the year. The crypto exchange estimated at the time of the incident that this information leak could cost as much as $400 million. Earlier reports suggested that an India-based TaskUs employee was caught taking pictures of her work computer with her phone to sell it to hackers at the start of the year. The suspected employee and an accomplice were providing sensitive Coinbase customer data to malicious actors in return for bribes, Bitcoinist disclosed earlier. Armstrong said in a post on the social media platform X that the Hyderabad Police have picked up an ex-Coinbase customer service agent, with more arrests still to come. “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice,” the crypto CEO said. 2026, Start Of A New Coinbase Chapter? 2025 proved to be another challenging year for security across the global cryptocurrency industry, marked by several significant exploits and hacks that rocked the space. As Bitcoinist reported , over $3.4 billion worth of crypto assets were lost to hacks and exploits this year. However, this latest development would come as a positive step for Coinbase, which largely struggled with platform security in 2025. Earlier in February, an investigative report found that customers lost more than $65 million to social engineering exploits in just two months. Meanwhile, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man was indicted on 31 counts for allegedly operating a phishing scheme that defrauded about 100 Coinbase customers of approximately $16 million in cryptocurrency. Going into 2026, the cryptocurrency exchange would be hoping to offer a more secure platform for its users.",Coinbase|Brian Armstrong|coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency news|hacks,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 22:30:01

The regulator said the scheme operated from at least January 2024 to January 2025 and followed a familiar pattern seen in many modern online investment scams. Fake Crypto Platforms, Real Losses The SEC alleges that the defendants first attracted victims using advertisements on popular social media platforms, and promised easy profits and advanced, AI-generated investment advice. Interested users were then invited to join WhatsApp group chats, where scammers posed as experienced financial professionals and slowly built trust by sharing what they claimed were successful AI-powered trading tips. Once investors were convinced, they were encouraged to open accounts and deposit money on purported crypto trading platforms run by Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor. These platforms allegedly claimed to be properly licensed and regulated, including making false statements about government approval. The SEC says this was not true. The complaint further alleges that the investment clubs promoted fake “Security Token Offerings,” which they said were linked to real companies. In reality, no such companies or offerings existed, and no actual trading ever took place on the platforms. When investors later attempted to withdraw their funds, the defendants allegedly demanded additional upfront fees, a tactic often used to extract even more money from victims. According to the agency, all investor funds were ultimately misappropriated and funneled overseas through a complex network of bank accounts and crypto wallets. In a statement, Laura D’Allaird, chief of the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, said “Our complaint alleges a multi-step fraud that attracted victims with ads on social media, built victims’ trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals and promised profits from AI-generated investment tips, then convinced victims to put their money into fake crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated.” AI-Powered Fraud In addition to AI-generated investment advice, AI deepfakes have also increased significantly. Fraudsters are increasingly using artificial intelligence to produce realistic videos that appear to show well-known figures, such as X owner Elon Musk, endorsing bogus investment schemes on social media. Scammers are also exploiting AI to get around KYC checks, forge customer support conversations, and replicate platform dashboards to appear legitimate. In some cases, they have even abused Zoom meetings by sending fake invites that contain links to malicious software.

The Congress trades were executed within a narrow window in late November 2025, drawing scrutiny over timing and potential conflicts of interest. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal The disclosure shows McCormick purchased shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) in multiple transactions totaling up to $200,000. Two of the largest trades, each valued between $50,001 and $100,000, were executed on November 26 and November 28 but were not disclosed until December 26. Additional purchases included a $15,001 to $50,000 trade on November 25 and another $50,001 to $100,000 purchase on November 24, both filed on November 27. Performance data show mixed results, with the November 25 transaction posting a gain of approximately 2.29%, while the November 24 trade showed a loss of roughly 0.72%. Notably, scrutiny is heightened by McCormick’s role on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, which influences cryptocurrency regulation. To this end, Bitcoin ETFs are highly sensitive to regulatory signals, making such trades by policymakers contentious. McCormick’s other trades Meanwhile, the same December 26 filing also disclosed large municipal bond purchases earlier in the month, including up to $250,000 in Ohio State University general revenue bonds and up to $500,000 in Delaware County, Pennsylvania general obligation bonds on December 17, up to $250,000 in Pennsylvania state general obligation bonds on December 15, and up to $500,000 in Pennsylvania Turnpike municipal securities on December 10, all with coupon rates near 5%. Overall, the filings show a concentrated period of high-value investing across both volatile digital assets and conservative municipal debt, disclosed just after Christmas. Notably, there is no public evidence of any legal violation, and such trades are permitted under current law.

For months, both Bitcoin and major altcoins have struggled to regain their previous highs, while traditional markets have flourished. This difference in performance has sparked discussions about whether the old cycle rule still applies and what could come next for the broader market. Analyst Declares Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Dead A popular crypto analyst with over 227,000 followers on X, @theunipcs, has announced that the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. He stated that this market cycle is now unable to determine the behavior of BTC and many major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 2026 Overhaul Aims To Cut Costs, Boost Speed, Limit Censorship Traditionally, crypto’s four-year cycles have relied on the Bitcoin halving to reduce supply and trigger price surges. However, based on Unipcs’ analysis, these mechanisms no longer govern the market, especially as factors such as monetary policy, Spot ETFs, liquidity flows, macroeconomic factors, and dramatic liquidation events have significantly altered it. Unipcs emphasized that the market has been in a long phase of consolidation and accumulation, showing little of the explosive activity historically expected after halving events. He pointed out that the price of Bitcoin and leading altcoins have remained depressed for months, trading roughly 30% or more below their all-time highs. This decline stands in stark contrast to other major asset classes, which continue to climb. The analyst noted that Silver has been hitting record levels almost daily, while Gold continues to climb to new peaks. Additionally, major US stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, are hitting fresh highs, while crypto remains stagnant and underperforming. Notably, this extended period of weakness is highlighted by Bitcoin’s crash below $85,000 earlier this month after peaking above $126,000 during the first week of October. Many altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and others, have followed a similar trajectory, surging explosively before plunging to new lows. Technical indicators, such as the Fear & Greed Index, indicate that investor sentiment remains deeply negative, while analyst insights point to a bearish market structure. Overall, Unipcs’ analysis signals the possible end of the historically repetitive 4-year cycle, though he suggests it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase for crypto. What’s Next For BTC And The Crypto Market? Despite the prolonged slump, Unipcs believes that the ongoing accumulation trend could end soon, triggering an aggressive rally in the crypto market. He believes that once this happens, Bitcoin and major altcoins could surge explosively to new all-time highs once the dormant market transitions into a new bullish phase. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible While the timing of his optimistic outlook remains uncertain, the analyst is confident in the market’s potential for a decisive breakout and recovery.

The broader cryptocurrency space has also entered a period of weak momentum, with prices moving sideways after recent market declines. Despite this environment, some analysts argue that the current trend could be forming a base for the next major upward movement. One of such views was shared by market analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto), who referenced chart behavior he considers similar to the early stages of two previous XRP rallies. He suggested that the next major move could be significant, adding that many traders may underestimate the setup developing in the market. The most hated $XRP rally is about to start! pic.twitter.com/HTwbTIwxZ2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 16, 2025 Repeated Accumulation Behavior Identified Steph pointed to a recurring formation he classifies as an accumulation cycle. He compared the present structure to two previous periods in which XRP traded similarly before strong price increases. The first example covered early 2015 through early 2017 . During that stretch, XRP price action fluctuated within a narrow range, recording several pullbacks and extended consolidation. Toward the end of 2016, downward movement accelerated, and the asset declined to approximately $0.005 from about $0.00885. After that decline, XRP reversed its trend and later reached a peak of around $3.31 in January 2018. A second structure, according to Steph, developed between mid-2023 and late 2024. In that period, XRP again traded mostly sideways with intermittent drops. From August to November 2024, the token slipped from roughly $0.62 to $0.50 before demand returned. This preceded a surge that carried the price to about $3.4 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst Suggests Conditions Are Similar Again The chart shared by Steph shows that after XRP touched the $3.4 region early in 2025, the token entered what he describes as another accumulation band. The price has since declined gradually, intensifying from October 2025 when the asset fell from around $2.8 to its current level. Steph noted that both prior cycles were followed by major rallies, and he believes the same pattern may be unfolding. He warned that those exiting positions prematurely may be overlooking potential upside. Additional analysts also see room for a possible rebound. Chart Nerd recently stated that XRP may be undergoing an ABC corrective phase and pointed out that the $1.8 to $2 range now appears to be functioning as support instead of resistance. Based on this, he expects a positive shift in price action. In the wider community, commentators such as Zach Rector addressed investor frustration regarding the lack of a strong rally this year. Rector maintained that regulatory outcomes, including the resolution of the SEC case, progress toward XRP exchange-traded funds, and the proposed Clarity Act , could form the basis for growth in the coming year. While no outcome is guaranteed, historical accumulation patterns, renewed analyst optimism, and improving regulatory developments suggest that XRP may be entering a potentially decisive phase. Traders are watching closely to determine whether current market conditions will lead to another significant upward trend similar to previous cycles.

Why i s Fl ow token down? The announcement of the ongoing investigation was made because the Flow Foundation became aware of a potential security incident. The engineering team i s ha rd at work with network partners to establish effective response strategies. The exact nature and extent of changes within the Flow network also remain unconfirmed. As a precaution, stakeholders have been advised to monitor updates closely. Once verified, the team is expected to provide further announcements that detail the cause and potential duration of disruptions to the Flow network. While the investigation is ongoing, speculation has continued. As of December 27, 2025, Flow (FLOW) is trading at $0.11, down from $0.17, some of the lowest levels the token has ever been. For context, the token was once valued at $42. Flow token price chart.

Why did exchanges pause Flow token deposits and withdrawals? On Saturday, after the project flagged a potential security incident affecting its mainnet, crypto exchange Upbit issued a cautionary advisory for Flow (FLOW). According to Upbit, the situation is under review, and there is a possibility for the exchange to take protective measures, including warnings, trading restrictions, or ending support if necessary. Users holding FLOW are urged to be cautious. Other South Korean exchanges that have taken similar action to Upbit since the Flow episode began include Bithumb, one of South Korea’s largest platforms, which quickly halted FLOW deposits/withdrawals, and Coinone.

While spot trading remained available on the aforementioned platforms, on-chain transfers were paused to mitigate risks during the investigation.

A senior executive has now outlined conditions under which the company could reduce or potentially halt these sales. Ripple initially received an allocation of 80 billion XRP. To fund its operations, the company has periodically sold portions of these holdings on the open market. In 2017, Ripple implemented an escrow system that locked up 55 billion XRP and scheduled the release of 1 billion tokens per month. From these releases, a fraction was sold to support operational expenses. Over time, the escrow structure was adjusted, allowing up to 80% of the released tokens, approximately 800 million XRP, to be sold if necessary. These sales, however, have been a recurring concern for investors, with some arguing that steady liquidation pressures can negatively affect XRP’s market price. While these worries have eased in recent years, especially after analyses showed XRP largely tracks broader crypto market trends, periods of market weakness tend to reignite debates over Ripple’s role. I think this is fundamentally the wrong way to think about things, but even if you want to think this way, how is it better if Ripple feels more pressure to sell more XRP if the price drops? Wouldn't you think other sources of income reduce this pressure? — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) November 22, 2025 Reducing Dependence on XRP Sales Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently addressed how the company could lessen its reliance on XRP sales. During a community discussion, he emphasized that the key lies in establishing alternative revenue streams. By generating sufficient income from operations outside of XRP liquidations, Ripple would no longer need to sell tokens to fund its activities. Schwartz’s comments came in response to concerns that Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , could shift the company’s focus away from XRP. A community member suggested that because RLUSD is backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars, Ripple could rely on it for liquidity, thereby reducing its need to sell XRP, particularly if the token’s market price dropped sharply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz rejected the notion that RLUSD could replace XRP in Ripple’s operational strategy. Instead, he highlighted that developing new income sources, such as expanding payment services, licensing blockchain solutions, and supporting institutional adoption, would provide a more sustainable solution. This approach would naturally diminish the company’s reliance on selling XRP while maintaining its commitment to the token’s ecosystem. Investor Implications For XRP holders, Schwartz’s remarks signal a potential shift in the company’s strategy that could ease market pressures from ongoing token sales. If Ripple successfully diversifies revenue sources, the market may experience less volatility linked to routine XRP liquidation. Overall, while XRP sales remain part of Ripple’s operational framework, the executive insight underscores a pathway toward reduced dependence on these sales. By focusing on long-term business growth and alternative revenue models, Ripple could better balance operational funding with market stability, potentially benefiting both the company and XRP investors.

Years of regulatory uncertainty, legal scrutiny, and prolonged underperformance have tempered speculation and reshaped its investor base, leaving behind a market that appears more resilient than reactive. Why XRP No Longer Reacts To Every Negative Headline XRP is starting to trade like an asset that has already endured its hardest trials after years of regulatory overhang, which forced it to mature earlier than most digital assets. An ambassador at AstraAIofficial, Winny, revealed on X that the ETFs linked to the token are now live, providing traditional investors with regulated exposure without the operational friction of wallets or exchanges. At the same time, institutional inflows are rising, with managed assets tied to XRP surpassing $1 billion, a milestone that signals growing confidence. The supply on exchanges balances continues to thin, reinforcing the narrative. Long-term fund purchases don’t trade; they sit, which has changed the pressure dynamics, whether participants would admit to it or not. Most importantly, the regulatory clarity is finally improving, something that the altcoin has lacked for years. Winny concluded that this is about the altcoin graduating into a different market structure . Meanwhile, all this dynamic doesn’t mean the market will explode tomorrow, but it does mean the fundamentals are quietly shifting, and patience pays. Institutions Are Choosing The Altcoin For A Reason Crypto analyst Xfinancebull has explained why it will be too late if no one believes in XRP. The narrative was that ETFs were priced in, but the funds became the fastest altcoin ETF in history to hit $1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), with no outflows, no red days, and just steady institutional-sized capital moving in with conviction. The flow data shows that the funds have absorbed over $666 million in November, followed by another +$470 million in December, with no single outflow day. During the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw hundreds of millions in net outflows, while XRP quietly stacked over 30 consecutive green flow days. Currently, 686 million and 740 million XRP are locked, quietly reducing supply in real-time. However, the reason the altcoin is being chosen is that it solves what institutions actually need, which are complexity-ready settlement, on-chain liquidity, and global transaction speed. XRP’s price is currently down because the entire market is under pressure; that move is macro, not a failure. In Xfinancebull’s view, institutions are still accumulating the token with patience and intent. The markets often whisper before they move, but this time the data is screaming, and institutions are already stacked.",XRP|Altcoin|Assets Under Management|AstraAIofficial|AUM|bitcoin|Ethereum|ripple|Spot XRP ETFs|Winny|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 00:00:39

After the Trump-Melania memecoin drama, it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space.” None of my normie friends or family ask me anything about crypto anymore,” he added, highlighting the sentiment among retail traders following the price implosion of memecoins from the Trump family, which have declined by over 90% in value from their highs. The weak search volumes highlight subdued retail investor sentiment, as the crypto market continues to recover from October’s flash crash, one of the most severe single-day drops in its history. Crypto markets reel as fear lingers after October crash October’s market crash led to nearly $20 billion in leveraged liquidations and caused some altcoins to dip by as much as 99% in a single day. The crash also took BTC from a peak above $125,000 to a low of about $80,000 in November, with the price subsequently consolidating between $80,000 and $90,000 since then. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, an index that tracks sentiment about cryptocurrency, reached a yearly low of 10 in November, indicating “extreme fear” among investors, according to CoinMarketCap. According to reports, Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 is sharply divided as traders close the year. The coin was trading at $87,520 at the time of publication and is down 8% year-to-date since January 1. Market mood has been weak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached 20 on December 26, marking two weeks labeled as “extreme fear.” According to posts on X, Jan3 founder Samson Mow contends that 2025 marked the beginning of the bear market and that Bitcoin could be entering a bull run that lasts into 2035. The Fear and Greed indicator still reflects fear among investors, but also a slight improvement over the prevailing market sentiment over the last several months. Several prominent voices still expect sharp gains. Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered and Gautam Chhugani at Bernstein each forecast a price of $150,000 for Bitcoin in 2026. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, predicted a price of $250,000 by 2026 as supply and rising institutional demand are the primary drivers.

Just this one wild year. Both metals crushed everything else. Gold is up 4 times more than the S&P 500. Silver is up 8 times. This whole thing all started with the US Dollar falling apart, plunging down by 9% year-to-date in its worst yearly performance since 2017. Then came the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, which began in September, causing the dollar to lose more strength. And things got messier when President Donald Trump announced on December 12 that he simply wants “1% and maybe lower than that” from the Fed. China tightens silver exports as price hits $85 in Shanghai Silver is up 175% this year, running on an 8-month winning streak, something we haven’t seen since 1980. Just this month, silver prices are up 41%, heading for their best month since December 1979. The Shanghai price is now $85/oz, which is $5 higher than US spot prices and came right before president Xi Jinping’s new export rules kick in for 2026. These rules will force companies to get special government licenses before shipping silver out of the country. And now, everyone’s watching Shanghai as buyers rush in before the controls hit. In Q3 2025, the People’s Bank of China bought 118 tonnes, up 39% month-over-month and 55% compared to last year, though according to Goldman Sachs, China is “hiding” the real numbers. They officially said they bought +15 tonnes in September, but the actual number was closer to 10 times that. So far this year, China claims it’s bought 24 tonnes, but Goldman says the real total is probably closer to 240 tonnes. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down 6% in 2025. It was up 40% earlier this year, then tanked. Leverage killed it. The whole crypto market got wrecked and Cryptopolitan cannot tell you what 2026 might hold for the OG crypto.

As the market consolidates, these smaller assets could hint at early upside moves before BTC breaks out. Key Resistance In Focus: $90,588 And The Descending Trendline According to a recent update by Kamile Uray, there are no changes in the key levels being tracked on the daily chart, as the focus remains on the $90,588 level and the descending blue trendline. Unless BTC can close above these levels, the current decline may continue. Any upward moves below the blue descending trend are considered corrective rather than a trend reversal. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About The first support zone to monitor during the decline is between $83,822 and $82,477. A daily close below $82,477 would signal a continuation of the downtrend and could open the door toward the $74,496–$71,237 zone, marked by the blue box. This lower zone is viewed as a strong support area where buyers may step in. Thus, a clear reversal confirmation is key before considering any significant upward move. Once confirmed, a rally toward the blue descending trendline could follow, testing resistance levels along the way. For the uptrend to resume decisively, BTC would need to close above $90,588 and break the descending resistance. Meanwhile, a daily close above $94,130 would confirm that the blue descending trend has been broken, potentially signaling a shift to sustained bullish momentum. LTF Moves Show Less Impulse, But Structure Holds Crypto analyst The Penguin noted that the lower time frame (LTF) is showing slightly less impulsive action, though the overall count remains unchanged. The recent moves on the LTF appear more like noise and do not affect the broader wave count, and confidence in a leading diagonal for wave 1 remains intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Phase Begins: Weekly Support Holds, Momentum Fades Putting Elliott Wave analysis aside for a moment and leaning on standard technical analysis, BTC is clearly respecting a defined range. As a result, a minor deviation toward the 0.886 level marked on the chart is being closely watched as a potential entry point. Bullish confirmation will come if BTC manages to close and hold above $90,500, which would invalidate the current bearish scenario and signal the potential for a more sustained upward trend. Until then, the short-term fluctuations are considered normal noise, especially with the yearly open approaching. On the altcoin side, momentum appears to be holding, suggesting potential upside. Outperformance is already visible in altcoins like XPL, indicating that while BTC consolidates, some alts are starting to push higher.

Lummis made this statement after Waller released his new proposal to the public during the Payments Innovation Conference held in October of this year. According to reports, the Governor claimed that this suggestion would enable crypto and fintech startups, including banks that only conduct payment activities, to obtain accounts at the Federal Reserve, just like traditional banks’ “master accounts.” However, it was confirmed that this access would involve certain restrictions. Senator Lummis sparks hope for smooth operations in the crypto ecosystem soon Waller’s suggestion ignited heated discussions in the crypto ecosystem. To address this controversy, Senator Lummis issued a statement clarifying the proposal. In the statement, Lummis acknowledged that, “Governor Waller’s skinny master account idea ends Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and paves the way for real payment innovations. This means faster payments, lower costs, and better security — this is how we can responsibly create the future.” Earlier, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was perceived as a strategic approach aimed at hindering banking services, particularly for crypto firms and their founders. To support this claim, Marc Andreessen, a highly influential venture capitalist and staunch advocate for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, asserted that more than thirty tech founders were blocked from accessing banking services in the event of this operation. Meanwhile, reliable sources indicate that Waller’s new proposal marks a significant shift in how officials in the United States view digital assets and other emerging fintech startups. At this point, they perceive cryptocurrencies as essential aspects of the payment system and the future of finance. What still shocked the entire crypto community was the move to deny crypto firms access to banking services that took place even after US President Donald Trump issued an executive order in August instructing banks not to block services to Americans and businesses without a legitimate reason. The executive order further directed banking regulators based in the US, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to identify certain banks and financial institutions that had participated in debanking activities. To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, reports highlighted that the order illustrated the possibility of these institutions facing serious fines or other forms of penalties. Nonetheless, even with these efforts in place and Trump’s pro-crypto stance, sources close to the matter raised concerns that crypto executives, project creators, and Web3 firms are still subject to debanking issues. Analysts note an increasing debanking attempt impacting crypto firms Banks’ decision to block crypto companies from accessing banking services has become a growing concern in the crypto industry. This trend was noticed when crypto leaders began to report incidents of being victims of such attempts. An example is Jack Mallers, the CEO of the Bitcoin payment company Strike. Mallers claimed that JPMorgan , a massive and leading global financial services firm, decided to suspend its banking services in November without providing a valid reason for doing so. In a separate X post, the CEO highlighted that the sudden decision caught him by surprise, adding that, “Every time I asked them why, they replied the same way: ‘We aren’t allowed to tell you.’ In the meantime, apart from Mallers, recent reports mentioned that JPMorgan Chase had also blocked the accounts of BlindPay and Kontigo. These venture capital-financed stablecoin startups focus on global, specifically Latin American, payments infrastructure in December. Following this move, the largest bank in the US by assets alleged that it made this decision after discovering that these firms were connected to sanctioned areas as the justification.

The price rises first. Participation follows. Afterward, the attention comes at a later point. This trend is usually observed once the infrastructure is near maturity and risk begins to decline. One DeFi crypto is currently in that very window as per industry speculation in which early placement is underway prior to wider exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized financial protocol specializing in developing lending and borrowing. It is not constructed around the hype cycles but the organized usage. There are two central markets in the protocol. The former is a pooling based lending system, commonly referred to as P2C. In such a construction, users deposit assets such as ETH or USDT in common liquidity pools. They, in their turn, are provided with mtTokens. These mtTokens are their deposit that will increase in value, as their borrowers pay them interests. As one example, when a user deposits ETH, they can get a yield having a transferable token which keeps track of their position. The second market is peer-to-peer borrowing. In this case, customers will be able to borrow against their own collateral. The borrow rates will be determined by the type of asset and the risk profile. Less volatile assets can be used to fund higher Loan to Value ratios, and tokens which are more volatile need lower LTVs. In case of too low collateral values, the liquidation rules come into play to save the system. These two markets are working to reconcile flexibility and control of risk. This structure is important since lending of protocols can only scale in a case where there is trust between lenders and borrowers in the system. Mutuum Finance has raised approximately $19.45M so far and has got around 18,650 holders. The significance of these numbers is that it shows early implementation prior to the full establishment of the protocol. V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be launched in Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 with ETH and USDT being the initial assets, according to official statements posted on X. Growth and Increasing Demand MUTM is valued at currently $0.035 and it is at Phase 6. The maximum number of token supply is 4B. Approximately 1.82B tokens, which are about 45.5%of that supply, are to be distributed early. Approximately, 825M tokens were sold. Since the pricing of the token when the token was priced at $0.01 at the beginning of 2025, MUTM has gone up by 250%. This continuous growth indicates increased confidence with the achievement of development milestones. The participants of Phase 1 are positioned at approximately 500% MUTM appreciation in case the token is positively priced at its official launch at $0.06. The phases of price progression have been put in place. The next stage increases the cost progressively. The next Phase 7 will push the MUTM price to an approximate of 20% higher. This is important to early entrants since the price of entry has a direct and positive impact on long-term upside. With the tightening of the allocation, access becomes more difficult to supply at the existing level. Such a dynamic usually alters conduct. Buyers move faster. Greater allocations come up earlier. It is here that people think whale interest is taking shape. Risk Reduction and Security Stack Security is one of the reasons that some investors are now giving increased attention. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK token scanned where it has received a Test Score of 90 / 100. It means that there are good outcomes in various security examinations. Besides this, Halborn security is also doing an independent audit of the lending and borrowing agreements at Mutuum. It is a completed code that is in the process of formal analysis. To a DeFi crypto, this phase is paramount since it lowers the levels of uncertainty prior to the launch. Another aspect that was announced as part of the project was the $50k bug bounty initiative dedicated to the detection of vulnerabilities in code. Another protection level is brought by bug bounties which subject the system to external research to ensure it is stressed. Audits along with bounties facilitate the compression of risk. That is when long-term investors tend to get more comfortable to make increases in exposure. Why Urgency Is Building Now There are a number of indicators that there is an escalating urgency. Phase 6 is over 99% allocated. Recent whale distributions have been up to $100k. Such actions are frequently done in cases where the supply that is left is small but visibility is on the rise. Mutuum Finance is also sponsoring a 24 hour leaderboard that pays out the highest gross daily contributor with MUTM to the tune of $500. This keeps it active and promotes long-term participation as opposed to bursts of participation. The payment options can also be carried out using cards, which reduces friction to new entrants. For a project, the aspect of accessibility may be important when moving to the next stage of early adoption to more widespread recognition. The future of Q1 2026, according to numerous market pundits, is that Mutuum Finance is establishing itself in the market as a potential leading crypto as far as the DeFi crypto sector is concerned. There is almost prepared infrastructure. Information reviews are underway. Supply is tightening..
