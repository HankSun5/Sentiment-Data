Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00004137 to $0.00004728. In 2031, we expect the Bonk price to reach a maximum of $0.00007683 with an average of $0.00007388. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates an uptrend. This movement suggests a bullish trend as buying activity dominates selling activity. However, the chances of reversal seem high in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator defines market volatility. As the bands are expanding, this signals an increase in volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00001000. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000713. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bullish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has ascended to $0.00000793, as an upturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained positive. Technical indicators support the bears, but the price charts favor the bulls for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will approach $0.00008, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk up? After a significant dip from $0.00000802 to $0.00000768 over the past few days, BONK is now experiencing some recovery as stakeholders start buying again. Support still exists at $0.00000786 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000189. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00004 by 2028. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.0001. Recent news/opinions on Bonk BONK ETP goes live on six (6) Swiss exchanges.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of October, Bonk was trading near $0.00002056.

His projections suggest a period where blockchain infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and robotics advance simultaneously, reshaping digital markets and technology adoption. Yakovenko shared his outlook through a public post, forecasting that total stablecoin supply could exceed $1 trillion by 2026. Besides scale, his comments pointed toward limits in quantum computing progress, steady fusion challenges, and major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. He also projected shipments of roughly 100,000 humanoid robots within the same period. Stablecoin Growth Faces Conflicting Views Yakovenko’s trillion-dollar stablecoin forecast contrasts with estimates from major financial institutions. JPMorgan Chase expects global stablecoin supply to reach between $500 billion and $600 billion by 2028. The bank links most stablecoin expansion to crypto trading activity rather than everyday payment usage. Significantly, JPMorgan reported that stablecoin supply has grown by about $100 billion this year alone. That growth pushed total supply to roughly $308 billion. USDT and USDC drove most of the increase. Additionally, derivatives platforms added nearly $20 billion in stablecoin balances as futures trading activity expanded. However, JPMorgan analysts emphasized that higher transaction volumes do not automatically require higher supply levels. Faster circulation could reduce the need for large issuance increases. Moreover, banks continue developing tokenized deposits, while central banks explore digital currencies that could compete with private stablecoins. Solana Market Performance and Technical Outlook Solana’s market price moved higher alongside renewed discussion around network adoption. SOL traded at $123 , posting a daily gain of 1.08%. Consequently, its market capitalization stood near $69.3 billion, supported by a circulating supply of about 560 million tokens. Source: X Crypto Patel, a market analyst, commented on investor behavior surrounding Solana’s long-term narrative. He noted that many holders remain emotionally tied to a $1,000 price target. However, he stressed that price cycles never move in a straight line. According to Patel, Solana currently trades within a corrective phase. A breakdown below the $120 support could push prices under $100. That level, he suggested, may offer a stronger long-term accumulation opportunity. His accumulation range extends from $98 down to $50. Long-Term Expectations Remain Divided Despite near-term volatility, long-range projections remain optimistic among some analysts. Patel outlined a long-term valuation range between $500 and $1,000 for SOL.

XRP, in particular, is showing technical signals that suggest a potential bullish reversal could be imminent. While short-term volatility has spooked some traders, seasoned analysts highlight that price patterns, momentum indicators, and historical parallels point to a possible turnaround as XRP approaches key support levels. A recent post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X emphasized that XRP’s price action is testing a downtrend line from August 2025. Steph pointed out that the convergence of technical indicators—including a MACD bullish crossover and an RSI at 37, indicating oversold conditions—signals that downward momentum may be slowing and that buyers could step in, setting the stage for a sharp rebound into 2026. $XRP : MASSIVE TREND REVERSAL INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/zIC2ziNeHu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 26, 2025 Technical Analysis: Trendline, MACD, and RSI XRP’s daily chart shows the asset challenging a descending resistance line that has constrained rallies for months. The RSI, sitting near oversold territory , indicates that selling pressure may be near exhaustion, creating a potential entry point for bullish traders. Meanwhile, the MACD has signaled a bullish crossover, a classic momentum indicator suggesting that short-term averages are beginning to outpace longer-term averages, which often precedes upward price movements. Technical analysis also highlights that XRP’s trendline support has historically served as a pivot point where buyers emerge. Combined with oversold conditions, these signals indicate a higher probability of a bounce rather than a continuation of the downtrend. Historical Parallels: Lessons from 2022 Steph drew a comparison to 2022, when XRP broke a similar downtrend from $0.30. That breakout triggered a 150 % rally to $0.80 within months amid a broader crypto market recovery following the FTX collapse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While history does not guarantee future outcomes, this pattern suggests that prolonged downtrend tests followed by momentum confirmation can precede substantial gains. Market Context and Institutional Factors The broader crypto market context also supports the potential for a reversal. XRP has demonstrated resilience during Q4 2025 selloffs, holding above critical support levels despite macro pressures and risk-off sentiment in global crypto markets. Institutional interest in XRP, particularly for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and cross-border settlement, provides a structural floor for the asset, creating buying pressure when prices approach key technical levels. Outlook: Preparing for a Reversal If XRP successfully breaks above the descending trendline and confirms momentum across MACD and RSI indicators, a significant trend reversal may be underway . Traders should watch for increasing buying pressure and volume, as these factors often confirm a shift from consolidation to an uptrend. While volatility remains, the alignment of technical setups, historical precedents, and market fundamentals suggests that XRP could experience a substantial rebound in the near term.

As of press time on December 27, 2025, XRP was trading at $1.85, reflecting an 11% year-to-date decline. XRP YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold Based on this performance, XRP began the year at approximately $2.08, meaning a $1,000 investment made in early January 2025 would now be worth about $890, representing a loss of roughly $110 before fees or taxes. XRP 2025 performance This underperformance comes in a year that, on paper, should have been transformative for XRP. One of the most significant catalysts in 2025 was the final resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement brought long-awaited regulatory clarity, removing a major overhang that had restricted institutional participation for years and effectively reframing XRP’s status in the U.S. market. Historically, such clarity has been viewed as a potential turning point for digital assets seeking broader adoption. Ripple also made a decisive push into institutional finance during the year. The expansion of its prime brokerage and liquidity services signaled a clear strategy to position XRP within traditional market infrastructure. At the same time, XRP gained exposure through regulated investment vehicles, including the launch and approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) in select jurisdictions, lowering the barrier to entry for both professional and retail investors. Another notable development was the rollout and broader integration of Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. While the stablecoin itself is not XRP, its usage within the ecosystem indirectly supports XRP through transaction fees and liquidity mechanics, adding another layer to the asset’s long-term utility narrative. Despite these structural advances, XRP’s price struggled to sustain momentum throughout 2025. Market sentiment remained fragile for much of the year, with repeated failures to hold above key resistance near $2. Broader crypto market volatility, combined with periodic XRP escrow releases and cautious investor positioning, weighed on price action. By late December, XRP had slipped into negative territory for the year, erasing gains seen earlier in 2025.

Under the revised framework, the system must process single cross-border renminbi payments using real-time gross settlement, while batch transactions must clear through timed net settlement. As a result, payments now follow two clearly separated tracks. Individual transfers settle one by one, immediately and irrevocably, reducing settlement risk between counterparties. At the same time, high-volume batch payments move through scheduled netting cycles, allowing the system to offset obligations and improve liquidity efficiency. In addition, the rules give the CIPS operator flexibility to adjust netting frequency, settlement windows, and processing schedules when transaction volumes or market conditions shift. This design aims to keep the system stable during peak cross-border payment periods while maintaining predictable settlement outcomes for participants. Operational control and system evolution The revised framework also reflects how China’ s cross-border payment infrastructure has evolved since CIPS launched in 2015. Initially built to support basic offshore renminbi settlement, the system has expanded alongside the international use of the yuan in trade, investment, and financial transactions. By locking in real-time settlement for single payments, regulators reinforce a structure similar to major global payment systems, where immediacy and finality limit systemic risk. Meanwhile, net settlement for batches mirrors long-standing international practices used to manage liquidity across large transaction flows. Oversight remains centralized under the People’s Bank of China , which supervises system rules, risk controls, and settlement discipline. Historical data show that Chinese authorities have repeatedly adjusted payment infrastructure rules following periods of market stress, including reforms after the global financial crisis and later enhancements tied to RMB internationalization. Taken together, the changes do not introduce a new payment rail.

The forecast appears in the firm’s latest annual outlook and builds on the momentum seen since spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the United States. Galaxy said U.S. spot crypto ETFs pulled in about $23 billion in net inflows during 2025. It now expects that figure to more than double next year as access broadens across traditional investment channels. According to the report, the shift reflects steady normalization of crypto products inside mainstream portfolio construction. At the same time, Galaxy framed the inflow growth as part of a longer institutional adoption cycle rather than a one time launch effect. It said 2026 could mark the first full year when crypto ETFs operate with fewer distribution limits across advisory platforms. Distribution Access Seen as Main Catalyst Galaxy pointed to easing restrictions at wirehouses and large advisory networks as a key driver of higher inflows. As more firms allow financial advisers to recommend spot crypto ETFs, Galaxy expects capital from managed portfolios to rise in size and consistency. In addition, the firm said large investment platforms are gradually expanding the list of approved crypto funds. That process, it noted, increases visibility among traditional investors who previously lacked direct access to spot products through standard brokerage accounts. Galaxy also highlighted product timing. New ETF launches often see strong early demand once distribution opens. The firm expects that pattern to repeat in 2026 as additional spot and non spot crypto products reach the market. Dozens of New Crypto ETFs Expected Beyond bitcoin and ether, Galaxy projects more than 50 U.S. spot altcoin ETFs could launch in 2026. These would be joined by roughly another 50 crypto related ETFs that do not track a single asset, including multi asset and leveraged products. Galaxy linked that outlook to a growing pipeline of regulatory filings. It said more than 100 crypto ETF applications are already in progress and argued approvals could accelerate if generic listing standards are finalized. The firm also tied ETF growth to broader capital markets activity. In the same outlook, Galaxy said it expects at least 15 crypto companies to pursue U.S. IPOs or uplistings in 2026, reinforcing the link between public markets and digital assets as crypto becomes further embedded in traditional finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 20:22:37

Binance BTC USD1 Pair Briefly Dropped as Traders Cited Thin Liquidity, Perera Says Shanaka Anslem Perera said a widely shared screenshot claiming Bitcoin fell to $24,000 on Christmas reflected a brief price wick on a single, illiquid Binance trading pair, not a broader market crash. In a post on X, Perera wrote that the BTC USD1 pair “wicked down” about 72% for roughly three seconds, while BTC USDT did not trade below $86,400. He said the move appeared limited to one order book and ended quickly as arbitrage activity closed the gap. Perera linked the volatility to a Binance promotion that he said offered 20% APY on USD1 deposits about 24 hours earlier. He said traders moved from USDT into USD1 to pursue the yield, which he claimed reduced sell side liquidity on the BTC USD1 market. Perera said a large market sell then hit a thin book, pushing the price down to the nearest bids, which he identified as $24,111, before prices normalized. Perera also said a similar spike occurred on Dec. 10, when BTC/USD1 briefly dropped from about $96,000 to $76,000. He argued that posts alleging “manipulation” did not provide on chain evidence, while posts calling it a “crash” drew major attention. Perera added that the episode highlights risks tied to newly listed stablecoin pairs, including liquidity gaps during promotional campaigns. He also said USD1 , the stablecoin used in the pair, is issued by Trump linked World Liberty Financial and has passed a $3 billion market cap.

This unprecedented transaction, reported by the blockchain monitoring service Whale Alert on March 21, 2025, represents one of the largest single-asset burns in decentralized finance (DeFi) history, fundamentally altering the tokenomics of one of the world’s leading crypto protocols. UNI Token Burn: Anatomy of a $592 Million Transaction The transaction originated from a wallet address directly associated with the Uniswap protocol treasury. Subsequently, blockchain explorers confirmed the destination as a verifiable burn address—a public wallet from which private keys are mathematically impossible to generate, ensuring permanent token removal. The 100 million UNI tokens constituted roughly 10% of the protocol’s total initial supply of 1 billion tokens. Consequently, this action immediately reduced the maximum potential circulating supply, creating a deflationary pressure mechanism that market analysts have been closely monitoring for years. Historically, token burns serve as a strategic tool within cryptocurrency ecosystems. For instance, Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a base fee burn mechanism, while Binance Coin (BNB) executes quarterly burns based on exchange profits. However, the sheer scale and one-time nature of this UNI transfer distinguish it from typical, scheduled burn events. The transaction required only standard network gas fees, demonstrating the efficiency of Ethereum’s underlying infrastructure for executing high-value, trustless operations. Decoding the Impact on Uniswap Tokenomics and Market Dynamics The immediate market reaction saw increased volatility in UNI’s trading price across major exchanges. More importantly, the burn triggers a fundamental recalculation of key token metrics. The reduction in total supply increases the scarcity of the remaining UNI tokens, potentially influencing their long-term valuation based on simple supply-and-demand economics. This event also directly affects the protocol’s governance structure, as the burned tokens can no longer be used to vote on future Uniswap Improvement Proposals (UIPs). Expert Analysis: Strategic Protocol Management Industry analysts point to several strategic rationales for such a significant burn. First, it can be a method of value accrual for existing token holders, akin to a stock buyback in traditional finance. Second, it may signal a maturation of the protocol’s treasury management, moving excess or unallocated tokens out of circulation. Third, it could be a proactive measure to align the token’s economic model with long-term sustainability goals, especially as the DeFi sector evolves beyond its initial growth phase. Notably, the action follows a broader trend of DeFi protocols optimizing their token supplies post the 2021-2023 market cycle. To understand the scale, consider this comparison of major historical token burns: Protocol/Asset Approximate Value Burned Year Nature of Burn Uniswap (UNI) $592 Million 2025 One-time treasury transfer Ethereum (ETH) ~$9 Billion (cumulative) 2021-2025 Continuous fee mechanism (EIP-1559) Binance Coin (BNB) ~$600 Million (largest single) 2021 Scheduled quarterly auto-burn Shiba Inu (SHIB) $~1.7 Billion (at time) 2021 Voluntary burn by Vitalik Buterin The mechanics of a burn are straightforward but final. Tokens are sent to an address like `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`. Crucially, this address has no known private key, meaning the assets are provably and permanently inaccessible. This transparency is a core feature of blockchain technology, allowing anyone to verify the event’s permanence. Broader Implications for the DeFi Ecosystem and Regulatory Landscape This event extends its influence beyond Uniswap’s immediate community. It sets a potential precedent for other large DeFi protocols with substantial treasuries, such as Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO. Market observers will now scrutinize their governance forums for similar proposals. Furthermore, the burn interacts with evolving regulatory frameworks. By reducing supply and potentially increasing token value, the action could attract different types of regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning securities law interpretations and market manipulation concerns, even though the transaction was fully transparent and on-chain. For UNI holders, the implications are multifaceted: Supply Shock: A permanent reduction in maximum supply increases the scarcity of each remaining token. Governance Shift: Voting power is now concentrated among the remaining circulating tokens. Value Accrual: The protocol’s value, measured by fees and usage, is distributed across a smaller token base. Market Perception: The move is widely interpreted as a confident, long-term commitment by the protocol’s stewards. Technologically, the event underscores the power and finality of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional finance, where actions can sometimes be reversed, this burn is immutable. It was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and will remain in its history forever, verifiable by any node on the network. This characteristic provides unparalleled certainty for all market participants. Conclusion The transfer of 100 million UNI tokens to a burn address marks a pivotal moment for Uniswap and the wider DeFi sector. This decisive UNI token burn, valued at nearly $600 million, demonstrates a sophisticated approach to protocol-owned liquidity and long-term tokenomics management. By permanently removing a significant portion of the supply, the action reinforces core principles of digital scarcity while providing a transparent case study in blockchain-based treasury management. As the DeFi landscape continues to mature, such calculated, large-scale economic decisions will likely play an increasingly critical role in defining sustainable value and governance for leading protocols. FAQs Q1: What does “burning” tokens mean in cryptocurrency? A1: Burning tokens refers to permanently removing them from circulation by sending them to a verifiable, inaccessible wallet address (a burn address). This reduces the total supply of the asset, making the remaining tokens scarcer. Q2: Why would Uniswap burn 100 million UNI tokens? A2: Potential reasons include: implementing a deflationary mechanism to increase token scarcity, managing the protocol treasury efficiently, accruing value to existing holders, and signaling long-term confidence in the protocol’s sustainable economics. Q3: Can the burned UNI tokens ever be recovered? A3: No. The tokens were sent to a cryptographically secure burn address for which no private key exists or can be generated. The removal is permanent and verifiable by anyone on the Ethereum blockchain. Q4: How does this burn affect the price of UNI? A4: While short-term price movements are volatile, the fundamental effect is deflationary. Reducing the total supply, all else being equal, increases the scarcity of each remaining token, which can create upward pressure on price based on supply and demand principles. Q5: Does this change how Uniswap governance works? A5: Yes. The burned tokens can no longer be used to vote on governance proposals. This concentrates the voting power among the remaining UNI token holders, potentially making governance more responsive to the active, circulating token base.

The law first came into effect in 1994, got updated in 2004, and was lightly amended in 2016 and 2022. But this year’s new rules follow the CPC Central Committee’s direction to “promote high-quality development” in China’s foreign trade. The Committee said:- “This is an important measure taken against the backdrop of profound changes in the global economic and trade landscape and the accelerated restructuring of international rules, and is of great significance for promoting high-level opening-up, maintaining foreign trade order, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign trade operators.” Law lays out legal structure, reform plans, and enforcement muscle The new law is made up of eleven chapters and eighty-three articles. The Committee said foreign trade must serve “national economic and social development” and push the goal of turning China into a “strong trading nation.” And yeah, it puts “national sovereignty, security and development interests” right up front. The law pushes reforms that will legally lock in newer trade models. According to the Committee: “Reform measures such as the negative list management system for cross-border service trade, support and promotion of the development of new forms and models of foreign trade, support and encouragement of the development of digital trade, and acceleration of the establishment of a green trade system have been elevated to legal systems.” A big chunk of the law is aimed at matching “high-standard international economic and trade rules.” Officials are now legally expected to align China’s rules with global standards, but only when it serves the country’s own plan. They’re also expected to help write new global rules, not just follow them. So if there’s a rulebook being passed around, China wants a pen. And if push comes to shove, the law gives China more tools to strike back. According to the Committee, it “improved corresponding countermeasures” and strengthened “legal responsibilities” tied to foreign trade fights. In short: China’s toolbox just got heavier. Beijing links law upgrade to struggling industries and falling profits All this comes as China’s industrial profits are tanking. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows profits fell by 13.1% in November compared to the same time last year. That’s after a 5.5% drop in October. For the first 11 months of 2025, profits are barely in the green, up just 0.1%, down from 1.9% earlier. Bloomberg Economics had expected worse, but a fall is still a fall. Companies are hurting from low demand at home and nasty industrial deflation . And yes, that’s happening even with a tariff truce with the US in place. Some sectors are holding on. Manufacturers posted a 5% rise in profits this year, mainly from tech-heavy industries like aerospace and electronics. Utilities are still growing. But miners are deep in the red, with double-digit losses. The back-to-back profit dips are bad news for future investment and hiring. But government officials haven’t pushed out new stimulus… yet. The growth target for the year is still around 5%, and they think they can hit it without pulling more levers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

At the same time, Tom Lee restated his bullish case that Ethereum could reach higher levels into 2026 as network usage grows. BitMine Stakes $219.2 Million in ETH, With Billions Still Unstaked BitMine staked about $219.2 million worth of Ether on Friday, according to on chain transfers shared by the X account @TedPillows. The transactions showed BitMine linked wallets sending large ETH amounts into staking deposit addresses within hours. On chain records listed several deposits in the same window, including transfers of roughly 16,992 ETH, 20,768 ETH, and 24,544 ETH. Together, the moves supported the claim that BitMine deployed about $219.2 million into Ethereum staking on the day. At the same time, BitMine still holds a much larger Ether position that remains unstaked. The post said the firm holds about $10.759 billion in Ethereum that it could stake later, which would far exceed the amount deposited so far. Ethereum staking locks ETH into the network in exchange for validator participation and rewards. As a result, large deposits often attract attention because they can shift a portion of supply out of liquid circulation while increasing long term exposure to the protocol. Tom Lee Keeps Bullish Ethereum Target for 2026 Meanwhile, Tom Lee reiterated a bullish view on crypto heading into 2026, saying Ethereum could rise from around $3,000 to $7,000 or $9,000 in early 2026, according to a clip circulated on X. Lee also said he still sees a path for Ethereum to reach $20,000 if the network becomes competitive with global payment rails. Lee tied the case to utility rather than trading momentum. In the clip, he pointed to scale, settlement, and real world usage as the main drivers, arguing that Ethereum could shift from a speculative asset toward financial infrastructure if it handles large transaction volumes reliably. He has made similar arguments in past market commentary, where he framed Ethereum’s long term upside around adoption and network effects. In that view, broader use by exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and tokenization platforms matters more than short term price action, because it increases demand for blockspace and settlement on the base layer and related networks. The latest comments came as crypto investors track whether Ethereum’s ecosystem can expand beyond trading and DeFi into payments and settlement for real businesses. That question often centers on fees, throughput, and user experience, since global payments require speed and predictable costs at scale.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 21:00:52

According to our technical indicators, ALGO is bearish, with the fear and greed index indicating an extreme fear sentiment among investors. The charts show that the price drop has slowed, and its volatility dropped as well. Why is Algorand down ALGO’s drop reflects technical triggers and macro headwinds outweighing incremental ecosystem progress. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will not break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains improbable for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment?

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history by CoinGecko Algorand conducted its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 per token. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. In 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January and $0.35 in February. It crossed into October, trading at $0.22. The coin later nosedived, and by December, it had dropped to $0.14.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 21:04:00

For holders of XRP, a critical structural pattern has recently resurfaced on weekly charts that could signal a pivotal moment in the token’s multi‑year cycle. Rather than mere price speculation, this pattern centers on how XRP behaves around its long‑term moving averages — a technical lens that many seasoned analysts consider essential for distinguishing between shallow corrections and deeper cycle lows. In a recent post on X by Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders, the significance of the 50‑week and 100‑week simple moving averages (SMAs) was brought to the forefront for XRP investors. Rietveld’s analysis suggests that how XRP interacts with these key moving averages — especially after prolonged periods below the 50‑week SMA — has historically preceded major shifts in trend direction and can offer insight into potential long‑term entry points for strategic holders. $XRP Holders YOU NEED To Know This!

Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/3MwEx0MGWH — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 26, 2025 The Role of the 50‑Week SMA in XRP’s Market Cycles The 50‑week SMA is widely regarded among technical analysts as a structural divider between sustained bullish trends and extended bearish phases. Historical chart patterns indicate that when XRP trades below this moving average for an extended period (typically around 50–84 days) and then reclaims it on the weekly chart, strong upward momentum has often followed. In 2017, XRP spent roughly 70 days under this level before a notable rally, and in 2021, a shorter period below the SMA also preceded a significant rebound. The most dramatic precedent appeared in 2024, when around 84 days beneath the 50‑week SMA were followed by an approximate 850% surge into mid‑2025. This repeated configuration has led analysts to view extended stretches below the 50‑week SMA not only as periods of bearish pressure but also as potential setup phases for explosive rallies once that level is decisively reclaimed on the weekly timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Approaching the 100‑Week SMA: A Deeper Structural Indicator Beneath the 50‑week SMA lies the 100‑week SMA, another long‑term line that chartists interpret as a deeper measure of structural market floors. When price approaches this longer moving average, it often signals that the market is testing foundational support zones where significant investor capitulation can give way to renewed accumulation phases. Rietveld’s observation that XRP is nearing this level suggests a phase where long‑term buyers may begin positioning ahead of a potential cycle bottom, echoing patterns observed in previous bear markets. Taken together, these two moving averages frame a dynamic corridor in which XRP’s weekly price action unfolds. The interplay between them provides a roadmap of sorts: breaking below the 50‑week SMA typically denotes bearish compression, while proximity to the 100‑week SMA hints that structural lows may be in sight. Broader Market Context and What It Means for Holders It’s important to balance this moving average analysis with broader market indicators. XRP’s price has been under macro pressure along with the wider crypto market , and technical risks such as resistance at key price bands remain relevant. However, the historical consistency of the 50‑week SMA pattern offers a disciplined framework for interpreting price action beyond day‑to‑day volatility. For long‑term holders, understanding these structural benchmarks can be crucial. Rather than reacting to short‑term fluctuations, watching how XRP trades around these long‑term moving averages — particularly the 50‑week and 100‑week SMAs — may provide a more grounded perspective on when historic accumulation windows emerge and when potential trend shifts could unfold.

Critics argue that the banks lobbying to change the GENIUS Act are doing so in order to protect their profit margins from competition and not for safety like they claim. Why are banks trying to change the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is the result of several months of Congressional negotiation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation reached a compromise between banks and stablecoin issuers that prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders, but allows platforms and third-party services to offer rewards and yields. However, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and crypto advocate Max Avery, the banking lobby is now pushing to reopen these settled provisions. Avery posted on X that banks claim their lobbying efforts are due to “safety concerns” and worries about “community bank deposits,” but independent research shows no evidence that community banks are losing deposits at an unusual rate. The real issue is that traditional banks currently earn over 4% interest on customer deposits at the Federal Reserve while they pay customers approximately 0.01% interest on savings accounts. He went on to advise community members to be careful about amendments that would ban “rewards” instead of just directing interest payments from issuers, as that would effectively close the loophole that allows third-party platforms to share yields with stablecoin users. He also questioned whether legislators concerned about stablecoin yields have ever addressed why bank savings rates have remained stagnant for fifteen years despite significant changes in Federal Reserve rates. Why does Coinbase consider this a red line issue? Coinbase has declared that preventing any reopening of the GENIUS Act is a “red line issue” for the company. Coinbase joined other crypto companies in supporting a letter organized by the Blockchain Association, Stand With Crypto, and the North American Blockchain Association to show that the industry is against these lobbying efforts as a whole. Max Avery argues that if Congress allows the banking lobby to reopen and modify settled legislation, leading financial institutions can continuously chip away at frameworks designed to enable new competition. He pointed out that fintech companies considering entering U.S. markets are closely monitoring whether legislation “actually sticks” or can be repeatedly modified to protect current profit margins. Armstrong made a bold prediction that banks will eventually reverse their position and lobby for the ability to offer stablecoin yields once they recognize the market opportunity. He called the current banking lobby efforts “100% wasted effort” and “unethical.” “My prediction is the banks will actually flip and be lobbying FOR the ability to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in a few years, once they realize how big the opportunity is for them. So it’s 100% wasted effort on their part (in addition to being unethical). The innovator’s dilemma is undefeated.” He wrote . If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

With the weekend likely to bring thinner liquidity, patience remains key as the focus shifts to waiting for a cleaner structure and a more reliable scalp opportunity to emerge. Tight Ranges Signal Indecision As Volatility Wanes Cryptowzrd went on to explain that Ethereum’s daily candle closed indecisively, mirroring the lack of clear direction seen across the broader market. ETHBTC also ended the session without conviction, reinforcing the idea that momentum remains muted for now. Related Reading: $6 Billion In Ethereum Options: What This Means For Price The uncertainty extended to the higher timeframes as well, with the weekly candle closing indecisively across most ETF and CME charts. This type of price behavior suggests hesitation among market participants, making it challenging to establish a strong directional bias in the near term. According to the update, healthier price action from ETHBTC will be required before Ethereum can develop a clearer trend. That process may take time, as the pair often leads Ethereum’s relative strength and overall structure. At the time of the post, Ethereum was trading close to the $2,800 support target zone. Holding this area maintains the broader structure, while a stronger bullish push in the future could open the door for a move toward the $3,700 resistance region. For now, the focus shifts to the lower time frame charts over the weekend, where short-term scalp opportunities may emerge. However, expectations remain measured given the indecisive conditions and typically lower liquidity during weekend sessions. Range-Bound Action Keeps Ethereum Traders On The Sidelines In a conclusive summary, the analyst observed that the intraday chart remains characterized by choppy and sluggish price action. The market is currently confined to a narrow range, lacking the decisive momentum required to establish a clear trend. This period of consolidation suggests a “wait-and-see” approach is necessary as the asset stabilizes between its immediate boundaries. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Specific price triggers have been identified to determine the next major move. A break below the $2,880 support level would likely signal a shift toward further bearish decline, whereas a move above the $3,060 resistance would open the door for sustained upside and new long opportunities. Ultimately, the analyst emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the current market environment requires a more mature chart structure before the next high-probability trade can be executed. Until the price breaks out of this intraday range and develops a more defined pattern, the strategy remains defensive to avoid the risks associated with the current volatility.

This New Crypto Could Surge 650%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-under-0-1-this-new-crypto-could-surge-650/,"Noise is not the way that some of the strongest crypto moves begin. They commence when infrastructure is almost exhausted and furnishment starts to die out. That is usually when more senior investors begin to listen attentively. According to market commentators, one of new DeFi crypto is currently entering that phase, where positioning is winning over publicity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): What It Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a DeFi crypto-centered on borrowing and lending. It aims at developing a protocol that humans use, not to trade. The platform will give users an opportunity to provide assets and receive yield as other users borrow against security. As an example, one may invest in ETH or USDT and become interested when borrowers get access to liquidity. Borrowers are forced to overcollateralize their positions and this assists the system in such price swings. Interest rates change depending on the degree of utilization of capital. Rates remain low when the liquidity is high. Liquidity becomes restricted and to stimulate repayments and new deposits, then the rates go up. The balance is meant to ensure efficient flow of capital. As per the documentation provided on the Mutuum Finance X account , the V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be released to the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Key characteristics are liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator robot. The first available assets are ETH and USDT. Another big concern is security. Halborn Security is considering the lending and borrowing agreements of Mutuum Finance. Before any DeFi crypto goes live, it is significant to have a finalized code that is under formal analysis. Involvement and Price Advancement There have been significant inferences regarding Mutuum Finance. This project has garnered close to $19.45M in funds up to date and has created a community of approximately 18,650 holders. These statistics are important since they demonstrate pre-protocol activity. The first price of the token was $0.01 in early 2025. MUTM has since improved to be in the range of $0.035 which is a 250% appreciation. The move indicates increasing confidence because development milestones have been achieved. To most players in the market this kind of price movement indicates that perceptions are becoming premature. Buyers are positioning before activation instead of responding to a completed product. Such behaviour can frequently take place even before utility becomes live, rather than after. Supply Structure and Distribution Signals There are 4B fixed tokens in MUTM. Approximately 45.5% of that supply or about 1.82B tokens are to be allocated at early distribution stages. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. With tightening up, there is less supply to spare. In the past this is when the price sensitivity is high due to limited availability of the tokens at present levels. The site also has a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards the largest contributor to the protocol on a daily basis with MUTM at $500. The aspect will promote consistent attendance and not sharp peaks. It assists in smoothing out distribution and maintains the engagement. The other fact that is important is accessibility. MUTM is a card payment, which makes the entry of new players that are not so invested in crypto easier. This has the ability to get out to a wider audience than a usual DeFi user. Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK token scan that has a score of 90 out of 100. This score shows good outcomes of various security checks. In the future, the Mutuum Finance will present an overcollateralized stablecoin. Stablecoins are essential to lending applications as it lessens volatility and aids predictable lending and inflation habits. This could boost daily usage and will render the protocol more appealing in times of uncertainty in the market. Why Timing is Attracting Urgency As Phase 6 is coming to an end, time has become one of the central issues being discussed by the onlookers. Purchases of whales have been reported as $100k in recent times meaning that there are bigger purchasers of whales who are positioning before the allocation closes. To minimize risk, whales usually wait until late and when the visibility is improving. Supply is tight. Infrastructure is soon to be launched. Security audits are underway. Mutuum Finance is mentioned in the discussion of the potential best crypto to buy now with developing use. At this stage, it is not the question, whether MUTM is early. It depends on whether retained supply would last till wider exposure comes.

This arrest comes after hackers reportedly bribed customer service representatives or contractors to gain access to customer information at the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. In May, Coinbase revealed that hackers bribed contractors or the company’s employees outside to steal sensitive user information. While the San Francisco-based crypto firm faced backlash for allegedly disclosing the data breach months after initial discovery, several employees of the US outsourcing firm TaskUs were laid off following the incident. Former Customer Service Agent Arrested In India On Friday, December 26, a Bloomberg report stated that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a former customer service agent had been arrested in India in connection with the data breach that occurred earlier in the year. The crypto exchange estimated at the time of the incident that this information leak could cost as much as $400 million. Earlier reports suggested that an India-based TaskUs employee was caught taking pictures of her work computer with her phone to sell it to hackers at the start of the year. The suspected employee and an accomplice were providing sensitive Coinbase customer data to malicious actors in return for bribes, Bitcoinist disclosed earlier. Armstrong said in a post on the social media platform X that the Hyderabad Police have picked up an ex-Coinbase customer service agent, with more arrests still to come. “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice,” the crypto CEO said. 2026, Start Of A New Coinbase Chapter? 2025 proved to be another challenging year for security across the global cryptocurrency industry, marked by several significant exploits and hacks that rocked the space. As Bitcoinist reported , over $3.4 billion worth of crypto assets were lost to hacks and exploits this year. However, this latest development would come as a positive step for Coinbase, which largely struggled with platform security in 2025. Earlier in February, an investigative report found that customers lost more than $65 million to social engineering exploits in just two months. Meanwhile, a 23-year-old Brooklyn man was indicted on 31 counts for allegedly operating a phishing scheme that defrauded about 100 Coinbase customers of approximately $16 million in cryptocurrency. Going into 2026, the cryptocurrency exchange would be hoping to offer a more secure platform for its users.",Coinbase|Brian Armstrong|coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency news|hacks,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 22:30:01

The regulator said the scheme operated from at least January 2024 to January 2025 and followed a familiar pattern seen in many modern online investment scams. Fake Crypto Platforms, Real Losses The SEC alleges that the defendants first attracted victims using advertisements on popular social media platforms, and promised easy profits and advanced, AI-generated investment advice. Interested users were then invited to join WhatsApp group chats, where scammers posed as experienced financial professionals and slowly built trust by sharing what they claimed were successful AI-powered trading tips. Once investors were convinced, they were encouraged to open accounts and deposit money on purported crypto trading platforms run by Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor. These platforms allegedly claimed to be properly licensed and regulated, including making false statements about government approval. The SEC says this was not true. The complaint further alleges that the investment clubs promoted fake “Security Token Offerings,” which they said were linked to real companies. In reality, no such companies or offerings existed, and no actual trading ever took place on the platforms. When investors later attempted to withdraw their funds, the defendants allegedly demanded additional upfront fees, a tactic often used to extract even more money from victims. According to the agency, all investor funds were ultimately misappropriated and funneled overseas through a complex network of bank accounts and crypto wallets. In a statement, Laura D’Allaird, chief of the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, said “Our complaint alleges a multi-step fraud that attracted victims with ads on social media, built victims’ trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals and promised profits from AI-generated investment tips, then convinced victims to put their money into fake crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated.” AI-Powered Fraud In addition to AI-generated investment advice, AI deepfakes have also increased significantly. Fraudsters are increasingly using artificial intelligence to produce realistic videos that appear to show well-known figures, such as X owner Elon Musk, endorsing bogus investment schemes on social media. Scammers are also exploiting AI to get around KYC checks, forge customer support conversations, and replicate platform dashboards to appear legitimate. In some cases, they have even abused Zoom meetings by sending fake invites that contain links to malicious software.

The Congress trades were executed within a narrow window in late November 2025, drawing scrutiny over timing and potential conflicts of interest. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal The disclosure shows McCormick purchased shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) in multiple transactions totaling up to $200,000. Two of the largest trades, each valued between $50,001 and $100,000, were executed on November 26 and November 28 but were not disclosed until December 26. Additional purchases included a $15,001 to $50,000 trade on November 25 and another $50,001 to $100,000 purchase on November 24, both filed on November 27. Performance data show mixed results, with the November 25 transaction posting a gain of approximately 2.29%, while the November 24 trade showed a loss of roughly 0.72%. Notably, scrutiny is heightened by McCormick’s role on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, which influences cryptocurrency regulation. To this end, Bitcoin ETFs are highly sensitive to regulatory signals, making such trades by policymakers contentious. McCormick’s other trades Meanwhile, the same December 26 filing also disclosed large municipal bond purchases earlier in the month, including up to $250,000 in Ohio State University general revenue bonds and up to $500,000 in Delaware County, Pennsylvania general obligation bonds on December 17, up to $250,000 in Pennsylvania state general obligation bonds on December 15, and up to $500,000 in Pennsylvania Turnpike municipal securities on December 10, all with coupon rates near 5%. Overall, the filings show a concentrated period of high-value investing across both volatile digital assets and conservative municipal debt, disclosed just after Christmas. Notably, there is no public evidence of any legal violation, and such trades are permitted under current law.

For months, both Bitcoin and major altcoins have struggled to regain their previous highs, while traditional markets have flourished. This difference in performance has sparked discussions about whether the old cycle rule still applies and what could come next for the broader market. Analyst Declares Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Dead A popular crypto analyst with over 227,000 followers on X, @theunipcs, has announced that the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. He stated that this market cycle is now unable to determine the behavior of BTC and many major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 2026 Overhaul Aims To Cut Costs, Boost Speed, Limit Censorship Traditionally, crypto’s four-year cycles have relied on the Bitcoin halving to reduce supply and trigger price surges. However, based on Unipcs’ analysis, these mechanisms no longer govern the market, especially as factors such as monetary policy, Spot ETFs, liquidity flows, macroeconomic factors, and dramatic liquidation events have significantly altered it. Unipcs emphasized that the market has been in a long phase of consolidation and accumulation, showing little of the explosive activity historically expected after halving events. He pointed out that the price of Bitcoin and leading altcoins have remained depressed for months, trading roughly 30% or more below their all-time highs. This decline stands in stark contrast to other major asset classes, which continue to climb. The analyst noted that Silver has been hitting record levels almost daily, while Gold continues to climb to new peaks. Additionally, major US stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, are hitting fresh highs, while crypto remains stagnant and underperforming. Notably, this extended period of weakness is highlighted by Bitcoin’s crash below $85,000 earlier this month after peaking above $126,000 during the first week of October. Many altcoins, including Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and others, have followed a similar trajectory, surging explosively before plunging to new lows. Technical indicators, such as the Fear & Greed Index, indicate that investor sentiment remains deeply negative, while analyst insights point to a bearish market structure. Overall, Unipcs’ analysis signals the possible end of the historically repetitive 4-year cycle, though he suggests it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase for crypto. What’s Next For BTC And The Crypto Market? Despite the prolonged slump, Unipcs believes that the ongoing accumulation trend could end soon, triggering an aggressive rally in the crypto market. He believes that once this happens, Bitcoin and major altcoins could surge explosively to new all-time highs once the dormant market transitions into a new bullish phase. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible While the timing of his optimistic outlook remains uncertain, the analyst is confident in the market’s potential for a decisive breakout and recovery.

The broader cryptocurrency space has also entered a period of weak momentum, with prices moving sideways after recent market declines. Despite this environment, some analysts argue that the current trend could be forming a base for the next major upward movement. One of such views was shared by market analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto), who referenced chart behavior he considers similar to the early stages of two previous XRP rallies. He suggested that the next major move could be significant, adding that many traders may underestimate the setup developing in the market. The most hated $XRP rally is about to start! pic.twitter.com/HTwbTIwxZ2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 16, 2025 Repeated Accumulation Behavior Identified Steph pointed to a recurring formation he classifies as an accumulation cycle. He compared the present structure to two previous periods in which XRP traded similarly before strong price increases. The first example covered early 2015 through early 2017 . During that stretch, XRP price action fluctuated within a narrow range, recording several pullbacks and extended consolidation. Toward the end of 2016, downward movement accelerated, and the asset declined to approximately $0.005 from about $0.00885. After that decline, XRP reversed its trend and later reached a peak of around $3.31 in January 2018. A second structure, according to Steph, developed between mid-2023 and late 2024. In that period, XRP again traded mostly sideways with intermittent drops. From August to November 2024, the token slipped from roughly $0.62 to $0.50 before demand returned. This preceded a surge that carried the price to about $3.4 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analyst Suggests Conditions Are Similar Again The chart shared by Steph shows that after XRP touched the $3.4 region early in 2025, the token entered what he describes as another accumulation band. The price has since declined gradually, intensifying from October 2025 when the asset fell from around $2.8 to its current level. Steph noted that both prior cycles were followed by major rallies, and he believes the same pattern may be unfolding. He warned that those exiting positions prematurely may be overlooking potential upside. Additional analysts also see room for a possible rebound. Chart Nerd recently stated that XRP may be undergoing an ABC corrective phase and pointed out that the $1.8 to $2 range now appears to be functioning as support instead of resistance. Based on this, he expects a positive shift in price action. In the wider community, commentators such as Zach Rector addressed investor frustration regarding the lack of a strong rally this year. Rector maintained that regulatory outcomes, including the resolution of the SEC case, progress toward XRP exchange-traded funds, and the proposed Clarity Act , could form the basis for growth in the coming year. While no outcome is guaranteed, historical accumulation patterns, renewed analyst optimism, and improving regulatory developments suggest that XRP may be entering a potentially decisive phase. Traders are watching closely to determine whether current market conditions will lead to another significant upward trend similar to previous cycles.

As a precaution, stakeholders have been advised to monitor updates closely. Once verified, the team is expected to provide further announcements that detail the cause and potential duration of disruptions to the Flow network. While the investigation is ongoing, speculation has continued. As of December 27, 2025, Flow (FLOW) is trading at $0.11, down from $0.17, some of the lowest levels the token has ever been.

Why did exchanges pause Flow token deposits and withdrawals? On Saturday, after the project flagged a potential security incident affecting its mainnet, crypto exchange Upbit issued a cautionary advisory for Flow (FLOW). According to Upbit, the situation is under review, and there is a possibility for the exchange to take protective measures, including warnings, trading restrictions, or ending support if necessary. Users holding FLOW are urged to be cautious.

A senior executive has now outlined conditions under which the company could reduce or potentially halt these sales. Ripple initially received an allocation of 80 billion XRP. To fund its operations, the company has periodically sold portions of these holdings on the open market. In 2017, Ripple implemented an escrow system that locked up 55 billion XRP and scheduled the release of 1 billion tokens per month. From these releases, a fraction was sold to support operational expenses. Over time, the escrow structure was adjusted, allowing up to 80% of the released tokens, approximately 800 million XRP, to be sold if necessary. These sales, however, have been a recurring concern for investors, with some arguing that steady liquidation pressures can negatively affect XRP’s market price. While these worries have eased in recent years, especially after analyses showed XRP largely tracks broader crypto market trends, periods of market weakness tend to reignite debates over Ripple’s role. I think this is fundamentally the wrong way to think about things, but even if you want to think this way, how is it better if Ripple feels more pressure to sell more XRP if the price drops? Wouldn't you think other sources of income reduce this pressure? — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) November 22, 2025 Reducing Dependence on XRP Sales Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently addressed how the company could lessen its reliance on XRP sales. During a community discussion, he emphasized that the key lies in establishing alternative revenue streams. By generating sufficient income from operations outside of XRP liquidations, Ripple would no longer need to sell tokens to fund its activities. Schwartz’s comments came in response to concerns that Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , could shift the company’s focus away from XRP. A community member suggested that because RLUSD is backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars, Ripple could rely on it for liquidity, thereby reducing its need to sell XRP, particularly if the token’s market price dropped sharply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz rejected the notion that RLUSD could replace XRP in Ripple’s operational strategy. Instead, he highlighted that developing new income sources, such as expanding payment services, licensing blockchain solutions, and supporting institutional adoption, would provide a more sustainable solution. This approach would naturally diminish the company’s reliance on selling XRP while maintaining its commitment to the token’s ecosystem. Investor Implications For XRP holders, Schwartz’s remarks signal a potential shift in the company’s strategy that could ease market pressures from ongoing token sales. If Ripple successfully diversifies revenue sources, the market may experience less volatility linked to routine XRP liquidation. Overall, while XRP sales remain part of Ripple’s operational framework, the executive insight underscores a pathway toward reduced dependence on these sales. By focusing on long-term business growth and alternative revenue models, Ripple could better balance operational funding with market stability, potentially benefiting both the company and XRP investors.

Years of regulatory uncertainty, legal scrutiny, and prolonged underperformance have tempered speculation and reshaped its investor base, leaving behind a market that appears more resilient than reactive. Why XRP No Longer Reacts To Every Negative Headline XRP is starting to trade like an asset that has already endured its hardest trials after years of regulatory overhang, which forced it to mature earlier than most digital assets. An ambassador at AstraAIofficial, Winny, revealed on X that the ETFs linked to the token are now live, providing traditional investors with regulated exposure without the operational friction of wallets or exchanges. At the same time, institutional inflows are rising, with managed assets tied to XRP surpassing $1 billion, a milestone that signals growing confidence. The supply on exchanges balances continues to thin, reinforcing the narrative. Long-term fund purchases don’t trade; they sit, which has changed the pressure dynamics, whether participants would admit to it or not. Most importantly, the regulatory clarity is finally improving, something that the altcoin has lacked for years. Winny concluded that this is about the altcoin graduating into a different market structure . Meanwhile, all this dynamic doesn’t mean the market will explode tomorrow, but it does mean the fundamentals are quietly shifting, and patience pays. Institutions Are Choosing The Altcoin For A Reason Crypto analyst Xfinancebull has explained why it will be too late if no one believes in XRP. The narrative was that ETFs were priced in, but the funds became the fastest altcoin ETF in history to hit $1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), with no outflows, no red days, and just steady institutional-sized capital moving in with conviction. The flow data shows that the funds have absorbed over $666 million in November, followed by another +$470 million in December, with no single outflow day. During the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw hundreds of millions in net outflows, while XRP quietly stacked over 30 consecutive green flow days. Currently, 686 million and 740 million XRP are locked, quietly reducing supply in real-time. However, the reason the altcoin is being chosen is that it solves what institutions actually need, which are complexity-ready settlement, on-chain liquidity, and global transaction speed. XRP’s price is currently down because the entire market is under pressure; that move is macro, not a failure. In Xfinancebull’s view, institutions are still accumulating the token with patience and intent. The markets often whisper before they move, but this time the data is screaming, and institutions are already stacked.",XRP|Altcoin|Assets Under Management|AstraAIofficial|AUM|bitcoin|Ethereum|ripple|Spot XRP ETFs|Winny|Xfinancebull|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 00:00:39

After the Trump-Melania memecoin drama, it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space.” None of my normie friends or family ask me anything about crypto anymore,” he added, highlighting the sentiment among retail traders following the price implosion of memecoins from the Trump family, which have declined by over 90% in value from their highs. The weak search volumes highlight subdued retail investor sentiment, as the crypto market continues to recover from October’s flash crash, one of the most severe single-day drops in its history. Crypto markets reel as fear lingers after October crash October’s market crash led to nearly $20 billion in leveraged liquidations and caused some altcoins to dip by as much as 99% in a single day. The crash also took BTC from a peak above $125,000 to a low of about $80,000 in November, with the price subsequently consolidating between $80,000 and $90,000 since then. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, an index that tracks sentiment about cryptocurrency, reached a yearly low of 10 in November, indicating “extreme fear” among investors, according to CoinMarketCap. According to reports, Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 is sharply divided as traders close the year. The coin was trading at $87,520 at the time of publication and is down 8% year-to-date since January 1. Market mood has been weak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached 20 on December 26, marking two weeks labeled as “extreme fear.” According to posts on X, Jan3 founder Samson Mow contends that 2025 marked the beginning of the bear market and that Bitcoin could be entering a bull run that lasts into 2035. The Fear and Greed indicator still reflects fear among investors, but also a slight improvement over the prevailing market sentiment over the last several months. Several prominent voices still expect sharp gains. Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered and Gautam Chhugani at Bernstein each forecast a price of $150,000 for Bitcoin in 2026. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, predicted a price of $250,000 by 2026 as supply and rising institutional demand are the primary drivers. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Just this one wild year. Both metals crushed everything else. Gold is up 4 times more than the S&P 500. Silver is up 8 times. This whole thing all started with the US Dollar falling apart, plunging down by 9% year-to-date in its worst yearly performance since 2017. Then came the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, which began in September, causing the dollar to lose more strength. And things got messier when President Donald Trump announced on December 12 that he simply wants “1% and maybe lower than that” from the Fed. China tightens silver exports as price hits $85 in Shanghai Silver is up 175% this year, running on an 8-month winning streak, something we haven’t seen since 1980. Just this month, silver prices are up 41%, heading for their best month since December 1979. The Shanghai price is now $85/oz, which is $5 higher than US spot prices and came right before president Xi Jinping’s new export rules kick in for 2026. These rules will force companies to get special government licenses before shipping silver out of the country. And now, everyone’s watching Shanghai as buyers rush in before the controls hit. In Q3 2025, the People’s Bank of China bought 118 tonnes, up 39% month-over-month and 55% compared to last year, though according to Goldman Sachs, China is “hiding” the real numbers. They officially said they bought +15 tonnes in September, but the actual number was closer to 10 times that. So far this year, China claims it’s bought 24 tonnes, but Goldman says the real total is probably closer to 240 tonnes. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down 6% in 2025. It was up 40% earlier this year, then tanked. Leverage killed it. The whole crypto market got wrecked and Cryptopolitan cannot tell you what 2026 might hold for the OG crypto.

As the market consolidates, these smaller assets could hint at early upside moves before BTC breaks out. Key Resistance In Focus: $90,588 And The Descending Trendline According to a recent update by Kamile Uray, there are no changes in the key levels being tracked on the daily chart, as the focus remains on the $90,588 level and the descending blue trendline. Unless BTC can close above these levels, the current decline may continue. Any upward moves below the blue descending trend are considered corrective rather than a trend reversal. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Bull And Bear Cases That Crypto Traders Should Know About The first support zone to monitor during the decline is between $83,822 and $82,477. A daily close below $82,477 would signal a continuation of the downtrend and could open the door toward the $74,496–$71,237 zone, marked by the blue box. This lower zone is viewed as a strong support area where buyers may step in. Thus, a clear reversal confirmation is key before considering any significant upward move. Once confirmed, a rally toward the blue descending trendline could follow, testing resistance levels along the way. For the uptrend to resume decisively, BTC would need to close above $90,588 and break the descending resistance. Meanwhile, a daily close above $94,130 would confirm that the blue descending trend has been broken, potentially signaling a shift to sustained bullish momentum. LTF Moves Show Less Impulse, But Structure Holds Crypto analyst The Penguin noted that the lower time frame (LTF) is showing slightly less impulsive action, though the overall count remains unchanged. The recent moves on the LTF appear more like noise and do not affect the broader wave count, and confidence in a leading diagonal for wave 1 remains intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-or-Break Phase Begins: Weekly Support Holds, Momentum Fades Putting Elliott Wave analysis aside for a moment and leaning on standard technical analysis, BTC is clearly respecting a defined range. As a result, a minor deviation toward the 0.886 level marked on the chart is being closely watched as a potential entry point. Bullish confirmation will come if BTC manages to close and hold above $90,500, which would invalidate the current bearish scenario and signal the potential for a more sustained upward trend. Until then, the short-term fluctuations are considered normal noise, especially with the yearly open approaching. On the altcoin side, momentum appears to be holding, suggesting potential upside. Outperformance is already visible in altcoins like XPL, indicating that while BTC consolidates, some alts are starting to push higher.

Lummis made this statement after Waller released his new proposal to the public during the Payments Innovation Conference held in October of this year. According to reports, the Governor claimed that this suggestion would enable crypto and fintech startups, including banks that only conduct payment activities, to obtain accounts at the Federal Reserve, just like traditional banks’ “master accounts.” However, it was confirmed that this access would involve certain restrictions. Senator Lummis sparks hope for smooth operations in the crypto ecosystem soon Waller’s suggestion ignited heated discussions in the crypto ecosystem. To address this controversy, Senator Lummis issued a statement clarifying the proposal. In the statement, Lummis acknowledged that, “Governor Waller’s skinny master account idea ends Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and paves the way for real payment innovations. This means faster payments, lower costs, and better security — this is how we can responsibly create the future.” Earlier, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was perceived as a strategic approach aimed at hindering banking services, particularly for crypto firms and their founders. To support this claim, Marc Andreessen, a highly influential venture capitalist and staunch advocate for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, asserted that more than thirty tech founders were blocked from accessing banking services in the event of this operation. Meanwhile, reliable sources indicate that Waller’s new proposal marks a significant shift in how officials in the United States view digital assets and other emerging fintech startups. At this point, they perceive cryptocurrencies as essential aspects of the payment system and the future of finance. What still shocked the entire crypto community was the move to deny crypto firms access to banking services that took place even after US President Donald Trump issued an executive order in August instructing banks not to block services to Americans and businesses without a legitimate reason. The executive order further directed banking regulators based in the US, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to identify certain banks and financial institutions that had participated in debanking activities. To demonstrate the intense nature of the situation, reports highlighted that the order illustrated the possibility of these institutions facing serious fines or other forms of penalties. Nonetheless, even with these efforts in place and Trump’s pro-crypto stance, sources close to the matter raised concerns that crypto executives, project creators, and Web3 firms are still subject to debanking issues. Analysts note an increasing debanking attempt impacting crypto firms Banks’ decision to block crypto companies from accessing banking services has become a growing concern in the crypto industry. This trend was noticed when crypto leaders began to report incidents of being victims of such attempts. An example is Jack Mallers, the CEO of the Bitcoin payment company Strike. Mallers claimed that JPMorgan , a massive and leading global financial services firm, decided to suspend its banking services in November without providing a valid reason for doing so. In a separate X post, the CEO highlighted that the sudden decision caught him by surprise, adding that, “Every time I asked them why, they replied the same way: ‘We aren’t allowed to tell you.’ In the meantime, apart from Mallers, recent reports mentioned that JPMorgan Chase had also blocked the accounts of BlindPay and Kontigo. These venture capital-financed stablecoin startups focus on global, specifically Latin American, payments infrastructure in December. Following this move, the largest bank in the US by assets alleged that it made this decision after discovering that these firms were connected to sanctioned areas as the justification.

The price rises first. Participation follows. Afterward, the attention comes at a later point. This trend is usually observed once the infrastructure is near maturity and risk begins to decline. One DeFi crypto is currently in that very window as per industry speculation in which early placement is underway prior to wider exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized financial protocol specializing in developing lending and borrowing. It is not constructed around the hype cycles but the organized usage. There are two central markets in the protocol. The former is a pooling based lending system, commonly referred to as P2C. In such a construction, users deposit assets such as ETH or USDT in common liquidity pools. They, in their turn, are provided with mtTokens. These mtTokens are their deposit that will increase in value, as their borrowers pay them interests. As one example, when a user deposits ETH, they can get a yield having a transferable token which keeps track of their position. The second market is peer-to-peer borrowing. In this case, customers will be able to borrow against their own collateral. The borrow rates will be determined by the type of asset and the risk profile. Less volatile assets can be used to fund higher Loan to Value ratios, and tokens which are more volatile need lower LTVs. In case of too low collateral values, the liquidation rules come into play to save the system. These two markets are working to reconcile flexibility and control of risk. This structure is important since lending of protocols can only scale in a case where there is trust between lenders and borrowers in the system. Mutuum Finance has raised approximately $19.45M so far and has got around 18,650 holders. The significance of these numbers is that it shows early implementation prior to the full establishment of the protocol. V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be launched in Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 with ETH and USDT being the initial assets, according to official statements posted on X. Growth and Increasing Demand MUTM is valued at currently $0.035 and it is at Phase 6. The maximum number of token supply is 4B. Approximately 1.82B tokens, which are about 45.5%of that supply, are to be distributed early. Approximately, 825M tokens were sold. Since the pricing of the token when the token was priced at $0.01 at the beginning of 2025, MUTM has gone up by 250%. This continuous growth indicates increased confidence with the achievement of development milestones. The participants of Phase 1 are positioned at approximately 500% MUTM appreciation in case the token is positively priced at its official launch at $0.06. The phases of price progression have been put in place. The next stage increases the cost progressively. The next Phase 7 will push the MUTM price to an approximate of 20% higher. This is important to early entrants since the price of entry has a direct and positive impact on long-term upside. With the tightening of the allocation, access becomes more difficult to supply at the existing level. Such a dynamic usually alters conduct. Buyers move faster. Greater allocations come up earlier. It is here that people think whale interest is taking shape. Risk Reduction and Security Stack Security is one of the reasons that some investors are now giving increased attention. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK token scanned where it has received a Test Score of 90 / 100. It means that there are good outcomes in various security examinations. Besides this, Halborn security is also doing an independent audit of the lending and borrowing agreements at Mutuum. It is a completed code that is in the process of formal analysis. To a DeFi crypto, this phase is paramount since it lowers the levels of uncertainty prior to the launch. Another aspect that was announced as part of the project was the $50k bug bounty initiative dedicated to the detection of vulnerabilities in code. Another protection level is brought by bug bounties which subject the system to external research to ensure it is stressed. Audits along with bounties facilitate the compression of risk. That is when long-term investors tend to get more comfortable to make increases in exposure. Why Urgency Is Building Now There are a number of indicators that there is an escalating urgency. Phase 6 is over 99% allocated. Recent whale distributions have been up to $100k. Such actions are frequently done in cases where the supply that is left is small but visibility is on the rise. Mutuum Finance is also sponsoring a 24 hour leaderboard that pays out the highest gross daily contributor with MUTM to the tune of $500. This keeps it active and promotes long-term participation as opposed to bursts of participation. The payment options can also be carried out using cards, which reduces friction to new entrants. For a project, the aspect of accessibility may be important when moving to the next stage of early adoption to more widespread recognition. The future of Q1 2026, according to numerous market pundits, is that Mutuum Finance is establishing itself in the market as a potential leading crypto as far as the DeFi crypto sector is concerned. There is almost prepared infrastructure. Information reviews are underway. Supply is tightening..

This transformation reflects a maturing venture landscape where investors prioritize sustainable business models over speculative growth, creating a distinct investment thesis for the world’s third most-funded startup market. India Startup Funding 2025: The Selective Capital Shift The total funding figure of $10.5 billion represents a modest 17% decline from 2024, but the real story emerges in deal-making patterns. According to Tracxn data, the number of funding rounds plummeted by 39% to 1,518 deals, indicating investors wrote far fewer checks while committing larger amounts to proven opportunities. This selective approach created a bifurcated market where capital flowed toward demonstrated success while experimental bets faced significant constraints. Seed-stage funding experienced the sharpest contraction, falling 30% to $1.1 billion as investors reduced exposure to unproven concepts. Similarly, late-stage funding cooled to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline, amid intensified scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved remarkably resilient, rising 7% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, signaling investor confidence in ventures that demonstrate clear product-market fit and revenue visibility. India Startup Funding Breakdown 2025 vs 2024 Stage 2025 Funding 2024 Funding Change Seed Stage $1.1B $1.57B -30% Early Stage $3.9B $3.64B +7% Late Stage $5.5B $7.43B -26% Total $10.5B $12.7B -17% AI Investment Contrast: India’s Pragmatic Approach Nowhere is the divergence from US investment patterns more evident than in artificial intelligence. Indian AI startups raised $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from the previous year. This capital distribution favored application-led businesses over capital-intensive model development, with early-stage AI funding reaching $273.3 million and late-stage rounds securing $260 million. This approach contrasts dramatically with the United States, where AI funding surged 141% to $121 billion across 765 rounds, overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals. “We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India generating $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame,” noted Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel. He emphasized that India lacks large foundational model companies and requires time to build research depth, talent pipelines, and patient capital for that competitive layer. Strategic Focus Areas Beyond Core AI Investors have redirected attention toward sectors where India possesses distinct competitive advantages. Venture capital increasingly flows into manufacturing and deep-tech sectors that face less global capital competition while leveraging India’s talent, cost structures, and customer access. Advanced manufacturing startups have increased nearly tenfold over four to five years, representing what Swaroop describes as a clear “right to win” for India. Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, observed that AI startups accounted for 30–40% of deals in India during 2025. However, he highlighted a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies catering to changing urban behaviors. Categories like quick commerce and household services play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley-style capital intensity, creating sustainable business models aligned with local market dynamics. Government Catalysis and Domestic Capital Strength The Indian government’s growing involvement has significantly influenced the startup ecosystem’s evolution in 2025. New Delhi announced a $1.15 billion Fund of Funds in January to expand capital access, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme targeting energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI. This governmental push catalyzed nearly $2 billion in commitments from US and Indian venture capital and private equity firms, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep-tech startups. The initiative attracted Nvidia as an adviser and drew participation from Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the government co-led a $32 million funding round for quantum computing startup QpiAI, demonstrating unprecedented federal support for cutting-edge technology. Key government initiatives driving startup growth include: Fund of Funds: $1.15 billion to expand startup capital access RDI Scheme: ₹1 trillion ($12B) for research and innovation Deep-Tech Catalysis: $2B private capital mobilization Direct Investment: $32M in quantum computing startup QpiAI Exit Markets and Domestic Investor Maturation Reduced regulatory uncertainty has positively impacted exit markets, with 42 technology companies going public in 2025, representing a 17% increase from 2024. Domestic institutional and retail investors have driven much of the demand for these listings, easing longstanding concerns about excessive reliance on foreign capital for Indian startup exits. M&A activity also strengthened, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals. “This year has disproven that India’s public markets depend mainly on foreign capital,” stated Swaroop of Accel. He emphasized the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings, making exits more predictable while reducing reliance on volatile overseas flows. Women-Led Startups and Investor Concentration Funding for women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at approximately $1 billion in 2025, declining just 3% from the previous year. However, this headline figure masks a sharper pullback beneath the surface, with the number of funding rounds in women-founded startups falling by 40% and first-time funded counterparts declining by 36%. Overall investor participation narrowed significantly as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors participating in funding rounds—a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of this activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating, indicating local capital’s growing prominence as global investors turned cautious. Comparative Analysis: India vs United States Venture Landscapes Data from PitchBook reveals stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the US during 2025. US venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, compared with approximately $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period. However, this gap fails to capture fundamental differences in market dynamics and opportunity structures. Taneja cautioned against direct parallels between the two ecosystems, arguing that differences in population density, labor costs, and consumer behavior shape scalable business models. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found greater traction in India than in the US, reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors. Conclusion India’s startup funding landscape in 2025 reveals an ecosystem maturing through selective capital allocation rather than retreating from global competition. The $11 billion investment total, while slightly reduced from previous years, represents more deliberate deployment toward ventures demonstrating stronger fundamentals, clearer paths to profitability, and alignment with India’s unique market advantages. This evolution positions India not as a substitute for developed markets but as a complementary arena with distinct risk profiles, timelines, and opportunities shaped by domestic dynamics rather than global capital intensity trends. FAQs Q1: How much funding did Indian startups raise in 2025? Indian startups secured approximately $10.5 billion in funding during 2025, representing a 17% decline from 2024 but demonstrating increased selectivity in capital deployment.

Expert Explains What It Is Built For,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/what-does-xrp-really-do-expert-explains-what-it-is-built-for/,"Crypto analyst and XRP advocate Levi Rietveld recently shared a short post on X stating that “$XRP is built for this,” alongside a video clip of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaking about reviewing regulatory barriers around blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems like the crypto industry. Bessent’s comments focused on reforming financial infrastructure so capital markets can function more efficiently for mainstream users. In turn, Rietveld viewed those comments as closely matching the original purpose XRP was created to serve.

Bessent stated that officials will take a close look at regulatory impediments to blockchain, stablecoins, and new payment systems and consider reforms to unleash the power of American capital markets. Notably, this plan corresponds to a more crypto-positive approach adopted by the current US administration under President Donald Trump. $XRP Is Built For This! pic.twitter.com/WNDUoeFPC4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 22, 2025 These are a part of efforts by the US government to modernize crypto regulation and define clearer frameworks for digital assets, including proposed acts aimed at bringing clarity to markets and stablecoins. One example of this is the Clarity Act, a legislative proposal that aims to clearly define the regulatory treatment of digital assets, separate payment-focused tokens from securities, and assign clearer oversight roles to agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Bessent’s comments focused on improving payment systems and removing friction around new financial technology. XRP proponents like Levi Rietveld would quickly point out that the theme aligns closely with how the cryptocurrency and the XRP Ledger were engineered. The XRP Ledger works with transparent settlement, predictable transaction costs, and finality that does not depend on mining or complex smart contract execution. These characteristics are important for institutions that need clarity and reliability. In practice, XRP’s real-world role is most visible through payment solutions developed by Ripple. Banks and other financial institutions do not need to hold large balances of foreign currencies, since XRP can be used as an intermediate asset during settlement. XRP’s Current Regulatory And Institutional Position Progress on regulatory clarity has been helping real institutional infrastructure around XRP. Multiple Spot XRP ETFs have gained approval and launched in 2025 and early numbers are positive, with over $1.14 billion worth of inflows. Bloomberg estimates suggest these funds could draw $5 billion to $7 billion in institutional capital by 2026. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires?

Following his warning, Schiff expressed his belief that the cryptocurrency would face the reverse effect of silver’s surge. According to him, any adjustments could occur swiftly, as market downturns often accelerate under stress. This statement came after the prices of silver increased significantly in one day, boosting the metal to a record level above $79 per ounce, marking the first time in history. Silver’s surge prompts Schiff to issue a warning regarding Bitcoin Concerning Schiff’s warning, reliable sources reveal that the prominent financial expert shared an X post offering his insights at a time when investors witnessed silver rise by more than 10% in a short period. To clearly explain the situation, market data indicate that this rally pushed silver from a level of $78 to approximately $79 in about ninety minutes. The increase drew the attention of several individuals globally, as the metal had been demonstrating a steady rise for several months. Moreover, a TradingView chart showed a sharp breakout as the price surged to a new historical peak. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that silver’s surge had also played a crucial role in the metal ecosystem by improving the overall market sentiment towards metal assets. Interestingly, the substantial performance of tokenized commodities supported by cryptocurrency illustrates this trend, as reports pointed out that their total value nears $4 billion. This finding indicates that several investors prefer alternative assets. On the other hand, data from CompaniesMarketCap revealed Silver’s recent efforts to narrow the gap with NVIDIA in overall market value. This move has prompted analysts to suggest an increased likelihood of heightened demand from institutions and growing interest in commodities among investors. In the case of Bitcoin, sources reported that the cryptocurrency’s price remained close to $87,000, showing slight movement over the last 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap also revealed that major cryptocurrencies encountered minimal daily gains. The fate of silver and Bitcoin sparks debates in the industry The surge in Silver’s price has initiated heated discussions in the ecosystem as recently released updates intensify these debates. For example, a new chart from Ted Pillows noted that the metal’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) reached a new all-time high in forty-five years. As this reading showed a bullish trend, analysts commented that the big question raised in the industry is the duration of the trend. Another conclusion drawn from this reading was the dramatic progression of the current silver price breakout. In comparing the progress of Bitcoin to silver over many years, another chart highlighted that the cryptocurrency has substantially lost its relative gains that date back to eight years ago. Such a shift prompts individuals to believe that silver has surpassed BTC in the recent market rally. In the meantime, with silver priced at roughly $80, a model that compares silver to BTC estimates that the cryptocurrency’s value should be approximately $394,000. With this estimation in mind, traders raised concerns about whether the digital asset could catch up with silver, should market conditions change. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Some are steady, foundational, and reliable, like Ethereum, powering decentralized finance with strong security and a deep smart contract ecosystem. Others, like Cronos, focus on speed and accessibility, supporting efficient transactions and cross-chain connectivity. Then there’s APEMARS ($APRZ), a mission that doesn’t just move; it builds momentum. With the whitelist now live, APEMARS is opening the doors to early access ahead of its crypto presale, inviting supporters to align with the project before Stage 1 begins. Rather than positioning itself as a conventional token, APEMARS frames participation as a narrative-driven expedition where community energy helps shape each milestone of a 23-stage journey. For anyone tracking crypto presales , this is a chance to get in early on a project designed around structure, engagement, and engineered scarcity. Among the best presale crypto projects to watch in 2026, APEMARS stands out by combining a clear mission concept with a staged rollout that rewards early attention, setting the foundation for what could become the next major narrative-led launch. Stage 1 Launch: Board the APEMARS Mission and Multiply Your Rewards Momentum is everything, and APEMARS is building it well before launch. With the whitelist now live and Stage 1 approaching, the project is positioning itself ahead of most upcoming crypto presales by anchoring participation to a clear, milestone-driven mission. This isn’t passive interest; it’s early alignment with a journey where each stage matters and every token represents a deeper role in an unfolding narrative. Central to this structure is the Thermal Disposal Protocol, a precision-based scarcity mechanism built into the presale design. At Stages 6, 12, 18, and 23, any unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. These scheduled burns progressively tighten supply, reinforce long-term value dynamics, and maintain momentum throughout the mission. It’s a deliberate system that reflects the planning seen in only the most strategically designed crypto presale projects. Complementing this is the APE Yield Station, which converts long-term commitment into measurable rewards. Offering a 63% APY, inspired by Mars’ average temperature of –63°C, the staking model allows early participants to position themselves from the outset. While rewards activate two months after listing to support supply stability, the structure is designed to compound over time, favoring those who align early and remain committed. No complex tracking, no additional actions, just a streamlined reward system built for participants who join the mission before liftoff. Pocket Change to $16K: The 32,000% ROI Trade Nobody Wants You to See Here’s what most people don’t realize: $50 at Stage 1 priced at just $0.00001699 per token locks in approximately 2,943,240 APEMARS. That’s less than your weekend takeout. Less than a tank of gas. Yet when this rocket lists at $0.0055, that throwaway fifty transforms into $16,187. A 32,269% ROI that makes early Bitcoin look tame. Let that number burn into your brain: sixteen thousand dollars from pocket change. Now scale that mental math. If $50 delivers five figures, what does $500 unlock? What about $5,000 when you catch Stage 1 at peak discount? This isn’t hype, it’s the kind of upcoming top crypto presale opportunity designed for strategic participants. Structured, deflationary economics with burn mechanisms and staking multipliers are baked into the mission. Every stage climbs. Every burn tightens the supply. Every minute you wait, someone else is stacking the position you’re debating. This upcoming presale offers a unique loop of value: scarcity from scheduled burns drives demand, while staking multiplies potential gains for those bold enough to join early. Stage 1 is coming soon, milestones are on schedule, and every token you hold places you at the heart of a community-powered journey toward a symbolic Mars landing. Missing the launch isn’t just a delay; it’s missing the opportunity to board before lift-off and witness one of the next big crypto opportunities in action. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the APEMARS whitelist is a simple step that positions you early ahead of the upcoming crypto presale. Interested participants can visit the official APEMARS website and submit their email address through the whitelist form. Once submitted, a confirmation email is sent to acknowledge successful registration. With the whitelist now live, this early step allows participants to stay informed, receive official updates, and be ready as Presale Stage 1 approaches, securing awareness of the lowest entry point before the mission begins. Ethereum: The Pillar of Decentralized Finance Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Its ERC-20 standard ensures security, scalability, and integration with thousands of dApps. Recent market movements show continued adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure, reaffirming Ethereum as a long-term powerhouse. Utility is its strength: Ethereum powers decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and smart contracts with battle-tested reliability. Its upgrade paths continue to enhance transaction speed and reduce gas fees, making it a practical option for both developers and participants. While crypto presales offer explosive early-stage potential, Ethereum’s stability and ecosystem dominance make it a foundational asset for any serious crypto portfolio. Cronos: Speed and Interoperability Across Chains Cronos excels in cross-chain operations, bridging assets between Ethereum, Cosmos, and Binance ecosystems. Fast confirmations and low fees make it ideal for users seeking quick, cost-efficient transactions. Its growing adoption in DeFi and NFT projects highlights the chain’s versatility and strong ecosystem support. Beyond speed, Cronos offers staking, native DEX support, and a focus on scalability, showing how mature networks balance utility and growth. In a market that moves quickly, observing such established chains reinforces a key insight: early participation in emerging projects can provide unique entry advantages. Low-entry presales, for instance, capture momentum before broader market recognition, a strategy that complements established holdings like Cronos. For investors looking to diversify, combining stable, high-performance networks with selective early-stage presales can position them to benefit from both reliability and rapid upside potential. Conclusion: Why APEMARS Stands Out Across Ethereum, Cronos, and APEMARS, the market presents diverse opportunities. Ethereum offers stability, Cronos offers speed, but APEMARS compresses narrative, scarcity, and explosive potential into a single, story-driven upcoming crypto presale. For those seeking crypto presales with symbolic design, structured growth, and immersive storytelling, APEMARS could be the next crypto to explode in 2026. Early-stage participation doesn’t merely position you in a market; it places you in a community-powered journey with mathematically reinforced opportunity. Whitelist 1 is live, the capsule is primed, and the countdown to Mars has begun. Join the mission, stake your position, and be part of the next big crypto phenomenon before the rocket leaves the pad.

Among upcoming crypto presales, the Stage 1 APEMARS launch stands out for momentum, scarcity, and community-driven rewards, making it a top choice for early participants. Which crypto has 1000x potential? The next big crypto often comes from structured presales with deflationary mechanics. APEMARS whitelist demonstrates exactly that potential. What is the biggest crypto presale in history? Past presales like Ethereum set records, but today’s best crypto projects like APEMARS combine narrative, staged scarcity, and staking rewards, offering a new benchmark in opportunity. Is it good to buy crypto in presale? Participating in crypto presales allows early access to tokenomics, staking rewards, and deflationary mechanics, creating a chance for exponential growth. Summary For investors exploring upcoming crypto presales and top altcoin picks, projects like APEMARS, Ethereum, and Cronos each offer distinct opportunities. Ethereum provides long-term stability and proven utility in DeFi and smart contracts, Cronos delivers fast, low-cost transactions with cross-chain interoperability, and APEMARS combines narrative-driven engagement, staged token burns, and 63% APY staking to create momentum and early participation advantages. By balancing established networks with innovative presale projects, investors can strategically position themselves for growth while participating in both reliable ecosystems and high-potential missions shaping the next big crypto landscape.

On-chain data from TradeFi.Network shows that total RWAs tokenized on the XDC Network have reached $717 million . More striking, however, is where that capital is concentrated: $345.3 million , roughly 48% of the network’s RWA , is now deployed through VERT Capital in USDC-denominated private credit pools. The data points to something more deliberate: institutional private credit moving on-chain at scale and selectively . (Source: TradeFi Network ) What the Data Signals Three signals emerge clearly from the numbers: Capital is consolidating, not diversifying. Nearly half of all RWAs on XDC are managed by a single private-credit allocator, suggesting conviction rather than experimentation. Private credit has overtaken other RWA categories. Unlike tokenized treasuries or commodities, these pools represent long-duration, yield-bearing credit instruments, traditionally among the least transparent corners of finance. Settlement risk is being minimized. The exclusive use of USDC indicates institutional preference for regulated, fiat-backed settlement over volatile crypto assets. Why XDC, and Why Now? Private credit markets exceed $1.6 trillion globally and are expected to reach $3 trillion, according to Moody’s analysis , yet much of the infrastructure remains manual and opaque. Tokenization does not change credit risk, but it radically changes settlement speed, reporting, and operational efficiency . (source: Moody ) The XDC Network has quietly positioned itself around those exact requirements: low transaction costs, predictable finality, and permission-aware infrastructure tailored for financial institutions. The result, according to TradeFi data , is not a surge of small issuers, but fewer, larger pools deploying meaningful capital . One of the largest concentrations of tokenized private credit has formed without marketing campaigns or retail incentives. If this pattern continues, the next phase of RWA adoption may be defined less by pilots and more by which blockchains quietly become settlement layers for institutional balance sheets .",Press Release,EN,0,0,MARKET|MINING|XDC|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-28 03:47:31

Trading followed a “low start, high finish” pattern, amidst tight macro liquidity early in the year and stronger risk appetite later on. CoinGlass said that the global derivatives market has “solidified into a stratified oligopolistic landscape.” Crypto Derivatives Trading in 2025 According to CoinGlass’ 2025 Crypto Derivatives Market Annual Report, derivatives continued to serve as the main venue for price discovery and risk management, and peak activity was recorded on October 10, when single-day volume surged to around $748 billion. Market share remained highly concentrated. Binance led by a wide margin, accounting for over 29% of global derivatives volume, or $25.09 trillion for the year. OKX, Bybit, and Bitget followed suit, and together with Binance controlled more than 62% of total volume. A sharp drop-off appeared beyond the top tier, as long-tail exchanges held marginal shares and weaker liquidity. Open Interest (OI) also showed extreme swings. After heavy deleveraging in Q1 pushed OI to a low of $87 billion, leverage rebuilt rapidly and peaked at a record $235.9 billion in early October before a sudden $70 billion wipeout in Q4. Despite this, CoinGlass found that year-end OI still rose 17% from the start of the year. Binance again led in leverage concentration, as it held about 28% of daily average OI, while the top five exchanges controlled more than 80% overall. Liquidity, Custody, and Risk Liquidity depth data further validated this dominance. Binance’s BTC order book depth far exceeded all peers, and OKX ranked a distant but clear second, especially for institutional-sized trades. User asset custody was found to be even more concentrated. Binance held over 72% of custodial assets, with an HHI score of 5,352, which indicated extreme oligopoly. OKX ranked second, while the remaining platforms shared a much smaller pool. Liquidations were nearly $150 billion in 2025, mostly routine, but systemic stress was concentrated in the October 10-11 event, when combined liquidations surpassed $19 billion in a single day following a major macro shock tied to new US tariffs on China. High leverage, crowded long positions, and strained liquidation and ADL mechanisms amplified volatility, especially in altcoins. While BTC and ETH suffered moderate drawdowns, many smaller assets collapsed.

The maiden cryptocurrency is presently consolidating within the $87,000, while investors patiently anticipate a clear market direction. According to pseudonymous analyst Sunny Mom, recent on-chain analysis suggests that bearish sentiment will remain dominant in the coming months following the initial extended correction in October and November. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Dead: Crypto Trader Explains What Happens Next Why Rising Short-Term Bitcoin Supply Is Flashing A Rare Bearish Signal In a QuickTake post on December 27, Sunny Mom draws attention to the BTC HODL waves, which show the rising share of short-term holders coinciding with falling prices, flipping a metric that typically supports bullish narratives. Historically, an increase in short-term holder (STH) supply, coins held for less than 155 days, suggests fresh capital is entering the market ahead of sustained rallies. However, the analyst described the current move as “passive bag-holding” rather than signaling “new blood.” This is because investors who bought during the $120,000 rally in October, driven by FOMO, alongside dip buyers in November, now sit on unrealized losses, thereby creating a price setup that alters market behavior. Sunny Mom explains that each relief rally is met with selling pressure as these holders attempt to exit at breakeven, effectively turning the expanding STH cohort into a ceiling rather than a floor. Therefore, price rebounds struggle to gain traction. The renowned analyst explains that the market is witnessing an emotional toll that is growing visibly on-chain. Notably, there have been repeated spikes in Net Realized Loss (NRL) since October liquidations, suggesting that capitulation is underway, with investors locking in losses after months of endurance. Sunny Mom describes the process as a “dull knife” finally cutting deep, an indication that weaker hands are being forced out, not through a single crash, but through prolonged exhaustion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Face Prolonged Pain As Key Metric Stays Red Bitcoin In Demand Vacuum As Likely Fall Below $80,000 Remains Active In further analysis, Mom attributes the current bearish setup to a demand vacuum. The market expert explains that exchange reserves are sitting near multi-year lows, signaling limited immediate sell-side liquidity. At the same time, long-term holders (LTHs) show little interest in distributing coins, reinforcing the view that conviction capital remains intact. Therefore, the problem lies on the demand side. With macro uncertainty still elevated, new buyers appear hesitant to step in, creating a demand vacuum. This also creates thin order books, meaning even modest sell pressure can push prices sharply lower. While some market watchers target a potential recovery in Q1 2026, citing expectations of rate cuts and improved global liquidity. Mom predicts Bitcoin may need a “final shakeout” to resolve the imbalance and reset the market for a bullish breakout. The analyst points to a potential move below $80,000 as a liquidity hunt that could flush remaining weak hands and allow larger holders to reaccumulate.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $640.49. In 2031, AAVE will range between $864.66 to $1,040.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $155.33 Market cap $2.361B Trading volume (24-h) $253.91M Circulating supply 15.19M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $154.69 24-hour high $157.10 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.57% (High) 50-day SMA $184.47 14-Day RSI 40.07 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $229.63 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways : AAVE is trading below the key daily resistance, maintaining a bearish trend. A break above $160 is required for upside continuation. A price drop below $152 risks further downside. Aave 1-day price chart As of December 28, AAVE is trading around $155 after a steep breakdown from the $180–$190 zone, confirming a short-term bearish trend structure. The price remains below the mid-Bollinger Band near $175, which now acts as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the lower band, around $137, marks the next downside risk if selling resumes. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering near 40, signaling weak momentum with no clear bullish divergence yet, and MACD remains deeply negative despite early histogram compression, suggesting bearish momentum is slowing but not reversing. The daily structure implies consolidation or a weak bounce is possible, but failure to reclaim $165–$170 keeps the broader bias pressured. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, AAVE is consolidating between $153 and $157 after a corrective bounce, aligning closely with clustered moving averages around $155–$156. This compression shows indecision rather than strength, with Balance of Power staying negative and volume flow flattening, indicating buyers lack conviction. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The recent lower high near $158 reinforces short-term resistance, while a loss of $152 would likely reopen the path toward $148 and potentially $145. Only a clean reclaim and hold above $160 would flip the intraday structure back in favor of bulls. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $211.46 SELL SMA 5 $186.11 SELL SMA 10 $184.89 SELL SMA 21 $184.85 SELL SMA 50 $184.47 SELL SMA 100 $214.86 SELL SMA 200 $229.63 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $176.46 SELL EMA 5 $186.70 SELL EMA 10 $212.48 SELL EMA 21 $246.85 SELL EMA 50 $271.74 SELL EMA 100 $270.87 SELL EMA 200 $254.72 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is transitioning from an impulsive downside to a consolidation phase, but without a decisive reclaim of $160–$170, any upside looks corrective rather than trend-changing. The market is watching for either a volatility squeeze breakout or a continuation breakdown toward lower daily support. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve.

According to him, this move has consequently yielded considerable wealth for the United States. Nonetheless, market indicators revealed that investors expressed their belief that there will be no reduction in the Federal Reserve’s interest rates in the near future. This message was initially posted on Trump’s Truth Social , where he related tariffs to improved national security and economic prosperity. The president also noted that the trade deficit in the US markets has drastically declined and that the country’s economy is expanding without encountering inflationary pressures. Trump praises his decision on tariffs as a significant milestone for the US Trump referred to tariffs as a game-changer for the US economy . He claimed that tariffs had led to the nation’s dramatic economic growth, the creation of general economic confidence, and the restoration of the nation’s international respectability. He made this statement at a moment when economic futures heavily influence the outlook of financial markets. Another reliable source highlighted that the US government plans on adjusting some of Trump’s tariff frameworks. However, even with this situation in place, sources claim that the overall market sentiment appears to take a different approach to the matter. This finding was noted after Polymarket forecasts centered on a decision made by the Federal Reserve in January showed just a 14% likelihood of an interest rate cut occurring. These results suggested an 85% chance among traders that interest rates will be maintained steady at the next meeting. These very low odds of a significant interest rate reduction led analysts to conclude that the situation demonstrates more caution than optimism. In the meantime, as Trump views trade and production as a great milestone for the country, investors have raised concerns about inflation and growing uncertainties surrounding the economy. Following this report, sources mentioned that investors responded similarly earlier when the cryptocurrency market surged after Trump announced the implementation of a $2,000 dividend tax on eligible American citizens. After considering several factors related to the current US market, analysts conducted research. They discovered that market expectations suggest that borrowing costs are likely to stay high in the long run. Some of the factors said to have set off this risk are rising tensions over cost stability and the fact that global economic growth has been sluggish Meanwhile, it is worth bearing in mind the contradictory part noted between what the US president believes in and the overall market sentiment. At this point, sources confirm that Trump’s remarks focus on policies and the economic rebound. At the same time, market trends suggest that policymakers and traders consider simpler financial conditions to be essential. The White House adopts backup plans in case the judge’s ruling does not favour them Several economists contributed to heated discussions over the fate of the Fed rate cut. They alleged that the prospect of interest rate cuts showed growing investor confidence in the economy. They also pointed out that if, by any chance, the likelihood of rate cuts declines, then the situation will indicate that inflation is being controlled. Nonetheless, it was also discovered that the situation might raise tensions among individuals regarding economic stability. Currently, most of the feedback gathered focuses more on pessimism than optimism. Meanwhile, a recent report claimed that the White House has started adopting several backup plans just in case the Supreme Court prohibits the Trump administration’s authority over tariffs. Agencies, on the other hand, reported that they were thoroughly investigating other available legal choices for assuming responsibilities. Polymarket traders participated in discussions regarding the Trump administration’s authority over tariffs. They drastically reduced the odds of a tariff victory after justices asked how far executive powers go in the matter, leading to a major change in the prices of cryptocurrency. At this point, Bitcoin experienced a surge because of new uncertainty.

According to Arkham, various Bitmine-linked wallets paid a large amount of Ether into a contract known as “BatchDeposit” on Sunday, approximately 74,880 ETH. Before this, though, the company had never staked its holdings, despite owning one of the largest ETH treasuries in the market. It recently reached a 4 million token count, having purchased close to 100,000 ETH in the past week at an average cost of $2,991 per token, bringing its holdings back into profit as ETH moved above $3,000 over the weekend. Bitmine intends to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply On-chain analyst EmberCN commented on Bitmine’s staking, saying, “The largest Ethereum treasury company BitMNR (BMNR) has finally started attempting to stake its held ETH to earn interest income. This is their first time staking, and they now hold 4.066 million ETH, with an approximate APY of 3.12%. If all of it were staked, they could earn about 126,800 ETH in interest over a year, which at the current price of $2,927 would be worth $371 million.” Since June, the firm has been performing exceptionally well, with shares surging 606%, as investors back the company’s concentrated exposure to Ethereum’s long-term value. The firm’s chairman, Tom Lee, affirmed their success, noting that the firm is consistently increasing its Ethereum exposure, reaching 4 million tokens just five and a half months after rolling out the plan. The company still plans to hold 5% of all Ether in circulation. Currently, it holds about 3.37% of Ethereum’s total supply. Even in November, the company announced that it would start Ether staking in Q1 2026 on its own Made-in-America Validator Network, beginning with an initial pilot effort involving three institutional staking partners. Under the program, the goal would be to create more customer-generated investment value through staking, all in concert with the company’s fundamental accumulation plan. Tom Lee estimates that Ethereum will reach $7,000 by early 2026 As year-end trading slows, ETH has remained between $2,900 and $3,000. Nonetheless, Lee is hopeful that by early 2026, Ethereum could reach $7,000–$9,000 through tokenization. Ethereum now has a market capitalization of $354 billion and is valued at $2,928, down approximately 1% over the previous 24 hours. Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of Sharplink Gaming , also expects Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) to grow tenfold by 2026 as institutions become more committed and new on-chain applications enter the market. Stablecoins are also fueling growth , he said, and he anticipated the market could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a 62% bump. With over half of stablecoin transactions hosted on Ethereum, constant issuance and activity could significantly drive its TVL higher. He also predicts that the stakes of sovereign wealth funds will rise five to ten times as tokenization expands, while Ethereum remains at the center (or basis) of blockchain development. He also noted that RWAs could surpass $300 billion by 2026, reflecting the increased participation of large financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock . He added, “Ethereum’s stronghold on stablecoins, RWAs, and the future of tokenized equities make it a core technology asset. It’s not only a bet on the future, it’s a hedge against globalization and technological shifts happening, and ensuring their principals stay involved in the economic upside.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-moonshot-incoming-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator Crypto Captain (@UniverseTwenty) recently posted a short but notable statement on X. He stated, “XRP Moonshot Incoming,” capturing the bullish sentiment surrounding the asset. While XRP has experienced months of sideways trading, several factors could push it higher in late 2025 and 2026. ETF Inflows Drive Demand Spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. have gained traction in late 2025. Multiple ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in inflows since their launch, with more than a month of consecutive net inflows . Institutional investors now have regulated access to XRP. These inflows provide steady demand and strengthen price support. These products also boast over $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). Analysts note that continued ETF purchases could maintain upward pressure on XRP, and the positive inflow data reinforces that belief. #XRP Moonshot Incoming pic.twitter.com/UObP7lzglD — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 25, 2025 Ripple’s Acquisitions and Partnerships Ripple has expanded its ecosystem through acquisitions and partnerships in 2025. The launch of Ripple Prime and prime brokerage services is a major one. However, the company has made quiet moves to give XRP a foothold in global finance and increase institutional access. Partnerships across Asia and Latin America enhance XRP’s use in cross-border payments. This growth adds practical utility to the token beyond trading. Integration into financial networks may encourage adoption and long-term holding. Regulatory Clarity Reduces Risk The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the SEC also ended in 2025 . After years of price suppression, XRP finally gained its full legal clarity in the U.S. This development removed uncertainty for many institutional investors and enabled spot ETF approvals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reduced regulatory risk attracts institutional capital. This gives the market more confidence to participate. With clearer rules, investors can enter the XRP market with less concern over sudden legal obstacles. What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s outlook in late 2025 and 2026 rests on multiple converging factors. ETF inflows provide access and liquidity for institutional investors. Ripple’s strategic acquisitions and partnerships add utility and adoption. Legal clarity reduces risk. Prolonged consolidation and reduced supply on exchanges have also created a foundation for a possible price surge. Whale accumulation and positive sentiment could further support upward movement. Investors are watching how these elements interact. With ETFs fueling demand, Ripple’s network expanding, and regulatory hurdles cleared, XRP could see renewed strength.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-daily-chart-looks-ready-for-massive-breakout-heres-why/,"XRP is trading at a critical technical level after months of controlled downside movement on the daily chart. Crypto analyst Crypto Captain (@UniverseTwenty) shared a chart highlighting a prolonged descending channel that has guided its price action and is now nearing a potential breakout point. XRP has spent the second half of the year trading lower in a structured decline. Sellers maintained control, and the downtrend remained steady. That behavior kept XRP compressed as volatility continued to fade. This compression now places the market near an inflection point. #XRP Daily Chart Looks Ready For Massive Breakout pic.twitter.com/TiKkU7IB2L — CRYPTO CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 25, 2025 Descending Channel Nears Resolution The daily chart shows XRP trading inside a downward-sloping channel since its peak in July . Each rally stalled at descending resistance, and each pullback held above the lower trendline. This pattern produced a sequence of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a sustained corrective phase rather than a collapse. In recent weeks, XRP rebounded from support near $1.75. Buyers stepped in aggressively at that level. The price then pushed higher toward the resistance near $1.9. The distance between support and resistance has narrowed, signaling growing pressure, and markets rarely stay compressed for long. Crypto Captain described the setup as looking ready for a massive breakout . The chart supports that view by showing price now testing the same resistance that rejected every rally since October. A daily close above this level would break the pattern of lower highs and invalidate the channel structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Key Levels If Resistance Breaks A confirmed breakout above the channel could open the door to higher prices. The first area to watch sits between $2.1 and $2.3. XRP previously consolidated in this zone before accelerating lower. That makes it a logical area for the asset to revisit if momentum continues to build. Above that range, the next major resistance appears near $2.50. This level aligns with prior swing highs from November. Reclaiming it would mark a clear trend shift on the daily timeframe. Such a move would also restore bullish market structure after months of downside control. The final level is near $2.7 , as this level capped XRP’s rallies in October. If the asset can breach this level, it could target higher prices above $3, reclaiming levels not seen since early October. For now, market participants are focused on a breakout above the descending channel. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has accumulated $19,500,000 from its strategic presale, garnering 18,590 supporters for its upcoming launch. Solana’s network sees continued activity regardless of market volatility. Both of these assets are taking different stances in their industry. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a dual-market lending protocol that includes an overcollateralized stable cryptocurrency and yield strategies. Traders are reassessing their investment strategies for year-end, and these assets are becoming hubs for DeFi crypto technology. Solana Faces Price Fluctuations Solana’s ability to handle millions of transactions every day throughout this year of 2025 has proven its technical strength even during times when the price of its token faced pressures. It has also been hosting numerous decentralized applications that range from trading platforms to NFT marketplaces and more. It’s considered one of the best cryptos that provide faster transaction processing times. The transaction costs are low compared to other competing blockchain systems, making it possible for Solana to support transactions that could not actually be economically feasible on other systems. Looking at the price trend recently, Solana is experiencing resistance points which have been used as regions of consolidation in the past. The Solana blockchain’s number of validators and distribution of stake is increasing. However, investors considering which cryptocurrency to invest in should note that Solana is established and thus its growth trajectory is different from that of other systems which are still at development stages. Mutuum Finance Presale is Almost Through Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has allocated 99% of its Phase 6 tokens, prompting investors to take advantage of the current price of $0.035. Phase 7 will start with a direct price hike to $0.04, signaling a 20% growth before the exchange listing. Since the token has given a 250% return on investment for investors who joined during the $0.01 price for Phase 1, the new investors will make at least 400% profit once the price is $0.06. Such an increase in price is based on a genuine demand within the marketplace, which is not a product of hype, seen by the steady increase through the six stages of presales. Investors are falling behind schedule and are about to miss the last chance to purchase tokens at less than four cents, given how fast Phase 6 is selling out. Launched through this project is an interactive dashboard showing top 50 holders, an element that promotes a competition mechanism to ensure heightened participation. Additionally, a 24-hour leaderboard has been incorporated whereby the top user qualifies for a $500 MUTM bonus, provided there has been at least one trade made within the 24-hour period. The leaderboard reloads every day at 00:00 UTC. In addition, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token has also made it possible for people to make payments using their cards, with no limitations on the transaction amounts, which previously hindered potential buyers who invested through crypto-wallet payments. Halborn Security audits the lending and borrowing contracts for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This is after the code is now finalized and is being formally analyzed for any issues that could concern new DeFi crypto projects’ investors. Last Chance Before Pricing Increases The closure of phase 6 will thus signal the end of prices below four cents for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It is thus providing a clear marker for investors to choose a cryptocurrency to invest in prior to 2026. Solana is a good network play, but Mutuum Finance offers earlier stage access with clear near-term goals. Positioning must be considered prior to Phase 7 Pricing.

56484394,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1424434,1766907084,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/56484394.jpeg,"The 2025 Bitcoin Report: Strategic Reserves, Record Highs, and Q4 Crash",https://cryptopotato.com/the-2025-bitcoin-report-strategic-reserves-record-highs-and-q4-crash/,"2025 has been a very eventful year for the Bitcoin network and BTC as an asset. The ecosystem recorded notable growth and expansion, alongside rising adoption from traditional finance entities. But it hasn’t been a smooth ride. As the year unfolded, Bitcoin experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly, from major wins and institutional adoption to setbacks, controversies, and unresolved challenges. The Good Shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, he approved the creation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a digital asset stockpile. This development set the stage for increased BTC adoption, with institutions and U.S. states opening their doors to the leading cryptocurrency. Flows into the U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market rose and remained elevated. Several countries also enacted laws that comprehensively regulated Bitcoin and other digital assets. Most firms gained exposure to BTC via ETFs, while others became Bitcoin Treasury companies and acquired the digital asset directly. This consistent demand from institutions and retail investors fueled the momentum that drove BTC to multiple all-time highs (ATHs) this year. Between July and August, BTC went on a roll, becoming the fifth-largest asset by market cap in the world and surpassing Google. Before the market turned for the worse in October, BTC rallied to an ATH above $126,000. The Bad On the network front, the Bitcoin mainnet saw no major developments, aside from the adoption and scaling of layer-2 chains like the Lightning Network . Although developers are keen on expanding Bitcoin’s utility, the network’s programmability is somewhat limited. Bitcoin’s unique dynamics have made the network a bit distinct from the broader crypto ecosystem. In 2025, BTC’s correlation with the traditional finance sector increased, and the asset became more sensitive to macroeconomic catalysts. This growing correlation came from rising institutional investment as capital from corporate entities linked the crypto asset to traditional finance. Additionally, the Bitcoin network saw increased mining difficulty and expanded hardware. While this strengthened security, it also triggered miner capitulation, which forced some miners off the network. The Ugly Demand stopped growing after a major liquidation event that wiped out $19 billion in market value in early October. It marked the first negative October returns since 2018, and the big BTC buyers ghosted the market. BTC has dropped to prices below psychological levels and is currently struggling to stay above $90,000. With the bears dominating in recent months, the state of the market has dashed investor hopes of another rally before the bull phase ends. Currently, all technical indicators suggest the market is at the onset of a bear cycle, which has significantly impacted profitability for both miners and investors. Investors are shifting to traditional assets like gold. Interestingly, the four-year Bitcoin cycle may have died in 2025 – experts now insist that subsequent BTC rallies will be driven by demand waves, rather than the quadrennial halving events.

Key Takeaways: A former Coinbase support agent was arrested in India over a data breach affecting nearly 70,000 users. Coinbase rejected a $20M ransom and incurred $307M in breach-related costs. The incident adds to mounting legal and security pressure on the exchange. “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice,” Armstrong said in a post on X on Thursday. “Another one down and more still to come.” The breach, which Coinbase said began in December 2024, stemmed from a bribery scheme targeting offshore customer support staff. Coinbase Breach Exposed Data of Nearly 70,000 Users Cybercriminals allegedly paid customer service agents to access internal systems and extract sensitive user information, including names, addresses, phone numbers and government-issued identification. Coinbase disclosed in a filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office that 69,461 users were affected. The attackers later demanded a $20 million ransom, which Coinbase refused to pay. Instead, the company launched a matching bounty program, offering rewards for information that could lead to arrests and asset recovery. A subsequent investigation by Fortune linked the incident to customer support agents working for TaskUs, a Texas-based business process outsourcing firm with operations in India. TaskUs said it had identified two employees who were allegedly recruited as part of a broader criminal campaign that also targeted other service providers supporting Coinbase. We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice. Thanks to the Hyderabad Police in India, an ex-Coinbase customer service agent was just arrested. Another one down and more still to come. — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 26, 2025 Coinbase reported $307 million in breach-related costs in its second-quarter earnings, covering remediation efforts and reimbursements to affected customers. The company is also facing a shareholder class action lawsuit, which alleges that Coinbase failed to disclose the breach in a timely manner. The arrest in India comes just days after US prosecutors charged a Brooklyn resident with running a separate phishing scheme that allegedly stole $16 million from roughly 100 Coinbase users. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT played a role in identifying the suspect. Coinbase shares slipped about 1.2% to $236.90 on Friday. Indian law enforcement has not issued a public statement on the arrest. Brooklyn Man Charged in $16M Crypto Scam Targeting Coinbase Users As reported, US prosecutors have charged a 23-year-old Brooklyn resident , Ronald Spektor, with stealing roughly $16 million in cryptocurrency from around 100 Coinbase users through an alleged phishing and social engineering scheme. According to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, Spektor posed as a Coinbase employee and contacted victims claiming their funds were at immediate risk, pressuring them to transfer crypto to wallets he controlled. Authorities said the scheme relied on panic tactics rather than technical hacks. Operating under the online alias “lolimfeelingevil,” Spektor allegedly warned victims of imminent theft to override skepticism and force quick decisions. Once funds were transferred, prosecutors say he attempted to hide their origin by routing assets through crypto mixers, token swaps and online gambling platforms. Spektor was arraigned on 31 charges, including first-degree grand larceny and money laundering, following a year-long investigation. Law enforcement has seized about $105,000 in cash and $400,000 in digital assets so far, with efforts ongoing to recover more funds.

Although 2025 and this bull cycle were not entirely positive for Ether (ETH), the network recorded significant upgrades that optimized the user experience. There are multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in the works as developers continue to work together to scale the network. The Good At the start of the year, developers prepared for the release of the Pectra upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet. Following the mainnet deployment of Pectra in early May, Ethereum users gained support for larger validator stakes, account abstraction, protocol efficiency, and scalability enhancements. Hence, Pectra was one of Ethereum’s wins in 2025, as the upgrade marked one of the network’s largest in years and also a stepping stone to future developments. After Pectra, developers focused on preparing for Fusaka and finally deployed the upgrade in early December. Fusaka focused on preserving Ethereum’s core features and delivering major scaling and data-efficiency improvements to the network. Amid the network upgrades and improvements, the second-largest crypto network also saw sustained stablecoin, decentralized finance (DeFi), and staking activity. Ethereum recorded significant adoption among institutions and traditional finance entities. This year witnessed the rise of institutional investment vehicles and Ethereum Treasury companies, as billions of dollars flowed into the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market. Dozens of companies, including Nasdaq-listed firms, jumped on the trend of holding ETH on corporate balance sheets. The Bad Although regulatory clarity from U.S. and European Union frameworks has made institutional engagement more compliant and encouraged crypto adoption, Ethereum still faces some regulatory uncertainty. Authorities have yet to decide whether ETH is a security or a commodity. While there is increased integration of digital rails for tokenized assets within the ecosystem, the Ethereum community is concerned that the network is usable only via layer-2 chains. Market experts feel there is a need to redirect developer focus back to the mainnet. There are also concerns about centralization due to the raised validator stake. Larger entities now dominate the staking scene, raising questions about the network’s decentralization. The Ugly Meanwhile, the growth recorded in the Ethereum network had no meaningful impact on ether’s price and value. Despite sustained demand from institutions and ETFs, the asset barely recorded any major price movements. In fact, Ether’s current all-time high (ATH) is less than $100 more than the asset’s peak during the 2021 bull run. In November 2021, ETH hit an ATH of $4,878; this time, data from CoinMarketCap shows the coin’s August 2025 high sitting at $4,953. Since then, it has tumbled below $3,000, and it even plunged under $1,500 in April. The poor price performance resulted in a loss of confidence in ETH among investors. The mismatch between network growth and prices has become hard for investors to ignore, prompting retail users to offload their assets, further depressing ether’s value. Investors are increasingly frustrated, and the narrative that ETH is losing its leadership momentum is prevailing.

Could the digital currency bounce back to the $2.50 mark? The article delves into the factors at play, offering insights into what's driving interest and which cryptocurrencies show promise for growth. Uncover the dynamics influencing ATOM's future. Cosmos (ATOM) Displays Subtle Rebound Potential Amidst Market Turmoil Source: tradingview Cosmos (ATOM) is experiencing modest price movement, hovering in the $1.79 to $2.13 range. This shows a gradual rise above the 10-day average of just above $2. After a tough few months, with a nearly 50% drop in half a year, ATOM is now seeing a one-week uptick of just over 9%. The price needs to break through its nearest barrier at $2.31, aiming for the second one at $2.65, to possibly ignite a meaningful rally. A rise to the first resistance would be just a touch over 10%, offering some hope for upward momentum, though the journey remains cautious against recent downward trends. Conclusion The price of ATOM has shown signs of recovery. Positive market sentiment could help it reach $2.50 again. The coin's potential lies in its technology and community support. Improvements in market conditions are key factors. With continued progress, there is a possibility for ATOM to reclaim previous highs. Investors will be watching closely for any positive developments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite the turbulence, certain cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention. This article reveals which coins are catching the eye of savvy investors and poised for potential gains. Rising Star ENA: Why This Altcoin Could Shine in the Next Bull Run ENA is an altcoin that focuses on enhancing digital identity. It uses blockchain to make personal information secure yet accessible. This unique approach draws comparisons to successful privacy and identity projects from previous bull runs. With the current crypto market showing early signs of a turnaround, ENA's innovative tech could drive interest and adoption. Its recent partnerships and development updates indicate robust growth potential. As investors look for high-reward altcoins during market recoveries, ENA might appeal to those seeking a promising project with real-world applications. The coin's current low price could offer a striking entry point for future gains in the next alt season. Altcoins Ready to Bounce Back: Why WLD Could Shine WLD is the native token of Worldcoin, a project aiming to give everyone a piece of digital currency. Worldcoin uses unique technology to ensure fair distribution and privacy. Each person gets a share just by authenticating their identity. Even with recent market dips, WLD looks promising. It aims to expand access to cryptocurrency and increase adoption. The project mirrors early successful strategies from past bull runs. With the potential for mass appeal and solid tech backing, WLD could be an attractive choice in the current cycle. This altcoin could rise as the market gears up for a rebound, making it one to watch. Why TON Could Shine Bright in the Next Altcoin Season TON , short for The Open Network, is a decentralized blockchain originally designed by Telegram. It's built for speedy transactions and high security. What sets it apart is its focus on scalability, meaning it can handle lots of activity without slowing down. As we look at patterns resembling the 2021 bull run, TON stands out with its solid tech and robust community backing. Its ability to support decentralized applications makes it a strong contender in the current market cycle. With its promising technology and unique features, TON seems well-placed to attract attention and possibly shine in the next altcoin season. Conclusion Traders are showing interest in ENA, WLD, and TON even during market fluctuations. This selective accumulation suggests confidence in these assets. The focus on these coins highlights their potential for growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Chan plans to maintain this upward trend by strengthening the city’s role across three main areas: finance, technology, and trade. Earlier in February, he had estimated growth would land between 2 and 3 percent. Record year for stock listings Hong Kong led the world in new stock listings this year. Authorities want more companies from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to list on the exchange, Chan noted in a recent blog post. Additionally, the city will encourage broader worldwide acceptance of China’s currency. The plan places a significant priority on technological advancement. To remain competitive globally, Hong Kong plans to grow its biotech and artificial intelligence sectors. Authorities are equally committed to helping Chinese businesses expand into foreign markets by utilizing Hong Kong’s position as a center for regional trade. “Looking into next year, Hong Kong’s economy is expected to keep the good trend of growth,” Chan said. “Finance, tech innovation and trade will be Hong Kong’s key engines of growth as the city actively embraces China’s development strategy.” Market performance exceeds expectations The Hang Seng Index climbed 30 percent this year, making it one of the top-performing stock markets worldwide. Chan pointed to strong exports, active spending on buildings and equipment, and improving consumer spending as reasons the city did better than expected. To improve its financial center status, Hong Kong will make its stock market more competitive and grow trading in bonds, money markets, fintech, commodities, and gold.

Today, betting with BTC and USDT is a mainstream choice for players who value speed, privacy, and global access. Whether you prefer the volatility of Bitcoin or the stability of stablecoins, modern cryptocurrency betting sites now offer flexible tools built specifically for crypto-first users. But not every platform that accepts crypto is truly designed for it. Below, we review three trusted platforms for betting with cryptocurrency, focusing on real usability, transparency, and long-term reliability. What Makes a Crypto Betting Platform Truly Trustworthy? Before looking at specific sites, it’s worth understanding what separates reliable cryptocurrency betting platforms from risky ones. A trusted crypto betting site usually gets these fundamentals right: Clear licensing and operational transparency Fast BTC and USDT payouts without hidden delays Reasonable or no KYC policies, clearly explained upfront Crypto-native infrastructure, not fiat systems patched with wallets Fair odds and provable settlement logic, especially for live bets In short, betting with crypto should feel seamless — not like an experiment layered on top of a traditional sportsbook. 1. Dexsport — A Crypto-Native Platform Built for BTC & USDT Bettors Among platforms that truly understand betting with cryptocurrency, Dexsport stands out as a fully crypto-native ecosystem rather than a hybrid compromise. Dexsport is designed around instant access and user control. Registration takes seconds and can be done via email, Telegram, or a DeFi wallet — no identity checks, no document uploads, no friction. From there, users gain access to 10,000+ games, combining a full casino with a deep sportsbook. What makes Dexsport particularly strong for betting with BTC and USDT is its multi-chain support and real-time betting flexibility. Key strengths for crypto bettors include: Support for Bitcoin, USDT, and dozens of other cryptocurrencies across multiple networks In-play betting with Cash Out, allowing users to manage risk live Competitive odds across football, basketball, MMA, and esports Esports markets for CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and more Live streaming available even without a funded balance Bonuses are structured to reward activity rather than trap users. New players can unlock a 480% bonus across three deposits, plus free spins for casino games. Sports bettors also receive free bets and weekly cashback paid in stablecoins — a practical perk for anyone who prefers to bet with USDT instead of volatile assets. Transparency is another core advantage. Dexsport operates as a licensed platform and publishes real-time bet data through a public desk, allowing outcomes to be verified rather than blindly trusted. Independent audits further reinforce confidence in the platform’s infrastructure. In practice, Dexsport feels less like a “casino that accepts crypto” and more like a betting platform built from the ground up for crypto users. 2.Thunderpick — Esports-Driven Crypto Betting with BTC and USDT Thunderpick approaches cryptocurrency betting from a different angle. Its focus is firmly on esports, making it appealing to players who primarily bet with BTC or USDT on competitive gaming. The platform shines in titles like CS:GO, Dota 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, offering live betting, prop markets, and integrated streams. Deposits and withdrawals are crypto-only, which keeps transactions relatively fast and straightforward. That said, Thunderpick is more specialized. Traditional sports coverage exists but lacks the depth and market variety found on broader platforms. Some withdrawals may require additional verification depending on activity, which can be a downside for users seeking maximum anonymity. Thunderpick works best for: Esports-first bettors Players focused on in-play esports odds Users comfortable with a narrower betting scope 3. Vave — A Hybrid Sportsbook for High-Volume Crypto Betting Vave positions itself as a hybrid solution, combining casino entertainment with a large, traditional sportsbook offering. For players interested in betting with bitcoin across mainstream sports, Vave delivers a wide selection of markets, particularly in football. Live betting tools, cash-out options, and streaming are all present, and support for USDT and other major cryptocurrencies makes onboarding easy. However, Vave operates closer to a traditional sportsbook model. KYC is typically required at withdrawal stages, and bonus wagering requirements can be higher than crypto-native alternatives. For some players, that trade-off is acceptable in exchange for breadth and familiarity. Vave is generally suited for: High-volume sports bettors Players who prioritize market depth over anonymity Users comfortable with occasional verification steps BTC vs USDT: Which Is Better for Crypto Betting? Both options have clear advantages, and the choice often depends on betting style. Betting with BTC can amplify winnings during upward price movements, but volatility cuts both ways. It’s better suited for shorter sessions or speculative strategies. Betting with USDT, on the other hand, offers stability. Odds, bankroll management, and cashback rewards remain predictable — a major advantage for live betting and long sessions. Many experienced players combine both: Use BTC for selected high-risk bets Use USDT for consistent wagering and cashbacks Switch between assets depending on market conditions Which Platform Fits Your Betting Style? Maximum privacy & flexibility: Dexsport Esports-focused crypto betting: Thunderpick Wide sports coverage with crypto support: Vave Each platform serves a different type of crypto bettor, but Dexsport stands out as the most balanced option for users who want to bet with BTC and USDT without sacrificing control, speed, or transparency. Final Verdict Cryptocurrency betting is no longer about simply accepting Bitcoin. The best platforms are those that embrace crypto at every level — from registration to payouts and live wagering. Among today’s trusted options, Dexsport leads as a truly crypto-native platform, while Thunderpick and Vave serve more specialized roles. Choosing the right platform ultimately depends on how you prefer to bet, what assets you use, and how much control you want over your funds. For players serious about betting with cryptocurrency , the difference is immediately noticeable.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-28 08:00:32

Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a well-respected crypto analyst on X, has analyzed XRP’s liquidity charts, revealing its next steps to market participants. The analyst shared two liquidity charts for XRP that shift focus away from short-term noise. The charts highlight where capital has clustered, where it has thinned out, and where price could gravitate next. Rather than offering a near-term call, the analysis looks further ahead and identifies a minimum target for 2026. $XRP hourly and daily liquidity + minimum target for 2026 based on liquidity alone pic.twitter.com/0Z4x9yOiyB — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) December 26, 2025 Hourly Liquidity Shows Immediate Price Constraints The hourly chart provides the first layer of context. XRP trades within a tight range, with liquidity bands clearly stacked above the current price. These bands act as magnets during periods of expansion. They also cap upside during weak momentum phases. The hourly view shows XRP stabilizing after a prolonged decline, with its price hovering near $1.87. Liquidity below current levels has thinned considerably. That suggests less incentive for the asset to push lower unless new selling pressure enters the market . Above the current price, liquidity remains dense. This imbalance creates a directional bias. If momentum returns, the asset has a clearer path upward than downward on this time frame. The hourly chart does not define a long-term target for XRP. However, it establishes the structure that supports a broader move when market conditions align. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Daily Liquidity Reveals the Bigger Picture The daily chart shifts the focus from short-term reactions to structural positioning . Liquidity bands expand significantly as the time frame increases. On the daily chart, XRP sits beneath a wide zone of high liquidity that stretches well above $3. This zone has built up over months, and could give way to a rapid surge. Cryptoinsightuk highlights $4.32 as a minimum target derived from this daily liquidity concentration. He expects this to be XRP’s lowest level in 2026. The level stands out as a clear area where liquidity peaks relative to surrounding price zones. The chart suggests price has unfinished business there if XRP enters a sustained expansion phase. The targets on the way to $4.32 are $3.65, XRP’s all-time high , which it reached in July, and $4. These levels have the densest liquidity bands. Liquidity targets often act as checkpoints rather than endpoints. Crossing these levels could push XRP further, sending it to Cryptoinsightuk’s $4.32 target. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Today, it’s one of the most popular ways to bet with crypto, especially among players who value speed, flexibility, and real-time control. As more users explore how to bet with crypto during live matches, platforms built specifically for cryptocurrency betting begin to stand out. One of those platforms is Dexsport — a crypto-native sportsbook and casino designed around instant access, transparency, and live wagering with digital assets. Why Live Betting Works Differently with Cryptocurrency Live betting changes the entire logic of wagering. Odds move quickly, momentum shifts in seconds, and decisions often need to be made instantly. When you combine this with betting with cryptocurrency, the platform’s infrastructure becomes critical. In live crypto betting, three things matter most: Speed of balance updates — delays break the experience. Immediate settlement logic — especially important when markets suspend and reopen. User control — the ability to manage risk without waiting for final results. Dexsport is built with these exact requirements in mind, which becomes obvious the moment you place your first in-play bet. Dexsport Overview: Built for Live Crypto Betting Dexsport operates as a decentralized sportsbook and casino with official licensing and independent audits. Registration takes seconds and does not require identity verification. You can sign up via email, Telegram, or by connecting a DeFi wallet and start betting with crypto almost immediately. Here’s a concise overview of the platform’s core live-betting specifications: Feature Dexsport Platform Type Decentralized sportsbook & casino KYC Not required Cryptocurrencies 38+ coins across 20 networks Live Betting Yes, with Cash Out Transparency Public live bet tracking Audits CertiK, Pessimistic This structure makes Dexsport feel one of the true crypto betting websites , not a traditional sportsbook adapted to crypto payments. Live Sports Markets: Focused and Practical Rather than flooding the interface with low-liquidity events, Dexsport prioritizes sports where live betting activity is strongest. Football, basketball, tennis, MMA, boxing, hockey, and golf form the core offering, each supported by deep in-play markets. Live betting options often exceed 100 markets per match, covering everything from basic outcomes to advanced props. Odds remain competitive, and market suspensions are handled smoothly — an important detail for anyone serious about cryptocurrency for sports betting. Live streaming is also available, even without a funded account. This allows bettors to observe match flow before committing funds, which is especially useful in volatile live scenarios. Cash Out: Real-Time Risk Management Cash Out plays a central role in Dexsport’s live betting experience. Instead of waiting for an event to settle, users can actively manage their position. In practice, Cash Out is used in three main ways: Locking in profit when odds swing favorably Reducing exposure when momentum shifts Exiting high-risk positions during unpredictable phases of play For anyone learning how to bet with crypto in live markets, this level of control significantly lowers unnecessary risk. Live Esports Betting with Cryptocurrency Dexsport’s live betting isn’t limited to traditional sports. Esports markets are actively supported and updated in real time, including CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and cyber sports. Esports betting tends to move faster than traditional sports, which makes crypto a natural fit. Balance updates are instant, odds refresh smoothly, and in-play markets remain accessible throughout matches. This is where cryptocurrency betting feels genuinely native rather than experimental. Transparency and Verifiability One of Dexsport’s defining features is its public live bet desk. Bets and outcomes are visible in real time, allowing users to observe platform activity instead of relying on opaque settlement processes. This matters because live betting disputes are common across the industry. On Dexsport, transparency is not a marketing claim — it’s built into how the system operates. For players focused on betting with cryptocurrency, this level of openness builds long-term trust. Bonuses That Fit Live Betting Bonuses often interfere with live betting strategies due to rigid wagering rules. Dexsport’s incentive structure is more flexible. The platform offers a multi-stage welcome bonus, free bets for sports wagering, and weekly cashback paid in stablecoins. Cashback does not require additional wagering, which makes it usable even for conservative live bettors. There is also a Sports Club program that rewards consistent activity with guaranteed monthly free bets — a system designed for long-term users rather than one-time promotions. Why Dexsport Works for Live Crypto Bettors Dexsport succeeds because it aligns platform design with actual bettor behavior. There is no forced token economy, no unnecessary friction, and no artificial complexity. What you get instead is: instant access without KYC fast crypto deposits and withdrawals live betting tools that actually respond in real time transparent settlement logic support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies For users serious about betting with crypto and managing live positions actively, this combination is hard to ignore. Final Thoughts Live betting is where weaknesses in crypto sportsbooks become obvious. Delays, unclear settlement rules, and poor transparency quickly push users away. Dexsport handles these pressure points well. It offers a live betting environment that feels natural for cryptocurrency users — fast, flexible, and verifiable. For anyone exploring cryptocurrency betting beyond basic pre-match wagers, Dexsport stands out as a platform built for how modern crypto betting actually works.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-28 08:02:33

We talked numerous times about the major moves made by the Brad Garlinghouse-led company, which included the closure of the SEC lawsuit, impressive partnerships, and big acquisitions. The underlying asset benefited from some of those, as it pumped to a fresh all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July. However, it has slumped hard in the following months and now sits below a crucial support line at $1.90. Although it saw the release of five spot XRP ETFs since mid-November, its price performance has been quite underwhelming, losing roughly 25% of its value since the first one went live. With just days left of 2025, we asked a few AI projects about their predictions for the year’s end. How Will XRP End 2025? ChatGPT and Perplexity agreed with certain analysts’ claims that the fact that XRP dumped below $1.90 could spell further trouble in the following week. OpenAI’s solution outlined that the next significant support levels lie at $1.70-$1.75, which, if broken to the downside, might result in another pullback to and below $1.50. In case of a more profound price revival by the end of the year, the token would need to decisively reclaim the $1.90 resistance and aim for the next one at $2.00. If it’s successful, which seems rather unlikely at the moment, then it could go for $2.20. ChatGPT admitted that the overall market condition is quite unfavorable even for larger-cap alts, and added: “With Bitcoin steady but not especially bullish, XRP is lacking the external momentum needed for a strong year-end recovery.” Final Verdict 2025 has been spectacular , at least until the middle of it, for XRP, but mostly for the entity behind it. Now, the situation looks rather worrisome, and there’s little hope in the price predictions coming from the AI solutions. Grok joined the overall bearish side, indicating that a price drop to $1.60 is highly likely, especially if BTC is rejected once again at $88,000 or even $90,000, which has been the case over the past few weeks. Following each failed attempt, the altcoins fall even further, which is evident from the rising Bitcoin dominance. “Unless the bulls stage an unexpected comeback, XRP is likely to end 2025 in a consolidation or mild downtrend zone below $1.90. The breakdown of a major multi-month support level shifts the advantage firmly toward sellers, and only a strong reclaim of $1.90 would reverse short-term picture,” concluded Grok.

While the broader trend remains weak, technical conditions suggest downside pressure may be easing. This analysis piece is delivered by Outset PR , a web3 PR firm where crypto-native communication meets data-driven intelligence. Modest Bounce Within a Broader Downtrend SHIB gained nearly 1% over the past day, marking a modest recovery rather than a trend shift. Price action remains constrained by the broader downtrend, but the move signals tentative buyer interest after sustained selling. The token is currently testing the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000752, a zone that often acts as a short-term inflection point during corrective phases. Momentum Indicators Approach Oversold Levels The 14-day Relative Strength Index stands at 34.49, placing SHIB near oversold territory. While not yet extreme, this level suggests selling momentum is weakening. At the same time, the MACD is showing early signs of bullish divergence, indicating that downside momentum may be losing strength even as price remains compressed. Such setups often precede short-term relief rallies rather than full reversals. Any rebound attempt faces immediate resistance at the 50-day exponential moving average near $0.00000807. This level has capped upside moves during recent recovery attempts and will need to be reclaimed to confirm a more sustainable bounce. Without a break above this resistance, upside moves are likely to remain corrective. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create. While most crypto PR agencies rely on standardized packages and mass-blast outreach, Outset PR takes a tailored approach. Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system. It fuses organic editorial placements with SEO and lead-generation tactics, enabling clients to appear in high-discovery surfaces and drive multiples more traffic than through conventional PR alone. Case in point: Crypto exchange ChangeNOW experienced a sustained 40% boost in reach after Outset PR amplified a well-polished organic coverage with a massive Google Discover campaign, powered by its proprietary content distribution engine. Drive More Traffic with Outset PR’s In-house Tech Outset PR Notices Media Trends Ahead of the Crowd Outset PR obtains unique knowledge through its in-house analytical desk which gives it a competitive edge. The team regularly provides valuable insights into the performance of crypto media outlets based on the criteria like: domain activity month-on-month visibility shifts audience geography source of traffic By consistently publishing analytical reports, identifying performance trends, and raising the standards of media targeting across the industry, Outset PR unlocks a previously untapped niche in crypto PR, which poses it as a trendsetter in this field. Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. SHIB Price Outlook Shiba Inu is approaching oversold conditions, with momentum indicators hinting at a possible short-term rebound. However, the broader trend remains bearish, and confirmation would require a move above the 50-day EMA. Until then, any upside is best viewed as a relief rally rather than a structural trend change.

What once felt experimental is now a stable ecosystem of platforms offering sports betting with Bitcoin, esports markets, and fast on-chain payouts. For players who prefer to bet with BTC instead of fiat, the key question is no longer “Can I use Bitcoin?” but “Which bitcoin betting site can actually be trusted?” Below, we review some of the most reliable bitcoin betting sites in Europe, focusing on transparency, payouts, betting depth, and real usability — not marketing promises. What Makes a Bitcoin Betting Site “Trusted”? Before choosing where to bet on sports with Bitcoin, it’s important to understand what separates trustworthy platforms from risky ones. A reliable bitcoin betting site usually delivers on several core points: Clear operational structure — licensing or at least transparent ownership Consistent BTC payouts without unexplained delays Real sports and esports coverage, not just token markets Predictable rules around KYC, limits, and withdrawals For users engaged in online sports betting with Bitcoin, trust is built through behavior over time, not just welcome bonuses. Dexsport — Bitcoin Betting Built for Speed and Transparency Dexsport stands out as a crypto-native sportsbook and casino where betting with bitcoin feels natural rather than adapted. The platform supports BTC alongside dozens of other cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin remains a core asset for both deposits and withdrawals. Registration is instant and does not require identity verification. Users can sign up via email, Telegram, or a connected wallet and immediately access sports, live betting, esports, and a large casino section. From a betting perspective, Dexsport focuses on quality markets: football, basketball, tennis, MMA, boxing, hockey, golf live betting with Cash Out esports betting with Bitcoin on CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant Transparency is a major differentiator. Dexsport operates a public live bet desk, allowing users to observe real-time bet activity and outcomes — a rare feature among bitcoin betting sites. For players who regularly bet with BTC and value speed, anonymity, and verifiable settlement, Dexsport fits naturally into the “trusted” category. Cybet — A Newcomer with Strong Bitcoin Support Cybet is a newer entrant in the European crypto betting space, but it has gained attention quickly. The platform combines a sportsbook, casino, and esports betting under one interface, with Bitcoin fully supported. BTC deposits and withdrawals are processed quickly, and the platform interface is clean and mobile-friendly. Sports coverage includes mainstream leagues and esports, making it suitable for users interested in betting on sports with bitcoin as well as competitive gaming. That said, Cybet is still building its long-term reputation. While functionality is solid, players looking for a long operational track record may prefer more established platforms. Betplay — Lightning Network Speed for BTC Bettors Betplay takes a different approach, leaning heavily into Bitcoin technology. The platform supports BTC both on-chain and via the Lightning Network, which allows for extremely fast deposits and withdrawals. This makes Betplay attractive for users who value transaction speed above all else. Sports coverage is broad, including over 40 sports, esports markets, and standard betting formats like handicaps and futures. However, Betplay operates without a traditional license, and wagering requirements can be higher than average. It’s best suited for experienced users who understand the trade-offs and want to bet with bitcoin as efficiently as possible. Lucky Block — Bitcoin Betting with High Bonuses Lucky Block is a well-known name in crypto gambling, offering a combination of sportsbook, casino, and esports betting. Bitcoin is fully supported, and payouts are generally fast. The platform stands out for its generous bonuses and low minimum deposits, which appeal to casual users exploring sports betting with bitcoin for the first time. Markets cover football, basketball, tennis, and esports, with live betting available. Some users have reported account reviews during withdrawals, so while Lucky Block is popular, it may not be ideal for those prioritizing maximum operational predictability. BetPanda — Anonymous Bitcoin Betting with Moderate Depth BetPanda offers anonymous betting with Bitcoin and a wide selection of cryptocurrencies. Registration is simple, and KYC is generally not required unless triggered by unusual activity. Bitcoin betting markets cover mainstream sports and some niche options. While the sportsbook depth is adequate, it does not offer the same level of live markets or streaming as more advanced platforms. BetPanda works best for users who value privacy and simplicity over advanced features when betting with BTC. Bitcoin vs Traditional Betting: Why BTC Betting Gaining Popularity Bitcoin remains one of the most widely used assets for crypto betting because it offers: global access without banking restrictions fast, borderless transfers independence from fiat volatility tied to local currencies For both sports betting with bitcoin and esports betting with bitcoin, BTC continues to be a practical choice — especially on platforms designed around crypto from the start. Final Verdict Europe offers a growing number of solid bitcoin betting sites, but not all are equal. Some prioritize bonuses, others speed, and a few focus on transparency and long-term trust. Dexsport stands out for its crypto-native design, live betting tools, and verifiable approach to wagering. Cybet and Betplay offer interesting alternatives depending on whether you value interface simplicity or Lightning-fast BTC payouts, while Lucky Block and BetPanda cater to more casual or privacy-focused users.

According to its statement, the AI model boasts more than 500 billion parameters that it can use to learn data. In the statement released on Sunday, the SK Telecom consortium, which consists of eight organizations including Krafton, Rebellions, Seoul National University, and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, jointly developed A.X K1. The statement highlighted that the model seeks to become Korea ‘s first AI language model and boasts a total of 519 billion parameters. Parameters are learned values that models use to analyze data, which are widely regarded as an indicator of their size or scale. SK Telecom consortium to unveil AI language model In its statement, SK Telecom noted that during inference, the model activates about 33 billion parameters, which allows it to maintain high performance while optimizing computational efficiency. This design provides the model with an environment to operate flexibly while carrying out different varieties of task execution, including heavy-duty training and lightweight task execution. “Developing Korea’s first 500-billion-parameter scale model marks a new turning point for the country’s ambition to join the global top tier of AI leaders amid fierce international competition,” said Kim Tae-yoon, SK Telecom’s head of foundation model division. “As Korea’s national AI champion, we’ll continue working to realize our vision of AI for everyone.” Given the benchmarks for global models with over 500 billion parameters, SK Telecom noted A.X K1 will be able to offer more stable performance in complex reasoning, math, and multilingual understanding than smaller-scale models. It also added that the model would be able to enhance use cases such as code generation and autonomous agent-based workflows. At that scale, the model can also serve as what it describes as a ‘teacher model,’ transferring knowledge to smaller and domain-specific models, which will make it an important part of the AI ecosystem. SK Telecom also added that its consortium has plans to extend research so that the model would be able to train smaller models that directly enhance daily life and drive industrial innovation across South Korea. A.X K1 was trained as a Korean language model Unlike most models that are trained in English, A.X K1 was originally designed to be trained in Korean from the beginning, allowing it to understand Korean language input naturally. This Korean first approach makes the model well-suited for building personalized services that reflect the culture, history, and economy of the Asian country. SK Telecom also plans to deploy the mode through its AI service A. (Adot), which has over 10 million subscribers. The development is expected to create an environment for people to access AI easily through calls, text messages, the web, and mobile apps. The company also plans to expand its application to other sectors, including Adot Biz for workplace productivity, AI solutions that improve manufacturing processes, Krafton’s game AI for real-time character dialogue and autonomous behavior, and humanoid robot technologies that extend AI models into physical and behavioral domains. A.X K1 is also expected to become the testbed for the semiconductor industry. As performance testing in AI chip development requires high volume and speed in transferring data, its scale is highly effective for verifying next-generation semiconductor performance. SK Telecom plans to open-source A.X K1 along with an application interface, which will provide local firms with an environment for developing artificial intelligence agents.

56485640,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-backed-eur-loans-on-clapp-terms-collateral-and-access,1766909932,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56485640.jpeg,"Crypto-Backed EUR Loans on Clapp: Terms, Collateral, and Access",https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-backed-eur-loans-on-clapp-terms-collateral-and-access,"Crypto-backed lending has matured beyond fixed loans with rigid terms. For European users, the focus has shifted to flexibility, cost control, and direct access to euros. Clapp approaches this demand with a credit-line model that treats crypto collateral as an ongoing liquidity base rather than a one-time loan trigger. This review looks at how crypto-backed EUR loans work on Clapp, with a focus on terms, collateral structure, and access. Credit line structure instead of fixed loans Clapp does not issue traditional fixed-term crypto loans. Instead, users open a revolving credit line secured by crypto collateral. A borrowing limit is set based on deposited assets, but funds are drawn only when needed. Interest accrues exclusively on the amount actually borrowed. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. When funds are repaid, the available credit is restored immediately, without reapplying or restructuring the position. There is no fixed repayment schedule. Borrowers can draw, repay, or rebalance at any time through the Clapp Wallet . This structure shifts borrowing from a one-off decision to an on-demand tool. Collateral options and multi-asset flexibility Clapp supports multi-collateral credit lines. Users can combine up to 19 assets into a single borrowing position. Supported assets include BTC, ETH, SOL, and major stablecoins. Collateral does not need to be locked into a single asset type. Users can adjust composition as markets move, without closing the credit line. This reduces the need to manage multiple isolated loans or manually rebalance positions. For users holding diversified portfolios, this approach simplifies liquidity management while maintaining exposure. EUR access and same-day availability Once collateral is deposited and the credit line is active, EUR access is available without waiting periods or manual approvals. Funds can be drawn directly from the credit line and accessed through the platform’s EUR rails. Because interest applies only when capital is in use, users can keep the credit line open without cost until liquidity is needed. This makes the setup suitable for short-term expenses, opportunistic entries, or bridging liquidity gaps. Availability is continuous, rather than tied to loan issuance cycles. Interest model and cost control Clapp’s interest model is usage-based. Borrowers are charged only for active borrowing, not for unused credit. This differs from fixed-loan models where interest applies to the full principal from day one. There are no penalties for early repayment, and no pressure to maintain borrowed balances. Costs scale with usage rather than commitment. For users who borrow intermittently, this can materially reduce long-term interest expense. Regulatory standing and platform scope Clapp operates under a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license issued in the Czech Republic. This confirms its status as a licensed crypto lending provider within the EU regulatory framework. While licensing does not remove market risk, it provides clarity around operational standing and jurisdiction. The platform is designed for European users who require EUR-denominated borrowing with predictable access and transparent mechanics. Closing view Clapp treats crypto-backed borrowing as an ongoing liquidity layer rather than a one-time loan event. By separating credit availability from credit usage, it gives users more control over cost, timing, and collateral structure. For European crypto holders who need flexible EUR access without committing to rigid loan terms, Clapp offers a clean and functional approach built around usage, not obligation.

Thousands of projects compete for attention, so public relations has become a key factor in determining which brands gain investor trust, media coverage, and long-term traction. Crypto PR agencies help blockchain startups, Web3 companies, and established crypto brands communicate complex ideas, manage reputation, and secure placements in top-tier media outlets. This article reviews three of the best crypto PR agencies shaping the industry in 2026. We assess their services, technologies, strengths, and where they fit best for different kinds of Web3 projects. 1. Outset PR – Best Overall Crypto PR Agency Taking the top spot is Outset PR , a data-driven crypto and Web3 public relations agency working with blockchain startups, scale-ups, and established crypto companies. The agency is based in Tbilisi and operates across global markets. Outest PR has helped clients secure organic, high-credibility media coverage across leading crypto and mainstream publications, including: Cointelegraph Forbes Bloomberg The Block crypto.news CoinDesk Business Insider Benzinga Decrypt The scope of its services stretches far beyond organic media coverage and press releases. Outset PR is the first agency to apply a data-driven approach in crypto PR. Data-Driven Media Strategy Outset PR uses its internal intelligence system - Outset Data Pulse . It provides analytics and media performance data to choose where to pitch and to access which narratives dominate the attention. Its another in-house technology, Syndication Map , models how placements spread across aggregators and feeds, and defines which outlets will maximize secondary exposure, helping teams plan more efficient campaigns. AIO and LLM Visibility Beyond traditional PR metrics, Outset PR emphasizes visibility in AI-driven discovery systems and search surfaces — including Google Discover and large language model (LLM) indexing. The goal is to ensure stories aren’t just published but found and amplified by algorithmic systems that power modern discovery. Key Services of Outset PR Press Office — a proactive media service for consistent, credible visibility. Coverage is earned, not bought — 100% organic, driven by relevance and expertise, not media spend. Traffic Acquisition & SEO-Driven PR — campaigns designed to get featured in Google Discover and other high-visibility feeds. Tier-1 Pitching & Newsbreak Promotion — targeted efforts to secure coverage in top outlets. Long-Term Support & Market Dominance — building sustained brand presence that compounds over time. Content Creation & Personal Brand Development — aligning narratives with founder visibility and thought leadership. Real cases: XPANCEO (2023–2025): Outset PR supported XPANCEO with expert proofreading and adaptation of complex AI and deep-tech content, alongside full Arabic localization of PR and business materials. This helped make advanced technologies accessible to regional audiences and strengthened market positioning in MENA. StealthEX (2024–2025): Through weekly trend-driven pitching and thought leadership, Outset PR reached over 400 journalists and editors, securing expert mentions in outlets such as Forbes, Business Insider, Decrypt, and The Independent. The campaign generated 90+ syndications, including Yahoo Finance and MSN, with estimated total reach exceeding 3.6 billion. Why Outset PR Ranks #1 Outset PR is an analytics-centric partner that blends media relations with search optimization, algorithmic discovery, and measurable business outcomes. Its approach helps clients achieve not only press mentions but sustainable visibility that drives real audience engagement. 2. TokenMinds – Full-Stack Crypto PR & Web3 Marketing Agency TokenMinds is a global Web3 agency that offers a blend of crypto PR, media relations, community growth, and content strategy — making it a strong contender for projects needing both visibility and engagement beyond standard press coverage. TokenMinds operates globally (with headquarters in Singapore and teams across regions) and works with blockchain and Web3 projects from early-stage startups to growth-stage protocols. The agency’s model combines media relations with custom content, SEO optimization, and community engagement, helping projects build visibility both in media and across online audiences. The agency pursues placements and mentions across a range of crypto and mainstream outlets, supported by an integrated strategy that includes: Media relations and press placement SEO and visibility optimization Community engagement and platform outreach Branded content and tailored visuals designed for crypto audiences Services Offered TokenMinds’ core offerings align with a broader Web3 growth approach, blending PR with performance marketing elements: Media Relations & Press Outreach – Strategic pitching to crypto and tech outlets. SEO & Visibility Optimization – Content designed to rank and surface across crypto platforms. Community and Forum Engagement – Amplifying visibility on key Web3 channels. Custom Content & Creative Assets – Tailored press materials, visuals, and narratives. Ongoing Support & Reporting – Continuous performance tracking throughout campaigns. Real Cases SwissBorg — TokenMinds supported the Web3 wealth management platform with PR and content marketing initiatives, contributing to broader media exposure and community engagement during growth phases. ICON Network — The agency worked on content creation and visibility campaigns to support ecosystem communication and maintain consistent exposure across crypto media and online channels. SingularityNET — TokenMinds assisted with content and outreach strategies aimed at strengthening awareness around the project’s AI-blockchain narrative. Considerations TokenMinds is suitable for Web3 projects that want a full-service communications and growth partner rather than a narrow press outreach firm. Its mix of SEO-oriented content and community engagement adds depth to traditional PR, though it may require broader budgets and clearer campaign alignment than agencies focused purely on tier-1 press placements. 3. NinjaPromo – Subscription-Based Crypto Marketing & PR Support NinjaPromo is a crypto-friendly digital marketing and PR agency with a broad service offering that includes outreach, media management, branding, and community engagement. NinjaPromo operates internationally with offices in cities like New York, London, Dubai, Singapore, and more. While its core focus spans broader digital marketing beyond PR, it has experience supporting blockchain and crypto projects with brand visibility and strategic outreach. Services Offered Digital Marketing & PR – Integrated media and narrative support. Content Creation & Design – Creative collateral to support campaigns. SEO & Social Strategy – Search optimization and social engagement. Community and Influencer Outreach – Support for community growth. Paid Advertising & PPC Campaigns – Digital ads to supplement press efforts. Real Cases HTX (formerly Huobi) — NinjaPromo contributed to marketing and PR efforts aimed at strengthening brand presence and engagement across digital channels. Affyn — The agency supported the Web3 gaming project with content, social, and visibility initiatives to expand reach during key growth stages. Lisk — NinjaPromo assisted with digital marketing and content strategies to support ecosystem communication and developer-focused outreach. Considerations NinjaPromo’s strength lies in its integrated marketing and PR ecosystem, making it a good fit for projects that want combined support across PR, SEO, content, and advertising. However, because it’s not a pure PR specialist, some projects seeking tier-1 editorial placements exclusively may find its offerings broader than necessary. What Is Crypto PR? Crypto public relations focuses on how blockchain and Web3 companies communicate with investors, users, regulators, and the wider public. Its goal is to translate complex technologies into clear narratives, build credibility, and support broader adoption. Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology — decentralized, peer-to-peer systems that aim to improve transparency and efficiency in finance and digital ownership. While innovations like Bitcoin and Ethereum have reshaped the financial landscape, mass adoption is still slowed by several challenges. These include the technical complexity of blockchain concepts, market volatility combined with past scams, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty across different regions. As a result, many audiences remain cautious or skeptical. This is where crypto PR plays a critical role. How Crypto PR Agencies Help Effective crypto PR strategies help projects overcome these barriers in three key ways: Fostering understanding: PR teams simplify complex ideas and present them in accessible formats through media coverage, educational content, interviews, and thought leadership. Building trust: By securing credible media placements and highlighting transparency, security, and real-world use cases, PR helps strengthen a project’s reputation. Crisis communication also plays an important role in managing negative events. Shaping perception and policy: Through media engagement and industry commentary, crypto PR can help influence broader narratives around regulation and innovation. Because the crypto industry evolves quickly and operates globally, PR efforts must be fast, adaptive, and tailored to diverse audiences. How Much Does Crypto PR Cost? The cost of crypto PR varies widely and depends on several factors: Agency expertise and reputation Scope of services required Campaign duration Geographic focus Specialization in areas such as ICOs, DeFi, or NFTs Common pricing models include: Monthly retainers: Typically starting around $8,000–$15,000 per month, with higher-tier agencies charging significantly more depending on scope and media targets. Project-based fees: One-off campaigns or launches may range from a few thousand dollars to higher five-figure budgets. Hourly consulting: Less common, usually reserved for strategy or advisory work. While crypto PR can represent a meaningful investment, experienced agencies bring industry knowledge, media relationships, and risk management expertise that can significantly impact a project’s visibility, credibility, and long-term success. Conclusion Choosing the right crypto PR agency depends on a project’s goals, stage of growth, and visibility priorities. While all three agencies reviewed offer valuable services, their approaches differ significantly. Outset PR stands out for its data-driven methodology, focus on AI and search visibility, and long-term media performance optimization. TokenMinds is a strong option for teams seeking a full-stack Web3 marketing partner that blends PR with community and content strategies. NinjaPromo offers a flexible, subscription-based model suited to projects that want integrated marketing and PR support under one roof. As competition in the crypto space intensifies, strategic PR is no longer optional. Working with an agency that understands both media dynamics and modern discovery channels can play a decisive role in building credibility, visibility, and sustainable growth.

Market conditions change quickly, expenses are not always predictable, and selling assets is often the least efficient option. A crypto credit line offers an alternative: access to euros when needed, secured by crypto, without exiting positions. Clapp.finance approaches this use case with a structure designed for immediate access rather than scheduled borrowing. This article explains how instant crypto credit lines work in Europe and how Clapp enables same-day access. What an instant crypto credit line actually means An instant crypto credit line separates availability from usage. Collateral secures a borrowing limit, but funds are drawn only when required. There is no need to initiate a new loan each time liquidity is needed. Instant access means: the credit line becomes active as soon as collateral is deposited funds can be drawn without approvals or waiting periods repaid amounts immediately restore available credit This model differs from fixed crypto loans, where funds are issued once and interest applies from day one. Clapp’s approach to instant access Clapp operates a revolving crypto credit line secured by digital assets. Once collateral is deposited, the credit line becomes available immediately. Users can draw euros at any time through the Clapp Wallet. Interest accrues only on the amount actually borrowed. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. There is no fixed repayment schedule, and users can repay partially or in full whenever they choose. This structure allows users to keep liquidity available without cost until it is needed. Multi-collateral setup for flexible borrowing Clapp supports multi-collateral credit lines. Users can combine up to 19 assets into a single borrowing position, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and major stablecoins. Collateral composition can be adjusted without closing the credit line. This allows users to manage exposure dynamically rather than locking into a static structure. For diversified portfolios, this reduces the need to manage multiple loans or rebalance manually across platforms. Step-by-step: accessing an instant credit line with Clapp The process is designed to minimize friction: Create an account and complete onboarding Deposit supported crypto assets into Clapp Wallet A credit limit is assigned based on collateral value Draw EUR instantly from the available credit line Repay at any time to restore available credit There are no draw schedules, loan issuance delays, or mandatory lockups. Regulatory footing Clapp operates under a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license issued in the Czech Republic. This confirms its status as a licensed crypto lending provider within the EU. While licensing does not remove market risk, it provides clarity around jurisdiction and regulatory alignment for European users. Risk management considerations Instant access does not remove risk. Liquidation risk remains tied to collateral value and utilization levels. Higher usage increases exposure to market volatility. Maintaining conservative loan-to-value levels and monitoring collateral health remain essential. Because Clapp restores credit immediately upon repayment, users retain control over risk reduction without structural friction. Final take Access to liquidity matters most when timing is uncertain. Clapp’s instant crypto credit line treats borrowing as an on-demand resource rather than a commitment. By combining immediate availability, usage-based interest, and multi-collateral flexibility, it provides a practical framework for European users who want EUR access without locking themselves into rigid loan structures.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.33 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $3.79. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.3171 Market cap $316.72M Trading volume $57.75M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.3205 24-hour low $0.3117 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.81% (High) 50-day SMA $0.4025 14-Day RSI 37.95 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.6004 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF remains below key daily resistance, maintaining a bearish trend. Short-term consolidation signals exhaustion, not reversal. A move above $0.33 favors relief to the upside. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As seen on the 1-day price chart for December 28, WIF is trading around $0.318 after a prolonged downtrend from the $0.38–$0.40 region, with price firmly below the mid Bollinger Band near $0.356, keeping the daily structure bearish. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The lower band at $0.286 defines critical downside risk if support fails, while repeated small-bodied candles suggest selling pressure is weakening rather than accelerating. The RSI is stuck near 40, reflecting persistent bearish momentum without oversold relief, and the MACD remains negative, with only marginal histogram improvement, implying that downside momentum is slowing but still dominant. A daily close above $0.34 would be the first meaningful signal of trend stabilization. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, WIF is consolidating tightly between $0.315 and $0.320, with price trapped inside compressed moving averages around $0.317. This sideways structure reflects balance rather than strength, as the Balance of Power sits neutral and the MACD barely holds above zero, indicating a lack of conviction from both sides. Resistance remains layered at $0.325–$0.33, while a clean breakdown below $0.31 would likely accelerate a move toward the $0.30 psychological level. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4866 SELL SMA 5 $0.4272 SELL SMA 10 $0.4004 SELL SMA 21 $0.4024 SELL SMA 50 $0.4025 SELL SMA 100 $0.5179 SELL SMA 200 $0.6004 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3676 SELL EMA 5 $0.4019 SELL EMA 10 $0.4921 SELL EMA 21 $0.6227 SELL EMA 50 $0.7654 SELL EMA 100 $0.8314 SELL EMA 200 $0.9542 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is in a volatility squeeze after sustained downside, and while downside momentum is fading, bulls still lack confirmation. Traders can expect a sharp move once $0.31 or $0.33 decisively breaks. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $1 by the end of 2025 and between $3.4 and $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

On the first day, users were offered $500,000 worth of Dogecoin, a bunch of flashy physical prizes, and a five-minute window to grab it all. Though that window turned into a disaster for some, specifically those who showed up early, phones ready, but the Robinhood app crashed or froze. Robinhood $HOOD just announced their prizes for HOOD Holidays Day 2: – 5 people will win a trip to Hawaii for 2 – 1000 people will win Away suitcases – Everyone else will split $750K of Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/eMqvGcvgMg — WOLF (@WOLF_Financial) December 28, 2025 Some reportedly got stuck on a blank screen, while others were told they “missed the rewards” even though they were already in. And this happened during the one moment users were supposed to claim their prizes, according to multiple posts on X by users. Along with DOGE , Robinhood added luxury items to the mix. People could also win Rolex watches and Apple AirPods, turning what was supposed to be a crypto giveaway into a flex-off. Robinhood stock performance in 2025 has thrown Wall Street off a bit Away from the giveaways, Robinhood’s stock (HOOD) isn’t feeling festive. It closed at $118.13, down 1.92% from the previous day. That drop was worse than the S&P 500’s dip of just 0.03%. The Dow fell by 0.04%, and the Nasdaq slid 0.09%. Robinhood lost more ground than all of them. Over the past month, HOOD has dropped 6.05%, even as the finance sector gained 4.37% and the S&P 500 rose 2.57%. But earnings are coming up. Robinhood is expected to report Q4 2025 EPS of $0.57, which would be 5.56% higher than the same quarter last year. Revenue estimates sit at $1.29 billion, up 27.08% year-over-year. Still, some analysts remain optimistic. Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank still has a buy rating, and just bumped the target price from $150 to $160. TipRanks says Bedell has a 61.8% success rate and an average return of 19.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, financial analyst Carter Worth thinks Robinhood is in a “bullish-to-bearish” reversal, and could drop to around $100. Carter points out its weak performance compared to the S&P 500, and warns that the uptrend since April’s low is breaking. HOOD hit $29.66 back in April, then exploded to $153.86 in October, a 419% rally in just six months.

The real challenge is not borrowing itself, but controlling risk once market volatility enters the picture. In most cases, liquidation is triggered not by high interest rates, but by excessive leverage. This is where low Loan-to-Value (LTV) borrowing becomes relevant. Why LTV Matters More Than the Loan Size LTV measures how much you borrow relative to the value of your collateral. A low LTV means your loan is supported by a large buffer of collateral. A high LTV means that even a modest price drop can push the position toward liquidation. In crypto markets, price swings are structural. Sudden drawdowns compress collateral value quickly, raising LTV without any action from the borrower. Starting from a low LTV creates distance from liquidation thresholds and gives borrowers time to respond rather than react. Low LTV does not eliminate risk, but it dramatically reduces how often risk becomes urgent. Clapp’s Credit-Line Structure and Low LTV Clapp does not issue fixed-term loans. Instead, it offers a revolving crypto credit line where users lock crypto as collateral and receive a borrowing limit. Interest accrues only on the amount actually withdrawn. Unused credit carries 0% APR and does not increase LTV exposure. This structure makes low-LTV borrowing practical rather than restrictive. Users can keep liquidity available without paying for leverage they are not using. Because LTV is calculated in real time based on the drawn balance and current collateral value, borrowers always see how risk evolves as markets move. LTV-Based Pricing Encourages Conservative Borrowing On Clapp , interest rates depend on LTV. Lower LTV positions carry lower borrowing costs, while higher LTVs are priced higher to reflect increased risk. This pricing model reinforces safety-first behavior. Borrowers are not incentivized to maximize leverage, because doing so immediately increases cost. Maintaining a conservative LTV improves both stability and efficiency. Over time, this alignment between risk and pricing matters more than headline APRs. Managing Risk Without Rigid Loan Terms Low-LTV borrowing works best when positions can be adjusted easily. Clapp’s credit-line model allows users to repay part of the balance at any time, instantly restoring available credit. There are no fixed repayment schedules and no need to close and reopen loans to manage exposure. If market conditions change, borrowers can respond by reducing LTV incrementally rather than making all-or-nothing decisions. Clapp also supports multi-collateral credit lines, allowing up to 19 assets—such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins—to secure a single line. This can help smooth volatility and reduce the impact of sharp moves in a single asset. Risk Management and Monitoring Risk management does not end at loan origination. On Clapp, LTV is monitored continuously, and users receive advance notifications as their position approaches higher-risk levels. These alerts are meant to prompt early action, not last-minute intervention. Adding collateral or partially repaying the balance at this stage restores safety margins before liquidation becomes a threat. Final Thoughts Crypto lending becomes dangerous when leverage is treated as a default rather than a choice. Low-LTV borrowing flips that assumption. Clapp’s model supports this approach by separating access to liquidity from interest accrual, pricing risk transparently through LTV, and allowing positions to be adjusted without friction. The result is a borrowing framework designed for control rather than optimization. FAQ What does low LTV mean in crypto lending?Low LTV means borrowing a smaller amount relative to the value of your crypto collateral. This creates a wider buffer against price volatility and reduces liquidation risk. Why is low LTV safer for crypto loans?Because crypto prices can move sharply. A low LTV gives borrowers time and flexibility to react to market changes instead of facing immediate liquidation. How does Clapp support low-LTV borrowing?Clapp uses a credit-line model where interest accrues only on the amount withdrawn. Rates depend on LTV, and unused credit carries 0% APR, making conservative borrowing more efficient. Is there a fixed repayment schedule on Clapp?No. Borrowers can repay or draw funds at any time. Partial repayments immediately restore available credit without closing the position. Can I use multiple assets as collateral?Yes. Clapp allows up to 19 assets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins, to be combined into a single credit line. What happens if my LTV increases due to market moves?Clapp monitors LTV in real time and sends advance notifications before liquidation thresholds are reached, giving users time to add collateral or repay part of the balance. Who is low-LTV borrowing best suited for?Low LTV suits long-term crypto holders, users seeking fiat liquidity without selling assets, and anyone prioritizing stability over maximum leverage.

In a Sunday X post, he noted that gold and silver do not need to slow down for Bitcoin to perform well, and added that those who think otherwise may not fully understand these assets. Recent analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s value relative to gold could decline by as much as 50%. BTC currently trades at around 20 times the value of gold. However, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, believes it’s more probable for it to fall to 10 times the value of gold than rise to 30 times by 2026. He believes the token’s value compared to gold might be cut in half, even if its price in USD appears steady. Lyn Alden does not see Bitcoin and gold as market competitors Similar to James Check’s perspective , Macro strategist Lyn Alden said on a podcast that while many pit BTC against gold, she doesn’t share that view. She pointed out that the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has surged recently because BTC saw a relatively flat performance, while gold has had one of its best years. She insisted that both assets have strong long-term foundations, driving their value, and hinted that the two will continue to thrive. McGlone, however, has issued a warning indicating a lower Bitcoin-to-gold ratio at the end of 2025, a trend often linked to an economic downturn. He expects Bitcoin to drop to as low as $50,000 in 2026, a prediction also shared by veteran trader Peter Brandt. But Brandt earlier predicted that the token may fall to $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026 According to Trading Economics, on Friday, gold climbed to $4,533 and silver surpassed $77, hitting new all-time highs. However, BTC has declined by almost 30% from its all-time high of $125,100 on October 5, with its price currently at $87,613. Nonetheless, on Friday, Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, said he expects BTC to rise in tandem with gold. P eter Grant, VP and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals, also told reporters that the current market volatility in thin markets is being fueled by concerns over a potential Fed easing in 2026, the weakening of the dollar, and geopolitical uncertainty. Some bitcoiners believe BTC will post steady gains for the next decade From late 2022 through late 2024, the prices of gold and Bitcoin moved similarly, leading analysts to expect the trend to continue. So far this year, the correlation has waned, with gold rising 60% and BTC falling 7.2%. Moreover, the two markets are seeing very different sentiments. Saturday’s readings: Gold Fear & Greed Index was at 79 (“Greed”) while Crypto Fear & Greed Index was at 24 (“Extreme Fear”). Still, several BTC executives are optimistic that prices will recover in 2026. For instance, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise , stated on Friday that Bitcoin is expected to improve significantly next year and potentially achieve more stable returns over the next decade. Similarly, Jan3’s Samson Mow also thinks a ten-year bull run may be underway. Sebastian Beau, chief investment officer at ReserveOne, also noted that the fate of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is still uncertain. He described the sharp decline from October’s $125,000 high to roughly $87,000 as particularly painful. However, investors remain divided on whether the cycle is over, as Bitcoin’s October peak aligns with the peaks of the previous four-year cycles, suggesting that 2026 could be weaker.

Key Takeaways: Google search interest for “crypto” has fallen to a one-year low in the US, signaling weak retail engagement. Market crashes, memecoin losses and policy shocks have eroded investor confidence. Bitcoin’s prolonged consolidation has failed to draw retail traders back. Worldwide searches for the term “crypto” are hovering just above a one-year low, while search volume in the United States has already fallen to its weakest level in the past 12 months, suggesting muted investor sentiment across key markets. Google Trends data, which measures search interest on a scale from 0 to 100, shows global searches for “crypto” slipping to 26 on Monday, only two points above the yearly low of 24. US Crypto Search Interest Hits 1-Year Low as Retail Pulls Back In the US, search volume dropped to 26, marking a full one-year low. The decline reflects a broader pullback in retail engagement following months of market turbulence and fading enthusiasm for speculative trades. Search interest fell sharply during the April market sell-off triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policy, and has struggled to recover since. Commenting on the trend, crypto commentator Mario Nawfal said retail participation has all but disappeared. “There is close to no retail interest in crypto right now,” he said, adding that public trust was damaged by the collapse of high-profile memecoins linked to the Trump family, many of which have lost more than 90% of their value from peak levels. Nawfal noted that casual investors who once asked about crypto regularly have gone quiet, underscoring how deeply sentiment has shifted. The pullback in search activity mirrors broader market psychology, which remains fragile months after a violent downturn in October. There is close to no retail interest in crypto right now Do we need to start pumping the dino coins again to get retail to come back? After the Trump/Melania memecoin drama it seems that retail lost a lot of faith in the space None of my normie friends or family ask me… pic.twitter.com/ZNnOwT4FKe — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) December 27, 2025 That flash crash wiped out nearly $20 billion in leveraged positions in a single day, with some altcoins plunging as much as 99%. Bitcoin also suffered a steep reversal, falling from an all-time high above $125,000 to roughly $80,000 by November. Since then, the asset has traded in a narrow range between $80,000 and $90,000, offering few catalysts to reignite retail excitement. Crypto Fear Index Lingers in Fear Territory After November Low Other sentiment indicators paint a similar picture. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped to a yearly low of 10 in November, signaling “extreme fear” among investors. While the index has since recovered slightly to 28, it remains firmly in fear territory, suggesting caution still dominates market behavior. In October, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine chair Tom Lee suggested Bitcoin could still climb to $250,000 before year-end. Instead, Bitcoin is down about 3% over the past 30 days, with sentiment deteriorating through December. Last week, K33 also said Bitcoin’s prolonged sell-side pressure from long-term holders may be approaching its limits after years of steady distribution.

After multiple failed “super cycle” calls by other market enthusiasts, the anonymous market expert argues that Bitcoin’s defining breakout has yet to begin, highlighting a key market condition. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Face Prolonged Pain As Key Metric Stays Red Metal Market Downtrend, Bitcoin Supertrend According to KillaXBT in an X post on December 27, the real super cycle will only emerge when capital decisively rotates away from precious metals and into Bitcoin, marking a generational shift rather than a typical crypto rally. Unlike past “premature” super-cycle narratives, driven more by optimism, the analyst references a budding price structure similarity that indicates a massive Bitcoin price rally ahead. Notably, interest in precious metals is soaring after gold and silver recently reached new ATH prices of $4,500 and $77, respectively. Similar to most analysts, KillaXBT anticipates these precious metals will eventually slip into a multi-year downtrend that will force investors to explore other havens against inflation. In particular, the analyst expects older generations to remain anchored in gold, while a new cohort of capital increasingly chooses Bitcoin as its preferred store of value. As metals underperform, a scarce Bitcoin is tipped to record an unprecedented demand. The analyst draws a historical parallel between gold in early 1972 and Bitcoin’s current position heading into 2027. In this period, Gold entered a powerful multi-year run as capital sought protection from inflation and currency debasement. KillaXBT argues Bitcoin is approaching a similar inflection point and is set to outperform every major asset class in the next cycle. Interestingly, gold, long considered the ultimate store of value, is currently valued at an estimated $31.7 trillion in market cap value. Bitcoin, by contrast, sits near $1.83 trillion. KillaXBT explains that even at a Bitcoin price of $200,000, the network’s market cap would rise to roughly $5 trillion, still about six times smaller than gold, highlighting how early Bitcoin remains in the global asset hierarchy. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Slide Deeper Into Losses – What The Drop Below $3,000 Means This Is The Last Sub $100,000 Bear Market – Analyst In concluding notes, KillaXBT states that skepticism has accompanied every major Bitcoin rally, consistently peaking just before large upside moves. In past cycles, critics pointed to regulation, environmental concerns, and volatility risks. Today, the fear narrative has shifted to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The analyst suggests that these concerns may once again pressure investors out of the market prematurely. However, KillaXBT is taking a bullish stance as they believe the current phase could represent the final prolonged bear market in which Bitcoin trades below $100,000. However, they warn that investors should expect the supercycle boom in 2027, as 2026 is likely to be a bearish period.

Burry just put money down that shares of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies are going to tank. The two companies have helped push stock markets to new highs this year and are worth about $5 trillion together. But Burry, who’s mostly kept quiet for the past decade, says there’s a bubble here that’s going to pop. The catch? He doesn’t know when. The problem with timing “Michael, if he had one failing in the dot-com cycle, it was being early to the process. The housing bubble? It was being early to the process,” said Michael Green, a former hedge-fund manager who’s now chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. Green has warned against popular investment trends too, especially passive investing. “This is a significant issue, right? How quickly does this end?” After his housing market win, Burry picked up a serious online following. Fans dissect his posts on places like Reddit’s Burryology forum. Things are heating up for Burry now. Last month, he closed his hedge fund. Then he launched a newsletter where he said he’d share his big idea with investors—why AI stocks are going to deflate. Cassandra Unchained became one of the top-selling finance newsletters on Substack fast, pulling in some 171,000 subscribers. They’re paying $379 a year, which is actually pretty cheap compared to some competitors who charge more than $1,000 yearly. Burry ‘s pitch played into fears about AI companies investing in each other and real questions about data center limits. His main point isn’t that AI is bad, just that the market has gotten disconnected from reality. “This bubble looks an awful lot like the dot-com bubble,” he said on a podcast hosted by Michael Lewis, whose book first made Burry famous. “Which was not really a dot-com bubble. It was a data-transmission bubble.” Burry didn’t respond when asked for comment, but mentioned on Lewis’s show that he usually turns down reporters. Mixed track record fuels skepticism So far, his warnings haven’t done much to the stocks, though there’s been more talk about AI infrastructure concerns. Burry gets dismissed plenty on social media, where people crack jokes that he predicted 20 of the last two recessions. A lot of his big market crash predictions have been wrong over the past 15 years. In a Jan. 31, 2023, post he told his followers to “SELL.” Silicon Valley Bank went under two months later, but the S&P 500 index has gone up around 70% since then. He’s admitted that was the wrong call. Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive, called Burry “bats— crazy” on CNBC. On Nov. 3, Burry showed his hand against Nvidia, the chip maker that’s now the world’s most valuable company, and Palantir , a major AI software business. Together they’re worth about $5 trillion. His bets were pretty small, around $10 million in put options, but could turn into more than $1 billion if those stocks drop hard. “Palantir and Nvidia are the two luckiest companies on the planet,” he told Lewis. Why he’s betting against Palantir Burry said he’s shorting them for different reasons, though they’re connected. Palantir depends too much on stingy government contracts and gives too much to its executives, he said. He pointed to tough competition too, especially from International Business Machines. His bet pays if Palantir drops to $50 a share in 2027 from the roughly $200 it’s been trading around. Karp said on CNBC that he thinks Burry was trying to manipulate the market and shot down Burry’s take. Nvidia’s problems have to do with its customers, like Oracle and Meta Platforms, where Burry said he sees a bunch of issues. Nvidia has been helping fund some of their purchases in deals that, Burry said , look like how companies like Enron financially propped up its vendors buying its products. Burry’s also looked at the accounting at these companies and Nvidia about how long the chips last, saying this helps companies pump up their earnings. If the bubble bursts, there could be a domino effect of lower stated profits, falling share prices, and less investment that would hurt Nvidia’s future sales. Burry’s bet pays if Nvidia falls about 37%, to $110, by 2027. It’s around $190 now. Companies push back hard Nvidia has pushed back on Burry’s claims. “Nvidia does not resemble historical accounting frauds because Nvidia’s underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is complete and transparent, and we care about our reputation for integrity,” the company said in a memo that Barron’s reported on earlier. Nvidia and Palantir shares have fallen since Nov. 3, but the drops have been choppy. Right now, that might actually be helping investors who think there’s no end in sight. “I would actually argue that awareness of this has encouraged people to defect and basically become more convinced that stocks can go to unlimited levels,” Green, the chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said.

Recent reports suggest that the company is already in late-stage talks to go public in 2026 . Public listings are not casual moves, as they come with scrutiny, disclosure, and regulatory exposure. For firms deeply tied to financial infrastructure, that step usually signals preparation, not experimentation. That view was laid out clearly by crypto commentator Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle) in a recent video discussing XRP and the company’s direction. This Changes Everything for #XRP !!! pic.twitter.com/s9f3RLDWDn — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 26, 2025 Is Ripple Considering an IPO? Ripple Bull Winkle challenged a common perception that Ripple operates like a typical private crypto company. He argued that late-stage IPO discussions do not happen unless leadership sees favorable conditions ahead. As he put it, “Private firms usually stay private as long as possible.” An IPO brings regulatory oversight and constant attention from Wall Street. Companies avoid that unless they believe the environment supports growth. According to Ripple Bull Winkle, the fact that Ripple may be exploring an IPO now suggests confidence in regulation, infrastructure, and demand for its XRP-powered services. He stressed that “the timing isn’t random.” In his view, these conversations start long before expansion. That distinction is important for market participants interested in XRP’s future. Confidence Signals for XRP Ripple Bull Winkle sees the IPO discussion as a signal of maturity. He said it shows confidence that Ripple’s business model can operate under public market expectations. That includes compliance, transparency, and long-term scalability. Experts believe Ripple’s IPO can directly influence XRP’s price . Ripple Bull Winkle noted that once a company enters public markets, it undergoes formal valuation. That process forces institutions to assign clear value to the business and its associated network. He argued that when that happens, the underlying asset tied to that ecosystem gets revalued. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Investors Are Watching Now Ripple Bull Winkle made it clear that this phase does not revolve around charts alone. He said people paying attention “aren’t watching charts.” They are watching positioning. That includes how institutions prepare for regulatory clarity and public market exposure. The expectation he outlined was not immediate price movement. IPO discussions signal that Ripple believes the groundwork is close to complete. If true, that belief could shape how long-term capital views XRP . He closed by encouraging viewers tracking early developments to stay informed as the story evolves and we get closer to 2026.

Moving beyond the era of ‘Labor Income,’ where one had to work to earn money, the era of ‘Lifestyle Income’ where the act of enjoying life itself becomes wealth, has arrived. At the center of this massive shift is WonderChain. While existing blockchains were merely cold numbers on a monitor, WonderChain has entered the ‘real world’ where your heart beats. There is one single reason why the global community of 200,000 people and global VCs are enthusiastic about WonderChain right now. It is the most definite ‘Real Economy’ “Earning Money While Participating?”… The Web3.5 Ecosystem That Turned Imagination into Reality WonderChain is the world’s first project to implement the ‘Social Capital’ theory of renowned scholar Professor Robert Putnam into blockchain. However, what is more powerful than theory is the ‘tangible economy.’ True Value in Lifestyle : Within the WonderChain ecosystem, your shopping, travel, gourmet exploration, and cultural life do not end as simple participation. All this activity data is converted into value and rewarded in $WDC. Circular Economy : The rewarded $WDC is immediately used like cash within the ecosystem for shopping, hotel reservations, and airline ticket purchases. This suggests that WonderChain is a powerful alternative that perfectly solves the long-standing task of blockchain: “Mine in the virtual, spend in the real.” 3rd Massive Airdrop: “Those Who Enter Now Secure the Future” The successfully concluded 2nd airdrop was merely a prelude. Now, the eyes of all global users and holders are turned toward the upcoming ‘3rd Massive Airdrop.’ The community is already pouring out heated expectations, calling t his 3rd airdrop an “unprecedented opportunity and a moment that must never be missed.” Why Now? : This 3rd airdrop is not a simple free distribution. It is akin to distributing entrance tickets to become an ‘initial member’ of the massive real economy ecosystem built by WonderChain. Definite Reward for Contribution : Every act of participating in the community and contributing to the ecosystem is measured most fairly and transparently, returning as rewards. An industry insider predicted, “If Hyperliquid brought innovation to a specific financial sector, WonderChain aims for a fundamental civilizational transformation by turning the social value of all humanity into assets,” adding, “In terms of potential value and impact, it will surpass the success of Hyperliquid.” Why Top-Tier VCs and Exchanges Have Designated WonderChain as ‘Priority No. 1 for Listing’ The reason why Silicon Valley’s massive capital and top-tier exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Bitget are paying attention to WonderChain is cold and clear. ‘Real Data’ with Substance : WonderChain has 200,000 ‘real people’ who eat, travel, and enjoy shopping every day. ‘Living Assets’ Coveted by Exchanges : The tens of thousands of lively interactions created daily by these 200,000 people represent the guaranteed liquidity and sustainable fee model that exchanges crave most. Beyond a Cultural Phenomenon to an Economic Standard : If WonderChain dominated 1,007 global media outlets as a ‘cultural phenomenon’ in 2025, it is projected to establish itself as a ‘new standard’ of the global economy in 2026. Explosive Scalability : “Money gathers where people are.” The industry’s common view is that the current community of 200,000 will exceed 1 million in early 2026, expand to a digital empire of over 10 million and eventually 30 million within 2026, and that WonderChain will become the ‘core infrastructure’ supporting the real economy in 2026. Conclusion: Your Lifestyle, Now Put a ‘Price’ on It. According to WonderChain, “How much is your daily life worth?” They explain that while personal shopping, travel, and relationships have merely been ‘expenses’ or ‘memories’ until now, with WonderChain, every one of those moments becomes an ‘asset.’ It is projected that in 2026, a world will arrive where 10 million people worldwide travel and make payments through WonderChain. The choice of whether to remain a simple user or to participate in the ecosystem and become a master of this massive flow is ultimately up to the reader. WonderChain is waiting for everyone who wants to prove the value of their daily lives to join under the slogan, ‘Where Lifestyle Becomes Value.’ WonderChain Official Channels https://www.wonderchain.io This post “The Leader of 2026 is Set” WonderChain Opens the Era of the World’s First ‘Lifestyle Capital,’ Going Beyond Ethereum’s Scalability and Bitcoin’s Trust first appeared on BitcoinWorld .",Press Release|WonderChain,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-12-28 09:05:15

The company is reportedly in late-stage talks for a 2026 IPO, with multiple sources confirming active preparations that underscore a transformative moment for Ripple and the wider crypto-financial ecosystem. An IPO would be a turning point for Ripple. Going public brings stricter audits, enhanced disclosures, and continuous regulatory oversight, often seen as constraints, but ones that significantly boost credibility. Greater transparency and stronger governance can elevate institutional trust, making Ripple far more attractive to banks, payment providers, and large enterprises that typically require this level of accountability before deepening partnerships. This is where Ripple’s value proposition truly stands out. At its core is an XRP-powered payments network built for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Unlike many crypto projects driven largely by speculation, Ripple’s technology is already embedded in real-world financial systems. A public listing could further accelerate adoption, scale partnerships, and deepen institutional trust. If Ripple goes public, the ripple effects could be significant. Public-market transparency and governance would likely reassure banks and financial institutions, accelerating adoption of Ripple’s technology. As institutional use grows, payment volumes on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) would increase, driving real demand for XRP as a liquidity bridge. Well, this shift is crucial because when XRP is used for real-time cross-border settlements, its value becomes anchored in transaction utility and network flow rather than market hype. Over time, XRP’s narrative evolves from a volatile crypto asset to core financial infrastructure powering global payments. While the transition would be gradual, shaped by regulatory clarity and steady adoption, it could accelerate rapidly as network effects compound. As crypto-native firms like Ripple eye public listings, the divide between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure is rapidly narrowing. If Ripple’s rumored 2026 IPO comes to fruition, it could be a watershed moment, elevating not only the company, but also positioning XRP as a foundational asset in the future architecture of global finance. Conclusion Ripple’s late-stage 2026 IPO preparations could be a turning point for the company and the XRP ecosystem. A public listing would boost transparency, strengthen regulatory credibility, and attract wider institutional adoption, shifting XRP from speculative interest to real-world utility. As banks and payment providers increasingly integrate Ripple’s technology, XRP Ledger transaction volumes are set to rise, cementing XRP’s role as a core component of global payment infrastructure.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 09:11:54

This shows that individuals are fully aware of the utility provided through a two-way infrastructure for loaning. It should be noted that 1,850 wallets are involved, thus proving it’s more than just a gamble. Analysts of top cryptocurrencies who monitor DeFi developments have already named MUTM, also known as Mutuum Finance, one of the crypto to invest in before the end of the year since it has been deemed safe and its price won’t last long once Phase 7 is launched. The time to invest in Mutuum Finance at $0.035 is very short since afterwards its price will go high. Presale Structure Rewards Prompt Action Within this context, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized its fund-raising process to motivate proactive investors rather than those who only invest when market conditions suit them. Phase 6 is reportedly currently 99% full, with only below 1% tokens left at $0.035. When this phase is exhausted, Phase 7 will automatically start with a pricing plan of $0.04, which entails a 20% hike, thus making previous investors less attractive. Phase 1 participants who invested at $0.01 are already enjoying a 250% ROI and new investors will be able to enjoy a 420% ROI once MUTM exceeds its listing price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still remains one of the top crypto investments. This creates a supply-demand driving force for the token. Though regular tokens function on a speculation mechanism, there is a “buy-and-distribute” system on Mutuum Finance. This system creates market demand for MUTM regardless of market conditions. This system attracts a revenue-generating fee for each lending and borrowing process on the platform. From this revenue, MUTM is automatically purchased on open markets for distribution to mtToken liquidity providers. It solves a problem common among DeFi projects, where the success of the platform does not necessarily correlate to the price of the tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distributes benefits its token holders based on the increase in the number of loans, which in turn requires more buybacks of MUTM tokens. Yield-Generating Features The mtTokens earned from the deposits on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are interest-bearing tokens that signify a holder’s contribution to the lending pools. Such tokens earn interest automatically with the repayment of the same by the borrowers. Moreover, the mtTokens can be held in a wallet until the time of redeeming the initial amount and the interest incurred. Stablecoin Integration Addresses Volatility Concerns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced the imminent release of a stablecoin that shall be over-collateralized and anchored at a one-to-one price ratio to the value of the US dollar. Unlike the stablecoins that relied on algorithmic systems to manage the value and ultimately failed in the highly volatile market events of 2022, the stablecoin by Mutuum Finance shall be backed by the excess reserves provided by lending pools. The interest earned on the reserves shall be allocated to the treasury. This is anticipated to improve the position of Mutuum Finance in being one of the top crypto projects, since it will fill an essential demand within the DeFi market. Individuals will be in a position to take part in market positions without worrying about collateral value. It will be seamlessly integrated into both Peer-to-Contract lending markets and Peer-to-Peer lending markets. Time Limited for Optimization of Entries Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been able to raise $19.5 million funds and has been able to gain 18,590 supporters. Phase 6 is rapidly progressing, and the current price of $0.035 will no longer be available once Phase 7 is initiated. This is a good opportunity for investors for the crypto to invest in during a crucial marketplace state.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in September. In October, it rose above $30. It then reversed, and by December, it had dropped to $14.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIL|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-28 09:30:18

Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expects steady, lower-volatility Bitcoin gains over the next decade rather than explosive rallies. Hougan remains bullish on 2026, citing ongoing institutional buying despite recent price weakness. Some analysts warn Bitcoin could still face deeper downside if the cycle has peaked. Speaking on CNBC on Friday , Hougan described Bitcoin’s outlook as a prolonged upward trend marked by lower volatility and more measured returns. “I think we’re in a 10-year grind upward of strong returns,” he said. “It’s not spectacular returns, [but] strong returns, lower volatility, some up and down.” Bitwise CIO Sticks to Bullish 2026 Bitcoin Outlook Hougan reaffirmed his view that 2026 will be a positive year for Bitcoin, maintaining a forecast he first shared in July, months before the asset surged to a new all-time high of $125,100 in October. “I think next year will be up,” he said, despite growing debate over whether the current market cycle has already peaked. That debate intensified after Bitcoin pulled back sharply from its October highs. The asset is trading around $87,800 at the time of publication, down about 3.8% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. ReserveOne chief investment officer Sebastian Beau said the drop has revived questions about whether Bitcoin’s traditional four-year cycle remains intact. “All-time highs were 125,000… we are bordering on $87,000 today, down 30% relatively quickly,” Beau said, calling the move painful for investors. Some market participants note that the timing of Bitcoin’s October peak closely resembles past cycle tops, raising the possibility that 2026 could be a down year. Hougan acknowledged that retail behavior has played a role in the recent weakness, arguing that “fast-moving” retail investors rotated out late in the year in anticipation of a cycle-driven downturn. Still, Hougan believes Bitcoin’s downside has been cushioned by what he described as “persistent, slow-moving institutional buying.” Unlike previous cycles that saw drawdowns of 60% or more, Bitcoin’s current pullback has been comparatively shallow, a sign that long-term capital is providing support. Not all analysts share Hougan’s optimism. Veteran trader Peter Brandt has warned that Bitcoin could slide to $60,000 by the third quarter of 2026, highlighting ongoing risks tied to macro conditions and market structure. Bitwise CIO Sticks to Bullish 2026 Bitcoin Outlook Hougan also downplayed expectations that US politics will drive the next leg higher. While Bitcoin rallied to fresh highs earlier in 2025 following Donald Trump’s inauguration, Hougan said the administration is unlikely to unlock significant new upside. Looking ahead to 2026, the industry remains divided. Fidelity’s director of global macro research, Jurrien Timmer, has suggested 2026 could be a pause year, with prices potentially sliding toward $65,000. Others remain more optimistic. Strategy CEO Phong Le has argued that Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals held up throughout 2025 despite weaker prices, while Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier this year that he expects 2026 to be an “up year” for the asset. According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data.

While crypto prices often move on hype alone, long-term winners are usually built during quieter phases. That is exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently stands, positioning itself as a serious defi crypto contender while still being available at presale valuation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that will support both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. Its structure focuses on real usage rather than speculation, which is why many market observers are now projecting aggressive upside as adoption increases through 2026. Presale Drawing Attention Currently valued at $0.035, the MUTM token is making waves as it sails through its Phase 6 presale, showcasing a phenomenal 250% increase since its humble beginnings at $0.01. With a total supply capped at 4 billion, of which 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens are reserved for presale, Mutuum Finance is intricately designed for appreciation. This allocation ensures broad early participation while maintaining long-term ecosystem balance. What fuels urgency among investors is the staggered pricing structure that elevates prices by nearly 20% with each consecutive phase. This mechanism directly rewards early commitment and steadily raises the entry barrier as demand increases. How Lending Utility Will Drive 600% Demand and Revenue As part of its beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deploy V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. This testnet phase will allow users to interact early, provide feedback, and build confidence ahead of broader adoption. Deploying V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the protocol before the mainnet rollout. This phased release supports transparency, promotes hands-on user participation, and allows the team to refine the system based on real-world feedback. As engagement grows during the testnet phase, interest in the platform is expected to increase, helping reinforce long-term confidence and demand for the MUTM token. Mutuum Finance is being built around two lending models that will directly support usage-driven demand for MUTM. Every interaction within the protocol will require token engagement, reinforcing a circular economy that aligns users, liquidity, and long-term growth. In the peer-to-contract model, lenders will pool assets such as USDT and DAI alongside established cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access this liquidity by posting overcollateralized assets. Interest rates will dynamically adjust based on pool utilization, rising as demand increases and easing as liquidity expands. This mechanism will balance supply and borrowing efficiency without centralized intervention. For example, a lender supplying 10,000 USDT into a P2C pool will receive mtTokens representing their pool share and accrued interest. These mtTokens will also function as collateral, allowing the lender to borrow assets such as ETH without withdrawing their original position. At the same time, a borrower depositing $15,000 worth of ETH can borrow 9,000 USDT (depending on LTV ratio), maintaining a strong collateral buffer while accessing liquidity for trading or strategy execution. This structure rewards both sides through predictable yield and controlled risk. The peer-to-peer model will expand opportunities further by enabling lending for higher-risk or niche assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE). Instead of pooled liquidity, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates and durations that reflect asset volatility. For instance, a lender accepting DOGE as collateral can offer a short-term loan at a higher interest rate, capturing elevated returns while operating within clearly defined risk boundaries. This segmentation protects the core liquidity pools while unlocking yield avenues that traditional platforms often avoid. All loans across both models will rely on overcollateralization enforced by a Stability Factor. When collateral values decline beyond required thresholds, liquidation will activate automatically. Liquidators will repurchase outstanding debt at a discount, stabilizing the system and preventing bad debt from spreading across the protocol. Market volatility and liquidity management will play a critical role in sustaining protocol health. Adequate on-chain liquidity will ensure liquidations execute smoothly without excessive slippage. Loan-to-Value ratios will be calibrated based on asset risk, with lower-volatility assets like ETH and stablecoins sustaining higher LTVs, while volatile tokens operate within tighter parameters. Reserve factors will further protect the system, balancing security with participation incentives. In the final analysis, the current presale window is rapidly closing. Phase 6 is already 98% sold out, and the next phase will increase the token price by approximately 15%, moving MUTM from $0.035 to $0.040. For investors targeting 2026 exposure, this marks the final opportunity to secure entry at today’s discounted valuation.

While the flagship cryptocurrency has recorded an all-time high since Trump’s inauguration in January, the market has mostly been in consolidation and range-bound phase, with the broader picture still taking on a bearish form. Crypto analysis page XWIN Research Japan recently offered a comparative analysis with the post-election euphoria seen in 2016, to explain why the post-2024 price action is without enthusiasm. Analyst Explains Why Bitcoin’s Structure Differs Sharply From 2016 In the Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, the research and education institution draws a critical comparison between the 2016 and 2024 post-election periods. Just after Trump’s victory in 2016, the crypto market operated within a low-inflation and low-interest-rate environment, one that is ideal for a market with growing liquidity. Also, the crypto market’s relatively small size allowed for quick accumulation of speculative liquidity. Hence, the market was able to get sufficient capital to serve as fuel for a prolonged, yet powerful, uptrend. However, early 2025 saw a different market environment and dynamic. The year began and extended into a high-rate period, where financial conditions increasingly became crippling. Also, the larger market size (compared to the post-2016 election market), alongside increased participation among several investors, has structurally reduced the stand-alone importance of political events on price movements. Simply put, policy implementations can barely move Bitcoin’s price alone, especially when encumbered by more liquidity constraints. LTH-SOPR Ratio Further Reflects Caution XWIN Research Japan also references data obtained from the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio (LTH-SOPR/STH-SOPR), which reinforces the cautious stance among investors following Trump’s second inauguration. The Bitcoin SOPR Ratio deciphers market sentiment by comparing whether long-term holders are realizing profits more aggressively than short-term holders, serving as an important indicator of whether a price trend is driven by institutional conviction or speculative trading. According to the research team, Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) are realizing their limited profits. Short-term holders, on the other hand, are trading within red territory. Historically, this condition is typically found when the market is about to embark on a prolonged journey of demand-supply adjustments. Based on historical data, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is currently within a fundamentally bearish structure. Although XWIN Research elucidates that “as long as long-term holders maintain relative dominance and short-term holder selling is absorbed, downside may be supported,” but this came with a caveat that upside leadership would likely also remain restricted. The analytics group further conjectures that a stable growth of Bitcoin ETF inflows, alongside a clear depreciation in LTH distribution, would be pivotal in rescuing BTC from its downward spiral. Until these happen simultaneously, bitcoin might remain in its current state of inertia, or — in the worst case — dive further south. At press time, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $87,623, recording a slight 0.5% loss since the past week, and a 0.6% ascent since the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin SOPR Ratio|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Donald Trump|XWIN Research Japan,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-28 10:00:26

In a recent post on X, he focused on how the XRP Ledger was built, arguing that its structure prioritizes security, scarcity, and reliability at scale. Rather than centering price action or market sentiment, his comments point to architecture as the deciding factor in XRP’s long-term role within global finance. The way this network was created will make $XRP the hardest currency that will ever exist. It's Necessary for network security, it has a fixed supply, and it's deflationary as a function and it has no counterparty risk. With these characteristics it will be designated as Tear 1… https://t.co/2tNDbnn678 — WhiteBeardedNinja (@WhiteBeardNinja) December 25, 2025 XRP’s Network Hardness WhiteBeardedNinja argues that the network’s design positions XRP differently from most digital assets. He describes XRP as potentially “the hardest currency that will ever exist.” The reasoning links directly to network security. XRP requires a small amount of the asset to create accounts and submit transactions. That design raises the cost of spam attacks and denial of service attempts. He also points to supply mechanics. XRP has a fixed supply, and no new tokens can be minted. Each transaction destroys a tiny amount of XRP. That function makes the asset deflationary by design . Over long periods, supply trends lower while usage can rise. Another core element is risk structure. WhiteBeardedNinja states that XRP carries “no counterparty risk.” Value transfer occurs directly on the ledger, and settlement does not depend on a third party fulfilling an obligation later. This design matters if the network reaches large-scale usage across financial institutions. He believes these traits will make XRP a tier 1 asset in the global economic system. Utility As The Primary Driver WhiteBeardedNinja’s post was a reply to SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher. SMQKE argued that XRP’s price is driven by utility, not hype, and attached a document to support his view. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP secures its network by requiring reserves and transaction fees. Those fees get destroyed. The cost remains low for normal users but rises for attackers attempting to flood the system. This mechanism supports stability while preserving speed. The document also outlines XRP’s role as a bridge asset . It facilitates value transfer between currencies without requiring pre-funded accounts. That function supports real-world payment flows rather than speculative loops. Both perspectives converge on one point. Design alone does not guarantee an outcome. WhiteBeardedNinja makes it clear that adoption determines everything, noting that the tier 1 status only follows if the network gains scale.

At least that’s what Coinbase Institutional is saying in their latest report. Colin Basco, an analyst, and David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, examined what is now driving the cryptocurrency markets. What did they learn? The period of the wild west is coming to an end. Retail traders and meme coin frenzy are giving way to professional trading infrastructure and institutional money. Derivatives markets run the show The key one is that trade activity on major exchanges is now dominated by perpetual futures. This fundamentally alters the way cryptocurrency prices fluctuate. In the past, it was straightforward: coins were purchased, and prices increased. Coins were sold, and prices decreased. Right now? Leverage, funding rates, and the liquidity of the derivatives market are crucial. Late 2025 saw massive liquidations that wiped out a ton of leverage in these markets. But Coinbase doesn’t see this as a bad thing. According to Duong and Basco, tighter margin requirements and better risk management are actually making markets healthier. When bad news hits, the crashes aren’t as brutal. And despite more regulation, derivatives still provide most of the liquidity traders need. Prediction markets go mainstream The second trend is that prediction markets are becoming real financial instruments rather than just places to bet on random objects. Both volume and liquidity are rapidly increasing. People use these marketplaces for knowledge gathering and risk reduction about unclear situations in addition to gaming. Right now, prediction markets are scattered across different platforms. For traders who can identify price disparities and take advantage of them, this opens up chances. There’s growing demand for tools that pull data from all these platforms in one place. Professional traders are becoming increasingly involved, and they are no longer limited to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This is especially true in regions where regulators are starting to provide clearer rules. Stablecoins move beyond trading Stablecoins and payments make up the third category . This is the point at which cryptocurrency becomes practical rather than just speculative. Stablecoin transactions are becoming more frequent, but this isn’t because traders are flipping them. Businesses utilize them for foreign payments, treasury management, and settlements. Important yet boring stuff. What’s interesting is how payments tie into everything else happening in crypto. DeFi protocols run on stablecoins. AI applications are starting to use them too. Coinbase pushes back on the idea that AI threatens crypto payments. They argue the opposite—AI needs the kind of programmable, 24/7 financial infrastructure that blockchains provide. Make or break year The ability of these three industries to continue expanding in the face of stricter regulations and increased professional scrutiny will be put to the test in 2026. For years to come, the answer will likely dictate how cryptocurrency develops.
