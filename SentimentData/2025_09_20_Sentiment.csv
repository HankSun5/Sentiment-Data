Each cycle decreases supply, enhances scarcity, and very often will cause massive rallies. Analysts now project a possible rally of BTC to $250K in the next bull run. At the same time, liquidations are shaking out weak positions. Over $176.9 million in short positions were liquidated in the past day, boosting bullishness. As confidence builds back up, investors are starting to rotate to promising altcoins. Among the most-discussed are Hyperliquid and MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin Halving and Market Outlook The halving reduces the flow of new coins every 210,000 blocks. This event is foundational to Bitcoin’s model of scarcity and value proposition. Historically, halvings caused large price increases, with the cycles getting larger than the previous one. Importantly, the impact does not end with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin gains, altcoins tend to follow, but with greater percentage increases. Consequently, capital normally turns into innovative tokens with higher upside potential. This rotation opens the door for platforms such as Hyperliquid and emerging projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. $176.9M Short Liquidations: Market Confidence Returns In the past 24 hours, crypto liquidations hit $370.62 million. Shorts made up $176.93 million of that total. Longs were slightly higher at $196.16 million, showing volatility cuts both ways. Notably, the single largest liquidation happened on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, worth $2.65 million. These liquidations reveal how quickly sentiment shifts when prices move sharply. Yet, they also reinforce bullish momentum by removing leveraged sellers. Investors now see liquidations as signals of strength rather than weakness. Capital is shifting toward altcoins where growth potential is higher. Hyperliquid and Magacoin Finance are clear beneficiaries of this shift. Hyperliquid’s Breakout and Stablecoin Ambitions Hyperliquid has quickly established itself as a force in decentralized trading. Its native token, HYPE, surged past $55, setting a new all-time high. That represents over 1,200% growth from late 2024 lows. The rally was fueled by proposals around USDH, Hyperliquid’s upcoming stablecoin. Governance activity has intensified, with multiple players submitting proposals. Paxos suggested using reserve interest for HYPE buybacks, backed by Treasury bills and stable reserves. Frax Finance proposed minting USDH against a basket of stable assets, with revenue directed to staking or buybacks. Institutional support is also emerging. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck publicly endorsed Hyperliquid, confirming investment and long-term interest. His comments boosted confidence in Hyperliquid’s vision and strengthened its reputation. The combination of governance growth, stablecoin development, and institutional recognition positions Hyperliquid strongly. If altseason follows the halving, Hyperliquid could attract massive liquidity and adoption. Magacoin Finance: A Hidden Gem in Rotation MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly joining discussions about the best altcoins before the halving . Investors are searching for assets with upside potential beyond majors, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that category. Unlike larger-cap tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still selling at a low entry price many consider undervalued. Its limited supply and growing community create a scarcity-driven environment. Whale accumulation has increased steadily, a sign of strong confidence. As shorts get liquidated and capital rotates, traders are eyeing altcoins with breakout potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum, combined with its fundamentals, makes it a hidden gem in this environment. With scarcity, transparency, and community backing, it is attracting fresh attention as the halving nears. Why Altcoins Could Outperform Post-Halving Altcoin seasons usually follow Bitcoin rallies. As Bitcoin dominates headlines, investors eventually diversify into riskier assets for higher gains. Historically, this rotation led to massive runs in Ethereum, Solana, and other layer-1s. This cycle could follow the same pattern. Hyperliquid offers exposure to DeFi innovation and stablecoin growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides scarcity-driven value and growing adoption. Together, they represent two different but complementary opportunities for investors. As Bitcoin pushes toward a possible $250K target, altcoins could multiply at even faster rates. Investors preparing early have the best chance to capture these moves. Conclusion The upcoming Bitcoin halving is more than a supply event. It is a catalyst for the entire crypto market. With $176.9M shorts liquidated and confidence returning, the stage is set for growth. Hyperliquid’s governance and stablecoin progress show its potential as a DeFi leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by scarcity and accumulation, is emerging as a hidden gem. As the market looks beyond Bitcoin, these two altcoins stand out. Positioned before the halving, they could be the keys to outsized returns in the next cycle.

The plans are direct: Expand $USDe adoption across centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms Launch Ethena on BNB Chain Develop new products USDtb and Converge Strengthen growth with TVL now above $13B, according to DeFiLlama https://t.co/AfzsqtAPwb — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) September 19, 2025 $USDe: The Synthetic Dollar Taking DeFi by Storm Ethena’s $USDe is designed to be a synthetic dollar, independent from traditional banking rails. Unlike centralized stablecoins, it generates yields through delta-neutral strategies, combining spot and futures positions to hedge volatility while still delivering returns. That design makes $USDe attractive for both retail and institutional DeFi users. It’s not just a dollar substitute, it’s a yield-bearing asset integrated across lending, liquidity pools, and trading protocols. On CoinMarketCap, $USDe currently holds a market cap above $3.2B, climbing rapidly in 2025 as adoption spreads. TVL Growth Signals Strong Market Demand Ethena’s total value locked (TVL) has crossed $13B, a sharp rise from $6B earlier this year. This surge highlights just how quickly USDe and its ecosystem are becoming embedded into the DeFi landscape. For perspective, Ethena now ranks among the top 5 DeFi protocols by TVL, rivaling established players like Aave and MakerDAO. This rapid scaling also reinforces why YZi Labs sees Ethena as a key driver in the shift toward decentralized stable assets. YZi Labs doubles down on $ENA USDe is now the 3rd largest $USD asset in crypto with $13B+ supply & TVL, the fastest ever to $10B. Backed since incubation, YZi is fueling Ethena’s next phase: • USDe adoption across CEXs + DeFi • Expansion on BNB Chain • New… pic.twitter.com/8Pn5VsEhA4 — CryptoED (@Crypto_ED7) September 19, 2025 Strategic Expansion Into BNB Chain One of the most significant steps in YZi Labs’ roadmap is extending Ethena’s deployment to BNB Chain. BNB Chain brings access to a massive retail user base, with daily active wallets consistently ranking among the top across blockchains. Integrating USDe here positions Ethena to tap into liquidity, DeFi yield markets, and cross-chain opportunities within the Binance ecosystem. This also connects back to the origins of YZi Labs, founded by Binance co-founders CZ and Yi He, showing how their support is evolving from exchange-native products into broader Web3 infrastructure. New Products: USDtb and Converge Beyond scaling USDe, Ethena Labs is preparing to roll out two new products: USDtb → A new stable asset designed to complement USDe, with enhanced liquidity and interoperability across DeFi and CEXs. Converge → A protocol aimed at bridging centralized and decentralized finance, expanding yield opportunities and cross-market integrations. Together, these additions strengthen Ethena’s role as more than just a stablecoin issuer, it becomes a full-stack synthetic dollar ecosystem. ENA Token Gains From Ecosystem Growth The ENA token, Ethena’s governance and rewards asset, has already benefited from ecosystem expansion. Earlier this year, ENA spiked in value after Ethena’s TVL crossed $6B. With TVL now over $13B, investors are watching closely for another wave of upside momentum. On CoinMarketCap, ENA is trading at $0.68 with a $900M market cap, cementing its place among top DeFi governance tokens. As USDe adoption spreads across CEXs, DeFi, and BNB Chain, ENA stands to capture further value through governance rights, staking incentives, and fee participation. Institutional Backing Adds Credibility Institutional capital continues to flow into DeFi, but YZi Labs’ renewed investment carries unique weight. As the family office of CZ and Yi He, YZi Labs isn’t just a random fund. Its roots trace back to Binance Labs, historically one of the most influential venture arms in Web3. By expanding its stake in Ethena Labs, YZi Labs is signaling confidence in synthetic dollar protocols as the future of stable assets. For Ethena, this credibility boost could draw in more liquidity providers, institutional partners, and retail trust. Regulatory and Market Risks Still, stablecoins remain one of the most heavily scrutinized sectors in crypto. Regulators across the US, Europe, and Asia continue to assess how to classify synthetic dollar assets. At the same time, market volatility and yield compression pose risks to sustainability. Ethena’s delta-neutral design reduces exposure, but ongoing improvements in risk management and transparency will be critical for long-term adoption. Digital Dollars in Web3 YZi Labs’ investment is part of a larger trend: institutional capital moving toward mature, revenue-generating DeFi protocols. The growth of USDe shows that users are demanding dollar-denominated stability that isn’t tied to banks, especially in an era where centralized stablecoins face increased regulatory pressure. If successful, Ethena Labs’ model could set a blueprint for how synthetic dollars power the internet economy, from payments to trading to savings. With TVL at $13B, a growing user base, and new products on the horizon, Ethena Labs is cementing itself as a major player in the stablecoin sector. YZi Labs’ deeper stake sends a strong signal: USDe isn’t just another DeFi experiment. It’s a core building block for digital dollars, positioned to expand across CEXs, DeFi, and into BNB Chain. For ENA holders, USDe users, and the wider ecosystem, the message is clear, the future of stablecoins is becoming increasingly synthetic, decentralized, and yield-bearing.

51990326,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425804,1758321000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990326.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin and Pi Coin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-dogecoin-and-pi-coin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s homegrown ChatGPT alternative, DeepSeek AI, predict that XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network could post substantial gains for investors before the year’s end. The broader crypto market seems to be laying the groundwork for such a move. Just last month, Bitcoin reached a fresh record high of $124,128, beating the prior peak of $122,838 set only a month earlier. However, enthusiasm faded after July’s hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation numbers led to a temporary pullback. Regulators are also accelerating their efforts. In July, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive federal law governing stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC announced Project Crypto, an initiative aimed at updating securities laws and providing clearer rules for digital asset companies. With new rules rolling out and market confidence returning, analysts believe the upcoming wave in altcoins and meme tokens could surpass the 2021 bull run. If DeepSeek’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network could be the leading beneficiaries. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Sees a Potential 230% Rally Toward $5 According to DeepSeek, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could advance to $10 by late 2025, marking a significant 230% jump from its current level near $3.03. XRP has already shown resilience this cycle. On July 18, it hit $3.65, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40, before easing roughly 17% due to risk-on sentiment from various macroeconomic pressures. Ripple’s global payments network continues to expand. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a cost-effective solution for remittances in developing nations. The end of Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC in early 2025 removed one of the biggest uncertainties surrounding the project. The SEC dropped its lawsuit after a 2023 ruling confirmed that retail XRP sales do not qualify as securities. If XRP can reclaim and sustain its July highs, DeepSeek AI expects $5-10 to be within reach, though other market experts have floated far more ambitious targets of $10–$20. On the technical side, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) has pulled back from 59 yesterday to 53, signalling a brief flurry of buying in yesterday day trading before an overnight dip. Despite the Fed’s rate cuts and the rollout of the first spot XRP ETF , markets are cautious, potentially waiting for the SEC verdict on a raft of ETF applications due middle of next month, along with the rollout of comprehensive US crypto legislation. Over the last twelve months, XRP has skyrocketed 420%, much quicker growth than Bitcoin’s 87.5% and Ethereum’s 86% appreciation over the same period. Dogecoin ($DOGE): DeepSeek Predicts a Push Past $1 for the Original Meme Token First launched in 2013 as a parody cryptocurrency, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since evolved into a top-10 digital asset, with a market capitalization of about $41.3 billion within the $88.2 billion meme coin sector. Its staying power comes from its dedicated community and growing role as a payments option. DOGE often tracks Bitcoin’s moves, but thanks to its strong liquidity and fan base, it has managed to weather several market downturns. Now trading near $0.2738, Dogecoin has more than doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. In the last two weeks alone, DOGE gained 27%, briefly pushing its RSI up to 75 before cooling back to 62 amid profit-taking and market dips. Chart watchers highlight recurring bullish falling wedge patterns from November through April, and again in July and August, hinting at potentially explosive further upside. DeepSeek’s conservative projection places DOGE at $1 to $2 by December. The upper range would spell a staggering 630% increase for current holders. Additionally, it would mean the “Doge Army” could finally reach its dream target of $1 per coin, a major psychological milestone given Doge’s ATH during the 2021 bull run was $0.7316. DeepSeek suggests a strong bull market could finally make that goal a reality. Adoption is also growing steadily: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin transfers. Pi Network ($PI): DeepSeek AI Tips Tap-to-Mine Coin for Explosive Growth Pi Network ($PI) has drawn attention for its mobile-based “tap-to-mine” model, where users earn tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily. Currently priced at about $0.3577, DeepSeek predicts an extremely bullish scenario of up to $10 per coin by year’s end, a meteoric 28× gain in a matter of months. While such a surge seems improbable given today’s market conditions, the project’s roadmap and technicals signal some small space for hope. Since its launch in February 2025, PI has been highly volatile, including a 171% spike in May. Its current RSI of 49 suggests a fairly valued token with potential for further upward moves. The development team continues to roll out incremental updates, with version 23 and a possible mainnet launch expected soon, which could inject new momentum into the project. Realistically, analysts argue that a retest of February’s $2.99 high would be a strong outcome. Even if the extreme bullish case doesn’t materialize, October is traditionally a bullish month for crypto and we could see the price climb up to its previous resistance level, around $1.25. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Alternative For those seeking speculative opportunities outside DeepSeek’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) positions itself as a risk-heavy alternative to Dogecoin, marketing itself as the degen cousin of crypto’s original original meme coin. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream crypto asset, Maxi Doge is embracing volatility and community-driven culture. The presale has already brought in over $2.3 million within its first month. Built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, MAXI is focused on viral growth via Telegram and Discord engagement, trading competitions, and cross-project partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion tokens, about 25% are reserved for the Maxi Fund to drive marketing and collaborations. Staking is live, with current yields of 141% APY, though these returns are expected to fall as more users participate. The presale price is $0.000258, with the next price increase set in just under 36 hourws. Investors can purchase through the official Maxi Doge site, using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet .

51990298,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425767,1758321000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990298.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy 19 September – XRP, Shiba Inu, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-19-september-xrp-shiba-inu-pepe/,"With the vast number of choices available, deciding which crypto is the best to buy right now is far from straightforward. Lingering concerns around inflation, US policy, and global tensions have kept market growth in check, although Bitcoin managed to hit a new all-time high of $124,128 just last month. Beyond Bitcoin, investor interest remains strong in both leading altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the last year, many tokens have hit new price benchmarks, signaling growing enthusiasm across the crypto sector. This renewed confidence has largely been driven by two pivotal policy changes in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive U.S. regulation focused on stablecoins. Second, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize and clarify securities laws as they apply to digital assets. With sentiment gradually turning positive, it’s worth taking a closer look at how major altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are setting up for potential gains. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Titan is Best Blue Chip Crypto for 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) surged to an all-time high of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40. Since then, XRP has cooled to around $3.03, about 17% below that peak. The token’s main strength lies in its ability to facilitate fast and low-cost international payments, offering a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its standing has been reinforced by endorsements from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even recognition from the White House. Ripple’s influence in policymaking was underscored earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse was invited to a high-profile presidential roundtable on cryptocurrency regulation. XRP’s momentum also received a significant boost in 2023 after a U.S. court ruled that its retail sales did not qualify as securities, effectively closing a five year conflict with the SEC while achieving a pivotal victory for the wider industry. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 418%, compared to Bitcoin’s 88% gain. Following its July rally, the token has managed to hold steady near the $3 mark, despite broader market volatility. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 53 after briefly hitting 59 yesterday. This reflects a brief sharp spike followed by a cooldown. The brief spike may have been the result of the Fed’s interest rate cuts this week and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF, but those headlines have not catalyzed a major XRP gold rush yet. Looking ahead, the SEC is set to decide on a raft of additional spot XRP ETFs in mid-October. That could propel the token above $4 within weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Meme Coin Giant With Expanding Real-World Use Cases Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the second-largest meme coin, commanding a market cap of nearly $7.8 billion. In the past 24 hours, SHIB’s price has dipped 2%, although it retained value better than the collective meme coin sector, which dropped 3%. Given that the wider $4.11 trillion crypto market also dipped 0.4% overnight, SHIB’s resilience, utility, and multibillion dollar market cap means it often has less volatility than a typical meme coin and behaves more like a blue chip crypto. It currently trades around $0.00001321. Technical charts point to further potential upside. Over the past year, SHIB has formed two bullish patterns: a descending wedge from November through March and a flag pattern since mid-May. Breaking through the key resistance at $0.000022 could trigger a run toward $0.00003 by late October. In a broader bull run, analysts see possible targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by the end of the year. Unlike most meme tokens, SHIB has real-world utility, including enhanced privacy tools and Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 network that lowers fees and accelerates transactions. Pepe ($PEPE): Internet Meme Sensation Positioned for Breakout Introduced in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) rapidly climbed into the ranks of top meme coins by market cap, fueled by the popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic frog character. Its meteoric rise inspired numerous copycats, though none have replicated its success. With a market valuation above $4.6 billion, and even a brief feature as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X, PEPE has firmly secured its place as a meme coin heavyweight. Currently priced near $0.00001106, PEPE has grown 15% in the past fortnight, though it still sits 60.5% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 in late 2024. Chart analysts note the development of a falling wedge pattern, a setup often preceding a breakout. With its RSI around 53, PEPE remains in a neutral trading zone, suggesting balanced buy and sell pressure with room for upward movement. The meme coin sector as a whole dipped 3% overnight to a collective market cap of $88.9 billion. While PEPE dipped in line with it, it has gained 4% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Supporters believe favorable macro conditions and rising investor optimism could drive PEPE to fresh highs as the summer unfolds. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2 Makes for One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the most talked-about presales of 2025, aiming to launch the first Bitcoin Layer 2 network that blends viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. Its mission is to enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster transactions, smart contracts, and community-driven decision-making. The presale has already raised around $16.9 million, with analysts projecting potential 10× or higher gains post-launch. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers lightning-fast smart contracts while keeping transaction costs low. One of its standout innovations is the Canonical Bridge, which allows near-instant BTC transfers on its Layer 2 while powering dApps, meme tokens, and payments with minimal fees. A recent Coinsult audit found no security vulnerabilities, adding confidence among investors. The $HYPER token will support multiple roles, including staking, transaction processing, and governance. Early presale participants can earn staking rewards of up to 68% APY while also gaining voting rights on upgrades after the platform’s launch.

Everyday Benefits for Users Trust Wallet framed the update as a way of making every action count. Here’s what that means for users: Lower fees on swaps & buys Gas discounts when paying with TWT Loyalty rewards via Trust Alpha (Launchpool 2.0) Premium support & faster service Voting rights in governance decisions Every swap, buy, and transaction inside Trust Wallet now carries a clear benefit layer powered by TWT. Roadmap: From 2025 Into 2026 The litepaper also lays out a timeline of future rollouts: Q4 2025 → Everyday crypto finance, faster buys, simpler transfers 2026 → Deeper trading, earning, and ecosystem integrations At each stage, TWT is the growth fuel, embedded into every new feature. Market Outlook: More Than a Meme Pump The sharp 60% pump was sparked by CZ’s spotlight, but the fundamentals suggest TWT may be at the start of a structural re-rating. Utility expansion is clear. User base scale is unmatched in the wallet space. Tokenomics reset provides long-term sustainability. With a direct tie between user actions and token value, TWT shifts from being a passive governance coin into an active driver of the Trust Wallet ecosystem. Trust Wallet just reintroduced TWT to the market, this time with clear use cases and ecosystem-wide integration. The timing couldn’t be sharper: the token broke out of a six-month downtrend with CZ’s backing and a roadmap that stretches well into 2026. For users, it means cheaper fees, real rewards, and influence. For TWT, it could mean the start of a new growth cycle. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

51990504,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425803,1758321480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990504.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 19 September – XRP, Solana, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-19-september-xrp-solana-cardano/,"The crypto price prediction for top altcoins like XRP , Solana , and Cardano is turning bullish again, following a short cooldown after the Fed’s 0.25% rate cut . While the total market cap dipped 1% over the past 24 hours and traders locked in profits from this week’s rally, this looks more like a setup for the next leg higher. Bitcoin and Ethereum only dropped 0.5% and 1%, respectively, which are minor moves that suggest consolidation rather than a reversal. With market conditions still favorable and most tokens bouncing from oversold levels, the stage is set for weekend breakouts. XRP, SOL, and ADA are now on many traders’ watchlists, with fresh capital likely to rotate into these names in the coming days. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Set to Surge Amid Ripple Growth and ETF Approvals XRP is trading at $3.01 today after consolidating around this level for several sessions. Even with today’s flat performance, XRP remains up 6.5% in the past 14 days and 420% higher than one year ago — signaling a strong macro uptrend. More importantly, technical indicators suggest that a massive breakout may be brewing . As shown in the chart, XRP is coiling beneath the critical resistance at $3.65 — the same zone that capped gains during August. If bulls manage to reclaim this level and flip it into support, analysts expect a quick surge toward $5 , with $10 as the year-end target if momentum continues. Both the RSI (42.44) and MACD show signs of neutral-to-bullish strength, leaving room for acceleration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s continued expansion across real-world finance, including new partnerships with BBVA and Franklin Templeton , is setting a strong fundamental backdrop. And with the first XRP ETF already approved and more ETF applications pending, institutional demand could explode in Q4. If approvals land and momentum holds, this XRP price prediction remains valid: $5 by October, $10 by December . Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Institutional Demand Will Push Altcoin to New ATHs This Year At $242, Solana is down by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, yet it holds onto an 18% gain in a fortnight and a 33% increase in a month. These are very healthy percentages, and now may still be a good time to buy SOL, before it rallies later in the year. Its momentum has been growing because of the appearance of Solana treasury companies in recent weeks, including the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries , which has been buying over $1 billion in SOL. At the same time, Solana is also waiting on numerous ETF applications, and if the SEC does approve the corresponding funds, then the SOL price is likely to rise strongly. Source: TradingView Its indicators do suggest that the coin should correct a little in near term, and it may experience further losses over the weekend. That said, the medium- and long-term trajectory is clearly positive, and once the aforementioned ETF approvals do arrive, the SOL price could hit new heights. It may reach $ 350 in October, before climbing towards $500+ by the New Year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Network Growth and Grayscale ETF Can Push ADA to New Highs ADA is trading at $0.9045 , up 9% in two weeks and continuing its steady uptrend. While Cardano only has one ETF application on file, it’s from Grayscale, and Bloomberg analysts believe it is highly likely to be approved. The ADA price could therefore receive its own boost in the next few weeks, while it will also benefit from Cardano’s ongoing growth as a layer-one network. It now has a total value locked in of $383 million , making it the 19th-biggest platform in crypto. Its position is likely to increase over time, with the Cardano ecosystem witnessing significant development , and with important upgrades still on the horizon. On the technical side, MACD and RSI both suggest renewed bullish momentum , with the RSI at 55 and climbing, leaving room for significant upside. The chart shows a clean breakout above the descending wedge and a strong support trendline forming. A reclaim of the $1.32 high could trigger a move to $3 , with $5 and $10 the next targets if macro conditions align. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Token Raises $1.3 Million in Presale: Next 100x Coin? As strong as the coins above seem right now, the approach bull rally will also see other tokens perform well, including newer coins. In fact, some of the newest coins may outperform the market average by considerable margins, with presale tokens in particular having the potential to do well. One such token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new Ethereum-based coin that has taken an original approach to staking. All in a hard days work. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/MNflyozHp2 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 18, 2025 It has now raised $1.3 million in its sale, which will run for the next few weeks, before PEPENODE launches and lists on exchanges. PEPENODE’s unique draw is that it’s the market’s first mine-to-earn token, one which offers holders the chance to build virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, holders can boost their staking yields. This dynamic is likely to incentivize greater accumulation of PEPENODE, which in turn should push its price up over time. And when combined with viral Pepe memes, PEPENODE has the ingredients needed to take the market by storm once it lists. Invests can buy it now at the PEPENODE website , where the coin is currently selling for $0.001066. This price will rise repeatedly until the sale ends, so newcomers should move quickly.

SOL Strategies Inc. has secured approval to join the Nasdaq Global Select Market , where it will begin trading on September 9, 2025 under the ticker STKE. By moving onto Nasdaq, the firm expects to tap a broader base of investors, especially institutions seeking direct exposure to companies tied to Solana. The added liquidity is also seen as a major benefit for existing shareholders. Shares will automatically convert from the OTCQB Venture Market, where the company previously traded as CYFRF, while its listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange (HODL) will remain intact. For Solana investors, the move represents a meaningful bridge between blockchain innovation and U.S. capital markets, an alignment that could unlock the next wave of growth. And while Solana builds credibility through institutional channels, cultural tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly gaining momentum on the retail side. CEO on a Year-Long Push Chief executive Leah Wald described the Nasdaq approval as a validation of more than a year’s worth of preparation and persistence. In a social media post, she framed the milestone as proof that both the company and Solana’s ecosystem are gaining recognition among the world’s most prominent technology players. She added that the listing provides the foundation to scale validator growth and strengthen access to U.S. capital markets. One of the company’s top priorities is expanding validator partnerships and staking operations, which are essential for Solana’s performance and security. Analysts note the timing is deliberate. The debut coincides with Solana’s recent Alpenglow upgrade , designed to accelerate throughput and efficiency on the network. With Nasdaq capital behind it, SOL Strategies hopes to play a larger role in ensuring validator infrastructure keeps pace with rising demand. Why Nasdaq Matters for Solana Wall Street’s embrace of a Solana-linked firm is more than a symbolic win. It signals the mainstreaming of Solana’s ecosystem , with new opportunities for institutional money to flow into blockchain-backed businesses. Nasdaq listings carry a reputation for higher regulatory oversight, liquidity, and visibility, all of which can attract funds that were previously cautious about entering the crypto sector. For Solana, this represents a new form of legitimacy. Beyond its technical milestones, it now has a corporate vehicle in one of the world’s most influential financial arenas. As institutional capital hunts for exposure to scalable blockchain platforms, Solana’s Nasdaq presence could ignite fresh momentum in both price action and long-term adoption. While Solana makes inroads on Wall Street, a very different story is unfolding in the presale arena. MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the spotlight with 7,000% growth predictions, making it a standout even among top-tier presales. As institutions pile into Solana, retail traders are rushing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting that smaller caps will deliver the truly life-changing multiples. Unlike countless presales that fade after a brief hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been defined by scarcity-driven demand . Each round has sold out faster than the last, creating a sense of urgency across both whale investors and retail participants. What sets it apart is not just marketing, but an ability to turn cultural branding into measurable momentum. For many observers, the fact that MAGACOIN FINANCE is even being discussed alongside established giants underscores how powerful its narrative has become. Where Solana represents institutional validation, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents speculative ambition—an early-stage opportunity with exponential upside potential. Parallel Stories: Institutions vs. Retail The contrast between Solana’s Nasdaq listing and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale surge highlights the two sides of today’s crypto market. On one hand, institutional adoption is strengthening, with regulatory frameworks, ETFs, and stock listings guiding billions in capital toward large-scale infrastructure plays. On the other, retail investors are chasing asymmetric returns in presales, where small allocations can snowball into transformative gains. Neither path is inherently better, they simply appeal to different strategies. Institutional plays like Solana promise long-term growth and relative stability. Cultural tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE thrive on timing, scarcity, and community energy, delivering risk but also the chance for extraordinary upside. Together, they illustrate why crypto remains one of the most diverse, and unpredictable, asset classes. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out 7,000% ROI forecasts: Analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could rival some of crypto’s most explosive breakouts. Scarcity model: Rapid sellouts across presale rounds amplify urgency and buyer confidence. Retail magnet: Smaller investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as their chance to capture DOGE- or PEPE-style multiples. Cultural branding: Positioning that resonates beyond crypto-native circles ensures broader traction. These elements make MAGACOIN FINANCE more than just another speculative token—it’s becoming a case study in how early momentum and cultural resonance can combine to drive rapid growth. Conclusion Solana’s Nasdaq debut marks a pivotal moment, bringing Wall Street capital and institutional visibility to one of crypto’s fastest networks. It validates years of progress and strengthens the case for Solana as a top-tier ecosystem. Yet, as institutions prepare to stake their claims in SOL infrastructure, retail traders are embracing a very different opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 7,000% growth predictions and scarcity-fueled momentum , is proving to be the cultural wildcard of 2025. For investors, the smartest play may not be choosing one over the other, but recognizing how institutional milestones and presale surges together shape the next bull market.

The latest acquisition brings Bitmine’s holdings to roughly 1.95 million ETH, valued at $8.66 billion, according to Arkham data. Blockchain transaction records show a series of large transfers carried out between Galaxy Digital and Bitmine in recent hours. TOM LEE IS BUYING EVEN MORE $ETH Tom Lee’s Bitmine just bought another $69M of ETH from Galaxy Digital. They now hold $8.66 BILLION of ETH. $BMNR is bullish on $ETH . pic.twitter.com/t9BWh9btPR — Arkham (@arkham) September 19, 2025 The settlements included 3,247 ETH ($14.55 million), 3,258 ETH ($14.6 million), 4,494 ETH ($20.06 million), and 4,428 ETH ($19.77 million), totaling 15,427 ETH, about $69 million, in under an hour. The structured timing suggests coordinated OTC settlements, which allow institutional buyers to accumulate large amounts without disrupting open market prices. Bitmine Crosses 2M ETH, Controls Nearly 2% of Ethereum’s Supply The purchase underlines Bitmine’s aggressive accumulation strategy. Data shows that Ethereum accounts for nearly the entirety of its $8.65 billion portfolio, positioning the firm as the largest corporate ETH treasury holder. Other tokens in its portfolio are negligible by comparison, including minor holdings of MakerDAO’s MKR and a handful of experimental tokens with only a few thousand dollars in value. Bitmine’s latest purchase follows a series of substantial buys over recent weeks. On September 11, the company received 46,255 ETH worth $201 million from a BitGo wallet across three addresses. A week earlier, on September 4, Bitmine acquired 80,325 ETH valued at $358 million from Galaxy Digital and FalconX. These acquisitions have lifted its total stash well above 2 million ETH in circulation, equivalent to about 1.8% of Ethereum’s entire supply. According to treasury reserve data, corporate and institutional entities now collectively hold about 4.99 million ETH worth $22.2 billion, representing 4.13% of the token’s circulating supply. Bitmine leads this group with 2.15 million ETH, valued at $9.59 billion at peak pricing, followed by SharpLink Gaming with 838,000 ETH ($3.74 billion) and The Ether Machine with 495,000 ETH ($2.2 billion). Source: SER The Ethereum Foundation, by comparison, holds about 225,000 ETH, while Coinbase’s treasury sits at 136,800 ETH. The scale of Bitmine’s holdings has drawn comparisons to Strategy’s long-standing bitcoin strategy under Michael Saylor, where large corporate accumulation became a cornerstone narrative for BTC’s institutional adoption. Bitmine appears to be positioning itself as Ethereum’s equivalent, building a multi-billion-dollar ETH balance sheet as a long-term treasury reserve. Ethereum itself has been trading under pressure despite the accumulation. At the time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $4,465, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours and 4.2% over the week. Ethereum Treasury Firms Expand Holdings Amid SPAC Deals and Buybacks The competition among Ethereum treasuries is heating up as corporate strategies evolve under market pressure. On September 17, The Ether Machine, an Ethereum-focused treasury firm, filed a draft registration statement with the SEC to go public via a merger with Nasdaq-listed SPAC Dynamix Corporation. @TheEtherMachine has filed a draft registration statement with the SEC as it moves forward with plans to go public through a merger. #Ethereum #ETH https://t.co/vq7CHuD3Y7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 17, 2025 The deal, first announced in July, is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder approval. The company has built a sizable position of 495,362 ETH after adding 150,000 ETH in August . Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming announced the repurchase of 1 million shares at an average price of $16.67, part of its ongoing buyback program. Since late August, the firm has repurchased nearly 1.94 million shares , citing undervaluation as the driver. SharpLink reported a net asset value of $3.86 billion, or $18.55 per share, and confirmed it carries no outstanding debt. Analysts say Ethereum is emerging as the key beneficiary of the digital asset treasury (DAT) boom. In a report this week, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, argued that ETH-focused treasuries are better positioned than their Bitcoin and Solana counterparts. Standard Chartered said Ethereum has benefited more than Bitcoin or Solana from digital asset treasury buying, citing stronger staking yields. #Ethereum #Bitcoin #treasuries https://t.co/p5yNkvvW87 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana generate staking yield, which supports higher valuations and long-term sustainability. Since June, Ethereum treasuries have accumulated about 3.1% of the token’s circulating supply. With valuations for many DATs under pressure, consolidation is expected, but Ethereum-focused firms appear to be gaining ground.

A staggering 7,441 BTC, valued at approximately $860 million, moved from the popular exchange Coinbase to an entirely new, unknown wallet. This monumental transaction, reported by Whale Alert, immediately captured the attention of investors and market analysts alike. Such large movements often signal important shifts in the market, prompting questions about the motives behind the transfer and its potential impact on Bitcoin’s future. What Exactly Happened in This Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer? On a recent day, a significant amount of Bitcoin left the Coinbase exchange. Specifically, 7,441 BTC was transferred out. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer is notable not just for its size but also for its destination: an entirely new wallet with no known history. This means the funds are no longer on a centralized exchange, moving into a private holding. The Source: Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. The Amount: 7,441 BTC, equivalent to roughly $860 million at the time of the transfer. The Destination: An unknown, newly created wallet address. The Reporter: Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. These movements are crucial because they involve ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Their actions can often influence market sentiment and price dynamics. Why Do These Significant Bitcoin Whale Transfers Grab Attention? When a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer occurs, it naturally sparks curiosity and analysis. The primary reason is the potential market impact. A transfer of this magnitude can be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for Bitcoin’s price and stability. Investors closely monitor these movements for clues about future market direction. For example, if a whale moves BTC to an exchange, it might signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, moving BTC off an exchange to an unknown wallet often suggests long-term holding or an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, which could be seen as a bullish signal. Understanding the Implications of Such a Bitcoin Whale Transfer What does it mean when such a large sum of Bitcoin leaves a major exchange for an unknown destination? There are several possibilities, and understanding them helps in deciphering the potential impact of this Bitcoin whale transfer . Increased Security: Moving funds off an exchange to a private wallet, often referred to as ‘cold storage,’ is a common practice for enhanced security. This protects assets from potential exchange hacks or vulnerabilities. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might be intended for an OTC sale, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without affecting the open market price. This is common for institutional investors. Long-Term Holding: The whale might be consolidating holdings for long-term investment, indicating a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Institutional Accumulation: A large institution or fund could be accumulating Bitcoin quietly, moving it to secure custody. The lack of immediate clarity creates a sense of mystery, but the move itself is a powerful indicator of significant capital at play within the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Waters: What Should Investors Do? For individual investors, news of a Bitcoin whale transfer can be a source of anxiety or excitement. However, it is important to approach such events with a measured perspective. While these transfers can influence short-term market sentiment, they don’t always dictate long-term trends. Here are some actionable insights: Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Conduct Research: Understand the broader market context, not just isolated transactions. Look at overall market sentiment, regulatory news, and fundamental developments. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Short-term whale activity should not derail a well-thought-out strategy. Consider Diversification: A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden market shifts caused by large transactions. Ultimately, these events highlight the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market, underscoring the need for informed decision-making. The recent Bitcoin whale transfer of 7,441 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is a compelling reminder of the significant capital movements that characterize the crypto space. While the exact motives remain shrouded in mystery, such large transactions underscore the growing institutional interest and the ongoing quest for secure asset management. Whether this move signals a major sale, a strategic long-term hold, or an OTC deal, it undoubtedly reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a critical asset in the global financial landscape. As the crypto market continues to evolve, these whale movements will remain a key indicator for those looking to understand the underlying currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. The exact threshold varies, but it generally refers to holders of thousands of BTC. Why do Bitcoin whales move large amounts of BTC? Whales move large amounts of BTC for various reasons, including consolidating holdings, transferring to cold storage for security, facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) trades, rebalancing portfolios, or preparing for a large sale or purchase. Does this specific Bitcoin whale transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? While a single large transaction moving off an exchange usually suggests long-term holding or an OTC deal (which are generally not bearish), the sheer size can still trigger speculation and short-term volatility. The immediate impact is often on market sentiment rather than direct price action unless the funds are moved to an exchange for selling. How can I track Bitcoin whale transfers? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many crypto news outlets and analytics platforms also report on significant whale movements, providing insights into potential market implications. Is it safe for a whale to move such a large amount of Bitcoin? Yes, transferring Bitcoin to a secure, private wallet (cold storage) is often considered safer than keeping it on an exchange, as it reduces exposure to exchange-specific risks like hacks or regulatory freezes. However, the security of the funds then depends entirely on the whale’s private key management. We hope this deep dive into the recent Bitcoin whale transfer has provided valuable insights.

With Bitcoin trading at over $111,000 and Ethereum closer to $4,250, compared with that psychology, putting $100 to work may not seem like too much. However, smart allocation is not the possession of an entire coin; it is positioning early on in assets that have the potential to grow. Whether this be through exchange-traded funds based on the performance of bitcoin or investment into upcoming altcoins, even small amounts can add up to meaningful profits as well. The key lies in not being tempted by chasing after meme tokens and instead looking at things with proven or growing credibility. Alongside Bitcoin and its ETFs, newer players, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are proving that $100 can make a difference in the right hands. Bitcoin: The Foundation Allocation Despite volatility, Bitcoin has been the core of crypto investing. It makes up almost 60% of the total market value and is typically the first asset built up by institutions. Its track record is quite superior: for the last ten years, no other asset has equated its long-term growth. Buying $100 of Bitcoin directly on an exchange might only give you about 0.0009 BTC, but that’s a part of a proven store of value. More importantly, it gives you exposure to what many analysts think could reach $1m within five years. That kind of upside potential makes Bitcoin a logical place to start, regardless of the size of the investment. The Case for Bitcoin ETFs For those investors who are anxious about the idea of exchanges and wallets, Bitcoin ETFs have provided a simple, regulated way to gain market access. Products such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) trade under $100 a share. That means with just one bill, you can buy the exposure to the price performance of Bitcoin; you’re not concerned with private keys and custody. These ETFs track Bitcoin on a 1:1 basis, which means that once Bitcoin is up 100% in the course of a year, your ETF shares will be too. With expense ratios as low as 0.21%, they provide cost-effective and beginner-friendly access that’s easy to scale over time. Managing Allocation With Small Capital A $100 investment might seem insignificant in the scheme of a $10,000 portfolio, but it is a starting investment allocation of 1%. From there, you can scale up or down depending on how comfortable you are. Bitcoin ETFs make things particularly easy, as investors can refine their exposure as they increase their conviction. And while Bitcoin brings stability to the crypto space, there’s still importance in diversification. Smaller tokens and cultural projects provide the sort of upside that might not be present with Bitcoin on its own. That’s where early-stage opportunities enter the conversation. For those looking for asymmetric upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is really emerging as one of the more interesting new allocations. Contrary to speculation, meme coins that disappear after a hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum through scarcity, cultural branding, and community-driven growth. Its early presale rounds have been sold in a short period of time, showing demand far ahead of widespread exchange listings. Analysts cite forecasts of 44x , and this represents a rare opportunity where even a $100 entry turns into thousands if momentum stays on track. For investors who already hold Bitcoin or Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the type of high-risk, high-reward complement that completes a portfolio strategy. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Now Cultural identity: MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a token; it’s building a narrative that resonates far beyond crypto-native circles. Explosive upside: With projections of up to 44× gains, it represents one of the cycle’s strongest opportunities. Community momentum: Its swelling presence on Telegram and X shows conviction that can carry through multiple market phases. These qualities put MAGACOIN FINANCE in a unique position compared to other new tokens. It’s not a replacement for Bitcoin; it’s a speculative complement that could magnify returns for those nimble enough to catch it early. Building Smarter With $100 The smartest move with $100 in crypto isn’t to spread it thin across dozens of low-quality coins, but to create a balance of foundation and opportunity. Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF is the tried and tested anchor. MAGACOIN FINANCE, being one of the newer projects with explosive growth potential, offers the speculative edge. Taken together, they form a dual approach: stability plus upside. Even if you’re investing on a small scale, this approach lets you experience both the predictability and the thrill of crypto investing. Conclusion With prices soaring, $100 may not be a lot in crypto, but used wisely, it can still cause exposure of significance. Bitcoin, either directly or through ETFs, is still the focal asset. Yet, investors seeking tremendous potential are increasingly looking to high-momentum powers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. With scarcity, cultural resonance, and forecasts of up to 44X gains , MAGACOIN FINANCE is the bold allocation that makes even a modest investment count. The wisest action in today’s context is to balance the old and new, to lay the foundation while keeping open the space for explosive growth.

This move would mark a pivotal shift for one of the world’s largest crypto asset managers, bringing billions of dollars worth of ETH into active network participation. In an X post, on-chain analyst CryptoGoos has brought to light a significant development in the institutional crypto space. Grayscale is reportedly preparing to stake its massive Ethereum holdings. Although not yet confirmed, such a move, which was flagged by on-chain data following a transfer of over 40,000 ETH, is a significant signal of Grayscale’s evolving strategy and a potential game-changer for the ETH market. Why The Grayscale Move Could Accelerate Mainstream Adoption According to the data, Grayscale’s alleged transfer of a large sum of ETH is consistent with preparatory steps for staking. The firm, which holds approximately 1.5 million ETH in its various trusts, is now positioning a portion of that vast holding to earn staking rewards. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock If this is indeed the case, it would be a historic moment. Grayscale would become the first US-based ETH ETF sponsor to offer staking in the market, a feature that has been a point of contention with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While reports suggest Grayscale is preparing to stake ETH, market analyst TheKingfisher has issued a significant warning based on the ETH GEX+ chart, which he states is flashing a strong negative signal. This analysis centers on a key options metric known as Gamma Exposure (GEX), an indicator that provides insight into how professional traders, or dealers, are positioned in the market. The dealers are short gamma at the current implied volatility (IV) of 61 and an index price of $4,593. This dynamic is where volatility is likely to be amplified. Instead of a market that moves slowly and predictably, the ETH GEX+ signal suggests that price swings could be sudden and extreme, catching most retail traders off guard with the speed of moves. However, smart money considers the development a rare opportunity to capitalize on aggressive dealer hedging. In the meantime, this environment demands tight risk management. The Gateway To Price Discovery Ethereum price is at a pivotal point, currently consolidating between the $4,000 support level and its previous all-time high. MilkRoadDaily has also revealed that the next crucial step for ETH is a weekly close above its all-time high, which would put the asset into a phase of price discovery, where history shows the biggest moves have happened. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For $10,000: Charts Flash Parabolic Rally Signals Drawing on this historical pattern, MilkRoadDaily suggests that in the previous market cycle, ETH cleared its old highs with a parabolic run, ripping an additional 240%. If this historical pattern were to repeat itself, a similar move from its current position could project a new price target of around $16,500.

51991086,585222,1758322851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51991086.jpeg,Michigan Advances Bill To Build Crypto Reserve – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/michigan-advances-bill-to-build-crypto-reserve-details/,"Michigan lawmakers moved a bill that would let the state hold crypto assets closer to a vote, advancing House Bill 4087 to a second reading in mid-September 2025. According to reports, the proposal would change the Michigan Management and Budget Act to create a strategic crypto reserve under the control of the state treasurer. Michigan Bill Allows Up To 10% Investment The measure would let the state treasurer place up to 10% of certain state funds into qualifying digital currencies. The funds named include the countercyclical budget and the economic stabilization fund. The bill does not list a single currency by name; rather it sets rules that a digital asset must meet to qualify. Those who back the bill say this gives the state a new tool to diversify holdings and hedge inflation risks. NEW: Michigan Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill has progressed for the first time since February. HB 4087 been placed on the House second reading calendar, and referred to the Committee on Govt. Operations. The bill would allow 10% of state funds to be invested. pic.twitter.com/vN7Irm7Fr3 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) September 18, 2025 Security And Custody Rules The text would impose strict custody and security standards before any purchase is made. Reports have disclosed requirements such as exclusive government control of private keys, the use of state-regulated or bank custodians, and the option to invest through registered investment companies or exchange-traded products. The bill also calls for technical safeguards: end-to-end encryption, no access via smartphones, geographically split secure data centers, multiparty sign-offs for transactions, and regular security audits. Supporters Point To Diversification Supporters argue the rules reduce the main risks. They say a careful, limited position could protect the state from dollar weakness while offering upside. Lawmakers who introduced the bill — Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson — first filed it in February 2025, and its movement after roughly seven months of little action surprised some observers. Proponents also note that a few other US states have considered or passed similar measures. Concerns From Critics And Trade Groups Not everyone is sold. The Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council has argued the bill fails to set a market-cap floor, which could allow the state to buy smaller, less liquid tokens that swing wildly in price. Critics worry that even with custody rules, crypto’s sharp ups and downs could leave public dollars exposed. Implementation questions remain too: who will manage key recovery, how audits will be handled, and how losses would be covered in a severe market drop. Political And Practical Risks Reports say the bill now sits with the Committee on Government Operations and could face close scrutiny in committee hearings. If passed, Michigan would join a small group of states that have moved to let public treasurers hold crypto.

With ADA currently priced at around $0.83 , traders are watching closely to see if renewed demand can fuel a breakout similar to its past rallies. Meanwhile, the broader market is eyeing Bitcoin and Ethereum as barometers of sentiment, but rotation flows suggest investors are also looking beyond the majors. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught attention not just for growth potential but also for the credibility that comes with its completed audits, setting it apart in a crowded field of presale tokens. ADA’s Road Toward $2 ADA’s recent uptick is being driven in part by large wallet holders increasing exposure. On-chain trackers show whale addresses accumulating steadily, a pattern that has often preceded bullish moves in previous cycles. If momentum continues, analysts argue that ADA could test $1.20–$1.50 in the near term, with $2 being the bigger psychological target for the community. Cardano’s ongoing development progress also underpins confidence. The network’s Hydra scaling solution is designed to expand throughput, while updates to its governance model make ADA one of the more actively evolving proof-of-stake blockchains. Combined with its strong developer ecosystem, Cardano remains a consistent long-term player. Still, the climb back to $2 will require more than whale accumulation. ADA must break resistance zones and attract new liquidity inflows, which could hinge on broader crypto market conditions. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to strengthen, ADA could benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Security Comes in First Place In contrast to established giants like Cardano, newer projects are under constant scrutiny to prove legitimacy. That’s where this emerging player has carved out an advantage – it has already undergone independent smart contract audits by respected firms before its full public launch. This is not a trivial step. Audits reduce risk of contract flaws, exploits, or rug-pull events, and they provide confidence for cautious investors. In a market where scams and vulnerabilities regularly wipe out millions, the assurance of a third-party check makes a real difference. Compared to ADA, which already enjoys credibility from years of operation, this newcomer demonstrates a proactive stance on transparency. And unlike many presales that delay security reviews until later, this project’s audits were completed early, giving investors a rare blend of growth potential and peace of mind. Market Rotation and Investor Flows Investor behavior often rotates between major caps like BTC and ETH, mid-cap altcoins like ADA, and riskier early-stage tokens. Right now, ADA’s whale accumulation highlights interest in assets with a mix of credibility and potential for price expansion. But presale opportunities are gaining traction too, as investors look to capture exponential returns not available in established coins. That’s why audited presales stand out. By reducing the risk factor, they offer exposure to upside while minimizing one of the biggest deterrents – trust. This has made MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly attractive in recent months, as traders diversify from ADA and other names. For many, the logic is simple: ADA may double, but a presale token with audits and traction could multiply far more if execution is strong. Risks on the Horizon For ADA, the main risks remain its slower development pace and stiff competition from faster, cheaper chains. While Cardano excels in community governance and stability, some traders argue that momentum-driven markets favor networks with more aggressive expansion. Regulatory scrutiny of staking tokens is another factor that could weigh on ADA’s growth in certain regions. For the new project, the risks center around delivery. Audits confirm security but cannot guarantee execution. Investors must watch roadmap milestones, community growth, and liquidity conditions after launch. Still, the presence of completed audits helps position it ahead of peers in terms of credibility. Conclusion Whales are fueling speculation that ADA could revisit $2 in the coming months, supported by development upgrades and a loyal community. But as capital rotates across the market, investors are also eyeing new opportunities. Projects that arrive with the reassurance of independent audits stand out, and that’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is being closely watched. In a cycle where trust and growth potential both matter, this balance could prove decisive in determining which names outperform.

Kraken Just Turned Up with Direct USD to XRP,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-set-for-20-run-kraken-just-turned-up-with-direct-usd-to-xrp/,"Chad Steingraber, a prominent figure in the crypto space, has drawn attention to an important market development involving XRP. In a recent post, he reported that Kraken had introduced direct USD-to-XRP trading and noted an inflow of $8.16 million, sharing graphics that illustrated the movement of funds across major exchanges. Steingraber, who frequently comments on digital asset activity, used the post to emphasize a notable increase in XRP trading volumes, which he believes could swiftly send XRP to $20 price level. Kraken just turned up with DIRECT USD to XRP!! $8.16Million just flooded in… https://t.co/gc9B8H6e0G pic.twitter.com/ZdR2U8oGQW — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) September 18, 2025 Chart Shows Heavy Inflows to Kraken The chart in Steingraber’s post displays a heatmap tracking XRP movement across exchanges. According to the data shown, Kraken recorded a net inflow of $8.16 million in XRP/USD trading, significantly larger than the figures from other exchanges on the chart. Binance followed with $2.02 million, while Coinbase, Bybit, and others saw smaller inflows. This visualization highlights the size of the inflows on Kraken compared with its competitors, and shows the high demand for XRP and Kraken’s direct trading pair. The figures are especially striking because they show direct USD-to-XRP movement on Kraken, an option that not all major exchanges support. By emphasizing the direct USD pair, Steingraber’s post drew attention to increasing liquidity and easier access for traders. Large net inflows on a single exchange can signal strong buying interest , especially when contrasted with lower activity elsewhere. Market Optimism and Price Expectations Alongside the inflow announcement, Steingraber previously expressed his outlook for XRP’s price. He wrote , “When XRP makes its first run to $20 soon, there’s gonna be a lot of hate and anger. Don’t worry, they’re just jealous.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This statement reflects confidence in XRP’s future performance and indicates his belief that the asset could reach a substantially higher price. While price predictions are speculative, Steingraber’s remark captures optimism among XRP supporters at a time of rising volumes. A Positive Signal for XRP Such high-volume inflows, particularly from a direct USD trading pair, can boost liquidity and trading depth. Increased liquidity generally benefits active traders and may reduce slippage on large orders. This environment can also help establish a more robust market for institutional participants who may prefer exchanges with higher liquidity and fiat currency options.

This bullish structure often signals an explosive breakout. Right now, SHIB is pressing against the upper boundary of this wedge. With market sentiment turning favorable and momentum building, a breakout appears imminent. Trading volumes have surged in recent days, consistently holding between $200 million and $300 million — a range that typically accompanies major trend reversals. Combined with this technical retest, SHIB looks poised to push above the $0.00001500 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained in a steady uptrend and currently sits above 50, reinforcing the case for continued strength. A breakout above $0.000017 would likely confirm a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction , unlocking upside targets of $0.000035 and even $0.0001. That would represent a 680% surge for the second-largest meme coin. But while SHIB prepares for liftoff, early investors are turning their attention to Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a high-potential presale that’s already raised $2 million and could leave legacy meme coins in the dust once it hits major exchanges. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): The Meme Coin Going All-In With 1000x Leverage Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that fully embraces the ‘up only’ attitude that typically comes with crypto bull markets. This dog-themed token is what happens when a Shiba Inu takes too many Red Bulls for breakfast and stares for too long at price charts. Through the Maxi Fund, the project will allocate up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds on the most promising tokens. The size of these positions will be boosted by using 1000X leverage to reap the highest returns as the market keeps pumping. To join the $MAXI presale early, simply head to the Maxi Doge official website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto or use a bank card to invest.

This pivotal move, confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, marks a major step for the digital asset custodian. BitGo, a crucial player in securing digital assets for institutions, confidentially submitted its initial public offering (IPO) documents back in July. This development follows a successful August 2023 funding round where the company raised $100 million, achieving a robust valuation of $1.75 billion. For many, this moment highlights the growing maturity of the crypto industry, potentially bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset landscape. What Does the BitGo IPO Mean for the Crypto Ecosystem? An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is when a private company first offers its shares to the public. For BitGo, a company deeply embedded in the digital asset space, pursuing an IPO carries immense significance beyond just raising capital. It’s about legitimizing the crypto industry further in the eyes of mainstream investors and regulators. This move introduces a new level of transparency and scrutiny to a sector often perceived as opaque. Increased Legitimacy: A successful BitGo IPO could enhance the credibility of digital assets by demonstrating that crypto companies can meet stringent public market requirements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Going public means adhering to strict SEC regulations, which can set a precedent for other crypto firms considering similar paths. Mainstream Adoption: Publicly traded crypto companies make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to the digital asset market without directly holding cryptocurrencies. The influx of capital from an IPO can also fuel BitGo’s expansion, allowing it to innovate further in secure digital asset custody and other services. Navigating the Path to a BitGo IPO: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of a BitGo IPO is exciting, the journey to becoming a publicly traded company is complex, especially in the crypto sector. The regulatory environment in the U.S. remains uncertain for digital assets, requiring BitGo to navigate carefully and ensure full compliance with all SEC requirements. This process can be demanding for any company. However, significant opportunities also lie ahead. BitGo’s established position as a leading digital asset custodian gives it a unique advantage. Institutions increasingly seek secure, regulated solutions for holding cryptocurrencies, and BitGo is well-positioned to meet this demand. The IPO could provide the necessary capital to scale its operations, enhance technology, and expand its global reach, solidifying its role as a trusted partner for institutional investors. BitGo’s Journey: From Funding Rounds to an Impending IPO BitGo’s path to this milestone has been marked by strategic growth and substantial investment. The company’s ability to raise $100 million in August 2023, securing a $1.75 billion valuation, underscores investor confidence in its business model and the growing need for robust digital asset infrastructure. This funding round demonstrated the market’s recognition of BitGo’s critical role in providing secure, compliant solutions for institutional clients. BitGo offers a comprehensive suite of services, including: Digital Asset Custody: Securely storing cryptocurrencies for institutions. Trading Solutions: Facilitating institutional-grade crypto trading. Prime Brokerage Services: Offering integrated solutions for large-scale crypto investors. These services are vital for attracting traditional financial players to the digital asset market. The impending BitGo IPO highlights the maturation of the crypto industry, moving beyond speculative trading to embrace fundamental infrastructure and regulatory compliance. In conclusion, BitGo’s submission of its IPO filing to the SEC is a truly landmark event for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a significant stride towards greater institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. As BitGo prepares to make its debut on the public markets, it paves the way for a more integrated and mature financial ecosystem where digital assets play an increasingly vital role. This is not just an IPO; it’s a testament to the enduring potential and evolving legitimacy of the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is BitGo?

With the XRP and Solana ETFs under consideration, the institutions and retail traders alike are preparing for a pivotal moment. The regulators will signal if approval is near or if the delay is still the dominant theme. The outcomes of this will shape the next phase of the momentum. XRP and Solana will join Bitcoin and Ethereum in providing institutional-grade access to all investors around the world if green lights are afforded. If delays continue, frustration may lead to selling of assets across the board in the market with a focus on altcoins. Right now, investors are glued to the regulatory calendar, knowing October can make or break the quarter. At the moment all eyes are on ETFs, but some are starting to bring up MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next altcoin to watch. Solana’s ETF Push and Market Confidence Solana has been recovering after suffering outages and resilience queries over a period of time. The Ethereum network has managed to reestablish itself among the top-performing Layer-1 networks thanks to its renewed stability and regional NFT and gaming ecosystems. A Solana ETF would bring a wave of mainstream adoption for a blockchain that is often praised for its speed and scalability. The institutions are on board, but there are concerning regulatory ambiguities. The issue is whether regulators can be talked into giving the green light for ETF approvals to anything other than Bitcoin and Ethereum so soon. Solana could have its own moment of XRP like surge in October that could either make or break adoption. Recent analysis suggests MAGACOIN FINANCE could skyrocket 45×. It’s being compared with Solana and XRP. The very fact they’re comparing it to institutional favorites is telling a strong narrative that we think this presale could do the impossible. MAGACOIN FINANCE didn’t just rely on hype like other presales but achieved growth thanks to scarcity and quick sellouts in multiple rounds. As allocations continue to be taken up in fast succession, the sense of urgency builds and the signal of real demand emerges. It has a strong brand and cultural positioning that appeals to a more mainstream audience beyond the crypto-native. It’s no longer a question of if MAGACOIN FINANCE will do well but rather how great of a force with continued momentum. Those investors watching on the sideline as the XRP and Solana ETFs attempt to begin trading have a different story to buy into: an early entry, a cultural energy, and the likelihood of exponential returns without worrying about regulatory approval. That story is MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s ETF Battle for Legitimacy Regulatory challenges have made XRP a loser in the battle for market position on more than one occasion. The hope of institutional validation has renewed thanks to the optimism surrounding an ETF. People think that the XRP ETF will bring large amounts of liquidity from the money that it will release. But uncertainty lingers. Recent filings suggest the SEC still cautious, and we won’t have clarity for some time. This puts October into clear view. If approval occurs, true demand will likely be triggered and prevent XRP from making progress. In contrast, if this continues to hesitate, we could see XRP remain stagnant beneath key resistance. Currently, traders view October as an important moment for XRP to prove its legitimacy on Wall Street. The October Trade-Off The crypto market will face tests in October when XRP and Solana ETFs get important decisions. If it is approved, institutional adoption could ramp up. If it is delayed, investors will be upset. In this situation, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a presale token that is being compared to the giants and is currently getting predicted for 45× growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE proves that, for those who don’t want to wait on the regulators’ press release, sometimes the biggest stories are under the radar. As October rolls around, investors must decide: wait for the ETF clock or ride the wave already building in presales. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Explosive projections: Forecasts suggest 45× ROI , putting it in the conversation with some of crypto’s biggest breakouts. Scarcity-driven demand: Every presale round has sold out faster than the last, highlighting urgency and strong appetite. Cultural resonance: MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention as more than just a token, it’s becoming a movement. Comparisons to giants: Being discussed alongside Solana and XRP underscores its growing legitimacy in analyst circles. These factors show why MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out in a crowded field. While XRP and Solana battle regulators for ETF approval, MAGACOIN is accelerating through momentum, branding, and investor conviction. Conclusion In October, important decisions on XRP and Solana ETFs will test the crypto market. If it is approved, institutional adoption could ramp up. If it is delayed, investors will be upset. In this case, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a presale token compared to giants and is now predicted to achieve 45× growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that sometimes the biggest story is the one that most people are ignoring, for those who don’t want to wait on the regulators. With October around the corner, investors will have to choose. Wait for the ETF launch or get on board presales.

As traders look for the best altcoin to buy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its safety-first approach and ongoing audits, making it a standout choice in a shifting market. Bitcoin whales offload billions in September Bitcoin whales have been on a selling spree throughout September, moving billions of dollars’ worth of BTC across exchanges. According to on-chain data, wallets that had been dormant for nearly a decade have suddenly begun transferring large amounts, creating waves across the market. One whale alone sold more than $4 billion worth of Bitcoin for Ethereum last month, and has since resumed selling as Bitcoin touched $116,000 for the first time in weeks. Lookonchain tracked the whale depositing 1,176 BTC (worth $136 million) into trading platforms, which kicked off fresh selling. This activity follows a massive 115,000 BTC sell-off worth $12.7 billion, the largest since mid-2022. Analysts note that these moves have pressured Bitcoin’s price structure in the short term, keeping it below the $116,000 line despite several retests. For traders, the takeaway is clear: whale movements often signal where capital is rotating next — and many are now eyeing altcoins. Ethereum swap highlights sentiment shift The same whale that sold 35,991 BTC for Ethereum earlier this month offers an important clue to market behavior. By rotating out of Bitcoin into ETH, the whale essentially signaled that “smart money” is searching for better opportunities outside BTC. Even though the ETH/BTC ratio remains flat near 0.0401, Ethereum has gained nearly 6% over the past month. This shows that whales are not just reducing exposure to Bitcoin but are also diversifying their holdings. The scale of these swaps matters because it highlights how capital rotation works in crypto cycles. When whales reduce Bitcoin exposure, attention often turns to the best altcoins to buy during a dip, giving smaller projects the chance to shine. Bitcoin price struggles near $116,000 Bitcoin has been flatlining around the $116,000 mark after hitting a local peak above $124,000 in mid-August. It has since dropped around 7%, moving in a tight band between $110,000 and $116,000. This stagnant action comes even as on-chain metrics suggest long-term stability. Analysts point out that despite whale dumping, institutional buyers and ETF inflows are providing balance. Still, traders should be cautious, as heavy whale activity can continue to weigh on price action in the near term. For smaller players, this range-bound movement is frustrating — but it also sets the stage for capital to flow into altcoins that carry strong narratives and trust factors. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on trader radars As Bitcoin whales trigger uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being noticed as one of the best altcoins to buy in this dip. Its focus on safety and security appeals to traders who want stability even in volatile times. Audited for safety — CertiK ongoing, HashEx completed Security-first design with anti-phishing protocols Active community presence driving adoption For traders watching capital rotate out of Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a safer and cheaper way to get exposure to an altcoin backed by transparent practices. Positioning in this market With whales selling billions in Bitcoin, altcoins are set to attract fresh attention. Traders should prepare by diversifying into projects that emphasize security and transparency, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Timing matters, and waiting too long could mean missing the early entry advantage. Visit MAGACOIN FINANCE today to explore before the next move.

51992786,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178434,1758326350,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51992786.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Could Rally 470% as MAGACOIN FINANCE and AVAX Join Analyst Favorites,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-price-prediction-ripple-could-rally-470-as-magacoin-finance-and-avax-join-analyst-favorites/,"XRP is once again stirring excitement, with some analysts suggesting the token could stage a 470% rally if momentum aligns. At around $3.05 , XRP has already attracted billions in whale accumulation and continues to benefit from its role in global payments. Avalanche (AVAX), trading near $37.20 , is also gaining recognition for its rapid throughput and growing ecosystem. But while both XRP and AVAX are respected names with bullish forecasts, many investors are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the project with the ability to outpace them both in raw upside. Why Analysts See a 470% Rally for XRP The optimism around XRP stems from whale accumulation and technical setups. With whales now holding over $2.1 billion worth of tokens, supply on exchanges is tightening. If XRP clears major resistance levels at $3.30–$3.50 , technical targets point toward $15–$16 in the longer term, equating to a potential 470% gain from current levels. Ripple’s progress in the payments sector also underpins this outlook. Partnerships with financial institutions and ongoing regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions are creating a stronger use case. However, XRP’s large market cap means that moves of this size require huge inflows, making rallies slower to materialize than in smaller-cap tokens. AVAX Gains Momentum Avalanche has built a strong reputation as one of the faster and more efficient Layer-1 blockchains. With AVAX priced around $37.20 , it continues to grow in DeFi, GameFi, and enterprise solutions. Its subnets model allows customized blockchains, which has attracted developers and institutions alike. Analysts believe that AVAX could climb toward $70–$100 in the next cycle if adoption accelerates. While that represents a significant gain, it still pales in comparison to what smaller-cap projects can deliver when they gain traction. Like XRP, Avalanche offers a strong foundation but less explosive upside due to its size. Where Bigger Gains Could Be Found This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Unlike XRP or AVAX, which need billions in liquidity to move multiples higher, MAGACOIN is at an early stage with room to grow dramatically. Analysts point to the possibility that MAGACOIN could outpace XRP’s projected 470% and AVAX’s 200% by delivering exponential gains as adoption spreads. The reasoning is simple: XRP and AVAX are established players with slower growth curves, while MAGACOIN has a smaller starting base and a presale community already demonstrating strong momentum. Early-stage entries historically provide the biggest returns, as seen with SHIB or DOGE in prior cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines that early entry point with a clear roadmap and transparent structure, reducing risks often seen in presale tokens. For investors, the choice is not necessarily between XRP, AVAX, and MAGACOIN—it’s about balance. But those chasing outsized multiples know that smaller-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN have the edge when it comes to raw upside potential. Comparing Risk and Reward Both XRP and AVAX remain solid long-term bets. XRP benefits from whale support and real-world adoption in payments, while AVAX has technical strengths and ecosystem growth. Their risks—regulatory hurdles for XRP and competitive pressure for AVAX—are notable but manageable. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s risk comes from being early-stage: execution, roadmap delivery, and market adoption are critical. But the reward side of the equation is significantly larger. While XRP may deliver a 4-5x and AVAX a 2-3x, MAGACOIN is positioned to potentially outpace them many times over if its launch trajectory follows through. Conclusion XRP’s potential 470% rally and AVAX’s growth to higher price targets keep them both strong choices in the current market. Yet, for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as the project with the potential to outpace both . In a market defined by risk and reward, XRP and AVAX offer relative stability, but MAGACOIN could be the one that turns small allocations into life-changing outcomes.

Recently, Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran delivered a significant statement, indicating his expectation for additional Fed rate cuts in the coming months. This news is a crucial development that could reshape market dynamics, influencing everything from lending rates to investment sentiment across various asset classes, including digital currencies. What Do Expected Fed Rate Cuts Mean for the Economy? Governor Miran’s remarks follow a previous move by the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points (bp). His current stance suggests a continued dovish approach, with plans to advocate for swift interest rate cuts among fellow policymakers. But what does this really signify? Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates typically make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can encourage spending and investment, thereby stimulating economic activity. Inflation Management: While rate hikes combat inflation, rate cuts can sometimes risk accelerating it. However, if the Fed believes inflation is under control or economic growth needs a boost, cuts become more appealing. Market Reaction: Financial markets often react positively to expected rate cuts, as they can lead to higher corporate profits and increased liquidity. Why is Miran Pushing for Further Interest Rate Cuts ? The Federal Reserve’s primary mandate involves maintaining maximum employment and stable prices. When economic indicators suggest a slowdown, or when inflation appears to be cooling, the Fed often considers adjusting its monetary policy. Governor Miran’s advocacy for more interest rate cuts likely stems from an assessment that the economy could benefit from further stimulus, or that existing inflationary pressures are sufficiently mitigated. His intention to persuade other policymakers highlights that such decisions are not unilateral. They involve careful consideration and consensus-building among the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who weigh various economic data points and forecasts. How Might These Fed Rate Cuts Impact Your Finances? The prospect of additional Fed rate cuts carries broad implications for everyday finances and investment portfolios. Understanding these potential shifts can help individuals and businesses make informed decisions. Borrowing Costs: Expect to see lower rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit card interest. This could be an opportune time for refinancing or taking on new debt for large purchases. Savings Returns: On the flip side, interest earned on savings accounts, CDs, and money market funds might decrease. Savers might need to explore alternative investment avenues for better returns. Stock Market: Generally, lower rates are favorable for stock markets as they reduce borrowing costs for companies and make equity investments more attractive compared to bonds. Cryptocurrency Market: Lower interest rates can increase liquidity in the broader financial system. This often translates to increased investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, as traditional fixed-income returns diminish. This potential shift underscores a period where vigilance and adaptability will be key for investors, especially those with exposure to volatile assets like digital currencies. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After Expected Fed Rate Cuts ? As Governor Miran pushes for more Fed rate cuts , market participants will be closely watching for subsequent announcements and economic data. Key indicators like inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP growth will continue to influence the Fed’s decisions. The coming months are set to be a dynamic period, where economic policy could significantly shape financial landscapes globally. Staying informed about these developments is crucial. The impact of these decisions can ripple through various sectors, from housing to technology, and certainly into the burgeoning world of digital assets. Prepare for potential shifts and consider how a lower interest rate environment might affect your financial strategies. In conclusion, Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran’s expectation for additional Fed rate cuts signals a potentially transformative period for the economy. His commitment to persuading other policymakers suggests a strong push towards further monetary easing. This bold outlook could provide a much-needed boost to economic activity, while also prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming months will reveal the extent of these changes and their long-term effects. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Fed rate cuts? Fed rate cuts refer to the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. This benchmark interest rate influences other interest rates throughout the economy, making borrowing cheaper and potentially stimulating economic growth. 2. How do interest rate cuts impact inflation? Lowering interest rates can make borrowing and spending more attractive, which can increase demand for goods and services. If demand outpaces supply, it can lead to higher prices, potentially accelerating inflation. However, the Fed considers many factors before making such decisions. 3. What does 25 bp mean? 25 bp stands for 25 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. So, a 25 bp rate cut means the interest rate was lowered by 0.25%. 4. How might Fed rate cuts affect the cryptocurrency market? Lower interest rates can make traditional, safer investments (like bonds) less attractive due to reduced returns. This often encourages investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up demand and prices in the crypto market. 5. Who is Steven Miran?

Way too much.” The post reprises his data-driven commentary from early 2024, when he argued that “#Bitcoin could reach $112K this year driven by ETF inflows, worst-case $55K.” That framework came conspicuously close: Bitcoin went on to register a 2024 high above $108,000, narrowly under his $112,000 projection. Why Bitcoin Price Could Top Above $208,000 The chart Ki published on September 18 visualizes three time series derived from CryptoQuant’s realized-cap methodology: the spot price of BTC (black), a model “ceiling_price” (red) and a model “floor_price” (green). As of 17 September 2025 (UTC), the panel annotated a spot marker at $116,453, a ceiling at $208,310 and a floor at $41,662, with the dashboard showing it was “last run” two hours prior. In other words, the model currently locates Bitcoin well above its inferred floor and still materially below the band it treats as an overvaluation zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds $117,500 On Retail Support While Whales Stay Quiet – Cause For Concern? The implication of Ki’s share is not a guarantee, but a statement that, given prevailing on-chain capital inflows and the realized-cap structure, the market has room—by this metric—to extend toward that $208,000 upper band. Realized cap values the network by summing each coin at the price it last moved on-chain rather than the current market price, a construction that tends to track investor cost basis over time. CryptoQuant’s dashboard projects dynamic “floor” and “ceiling” bands around spots that, historically, have framed multi-year expansions and contractions. Ki’s renewed bullishness ties those bands to what he describes as surging demand pressure visible in settlement flows and ETF-linked capital migration onto the network. The continuity with his February 2024 note is explicit: then he cited exchange-traded product inflows as the dominant driver of an advance toward six figures; now he points to “too much capital inflows onchain” while circulating a model that places the ceiling near $208,000. Related Reading: $1 Million Bitcoin Is Coming: Arthur Hayes Says Fed Just Pulled The Trigger It is noteworthy that Ki is not presenting an open-ended forecast but rather a model snapshot that updates with market structure. The same dashboard that prints a $208,310 ceiling today also marks the risk floor at $41,662, underscoring the spread of outcomes the realized-cap approach contemplates. His track record with the $112,000 “this year” guidance—followed by a print just above $108,000—will inevitably color how traders receive the new post. But the framing remains analytical: a data readout of where Bitcoin sits relative to its realized-value envelope after a year and a half defined by US spot ETF adoption and deepening institutional participation. For now, Ki’s message is simple and blunt—“I’m bullish on Bitcoin”—and anchored in the same on-chain lens he used 10 months ahead of the 2024 peak. Whether the market ultimately approaches the model’s $208,000 ceiling will depend on how those on-chain inflows evolve against macro liquidity, ETF and corporate treasury demand as well as miners’ supply behavior. What his chart makes clear is that, by CryptoQuant’s realized-cap bands, Bitcoin has not yet tested the top of its statistical range in this cycle. At press time, BTC traded at $116,173.

Grayscale has officially submitted a revised S-1 application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to transform its existing closed-end Dogecoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This development could mark a pivotal moment for Dogecoin, potentially opening doors to a wider range of investors. If approved, this Dogecoin ETF is slated to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GDOG, as reported by The Block. This action highlights the growing institutional interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Exactly is a Dogecoin ETF, and Why Does it Matter? An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities. These funds trade on stock exchanges just like regular stocks. A Dogecoin ETF would directly hold Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly buying and storing it themselves. This structure offers several key benefits: Accessibility: It simplifies investing in Dogecoin for traditional investors who might be hesitant about crypto exchanges or digital wallets. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like NYSE Arca provides a familiar and secure environment. Diversification: It allows for easier portfolio diversification within traditional investment accounts. Therefore, a Dogecoin ETF could significantly broaden the investment landscape for this popular meme coin. Grayscale’s Ambitious Journey: Paving the Way for a Dogecoin ETF Grayscale has a long history of pioneering crypto investment products. They are well-known for their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which have provided institutional and accredited investors with access to digital assets for years. Their persistent efforts have often pushed the boundaries of crypto integration into traditional finance. This revised S-1 application for a Dogecoin ETF demonstrates Grayscale’s continued commitment to expanding investment opportunities for a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Their experience in navigating the complex regulatory environment with the SEC positions them as a key player in this ongoing evolution. They are clearly leveraging their expertise to bring more digital assets into the mainstream. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: The SEC’s Stance on a Dogecoin ETF The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically approached cryptocurrency ETFs with caution, primarily due to concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a significant shift in their stance. The SEC will thoroughly review Grayscale’s application, considering factors such as market surveillance, liquidity, and the underlying asset’s resilience. Approving a Dogecoin ETF would signal a further maturation of the crypto market in the eyes of regulators. The outcome will depend on Grayscale’s ability to address these regulatory concerns effectively. Potential Impact: How Could a Dogecoin ETF Reshape DOGE’s Future? If the Dogecoin ETF receives approval, its impact on DOGE could be substantial. Such a product could: Increase Liquidity: Attract more capital, leading to higher trading volumes and potentially more stable prices. Boost Legitimacy: Elevate Dogecoin’s status from a ‘meme coin’ to a more credible, institutional-grade asset. Attract New Investors: Open the floodgates for traditional investors and institutions who prefer regulated investment vehicles. Moreover, the approval could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs, signaling a broader acceptance of diverse digital assets in the financial world. This would be a significant step for the entire crypto ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What Are the Next Steps for the Dogecoin ETF? The submission of a revised S-1 application is an important step, but it is part of a longer process. The SEC will now review the updated filing, which typically involves periods of public comment and further deliberation. There is no fixed timeline for approval, and the process can often extend over several months. Market participants will be closely watching for any announcements from the SEC. The potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF could undoubtedly spark considerable excitement and investment activity around DOGE. Conversely, a rejection could lead to temporary price volatility. Investors should stay informed about these regulatory developments. In conclusion, Grayscale’s revised application for a Dogecoin ETF represents a monumental effort to integrate Dogecoin further into the mainstream financial system. While the path to approval involves navigating complex regulatory hurdles, the potential benefits for Dogecoin’s liquidity, legitimacy, and investor accessibility are immense. This move underscores the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market and its increasing convergence with traditional finance. The crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, which could profoundly shape the future trajectory of Dogecoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Dogecoin ETF?

NYSE Arca has taken a bold step, submitting a revised proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply recently relaxed ETF listing standards to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF , including its Mini version. This move could fundamentally reshape how investors access Ethereum through traditional financial markets. What’s Driving the Push for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? This pivotal action by NYSE Arca follows a crucial prior approval by the SEC. The regulatory body recently greenlit a rule change that automatically streamlines ETF listings for cryptocurrencies. Specifically, this applies to those digital assets that have traded as futures for over six months on a derivatives exchange licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This means such cryptocurrencies no longer require a separate, often lengthy, review process for their ETF applications. For the first time, this new, more efficient pathway is being directly applied to the eagerly anticipated Grayscale Ethereum ETFs . Unpacking the SEC’s Relaxed Rules: A Game Changer for Ethereum? The SEC’s decision to relax its ETF listing standards marks a significant shift in its approach to cryptocurrency-backed financial products. Previously, each ETF application underwent an extensive, individual review. This often led to delays and uncertainty for issuers. Now, the automatic greenlight for certain futures-backed cryptocurrencies removes a major hurdle. This change acknowledges the maturity and regulatory oversight already present in the CFTC-licensed futures markets. For Grayscale Ethereum ETFs , this could mean a much quicker journey to market, opening up new avenues for investors. This development is particularly exciting because it signifies a growing acceptance of crypto assets within traditional finance, albeit under specific conditions. It reflects a maturing regulatory landscape that seeks to balance innovation with investor protection. What Benefits Could Grayscale Ethereum ETFs Bring to Investors? The potential approval of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs under these new rules could unlock several key advantages for investors: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors, who might be hesitant to directly buy and store Ethereum, could gain exposure through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle like an ETF. Institutional Adoption: The streamlined process may encourage more institutional investors to allocate capital to Ethereum, potentially boosting its market stability and liquidity. Enhanced Market Transparency: ETFs trade on regulated exchanges, offering a layer of transparency and oversight that can build investor confidence. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Ethereum exposure through an ETF could offer new diversification opportunities for a balanced investment portfolio. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? While the relaxed rules offer a promising path, the journey for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs is not entirely without potential challenges. The SEC, despite its new framework, still maintains a level of discretion in its approval process. Here are some points to consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: Even with a more automatic process, the SEC will likely continue to scrutinize the underlying markets and the structure of the ETFs to ensure investor protection. Market Volatility: Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. This inherent characteristic will remain a consideration for both regulators and potential investors. Ongoing Dialogue: Issuers like Grayscale will need to maintain a constructive dialogue with regulators, addressing any concerns that may arise during the final stages of approval. This revised proposal is a testament to the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. It highlights a proactive approach by market participants like NYSE Arca to adapt to and leverage new regulatory frameworks, ultimately benefiting investors and the broader digital asset ecosystem. The move by NYSE Arca to apply these relaxed listing standards to Grayscale Ethereum ETFs is a landmark event. It signals a growing maturity in the crypto market and a willingness from traditional financial institutions to embrace digital assets. While final approval is still pending, this development undoubtedly brings us closer to a future where Ethereum is more seamlessly integrated into mainstream investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of NYSE Arca’s revised proposal for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? A1: NYSE Arca is proposing to use recently relaxed SEC rules that streamline ETF listings for cryptocurrencies with established futures markets. This could significantly expedite the approval process for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs , making them available to investors sooner. Q2: How do the SEC’s relaxed ETF listing standards work? A2: The new rule allows for automatic approval of ETFs for cryptocurrencies that have traded as futures for over six months on a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange, bypassing a lengthy individual review. Q3: What are the potential benefits of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs for investors? A3: They could offer easier access to Ethereum for traditional investors, attract more institutional capital, provide enhanced market transparency, and offer new opportunities for portfolio diversification. Q4: Are Grayscale Ethereum ETFs guaranteed to be approved now? A4: While the relaxed rules provide a more direct pathway, final approval still rests with the SEC. The proposal is a significant step, but it is not an automatic guarantee of immediate listing. Q5: What is the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and its Mini version? A5: These are proposed exchange-traded funds from Grayscale designed to hold Ethereum, offering investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning it. The Mini version is typically designed for lower expense ratios or different market segments. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Understanding market sentiment is absolutely crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes into play. This powerful tool offers a fascinating snapshot of investor psychology, helping us gauge whether the market is leaning towards panic or euphoria. Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dipped slightly to 48, settling firmly in the neutral zone. But what does this mean for you and your crypto journey? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts like a psychological barometer for the cryptocurrency market. Developed by Alternative.me, it distills complex market dynamics into a single, easy-to-understand number. Its primary goal is to illustrate whether market participants are feeling overly fearful or excessively greedy. This index operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are panicking, often seen as a potential buying opportunity by contrarians. 25-49: Fear – General anxiety and uncertainty in the market. 50-74: Greed – Investors are getting excited and eager, sometimes leading to irrational exuberance. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is overheating, often a signal for potential corrections. Currently, with the index at 48, we find ourselves in a neutral position. This suggests a balance between fear and greed, indicating that the market isn’t showing strong directional sentiment from the crowd. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Unveiling the Metrics It’s important to understand that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation based on several key factors. Each component contributes to the final score, offering a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of what goes into it: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. High volatility often signals a fearful market. Trading Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a negative market can indicate strong selling pressure, while high volumes during price surges can show strong buying interest. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzing sentiment around crypto-related hashtags and discussions on platforms like Twitter provides insights into public mood. Surveys (15%): While paused at times, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be flocking to Bitcoin as a perceived safe haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto bubble’ can reveal underlying fear or greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a holistic and dynamic representation of the market’s mood, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a powerful tool. Navigating Neutrality: What Does 48 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signify? A reading of 48, squarely in the neutral zone, presents an interesting scenario. It means that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market narrative. Instead, there’s a delicate balance. This can be interpreted in several ways: Uncertainty: Investors might be hesitant, waiting for clearer signals before committing to major moves. Consolidation: Prices might be moving sideways, as buyers and sellers reach a temporary equilibrium. Precursor to a Move: Neutrality can often precede a significant market movement, either upwards or downwards, as the market gathers momentum for its next trend. For traders, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests a time for caution and observation. It’s less about making impulsive decisions and more about preparing for potential shifts. This is when careful analysis of other indicators becomes even more vital. Actionable Insights for Traders: Leveraging the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct buy or sell signal, it is an invaluable tool when integrated into a broader trading strategy. Think of it as an emotional compass for the market. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Trading Opportunities: Some traders use extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity (when others are fearful, be greedy) and extreme greed as a potential selling opportunity (when others are greedy, be fearful). Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your existing technical or fundamental analysis. If your charts suggest a breakout and the index is showing increasing greed, it might add conviction. Risk Management: During periods of extreme greed, it might be wise to take some profits or tighten stop-losses. Conversely, extreme fear could signal a good time to accumulate positions gradually. Understanding Market Psychology: The index helps you understand the collective mindset, preventing you from getting swept up in herd mentality. Always remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used in conjunction with other research and not as a standalone indicator. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48, resting in the neutral zone, offers a fascinating glimpse into the current state of crypto investor sentiment. It highlights a period of balance, perhaps even anticipation, rather than strong directional conviction. For any cryptocurrency enthusiast or trader, understanding and effectively utilizing this index can be a powerful addition to their toolkit, helping them navigate the complex emotional landscape of digital assets. Stay informed, stay analytical, and always trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from extreme fear to extreme greed, on a scale of 0 to 100. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment based on the latest data points. What does a ‘neutral’ reading like 48 mean for the market? A neutral reading suggests a balance between buying and selling pressures, indicating market uncertainty, consolidation, or a period of calm before a potential significant move. It’s not strongly bullish or bearish. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict price movements? While it reflects market psychology, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct price predictor. It’s best used as a sentiment indicator to complement other technical and fundamental analysis, rather than as a standalone trading signal. Are there other sentiment indicators similar to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Yes, there are other sentiment indicators such as social media sentiment analysis tools, on-chain analytics focusing on investor behavior, and funding rates in perpetual futures markets, all of which provide different angles on market mood.

Under the notice, the Treasury said that although advance notice of proposed rulemaking was not normally necessary for implementing a law, it seeks public comment to refine and broaden its regulatory framework. The Treasury began a comment period in August and has set an Oct. 17 deadline for the public to provide input about any concerns or feedback it may have regarding possible illicit activity. The recent notice provides a 31-day window for feedback. “Treasury welcomes comments and views from a wide range of stakeholders on the [advance notice of proposed rulemaking],” the statement reads. The GENIUS Act was one of three cryptocurrency-related bills the House of Representatives advanced in July during Republicans’ “Crypto Week.” President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 18, joined by executives from major crypto firms including Gemini, Coinbase, Circle, and Kraken. Designed to regulate payment stablecoins in the US, the law is set to take effect either 18 months after enactment or 120 days following the release of final regulations from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve—placing implementation no earlier than late 2026. Congress advances market structure bill amid growing crypto oversight Meanwhile, i n one of its first legislative steps on crypto bills since passing the GENIUS Act in June, the US Senate is expected to vote on a digital asset market structure framework this month. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading American attorney and member of the Republican Party , has been pushing for market structure. She says the committee is expected to vote on the bill by the end of September, potentially being signed into law by 2026 . The market structure bill, tentatively titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, hopes to clarify US financial agencies’ roles in overseeing and enforcing digital asset laws.. Members of Congress, including Lummis, met with executives from crypto companies in three separate roundtable discussions this week to consider the market structure and Bitcoin BTC reserve bills. Kraken and Circle partnership expands stablecoin access and utility On related developments, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken recently partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to broaden access to and the utility of Circle’s USDC and EURC tokens. The collaboration will integrate Circle’s dollar- and euro-pegged stablecoins into Kraken’s platform, giving clients expanded ways to use USDC across existing applications and introducing support for EURC. “Stablecoins are the financial layer most aligned with crypto’s original architecture — permissionless, programmable, and global by default,” said Mark Greenberg, global head of Kraken’s consumer business. “Expanding support for Circle’s products isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about embedding new opportunities to benefit from Circle’s stablecoins into products our clients already use and trust.” Circle echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the role of stablecoins in shaping digital finance. “We’re focused on building the world’s largest, most widely used stablecoin network, and partnering with leading platforms like Kraken to drive new opportunities for onchain finance,” said Kash Razzaghi, Circle’s chief commercial officer. The companies said the partnership supports the “responsible growth of stablecoins” as a core component of the evolving online financial system.

What is a Leveraged DOGE ETF and Why Now? This isn’t just any ordinary investment product. A leveraged DOGE ETF is designed to provide magnified returns, aiming for 1.5 times the daily performance of its underlying Dogecoin ETF (DOJE). Decrypt recently reported on REX-Osprey’s ambitious application, highlighting the firm’s proactive approach in the crypto market. This filing comes on the heels of the impressive debut of their original DOJE ETF. The initial ETF recorded a remarkable $17 million in trading volume on its first day of listing on September 18th. This strong initial performance clearly signals a robust investor appetite for Dogecoin-related financial products. REX-Osprey’s decision to introduce a leveraged version underscores their confidence in this market demand. Consequently, it also reflects a growing sophistication within the crypto investment space, as firms explore more advanced instruments to cater to diverse investor strategies. Unpacking the Potential: Benefits of a Leveraged DOGE ETF For savvy investors and traders, a leveraged DOGE ETF offers several compelling benefits. The primary advantage is the potential for amplified gains. For instance, if Dogecoin’s price rises by 10% in a day, a 1.5x leveraged ETF theoretically aims to deliver a 15% return before fees and expenses. This product could particularly appeal to traders looking to capitalize on short-term price movements without the complexities of directly holding Dogecoin. It provides a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, making it easier for a broader range of investors to participate. Moreover, investing in such an ETF eliminates many common hurdles associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership, such as managing crypto wallets, dealing with various exchanges, and addressing security concerns. This enhanced accessibility can significantly lower the barrier to entry for many traditional finance participants. Navigating the Risks: What Investors Need to Know About This Leveraged DOGE ETF However, it is crucial to understand that leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify gains, it also amplifies losses. Therefore, a 10% drop in Dogecoin’s price could potentially lead to a 15% loss in the value of the leveraged DOGE ETF , before considering fees and rebalancing effects. These products are typically designed for short-term trading strategies and are generally not suitable for long-term holding. Daily rebalancing mechanisms, which are inherent to leveraged ETFs, can lead to performance decay over extended periods, especially in volatile markets. Investors must exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before committing capital. Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, a leveraged product becomes particularly high-risk. Understanding your personal risk tolerance and investment objectives is paramount before considering an investment in such a complex and potentially volatile instrument. The Regulatory Hurdle: SEC’s Stance on Leveraged DOGE ETF Approval The application for this leveraged DOGE ETF now rests with the U.S. SEC. Historically, the SEC has maintained a cautious stance on approving leveraged and inverse crypto products. Their primary concerns often revolve around potential market manipulation, extreme volatility, and ensuring robust investor protection measures are in place. The SEC’s decision on this filing will be a significant indicator of the regulatory body’s evolving perspective on complex crypto derivatives. The approval process for such novel financial instruments is often lengthy and subject to stringent review and public commentary periods. Nonetheless, REX-Osprey’s filing demonstrates continued institutional interest and confidence in bringing innovative crypto investment vehicles to market. This persistent effort actively pushes the boundaries of traditional finance and its intersection with digital assets. REX-Osprey’s pursuit of a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. While it offers an exciting opportunity for amplified returns and broader market access, it also comes with inherent risks that demand careful consideration and a clear understanding of market dynamics. As the SEC reviews this application, the entire industry watches closely, anticipating what this could mean for the future of crypto-backed financial products. This innovative step highlights the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios, paving the way for more sophisticated financial instruments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a leveraged ETF? A leveraged ETF is an exchange-traded fund that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index or asset. For example, a 1.5x leveraged ETF aims to return 1.5 times the daily performance of its benchmark. 2. How is a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF different from simply buying Dogecoin? Directly buying Dogecoin means your gains or losses mirror its price movement one-to-one. A 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF aims to amplify those daily movements by 1.5 times, meaning larger potential gains but also larger potential losses. It also offers exposure through a traditional brokerage account, bypassing direct crypto ownership. 3. Who is REX-Osprey? REX-Osprey is an asset management firm that focuses on providing innovative investment products, particularly in the cryptocurrency space. They are the firm behind the original DOGE ETF (DOJE) and are now seeking to launch a leveraged version. 4. What are the main risks of investing in a leveraged DOGE ETF? The primary risks include amplified losses (you can lose more than your initial investment faster), performance decay over longer periods due to daily rebalancing, and the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. These products are generally considered high-risk and are best suited for short-term, active trading. 5. Has the SEC approved other leveraged crypto ETFs? As of now, the SEC has generally been hesitant to approve leveraged or inverse cryptocurrency ETFs due to concerns about market volatility, manipulation, and investor protection. This application for a leveraged DOGE ETF is significant because it represents a continued push by firms to bring such products to market.

51993527,585052,1758328225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51993527.jpeg,Police Confirms Largest Crypto Seizure In Canadian History,https://bitcoinist.com/police-largest-crypto-seizure-canadian-history/,"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has confirmed a record-breaking seizure of cryptocurrency linked to the centralized exchange TradeOgre, taking control of assets worth more than 56 million Canadian dollars—about 40 million US dollars—following a federal policing investigation in Quebec. The agency described the operation as “the largest cryptocurrency seizure in Canadian history,” and said it dismantled the platform’s Canadian infrastructure. The news was announced on September 18 from Montréal. Canadian Police Confirms $40 Million Crypto Seizure According to details released by Canadian media quoting the RCMP, investigators seized servers in Beauharnois in the Montérégie region, which supported TradeOgre’s operations. RCMP Sgt. Mathieu Lagarde said: “The servers that allowed this platform to conduct these transactions were located in Canada. So we seized these servers and then seized the crypto assets controlled by the exchange.” Authorities added that this marks the first time a cryptocurrency exchange has been dismantled by police in Canada. The yearlong probe was run by the RCMP Federal Policing – Eastern Region’s Money Laundering Investigative Team and began in June 2024 after a tip from Europol, according to the accounts of the investigation provided by authorities and reported by national outlets. The RCMP alleges TradeOgre failed to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business and did not identify its customers, conditions that investigators say allowed criminal organizations to conceal the origins of funds. Open-source blockchain intelligence platform Arkham said its tooling was used in the case. In a public post, Arkham wrote that “as per the RCMP’s website, Arkham was used as part of the investigation,” and in a research note the firm documented earlier on-chain indicators—specifically messages embedded in Bitcoin transactions —signaling that Canadian police had claimed ownership of funds. Arkham’s report also noted TradeOgre’s social and site activity had gone dark earlier this summer (X account inactive since May; website offline since July 30). The RCMP said it is now analyzing transaction data from the platform and that enforcement actions may follow: “The transaction data obtained from the platform will be analyzed and charges may follow. The investigation is ongoing.” Authorities emphasized that no arrests had been announced as of the release and encouraged anyone with relevant information to contact investigators. While the RCMP’s statement framed TradeOgre as an unregistered venue used to launder proceeds of crime, the seizure has already prompted a broader debate among some users who claim legitimate balances were swept up with illicit funds. What is clear, however, is that Canadian law enforcement has established a new high-water mark for domestic crypto enforcement and, for the first time, has taken down the Canadian infrastructure of a cryptocurrency exchange as part of a money-laundering investigation. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $4 trillion.",Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|crypto news|Crypto News Canada|RCMP|TradeOgre,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ARKM|EXCHANGE|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 00:30:25

FTX, once a leading cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, imploded in November 2022 amid revelations of multi-billion-dollar fraud. Concerning the third round of payment mode, creditors in groups of four will secure their share of the funds at the end of this month, with a distribution rate ranging from 78% to 120%. According to a press release from the Trust, which manages the assets and claims linked to FTX’s bankruptcy, this distribution rate is the percentage of their FTX holdings worth when the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Additionally, it marks the third phase of FTX’s recovery plan, which will take place via the crypto exchanges Bitgo and Kraken, along with Payoneer, a financial services company. This is not the first time the FTX Recovery Trust has made the distribution plan public. In 2024, the legal entity had initially shared it. FTX collapse was due to mismanagement of funds Under FTX’s operation, its users were allowed to purchase, sell, and make speculations about the future prices of widely adopted cryptocurrencies and tokens. This greatly attracted customers and increased the exchange’s user base . However, its CEO, Bankman-Fried, alongside his senior partners, used customers’ funds invested in the exchange to cover high-risk investments that Alameda Research, a hedge fund connected to the company, made without their consent. Consequently, this mismanagement of customers’ funds resulted in FTX’s bankruptcy, with billions of investor funds missing. To track down the missing funds, John J. Ray III, an American attorney and CEO specializing in recovering funds from failed corporations, was assigned to get them back. While working on this, the American attorney pointed out that the exchange’s bankruptcy was greater than that of Enron, an energy firm, in the early 2000s. FTX’s CEO was arrested with fraud charges Following his actions, Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and later charged with defrauding clients. When the charges were presented in court, he was legally jailed. This was made possible because prominent figures from Bankman-Fried’s close team decided to testify against him during the trial. Interestingly, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, who used to lead engineering at FTX, acknowledged that they committed crimes because Bankman-Fried had commanded them to do so. After the verdict was announced, a Lawyer and former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York weighed in on the situation. He commented that Sam Bankman-Fried’s financial fraud was one of the largest in the history of America. According to him, the CEO carried out this multi-million dollar scheme to position himself as the ruler of crypto. Meanwhile, to serve as a warning to any individual with intentions similar to those of Bankman-Fried, the relevant authorities sentenced the CEO to serve 25 years in prison in Southern California for fraud and other offenses. On related developments, Bankman-Fried’s dormant X account suddenly became active this week, mass-following other profiles after months of silence. The unexpected activity sparked speculation and fueled a rally in the FTT token, which briefly climbed above $1. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the renewed activity raised questions about whether the former FTX founder, currently serving time in prison, somehow signals continued interest in crypto, or even hints at an early release. However, there has been no official word regarding his release, and the FTX bankruptcy process is still moving forward, with the next creditor distribution scheduled for September 30. On-chain data suggests Bankman-Fried has little to no funds left for trading, with one of his meme wallets now holding just 0.67 SOL. Meanwhile, wallets associated with Alameda Research continue to receive allocations of SOL from earlier distributions, but those funds are being directed toward bankruptcy settlements rather than trading.

This new investment vehicle isn’t just another fund; it represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption in traditional finance. What is the Grayscale GDLC ETF and Why is it Important? Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), now converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), offers investors exposure to a basket of major cryptocurrencies. Unlike single-asset ETFs, the Grayscale GDLC ETF provides diversification across several prominent digital assets, aiming to mirror the performance of the broader crypto market. Its recent launch follows a crucial approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This regulatory nod is a testament to the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within established financial frameworks. It opens doors for a wider range of investors, including institutions, to access the crypto market through a regulated and familiar investment product. A Strong Start: Decoding the $22 Million Volume for Grayscale GDLC ETF On its very first day of trading, the Grayscale GDLC ETF recorded an impressive $22 million in volume. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that this figure is notably higher than the typical debut for an ETF. What does this strong initial performance tell us? High Investor Interest: The substantial volume indicates significant pent-up demand for a diversified, regulated crypto investment product. Market Confidence: It suggests growing confidence among investors regarding the stability and potential of large-cap cryptocurrencies. Institutional Engagement: While not exclusively institutional, such volumes often reflect participation from larger investment firms seeking compliant ways to enter the crypto space. This early success underscores a pivotal shift. Investors are increasingly looking for accessible and secure avenues to participate in the digital asset economy. Benefits and Challenges of Investing in the Grayscale GDLC ETF The introduction of the Grayscale GDLC ETF brings several advantages, but also highlights ongoing considerations in the crypto investment landscape. Key Benefits for Investors: Diversification: Investors gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of major cryptocurrencies without needing to manage individual assets. Accessibility: It allows investors to buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying the investment process. Regulatory Oversight: As an SEC-approved ETF, it operates under stringent regulatory guidelines, offering a layer of protection and transparency. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer good liquidity, allowing for easy entry and exit from positions. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While diversified, the underlying assets are still subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Fees: Like all ETFs, there are management fees associated with holding the fund. Limited Scope: The fund focuses on large-cap cryptocurrencies, meaning investors seeking exposure to smaller, emerging altcoins might need to look elsewhere. Understanding these aspects is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The Grayscale GDLC ETF offers a robust entry point for many, yet it’s important to align it with individual risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and Grayscale’s Pivotal Role? The successful launch of the Grayscale GDLC ETF is more than just an individual product’s triumph; it’s a significant indicator for the broader crypto ETF market. It demonstrates a clear appetite from investors and potentially paves the way for further approvals of similar diversified or single-asset crypto ETFs. Grayscale has been a pioneer in bringing crypto investment products to traditional markets. Their persistent efforts in navigating regulatory landscapes have been instrumental in bridging the gap between digital assets and mainstream finance. This latest conversion and strong debut solidify their position as a key player in shaping the future of crypto investment vehicles. The trend suggests a future where investing in cryptocurrencies becomes as straightforward and accessible as investing in stocks or bonds. This evolution could significantly accelerate institutional adoption and bring greater stability and maturity to the crypto market as a whole. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Digital Asset Investing The debut of the Grayscale GDLC ETF marks a momentous occasion for the cryptocurrency investment landscape. Its impressive trading volume on day one signals robust investor confidence and a growing demand for regulated, diversified crypto exposure. This development not only provides a new, accessible pathway for investors but also reinforces the increasing legitimization of digital assets within the traditional financial system. As Grayscale continues to innovate and regulatory bodies adapt, we can anticipate further integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios. This ETF is a clear indicator that the digital asset revolution is not just ongoing, but accelerating, offering unprecedented opportunities for growth and diversification.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7572 Market cap $802.01M Trading volume (24-hour) $37.98M Circulating supply 1.059B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8253 24-hour low $0.7527 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.43% 50-day SMA $0.7809 14-Day RSI 55.98 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.6950 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos faces rejection at $0.80 and is now stabilizing near $0.755. XTZ’s daily support sits at $0.744. Short-term momentum leans bearish unless. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The 1-day price chart as of September 20 shows Tezos trading at $0.755, slightly under pressure after failing to hold the $0.80 resistance. The Bollinger Bands show price hovering just above the mid-band at $0.744, suggesting support is still intact, though the upper band at $0.804 continues to act as a ceiling. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Volume has picked up, showing stronger participation, but the latest red candle hints at short-term sellers stepping in. The MACD is flattening near the zero line, with a weak bullish cross but limited momentum, signaling indecision. If the $0.744 support is broken, Tezos (XTZ) could move downside toward $0.685. On the other hand, a sustained recovery above $0.80 would revive bullish momentum. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, the trend looks weaker. The price is consolidating just under $0.755 after consecutive red candles, with the Alligator lines showing a bearish alignment as the moving averages tilt downward. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The BoP remains negative at -0.12, highlighting selling pressure. The MACD is also trending below the signal line, confirming bearish momentum on intraday levels. Unless buyers reclaim $0.77–$0.78, the path of least resistance remains slightly downward, with $0.74 acting as near-term support. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7702 SELL SMA 5 $0.7814 SELL SMA 10 $0.7884 SELL SMA 21 $0.7545 BUY SMA 50 $0.7809 SELL SMA 100 $0.7153 BUY SMA 200 $0.6950 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7449 BUY EMA 5 $0.7461 BUY EMA 10 $0.7618 SELL EMA 21 $0.7846 SELL EMA 50 $0.7748 SELL EMA 100 $0.7387 BUY EMA 200 $0.7447 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos looks neutral-to-bearish in the short term. If the coin manages to hold above $0.744 support, the current setup remains. A failure to break past immediate resistance at $0.77 could result in further price drops toward $0.72–$0.68. A breakout above $0.80 would flip the momentum back to bullish. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

But while ETH’s overall direction remains strong, the real breakout coin could possibly be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Sold at lows of $0.035 today, MUTM waits for a potential 43x price pump, thanks to its borrowing- and lending-clad utility-based DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is offering investors the type of ground-floor potential ETH investors can’t ever see again. While capital seeks the next big performer, Mutuum Finance is rapidly becoming the coin to watch. Ethereum Sees $7,000-$10,000 On Building Signs Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $4,513.78, intraday ranging between $4,429.39 and $4,535.33. Momentum indicators are indicating steady firming up, volume has constricted, and support at $4,400-$4,500 is thought to be in place. For ETH to cross $7,000 or even $10,000 in subsequent cycles, it would ideally require positive macroeconomic contexts, continuous growth in DeFi adoption, and effective use of scaling solutions. Whereas ETH is the incumbent with a de facto place at the smart contract layer and less of a spec play than the majority of altcoins, investors believe Mutuum Finance has the potential to offer returns higher than ETH’s in 2025. MUTM Presale Momentum and FOMO Mutuum Finance offers investors the opportunity to be some of the project’s pioneers and invest in tokens at much less than they will be after launch. Available for sale at $0.035 per MUTM in presale Phase 6, the token will be priced at $0.04 in Phase 7. The presale has been successful, with over $16 million raised and over 16,400 token holders, which indicates positive sentiment among investors and trust in the market. To add a layer of protection for security, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK that guarantees rewards of up to $50,000 USDT. Openly available, the program welcomes white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to scan the codebase for any possible weaknesses. Rewards are tiered according to severity level to ensure even low-severity bugs get fixed before release. The program is merely one example of Mutuum’s commitment to safety, transparency, and investor confidence. MUTM is a two-layer hybrid lending protocol, offering Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, to enable maximum flexibility. The P2C system is applied to cause the contracts to constantly monitor the market so that interest rates can be determined. It is designed such that investors shall receive passive income and lenders shall lend at minimal interest rates, and the contracts will automatically execute the transactions. The P2P model facilitates immediate real-time communication between borrowers and lenders without the intermediary. The more dynamic alternative best suits riskier items such as meme coins and gives freedom and efficiency in a trustless setup. To provide actual and timely prices, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles, which aggregate rates for top-cap assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are further used to provide security if volatile markets exist. The robust pricing foundation is used in stable collateral management, liquidations, and risk analysis to maintain the stability and efficiency of the protocol under all conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the breakout altcoin while Ethereum (ETH) targets $7,000–$10,000. Currently in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, MUTM will rise to $0.04 in Stage 7, giving early investors access to ground-floor pricing ahead of a projected 43x pump. The project has raised over $16M and onboarded 16,400 holders, showcasing strong confidence. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, dual P2C and P2P lending models, and Chainlink-powered price feeds, MUTM delivers security, scalability, and real DeFi utility.

A significant development is now capturing attention: Enosys, a prominent Flare-based DeFi protocol, has officially launched a pioneering XRP stablecoin protocol. This move is set to unlock new avenues for XRP holders and reshape how stability is perceived within the DeFi space. Introducing the Groundbreaking XRP Stablecoin Protocol Enosys’s new protocol marks a pivotal moment for the XRP community and the broader DeFi landscape. CryptoBriefing initially reported this exciting launch, highlighting the core mechanism: the stablecoin is collateralized by XRP itself. This isn’t just another stablecoin; it’s a strategic integration designed to leverage XRP’s potential within a decentralized framework. For those unfamiliar, Flare is a high-performance blockchain network focused on bringing smart contract capabilities to various cryptocurrencies, including XRP, that do not natively support them. Enosys, built on this network, is now enabling users to mint a new stablecoin. This is achieved by depositing FXRP, which is the wrapped version of XRP on the Flare network. FXRP acts as the bridge, allowing XRP to participate in Flare’s DeFi ecosystem. This initiative showcases the power of interoperability, allowing an asset like XRP to gain new functionalities and integrate seamlessly into the burgeoning world of DeFi applications. It’s a testament to the growing demand for diverse collateral options beyond established assets like Ethereum or Bitcoin. How Does XRP Collateralization Work? Understanding the mechanics behind this XRP stablecoin is key to appreciating its value and security. The process is designed to be straightforward yet robust, ensuring user confidence and protocol stability: Acquiring FXRP: Before minting, users need to wrap their native XRP into FXRP on the Flare network. This process is typically facilitated through secure bridging mechanisms. Depositing FXRP as Collateral: Users then deposit their FXRP into the Enosys stablecoin protocol. This FXRP acts as the backing for the stablecoin they wish to mint. Minting the Stablecoin: Upon successful deposit, users can mint the Enosys stablecoin, which is pegged to a fiat currency (e.g., 1:1 with the US Dollar). To safeguard against market volatility, the value of the deposited FXRP collateral usually exceeds the value of the stablecoin minted (overcollateralization). This buffer helps absorb potential price drops in XRP. Utilizing the Stablecoin: The newly minted stablecoin can then be used across various DeFi applications on Flare, such as lending, borrowing, trading, or payments, all while maintaining exposure to their underlying XRP. Redemption Process: When users wish to retrieve their original FXRP, they simply repay the minted stablecoin plus any accrued fees. This burns the stablecoin and releases their FXRP collateral, completing the cycle. This mechanism provides a capital-efficient way for XRP holders to unlock liquidity from their assets without needing to sell them, offering flexibility and new strategic opportunities within DeFi. What Are the Benefits and Implications of This XRP Stablecoin? The launch of an XRP stablecoin protocol by Enosys brings several significant advantages and implications, not just for individual users but for the broader cryptocurrency market: Enhanced Liquidity and Utility for XRP: This protocol significantly boosts XRP’s utility. Holders can now use their XRP as productive collateral in DeFi, accessing stablecoin liquidity without divesting their core asset. This can lead to increased demand and new use cases for XRP. Stability in a Volatile Market: The stablecoin offers users a reliable medium of exchange, shielded from the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. This stability is crucial for payments, remittances, and long-term financial planning within the decentralized world, particularly for those looking to avoid frequent conversions to fiat. Broader DeFi Integration: This development firmly embeds XRP within the decentralized finance landscape. It opens doors for XRP to interact with a wider array of DeFi applications and protocols on the Flare network, fostering greater interoperability and innovation. Showcasing Flare’s Potential: The successful deployment of such a complex protocol highlights the robust capabilities of the Flare network as a platform for sophisticated DeFi solutions. This can attract more developers, projects, and users to its ecosystem, driving further growth. New Financial Primitives: By creating an XRP-backed stablecoin, Enosys is introducing a new financial primitive that can be composed with other DeFi protocols, leading to novel financial products and services. While the benefits are clear, it is important for users to understand the risks associated with collateralized debt positions, such as liquidation risk if the collateral value drops significantly. However, the foundational design aims to mitigate these risks through established DeFi best practices like overcollateralization and transparent oracle feeds for price data. Navigating the Future of Decentralized Finance with XRP The introduction of the Enosys XRP stablecoin protocol represents a forward-thinking step in the evolution of decentralized finance. It exemplifies how specific cryptocurrencies, often seen as payment-focused, can be integrated into sophisticated DeFi structures, offering both stability and utility. This protocol not only empowers XRP holders but also enriches the entire Flare ecosystem by adding a crucial financial primitive. This innovation aligns with the broader trend of expanding collateral options in DeFi, moving beyond just a few dominant assets. It signifies a maturation of the ecosystem, where more diverse assets can unlock their potential value in a decentralized, permissionless manner. As the DeFi space continues to mature, solutions like Enosys’s XRP-collateralized stablecoin will play a vital role in expanding accessibility and fostering greater financial inclusion. It’s a testament to the ongoing innovation that drives the crypto market forward, creating new possibilities for digital assets. Conclusion: A New Horizon for XRP in DeFi Enosys’s launch of an XRP-collateralized stablecoin protocol is more than just a new product; it’s a significant milestone for both XRP and the Flare network. By providing a secure and innovative way to leverage XRP’s value for stability and liquidity, Enosys is paving the way for enhanced utility and broader adoption within decentralized finance. This development underscores the dynamic potential of the crypto world to continuously innovate and create value for its users, marking a truly exciting chapter for the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Enosys? A1: Enosys is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Flare network. It aims to bring advanced financial services, such as stablecoin minting, to various cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is FXRP? A2: FXRP is the wrapped version of XRP on the Flare network. It allows native XRP to be utilized within Flare’s smart contract ecosystem, enabling participation in DeFi protocols like Enosys. Q3: How is the Enosys stablecoin collateralized? A3: The Enosys stablecoin is collateralized by FXRP. Users deposit FXRP into the protocol to mint the stablecoin, with the FXRP acting as a secure backing for the stable asset. Q4: What are the main benefits for XRP holders using this protocol? A4: XRP holders can unlock liquidity from their assets without selling them, gain access to a stable medium of exchange for DeFi activities, and increase XRP’s utility within the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. Q5: Are there risks associated with using an XRP-collateralized stablecoin protocol? A5: Yes, like all DeFi protocols, there are risks, primarily liquidation risk if the value of the FXRP collateral drops significantly below the required ratio.

Bitcoin Cash Has Seen A Spike In Positive/Negative Sentiment In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin Cash. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the ratio between the positive and negative comments related to BCH that are currently present on the major social media platforms. Related Reading: PEPE Gearing Up For Triangle Breakout: Is A 78% Move Coming? The metric separates posts/threads/messages into bullish or bearish by putting them through a machine-learning model. Once they have been divided, it counts up the number of each and calculates their ratio to find the net sentiment on social media. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin Cash over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Cash Positive/Negative Sentiment fell to a low of 0.13 earlier in the month. Such a value corresponds to there being just 0.13 bullish comments for every bearish post. Thus, it would appear that social media traders were heavily leaning toward a negative outcome for BCH. Interestingly, what followed the market disbelief was a surge in the coin’s price to the $650 level for the first time since April 2024, around 17 months ago. This pattern is something that has actually been seen many times throughout the past. “Historically, prices move the opposite of the crowd’s expectations,” notes the analytics firm. This means that an excess of bearish sentiment tends to be a buy signal for the cryptocurrency, while overexcitement can lead to a top. While BCH initially observed the former type of effect, market balance quickly shifted, and it’s now facing the latter part of the pattern. From the chart, it’s visible that the sharp rally in the coin brought with it a huge spike in the Positive/Negative Sentiment to the 2.3 level. Bitcoin Cash has witnessed its price drop by around 6.7% since this dominance in bullish sentiment has emerged. It now remains to be seen how the market will react to the pullback and whether another shift in the Positive/Negative Sentiment would follow. Naturally, a pivot back to the bearish zone could help stabilize the price decline.

On Friday, the social networking service confirmed that the scam was associated with bigger criminal groups. A number of those accounts were suspended for crypto scams and platform manipulation. The company emphasized cooperating closely with law enforcement agencies in the investigation. In its announcement, the company noted that the scheme was uncovered with the help of blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which enabled investigators to track the perpetrators. X added that the suspended accounts attempted to bribe staff at social networks and payment providers through middlemen to restore their access. These were not individuals “acting alone,” the company said. They are affiliated with groups filling multiple online spheres beyond X, including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Minecraft, and Roblox. The methods typically include some form of crypto fraud, phishing, or other online manipulation. FBI is monitoring hacker group ‘The Com’ The bribe circle is connected to a network of hackers called The Com , which the FBI has identified and is monitoring. The agency said in July that The Com was a “growing and evolving online threat group” comprised largely of minors. The FBI said the group had grown increasingly sophisticated in the past four years. They are believed to be using sophisticated techniques to hide their identities, obscure financial transactions, and launder money. Their work ranges from cybercrime to fraud to trolling on online platforms. Bribery isn’t new to cybercrime cases. In May, United States authorities said hackers had sought to bribe Coinbase employees to help with an attack to gain access to confidential customer data. The overlap illustrates how insider threats and dollar signs can often subvert security systems. Crypto scams have beset X for years as the platform is an easy target. While Jack Dorsey still owned it in 2020, Twitter fell victim to one of its most severe breaches. Hackers hijacked accounts of people and companies, including former President Barack Obama, Apple, Uber, and Kanye West, using them to post messages that urged people to send money to a Bitcoin account. Scammers last year infiltrated several high-profile accounts to promote a Solana-based meme token. Among the victims were Lenovo’s division in India, the film director Oliver Stone, and the Brazilian soccer player Neymar Jr. These cases highlight the ongoing scourge of crypto fraud on major social platforms. They use more ingenious schemes, taking on insider conspiracy, bribery, and cross-platform operation methods instead of straightforward phishing. Criminal networks exploit corruption to evade bans The exposure of the bribery network highlights two urgent concerns: the vulnerability of insiders to corruption and the growing sophistication of organized cybercrime. Allowing scammers to buy their way back onto platforms undermines trust in content moderation and threatens overall platform safety. It is also a sign that online con artists are diversifying their tactics. They are no longer simply scamming from afar. They are actively working to undermine the system from the inside. X has committed to improving internal controls and increasing protections against insider threats. The company said it would work with law enforcement to continue prosecuting those responsible. At the same time, US authorities hope to intensify pressure on groups like The Com, which are now viewed as a combative force putting digital security at risk. The investigation remains open, and more arrests or indictments could come. With social media and crypto deeply intertwined, experts warn that we can expect to see more of these schemes unless platforms batten down the hatches and their employees have a stronger defense against bribery attempts.

The company said the update is available to download now, and according to Apple, it delivers a completely redesigned look called Liquid Glass, plus new tools like live translation, updated Messages effects, and a feature that saves your spot in line when you’re put on hold. Apple Intelligence also gained new abilities, but the much-talked-about smarter Siri is still not here. The software had been tested since June in beta form. Testers noted from the start that Liquid Glass would be the most obvious change, with the interface replacing flat designs with transparent, glass-like surfaces. Every feature in the new system was fine-tuned over the months leading up to release, and Apple is presenting iOS 26 as one of the most significant visual updates in years. Apple releases Liquid Glass design Liquid Glass alters the way menus, icons, and backgrounds appear. Menus now shine with a transparent window effect, while app icons have been turned into frosted tiles with faint colors. Even third-party apps had their logos reshaped into this design. Apple showed the way Liquid Glass reacts when touched. In Apple Music, a droplet moves between tabs as users tap them. Scrolling bends and twists the background image behind the menus, producing a refracted look. Users can make icons fully transparent, which allows wallpapers to show clearly. This Clear option is accessible by holding down on the home screen, tapping Edit, then Customize. Clear is available in both Light and Dark modes. Apple tested different versions of Liquid Glass during the beta, sometimes brightening the effect, sometimes making it more subtle. The company settled on a balance between clarity and usability. But the new transparency makes text harder to read for some people. Settings offer fixes for this problem. In Accessibility > Display & Text Size, the Reduce Transparency toggle decreases see-through visuals, while Increase Contrast thickens borders and strengthens backgrounds. Movement in Liquid Glass can also be reduced. In Accessibility > Motion, a Reduce Motion option removes the bouncing and wiggling of elements. But switching this on disables other animations across the system. The company said these adjustments were added to make sure people who dislike the effects can scale them back. Despite all the design changes, the way the phone functions stays the same. iOS 26 also expands functionality. Live translation lets users break language barriers without needing an app. Messages gained new visual effects, and the on-hold feature keeps your place in line when calling customer service. These features are included across the update and are live today. Chats now come with background customization. Users can open a conversation, tap the participant’s name or the group chat title, then select the Backgrounds tab. Six options are included. Photo allows images from the device’s photo library. Playground generates original artwork using Apple Intelligence. Color, Sky, Water, and Aurora are animated designs that move gently while you chat, and each has variations. But these backgrounds can only be applied if the other person is saved in Contacts.

This is a huge milestone for the XRP ecosystem, further cementing its position in DeFi and driving utility beyond remittances. Under the new system , XRP holders can borrow stablecoins without selling their tokens. Its model operates under a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) scheme, wherein users lock FXRP (wrapped XRP) or Flare’s native token wFLR as collateral. In return, they create a stablecoin class of cryptocurrency tied closely to the dollar. The model would allow investors to maintain long-term XRP exposure and enjoy liquidity for everyday purchases. In this way, they can use stablecoins to trade, lend, or make payments within DeFi. Flare’s Time Series Oracle (FTSO) feeds the price for collateral and stablecoins. This decentralized oracle provides transparency and stability, guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the market. The borrowing system is also accompanied by a stability pool, which keeps track of the stablecoin peg and covers liquidations. Users participating in the pool receive rewards from fees, liquidations, and interest payments. This incentive forms a self-regulating equilibrium between risk and rewards in the network. After launch, collateral is issued with FXRP and wFLR, which will soon change and support stXRP, adding to collateral flexibility. That means token holders can stake their XRP for yield, yet still use those staked assets as collateral for stablecoin loans. Users gain rewards and utility Enosys Loans goes beyond creating a stablecoin by introducing a broader incentive model within the Flare ecosystem. Borrowers and stability providers can earn reward Flare tokens (rFLR), which adds another layer of motivation for users to engage with and adopt the platform. Another distinctive feature is the ability for borrowers to set their own borrowing rate, but this flexibility comes with trade-offs. Loans taken at lower rates carry greater risk if the stablecoin loses its peg, since they are the first to be redeemed during correction events. This design balances individual choice with the need to maintain overall stability in the system. Everything Blockchain, a U.S. company, has already used Flare’s XRP DeFi framework to handle its crypto treasury. This early adoption is a strong vote of confidence for the platform and its capabilities to support real-world use cases. XRP-backed stablecoin unlocks new DeFi use cases The launch comes at a time of significant growth for the XRP Ledger, with data from XRPScan showing that the number of active accounts has recently surpassed 7 million, a clear indication of rising adoption and expanding activity across the network. XRP is primarily a payment token and bridge currency used in cross-border transactions . An XRP-denominated stablecoin provides new ways for holders to interact with the financial system, which is exactly what comes into sight when using the coin. This move now makes XRP available to be used not only as a payments asset but also as collateral for DeFi markets that run seamlessly worldwide. And finally, it solidifies a bridge between XRPL and Flare ecosystems, expanding the flexibility of investment in XRP for investors, developers, and institutions. The innovation also tackles one of the continual issues in crypto markets, selling tokens to obtain liquidity. Instead of selling, holders could borrow against their XRP, spend or invest stablecoins, and still profit from any rises in price in the underlying tokens. Enosys Loans is a prototype of the first on-chain debt protocol, backed by XRP. Its structure is built on the stability of Liquity V2 with the decentralization from Flare, bringing about a secure, efficient, and incentivizing borrowing system. If it finds adoption, XRP-backed stablecoins might play a part in expanding the use of digital assets in finance, trade, and Dapps. The achievement also paves the way to experimentation with Flare’s interoperability framework, bringing XRP into other ecosystems. Get seen where it counts.

The case, which was thrown out less than a week after it was filed, isn’t completely dead yet — the judge gave Trump four weeks to come back with a shorter and more focused complaint. But Judge Steven Merryday made it very clear: cut the noise or don’t come back at all. The lawsuit, which was supposed to target alleged defamation, instead ballooned into an 85-page rant. Judge Merryday pointed out that only the final pages actually mentioned the legal claims, while the bulk of it was filled with praise for Trump and attacks on his enemies. “Superfluous allegations” was the phrase he used. The court didn’t waste time ripping the case apart, saying it read more like a speech at a rally than a serious legal document. Judge blasts filing and demands a professional rewrite Steven, who was appointed by George H.W. Bush, didn’t hold back in his order. He said the court is not a stage for venting frustrations. “As every lawyer knows (or is presumed to know), a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective — not a protected platform to rage against an adversary,” Steven wrote in the decision. He also said, “A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally or the functional equivalent of the Hyde Park Speakers’ Corner.” Trump’s legal team had named four New York Times reporters and Penguin Random House as defendants. Penguin got dragged in because of a book they published, Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success , written by Times reporters Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner. Trump’s lawyers claimed the book was filled with false and malicious statements meant to harm his image. Steven told Trump’s team they have 28 days to revise and resubmit the lawsuit. But this time, they’re under strict rules. The complaint must not exceed 40 pages, not including the caption, signature, or attachments. And the judge warned that the case will “begin, continue, and end” under procedural law — no more legal theater. Trump lashes out, reporters respond, case remains on life support During an Oval Office event, ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl confronted Trump with the news that the lawsuit had been dismissed. Trump didn’t take it well. “I’m winning, I’m winning the cases,” he said before turning his frustration directly at Karl. “You’re guilty, Jon, you’re guilty. ABC is a terrible network, a very unfair network, and you should be ashamed of yourself. NBC is equally bad. I don’t know who’s worse.” After the ruling, a spokesman for Trump’s legal team issued a statement to CNBC saying, “President Trump will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against The New York Times , its reporters, and Penguin Random House, in accordance with the judge’s direction on logistics.” The Times also responded to the court’s decision, saying, “We welcome the judge’s quick ruling, which recognized that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency space, you know that institutional players are increasingly seeking secure solutions for their digital holdings. This context makes the latest announcement about BitGo revenue particularly significant, revealing an astounding quadrupling of its first-half earnings. What’s Behind the Astounding BitGo Revenue Surge? Digital asset custodian BitGo has made headlines with its impressive financial performance. The company recorded a remarkable first-half revenue of $4.19 billion. This figure represents an incredible fourfold increase year-over-year, as reported by Reuters, highlighting a substantial expansion in its operations and market penetration. This dramatic growth underscores the increasing demand for secure digital asset custody solutions among institutional investors. Despite this revenue boom, it’s interesting to note that BitGo’s operating profit saw a decline, moving from $30.9 million to $12.6 million during the same period. This suggests significant reinvestment or increased operational costs associated with scaling. BitGo’s Crucial Role in Digital Asset Custody and Its Impact on BitGo Revenue As a leading digital asset custodian, BitGo plays a critical role in providing secure infrastructure for cryptocurrencies. Its services are essential for institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto market without compromising security. The surge in BitGo revenue directly reflects this growing trust and reliance on specialized custody providers. The company’s robust security measures and compliance framework attract a wide array of clients, from hedge funds to exchanges. Therefore, the significant increase in its top-line earnings is a strong indicator of broader institutional adoption of digital assets. Navigating Growth: BitGo’s Financials and Future Ambitions While the quadrupling of BitGo revenue is a clear win, the dip in operating profit warrants a closer look. This scenario is not uncommon for rapidly expanding companies that are investing heavily in infrastructure, talent, and new product development to capture market share. Such investments, while impacting short-term profitability, are often crucial for long-term sustainable growth and market leadership. Furthermore, BitGo previously submitted an S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO). This move signals the company’s ambition to become a publicly traded entity, potentially seeking to raise substantial capital to fuel further expansion and solidify its market position. An IPO would also bring increased transparency and regulatory scrutiny, which could further build trust among institutional clients. What Does This BitGo Revenue Boom Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The substantial growth in BitGo revenue is more than just a company success story; it offers valuable insights into the health and direction of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. It suggests a maturing market where professional and institutional money is flowing in, demanding enterprise-grade solutions for managing digital assets. This trend indicates: Increased Institutional Adoption: More traditional financial institutions are comfortable holding and managing cryptocurrencies. Demand for Security: The need for secure, compliant, and insured custody services is paramount. Market Maturation: The infrastructure supporting digital assets is becoming more sophisticated and robust. This positive indicator could encourage more cautious investors to explore digital assets, knowing that reputable custodians like BitGo are providing essential services. In conclusion, BitGo’s phenomenal quadrupling of its first-half BitGo revenue to $4.19 billion is a testament to the surging demand for institutional-grade digital asset custody. While its operating profit saw a temporary decline, this often reflects strategic investments aimed at future growth and market dominance. With an eye towards a potential IPO, BitGo is not only securing digital assets but also shaping the future landscape of cryptocurrency finance. This impressive performance underscores the ongoing institutionalization of the crypto market and highlights the critical role played by secure, reliable custodians. Frequently Asked Questions About BitGo’s Performance Here are some common questions regarding BitGo’s recent financial disclosures and its role in the digital asset space: What is BitGo, and what services does it provide? BitGo is a leading digital asset custodian that provides secure and compliant custody solutions for cryptocurrencies. It offers services like multi-signature wallets, institutional trading, and asset management for businesses and institutional investors. Why did BitGo’s operating profit decline even with a significant increase in BitGo revenue? A decline in operating profit amidst revenue growth often indicates substantial strategic investments. BitGo is likely investing heavily in expanding its infrastructure, technology, security measures, and team to meet growing demand and pursue its IPO ambitions, which can temporarily impact short-term profitability. What is the significance of BitGo’s S-1 filing with the SEC? The S-1 filing is a preliminary step for companies planning an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the U.S. It signifies BitGo’s intention to become a publicly traded company, aiming to raise capital and enhance its market presence and transparency within the traditional financial system. How does the growth in BitGo revenue reflect on the broader cryptocurrency market? The impressive growth in BitGo revenue is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption and confidence in digital assets. It highlights a maturing market where professional investors are seeking robust and secure solutions for managing their crypto holdings, suggesting a positive trend for the overall ecosystem. What are the benefits of using a digital asset custodian like BitGo? Using a custodian like BitGo provides enhanced security against hacks and theft, regulatory compliance, insurance, and professional management of digital assets. This is crucial for institutions that need to meet stringent security and regulatory requirements. We hope this deep dive into BitGo’s impressive financial performance has shed light on the evolving digital asset landscape.

SOL is trading near $240 , with traders anticipating that institutional access through ETFs could propel the token toward new highs. Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, continues to hold steady at around $0.83 , supported by whale accumulation and a resilient developer community. Yet while SOL and ADA remain strong contenders, investors are increasingly looking toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has been hitting milestone after milestone and building momentum that could rival ETF-driven surges. Why Solana ETF Hype is Important The possibility of a Solana ETF has been one of the hottest topics this season. ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum have already proven successful, drawing billions in inflows and helping establish crypto as a mainstream asset class. If Solana follows suit, analysts expect demand to rise sharply, as institutional players gain easier access to the token. Technically, SOL has reclaimed major support zones and is eyeing resistance near $260–$280 . Breaking through could open the door to fresh all-time highs, especially if ETF approval arrives sooner than expected. The combination of speculation and technical strength is keeping sentiment high, with many traders treating Solana as the next big ETF-driven opportunity. ADA’s Steady Position Cardano continues to hold its place as a trusted Layer-1 blockchain. Trading near $0.83 , ADA has been buoyed by renewed whale activity and progress on its Hydra scaling solution. Cardano’s emphasis on sustainability, transparency, and governance makes it attractive to long-term holders, even if its price action is slower than more volatile competitors. Analysts expect ADA to remain a consistent performer, with potential upside toward $2 if broader market conditions improve. While ADA is unlikely to deliver the same explosive multiples as a smaller-cap token, it provides stability and exposure to one of the most engaged communities in crypto. Building Momentum Through Milestones While SOL and ADA are benefiting from institutional and whale support, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been carving its own path by consistently achieving major milestones. From surpassing funding targets to securing independent audits and building a rapidly growing community, each stage of its development has reinforced confidence in its trajectory. What makes this noteworthy is the speed of its progress. While Solana requires ETF approvals and ADA relies on incremental upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already demonstrated the ability to deliver results quickly. This kind of momentum often signals the potential for breakout performance once the token hits major exchanges. For many investors, it represents a chance to capture gains at an earlier stage than what’s possible with SOL or ADA. The comparison is striking: SOL’s growth depends on regulators, ADA’s depends on adoption pace, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is already proving its capacity to meet ambitious goals ahead of schedule. That milestone-driven momentum is why analysts see it as a candidate to outperform established names in percentage terms. Comparing Upside Potential Solana’s ETF narrative could easily drive another leg higher, but its large market cap means upside will likely be measured in multiples rather than exponential surges. ADA offers steady growth and long-term credibility, but its conservative pace means it won’t deliver life-changing returns in a single cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, still has the kind of early-stage positioning that allows for exponential growth. With each milestone achieved, it builds credibility and draws more investors into the fold, creating a compounding effect. While risk remains higher at this stage, the potential rewards are also significantly greater. For those looking to diversify, pairing SOL and ADA with a smaller allocation to MAGACOIN provides exposure to both safety and high-risk, high-reward upside. Conclusion Solana’s ETF speculation is injecting optimism into the market, and ADA continues to offer steady long-term exposure. But for those chasing breakout performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving itself through milestone-driven momentum that could rival the gains of larger tokens. If it continues on this trajectory, it may not just complement established altcoins—it could outperform them in the cycle ahead.

Nasdaq-listed Faraday Future (FFAI), known for its ambitious electric vehicle plans, is making a bold leap into the burgeoning world of Web3 and cryptocurrency. This exciting move, centered around a strategic partnership, signals a new era for the company and potentially for how we view vehicle manufacturers interacting with digital assets. Let’s dive into what this Faraday Future crypto initiative means. What’s Driving Faraday Future’s Crypto Ambition? Faraday Future has officially announced its entry into the cryptocurrency and Web3 sectors. This isn’t a solo journey; they’re teaming up with fellow Nasdaq-listed firm Qualigen Therapeutics (QLGN). This collaboration isn’t just about exploring new technologies; it involves a significant financial commitment. Faraday Future has led a substantial $41 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) into Qualigen. This investment highlights the seriousness of their commitment to this new digital frontier. The PIPE round saw participation from several high-profile investors, signaling strong market confidence in this strategic direction. Key participants included: Binance Labs Sequoia Capital IDG Such prominent names indicate a belief in the long-term potential of this Faraday Future crypto partnership. How Will Qualigen Therapeutics Transform for Web3? To fully embrace its new role in the Web3 space, Qualigen Therapeutics plans a significant rebranding. Pending shareholder approval, the company intends to change its name to CXC10. This rebranding is more than just a name change; it represents a strategic pivot towards a future deeply integrated with decentralized technologies and digital economies. This shift will likely see CXC10 focusing on developing solutions and services within the Web3 ecosystem, potentially leveraging blockchain technology for various applications. The synergy between an electric vehicle innovator like Faraday Future and a rebranded Web3-focused entity like CXC10 could lead to groundbreaking developments. Imagine decentralized identity for vehicles, blockchain-based supply chain management, or even crypto payments for charging and services.

A wallet linked to Arca has recently made substantial Arca crypto investments , accumulating a remarkable $10.7 million worth of ENA and IMX tokens. This strategic accumulation, first reported by AmberCN, highlights Arca’s calculated approach to the evolving digital asset landscape. What Sparked These Arca Crypto Investments? Over the past six hours, the wallet presumed to be associated with Arca received a hefty $6.16 million worth of IMX from Flowdesk. Furthermore, it acquired $4.54 million worth of ENA directly from Binance. These transactions indicate a clear and deliberate strategy by Arca to bolster its holdings in these specific digital assets. Such large-scale movements by an institutional player like Arca often signal a bullish outlook on the chosen tokens. Arca is known for its deep research and sophisticated investment strategies in the digital asset space. Therefore, these recent acquisitions are not merely speculative; they likely stem from a thorough analysis of ENA and IMX’s potential. IMX (ImmutableX): A leading Layer 2 scaling solution for NFTs and Web3 gaming on Ethereum. ENA (Ethena): The governance token for Ethena Labs, which offers USDe, a synthetic dollar protocol. Understanding the Potential of ENA and IMX Why would Arca focus its substantial Arca crypto investments on ENA and IMX? Both tokens represent key areas of innovation and growth within the blockchain ecosystem. ImmutableX, with its focus on scaling Web3 games, addresses a critical need for high-throughput and low-cost transactions in the rapidly expanding gaming sector. Its technology enables developers to build and scale games with true digital ownership, attracting a significant user base and developer community. Ethena, on the other hand, is at the forefront of creating a scalable, censorship-resistant synthetic dollar. Its USDe stablecoin aims to provide a crypto-native solution that is independent of traditional banking infrastructure. This innovation has garnered considerable attention, positioning ENA as a governance token for a potentially disruptive financial primitive. Arca’s decision to invest heavily in these projects suggests a belief in their long-term viability and potential to capture significant market share. What Do These Arca Crypto Investments Mean for the Market? Institutional accumulation often acts as a strong bullish signal for the broader market. When a reputable firm like Arca makes such substantial Arca crypto investments , it can inspire confidence among retail investors and other institutional players. This can lead to increased demand and potentially positive price action for ENA and IMX. Moreover, Arca’s involvement can bring more visibility and legitimacy to these projects. It signals that these tokens are not just speculative assets but have fundamental value and potential for future growth. The move also highlights the increasing sophistication of institutional participation in the crypto market, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to explore promising altcoins. Key takeaways from this development include: Increased Confidence: Arca’s backing can boost investor trust in ENA and IMX. Market Momentum: Potential for positive price movements as more investors take notice. Strategic Vision: Arca’s focus on Web3 gaming and synthetic dollars reflects key trends. The Strategic Vision Behind Arca’s Digital Asset Play Arca’s reputation as a pioneer in digital asset management is well-established. Their team comprises seasoned financial professionals with deep expertise in both traditional finance and blockchain technology. These latest Arca crypto investments align with their philosophy of identifying early-stage projects with strong fundamentals and significant growth potential. Their active management style often involves taking substantial positions in projects they believe will shape the future of finance and technology. By accumulating ENA and IMX, Arca is not just buying tokens; they are investing in the underlying narratives of scalable Web3 infrastructure and decentralized stablecoin solutions. This long-term perspective is crucial in the volatile crypto market. In conclusion, Arca’s $10.7 million accumulation of ENA and IMX tokens is a compelling development in the crypto space. It underscores the growing institutional interest in innovative altcoins and provides a strong vote of confidence in the future prospects of ImmutableX and Ethena. As the digital asset market continues to mature, strategic moves by firms like Arca will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its trajectory.

In a podcast interview on Friday, Steve told Sean Spicer that Scott should take over from Jerome Powell as Fed chair next year but still stay on as Treasury Secretary. The episode’s footage was obtained by CNBC’s Eamon Javers. “I am a big believer that on an interim basis, that Scott Bessent should be both the head of the Federal Reserve and the secretary of Treasury, and maybe get through the midterm elections, step down at Treasury and take over the Federal Reserve,” Steve said. Scott is already heading the search for Powell’s replacement when his term ends in May 2026. He was once thought to be a candidate himself, but publicly said he’s fine staying at Treasury. That hasn’t stopped Steve from pushing the idea anyway. Steve lasted only seven months as Trump’s White House strategist before getting fired. Still, he’s close to Trump and clearly feels comfortable tossing out these kinds of proposals. The White House, on the other hand, isn’t amused. “Such an arrangement is not being and has never been considered by the White House,” a spokesman said. The idea was immediately shut down. White House rejects plan as Scott leads search for Powell’s replacement There’s no real example of this happening before. Before the Banking Act of 1935, the Treasury Secretary did sit on the Fed’s board, but the chair role wasn’t created until later. Janet Yellen ran the Fed and then the Treasury, but those jobs were years apart. Scott doing both at once — even if temporary — would break that mold completely. Right now, Scott is running the process to find Powell’s successor. Reports say there are 11 names on the list. He was once on it too, until he said he wasn’t interested. Still, Steve thinks Scott should hold both posts until midterms, then leave Treasury and stay on as Fed boss. It’s not clear if anyone else in Trump’s circle supports that plan. Trump has repeatedly slammed the Fed for not slashing interest rates more. He wants a Fed that moves fast — his way. That pressure could be why Steve wants someone loyal like Scott at the top. But making him do both jobs, even for a few months, would raise serious legal, policy, and political questions. Fed’s Miran dismisses tariff inflation and calls for deeper rate cuts While Steve is pushing personnel moves, Fed Governor Stephen Miran is focused on policy. He voted against the Fed’s decision this week to cut rates by 0.25%. He wanted a 0.5% cut instead. Speaking on CNBC’s “Money Movers” Friday, Miran said he doesn’t think Trump’s tariffs will cause inflation. “I’m clearly in the minority in not being concerned about inflation from tariffs,” Miran said. “But that was also true in 2018-2019, and I think I probably could take a little victory lap about that.” He said he hasn’t seen any real evidence that tariffs are pushing up prices. “If you thought tariffs are driving inflation higher, you’d think imports would be differentially inflating at a higher pace,” he said. Miran also said the difference between inflation in U.S. core goods and other countries is tiny. “If I thought that tariffs were driving any material inflation in the United States, I’d look for evidence,” he added. Even so, the Fed’s own data says inflation is still above 2%, and might not fall back to target until 2028. Only Miran wanted the Fed to move faster on cutting rates.

51995928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=813475,1758333068,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51995928.jpeg,BitGo reveals fourfold revenue surge in US IPO filing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitgo-reveals-fourfold-revenue-surge/,"Crypto custody firm BitGo has unveiled plans to go public in the United States after reporting a sharp surge in revenue. The company’s initial public offering (IPO) filing highlights that its revenue nearly quadrupled in the first half of 2025, underscoring the accelerating growth of the digital asset sector. According to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, BitGo generated $4.19 billion in revenue for the six months ending June 30, 2025, up from $1.12 billion during the same period a year earlier. However, profit went the other way, with net income declining to $12.6 million, compared with $30.9 million a year earlier. Analysts said the decline indicates growing costs as the company grows to supply demand from institutional clients. BitGo, founded in 2013, is one of the largest crypto-custody companies in the United States. It focuses on storing and protecting digital assets for institutions. As mainstream custody has soared in popularity, investors new to the space see services such as BitGo’s as necessary. The company’s last known valuation was $1.75 billion in a 2023 funding round. BitGo to join IPO frenzy in crypto industry BitGo plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the “BTGO.” Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are leading underwriters, signaling Wall Street’s intense interest in digital asset infrastructure . Its IPO arrived as the U.S. market picked up again following months of sluggishness in early 2025. Analysts predict the drop will be among the busiest periods for IPOs since 2021. However, unlike in previous years, the new wave is driven by crypto firms, which are now driving broader market activity. Stablecoin issuer Circle , trading platform Bullish, and blockchain lender Figure have all made their stock market debuts this year. Both have captured strong first-day receptions, indicating that investors might be warming to the stocks of companies involved in cryptocurrencies. Their performances have engendered confidence that demand extends beyond retail traders, deep into institutional portfolios. Factors driving this momentum, according to market experts, are numerous. Wins in Washington on the regulatory front have provided more certainty about how digital assets will be treated and reduced the fear of abrupt policy changes. Over time, the approval and expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have ushered in billions of dollars worth of inflows, cementing digital currencies as components of mainstream investment portfolios. “When it comes to digital assets, investors are now treating them as another asset class, not just something in the fantasy world where people can make billions of dollars every day,” said Josef Schuster, founder and chief executive officer of IPO research firm IPOX. The change in mindset has prompted large investment banks to pursue closer relationships with crypto firms, be it through direct investments or underwriting IPOs. The clustering of crypto listings also plays a role in redrawing the narrative around the IPO market itself. Where technology or health care companies had once reigned over splashy debuts, digital asset companies are now coming to the fore. For BitGo, this rush of optimism is a well-timed backdrop to capitalize on increasing investor enthusiasm for companies that can handle infrastructure and security in the sector. Crypto inches closer to the mainstream of finance BitGo’s decision to seek a public listing indicates how much crypto has penetrated the financial mainstream. Though it was once dismissed as a fringe experiment, the industry now boasts billions in funding from institutional investment and increasingly ambitious regulations. The steep revenue increase indicates increasing confidence in crypto infrastructure, particularly its custody vehicle, which secures the safety of assets for large investors. However, the drop in profit illustrates the tightrope of scaling businesses while keeping margins from deteriorating. The BitGo IPO will provide investors with a litmus test for their belief that Wall Street has the fortitude (screw the tolerance) to back crypto infrastructure companies, which return value over the long term. Its performance could affect how regulators, institutions, and retail traders think about future similar listings. If it succeeds, the offering could prompt other crypto companies to go public, cementing digital assets in global finance.

A safety driver will sit in the front seat while the cars run on their own. This move shows Tesla is getting ready to take its robotaxi program beyond Austin. The company told Arizona officials it wants to start in the Phoenix area. It reached out to the Arizona Department of Transportation back in late June to begin this process, and that’s when the permit application started rolling. According to Bloomberg, Tesla applied for two different kinds of permits — one for testing with a driver, and one for testing without one. But if it plans to start giving rides to the public, it still needs to get a transportation network license. That’s the same type of license Uber and Lyft need to operate in the state. So while the greenlight is a big win, it’s not the final step. Tesla adds Arizona after Texas and Nevada This makes Arizona the third state where Tesla is allowed to test these robotaxis. Texas and Nevada already gave the company the go-ahead, with Nevada granting its permit just earlier this month. Tesla first launched its robotaxi service in Austin back in June, but only for a small group of early users. In late July, Tesla quietly opened access to the robotaxi app in the Bay Area too. Still, none of these cars are fully driverless. They’re all using an unreleased version of Tesla’s Full Self Driving software, and there’s always a safety monitor sitting behind the wheel, ready to take over. Investors are watching every step. The market wants to know how fast Tesla can expand this network and actually turn it into a business. Right now, the cars aren’t completely autonomous, and there’s no confirmed date for when Tesla will try to remove the safety driver. But the pieces are clearly being put in place. Stock rebounds as Musk buys $1 billion in shares Tesla’s stock price has been through hell this year, but it’s finally turned around. After a rough first quarter, the worst since 2022, and a bloody April triggered by Trump’s tariff announcement, the shares have now jumped back into the green. They closed the week up 5.2%, ending Friday at $426. That’s more than $26 higher than Tesla’s last close in 2024. Since hitting a low of $221.86 in early April, the stock has gained 85%. A new SEC filing shows that Elon Musk, through his family foundation, just bought $1 billion worth of shares. That news came out this week and added fuel to the rebound. This marks the second year in a row Tesla’s stock made a comeback after a rough Q1. Last year, shares dropped 29% from January to March, then rallied to end 2024 up 63%. At the same time, analysts are still eyeing Musk’s new pay package, which could bring him a staggering $1 trillion over the next ten years, if certain performance targets are met. That plan hasn’t been finalized yet, but it’s out there and making waves. Tesla also rolled out new MegaBlocks battery systems. These come prebuilt and are sold to businesses trying to save on energy costs or get more power from solar and wind. It’s part of Tesla’s plan to make money beyond just cars. Even after all this, Tesla is still the second-worst performing stock among the big tech names in 2025. Only Apple has done worse, with its shares down 5% so far this year. Tesla’s still dealing with weak sales, too. Its cars are getting old, and cheaper EVs from BYD in China are eating up more market share, as Cryptopolitan reported previously.

51996559,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/here-is-what-every-investor-should-do-in-a-crypto-bear-market/,1758333600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51996559.jpeg,Here is What Every Investor Should Do in a Crypto Bear Market,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/here-is-what-every-investor-should-do-in-a-crypto-bear-market/,"When prices start to crater, crowds of traders run for the hills in fear, selling into a market bottom. But history has also shown that, painful as they are, downturns in crypto can be among the richest moments for those who know what they are doing. But unlike traditional markets, crypto never sleeps and trades off narratives, as well as moves right now on innovation, or news around the world. Which is why bear markets are so volatile — and also a time when they can be fertile ground for disciplined investors who are ready rather than panicked. In past cycles, the money managers who took this longer-term approach rather than chasing quick rebounds tended to make the biggest gains when the bull market returned. Against that kind of backdrop, the humpbacked migration-type of big-game whale behavior, like seen on MAGACOIN FINANCE , is a signal that pro money has already been quietly positioning for what’s upcoming, regardless of whether retail follows their tempo or not. Focus on Fundamentals Bear markets separate the wheat from the chaff, revealing who is genuinely building utility and who was just hype. Investors would do well to monitor developer activity, real-world applications and active partnerships along with them. Strongly established, tech-backed cryptocurrencies with active communities have the best chances of weathering a storm and also making it against the upcoming bull cycle. Accumulate Gradually Finding the exact bottom is nearly impossible. Instead of waiting for the “perfect” entry, strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) allow steady accumulation over time. This approach lowers the emotional pressure of market timing and builds exposure at more favorable prices, preparing portfolios for recovery when optimism returns. Diversify Wisely Focusing on one token is exhilarating when the market is booming, but it can also be destructive during down cycles. Holding a blend of established assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside a curated selection of altcoins can be an effective approach to risk management, whilst retaining the opportunity for upside. Investor controls: A more diversified portfolio gives investors a financial safety net to weather the volatility while not being overexposed to one project’s fate. In a market where most tokens struggle to survive, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads, with giant whale transactions and mounting institutional interest. Analysts cite its expanding ecosystem, a community-driven approach to development, and enthusiasm among early investors. Others predicted that once market sentiment recovers, the project may offer outsized gain potential — MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few altcoins to watch closely in hopes it will rebound stronger after a bearish period. Stay Liquid and Manage Risk Having a stable of assets or cash allows investors to capitalize on unexpected opportunities. Risk management tools — like position sizing and rebalancing strategies — limit the likelihood of catastrophic losses. Having a plan can help you avoid making fear-based decisions about what to do during market price swings and keep you calm. * Keep Learning and Building Conviction Bear markets provide time for study. It is also when the eventual winners are quietly building, often away from mainstream headlines. Identifying opportunities that range from decentralized finance to tokenized assets to AI-tied blockchain projects can help investors find opportunities before everyone else. Education begets conviction, which in turn helps investors hold rather than sell into weakness/have factor investing. Conclusion Because bear markets challenge patience and discipline in ways bull markets never do, the headlines are dominated by short-term pain, but the framework for the next cycle is usually being set in the longer term. By going back to basics, accumulating sensibly, diversifying, and identifying opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors cannot only avoid falling victim to profitability expectations in downturns but also thrive in the next period of growth.

51995985,585137,1758333616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51995985.jpeg,Here’s How Much Dogecoin Whales Bought In Only One Week,https://bitcoinist.com/how-much-dogecoin-whales-bought/,"Dogecoin has witnessed a strong uptick in whale accumulation this week, with large investors aggressively increasing their holdings. On-chain analytics platform Santiment reveals that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE have ramped up their balances this week, which is one of the most notable buying sprees in recent weeks. This accumulation coincided with Dogecoin’s push from $0.26 on September 15 to briefly crossing above the $0.28 level on September 18, suggesting that whale activity has been an important factor in the token’s latest rally. Whales Add About 1 Billion DOGE To Holdings According to Santiment’s data , whales in the balance category of 100 million to 1 billion DOGE boosted their combined holdings from 26.48 billion DOGE on September 15 to 27.39 billion DOGE by September 19. This means about 910 million DOGE were accumulated by these addresses in just four days, equivalent to over $250 million at the current price of Dogecoin. This increase in whale-controlled supply typically signals growing confidence in the asset while also reducing the liquidity available in open markets. The timing of these purchases points to a deliberate accumulation strategy as Dogecoin tested a local price support at $0.26. Whales purchasing hundreds of millions of tokens not only reduce available supply but also tend to encourage retail traders to follow suit. The scale of this accumulation appears to have had a direct impact on Dogecoin’s price action. Between September 15 and 18, Dogecoin rose from $0.26 to above $0.28, a rally of nearly 8% within three days. This rally was all on the action of whales alone, as Santiment data shows a corresponding holding decrease in the cohort of addresses holding between 10 million DOGE and 100 million DOGE tokens. Dogecoin Technical Analysis As it stands, Dogecoin’s ability to extend its rally will depend on how it holds above the $0.28 price level in the coming days. However, a bullish technical analysis that aligns with this whale accumulation trend suggests that Dogecoin is now on track to new all-time highs. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade confirmed that Dogecoin’s weekly chart has broken out of a long-standing symmetrical triangle pattern. According to him, last week’s candle close validates the breakout and establishes a 1:29 risk-to-reward trading opportunity. The symmetrical triangle setup points to a strong trend continuation after a series of higher lows and lower highs since September 2025 that has now resolved upward. Interestingly, Trader Tardigrade predicted a rally that would see Dogecoin break above its current all-time high. Particularly, the analyst predicted that Dogecoin could rally as high as $1.7 if the breakout follows through.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Santiment|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 02:00:16

With the September 17-18 FOMC meeting fast approaching, markets are almost unanimous: a 25 basis point rate cut is expected, with whispers of a more aggressive 50 bps move if labor data continues to soften. Inflation remains sticky, CPI held at 2.9% year-over-year in August , with core inflation still high, but momentum is clearly shifting toward easing. Weak job growth (only ~22,000 jobs added in August) and rising unemployment (now ~4.3%) have added to the pressure. Crypto traders are watching closely. Why? Because lower interest rates tend to make risk assets more attractive, and altcoins are first in line when capital seeks higher returns. As Bitcoin and Ethereum hold territory, many investors believe the next leg up might come from lesser-known names and presales. In that environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a focal point in speculative flows, its presale momentum, scarcity mechanics, and growing community chatter positioning it as a potential breakout when policy shifts drop. Fed Cuts, Markets, and Altcoin Sentiment The broader macroeconomic backdrop is shifting. Analysts and economists are broadly in line that the Fed will deliver a rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The IMF, for one, has opined that the Fed has scope to ease amid signs of labor-market softness. The weakening labor reports, slower job creation and uptick in unemployment, have helped prompt a reevaluation of risk asset potential. Crypto is reacting. Whales are building positions ahead of CPI releases and Fed decisions; volatility (as seen in VIX futures spreads) is signaling that traders expect increased turbulence post-Fed, but also that upside is being priced in before the cut. Ethereum and Bitcoin are steadying, preserving support zones, while many altcoins are seeing small inflows of interest, particularly from risk-tolerant capital. Some strategists argue a historic altcoin boom could follow, akin to late 2024’s surge, provided this rate cut acts as a trigger, liquidity enters, and macro pressures don’t snap back. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum & Speculative Positioning In the midst of all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most watched presales. According to recent announcements, its presale rounds are closing faster than projected, reflecting growing demand. Each stage of its presale is designed with scarcity in mind, later rounds have reduced token allocations, rewarding early participants who lock in at lower prices. Its visibility is also rising: Bitcoin and XRP communities are increasingly including MAGACOIN FINANCE in their altcoin outlooks, highlighting a shift from being a niche presale project to one discussed alongside more established names. Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to other presale projects like BlockDAG and Remittix, noting its combination of community strength, scarcity mechanics, and presale performance as key differentiators. What makes its timing especially interesting is how presale momentum is aligning with macro signals: as traders brace for what many expect to be a Fed rate cut, speculative flows tend to accelerate. The belief is that once easier money starts flowing, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which already have momentum and scarcity, could benefit disproportionately, early entry becomes highly leveraged in such environments. Risks to the Boom Narrative & Altcoin Vulnerabilities Despite the optimism, several risk factors could derail or muddy expectations. First: inflation remains above target in many categories, and if the Fed signals caution (e.g. tight rhetoric, hesitance to commit to multiple cuts), markets could react with disappointment. Second: bond yields are creeping upward in many tenors, a rise in yields tends to reduce the appeal of risk-assets, including altcoins, especially those without strong fundamentals or clear roadmaps. Third, macroeconomic shocks (geopolitical risks, supply chain issues, energy price shocks) could force the Fed to pause or reverse easing. Also, liquidity isn’t guaranteed; even with rate cuts, capital flows depend heavily on sentiment, regulatory clarity, and market structure. Presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE must also execute properly, delays, security issues, or exchange listing problems could trigger negative feedback. Finally, post-Fed volatility is almost baked in the cake; VIX futures point to higher expected turbulence in October compared to September. If markets get too euphoric pre-Fed, there could be sharp corrections once the decision lands or if forward guidance disappoints. What Traders Are Watching: Indicators & Levels To assess whether the altcoin boom is real and sustainable, traders are focusing on: Fed Communication & Dot Plots : Will Powell and the FOMC signal a single cut, or multiple cuts through end-2025? The updated projections will matter. Inflation Data (CPI & Core CPI) : If inflation shows further cooling, odds of more aggressive easing increase. If it surprises upward, markets may temper expectations. Labor Market Reports : Job growth, unemployment, wage inflation. Weakness here supports more dovish policy. Whale Activity & Presale Fill Rates : Which projects are attracting large holders? Presales closing fast? Are allocations tight? This tends to indicate strong speculative flows. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such case. Support/Resistance Zones in Alts : For Ethereum, Bitcoin, but also mid-caps and presale names. If ETH holds above ~$4,250 support and breaks resistance around $4,500, that could cascade into broader altcoin strength. Conclusion Traders everywhere are anticipating that the Fed’s next move could mark a turning point — not just for interest rates, but for altcoins. With a rate cut expected, inflation cooling slightly, and macro risks mounting, the mood is aligning for what many hope will be a historic altcoin boom. Amid this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising in prominence: strong presale rounds, shrinking supply per stage, and growing recognition across Bitcoin and XRP communities all signal it may be one of those breakout stories when liquidity floods in. While risks are real — inflation surprises, yield spikes, or regulatory headwinds could upset the script — the potential upside feels unusually compelling. If you believe that policy pivots drive momentum, and early speculative bets offer skewed returns, this moment is one to watch closely.

Two prominent whale addresses recently transferred a staggering $14.19 million worth of WLFI tokens to Binance. This kind of large-scale movement often signals potential shifts in market dynamics and warrants a closer look. What’s Behind the Recent WLFI Deposit on Binance? According to reports, two specific whale addresses collectively deposited 64.43 million WLFI tokens onto the Binance exchange. This massive transfer, valued at approximately $14.19 million, is a notable event for the WLFI ecosystem. Interestingly, these whale addresses initially acquired their tokens from an address starting with 0xA71, precisely on the day WLFI was first listed on exchanges. For those new to crypto, a “whale address” refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their actions, such as a significant WLFI deposit , can often influence market sentiment and price action due to the sheer volume of tokens they control. Why Does a Large WLFI Deposit by Whales Matter? When whales make such substantial moves, especially depositing tokens to an exchange, it typically sparks questions about their intentions. A large WLFI deposit could indicate several strategic possibilities: Potential Selling Pressure: One common reason for moving large amounts of tokens to an exchange is to prepare for selling. If these whales decide to offload their WLFI, it could introduce significant selling pressure, potentially leading to a price correction. Profit-Taking: Given that these tokens were received on WLFI’s listing day, the whales might be looking to realize substantial profits from their early investment. Strategic Rebalancing: Whales often manage diversified portfolios. This deposit could be part of a larger strategy to rebalance their holdings, moving capital into or out of WLFI. Providing Liquidity: Less commonly, but still possible, they might be contributing to liquidity pools or engaging in other financial activities on the exchange. Understanding these potential motivations is crucial for investors trying to anticipate market movements. Navigating the Market After a Major WLFI Deposit The immediate aftermath of a significant WLFI deposit by whales often brings a period of increased volatility and uncertainty. Investors should consider several factors when interpreting such events: Monitor Price Action: Keep a close eye on WLFI’s price movements and trading volume on Binance. A sudden spike in selling volume could confirm a profit-taking scenario. Assess Market Sentiment: How are other investors reacting? Social media and crypto news outlets can offer insights into the prevailing sentiment. Look for Confirmation: A single deposit, while large, doesn’t always guarantee a sell-off. Subsequent transactions, such as actual sales or further deposits, would provide clearer signals. It’s always wise to approach such situations with caution and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a whale’s move. Thorough research remains paramount. What’s Next for WLFI After This Significant Deposit? The future trajectory of WLFI will depend heavily on how these whale addresses proceed with their deposited tokens. Will they sell? Will they hold? Or perhaps engage in other strategic maneuvers? The market will be watching closely for any further actions from these large holders. For WLFI holders and potential investors, this event underscores the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements. Whale activity is a powerful indicator, and while it doesn’t dictate the entire market, it certainly adds an element of intrigue and potential impact to WLFI’s journey. In conclusion, the recent $14.19 million WLFI deposit to Binance by two whale addresses is a significant development. It highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the profound influence large holders can exert. Whether this move precedes a period of selling or is part of a broader strategy, it serves as a crucial reminder for all participants to remain vigilant and well-informed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto whale? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, often enough to influence its market price through large transactions. Q2: Why do whales deposit large amounts of tokens to exchanges? A: Whales typically deposit tokens to exchanges for various reasons, including preparing to sell for profit, rebalancing their portfolio, or participating in exchange-specific activities like staking or providing liquidity. Q3: How does a large WLFI deposit affect the market? A: A large WLFI deposit can potentially increase selling pressure, leading to price volatility or a temporary dip if the whale decides to sell a significant portion of their holdings. Q4: Should I be concerned if a whale makes a large deposit? A: It’s a signal to pay attention to, but not necessarily a cause for panic. It indicates potential market movement. Always conduct your own research and consider your investment strategy before reacting. Q5: What is WLFI? A: WLFI refers to the native token of a specific blockchain project. Its value and utility are tied to that project’s ecosystem and adoption. Did you find this analysis helpful?

After climbing to $0.29 before easing back, the coin is once again attracting bullish speculation from both retail traders and institutions. After climbing to $0.29 before easing back, the coin is once again attracting bullish speculation from both retail traders and institutions. Analysts regard this surge as part of a broader meme rotation, with liquidity shifting to the tokens with strong communities and new narratives. That shift sparks interest not only in DOGE’s breakout potential but in other meme coins getting heavy FOMO. MAGACOIN FINANCE interestingly stands out, with some analysts predicting that it may deliver 350x returns in 2025. Dogecoin technical setup The Dogecoin price recently emerged from a multi-month symmetrical triangle: a textbook bullish continuation. With trading volumes going up to three times as much, buyers have a strong conviction on that move. The chart predictions from the breakouts put near-term goals in the range of $0.40–$0.45, and subsequently $0.60. Its point of resistance is going to be a challenge to momentum before another move up. For the bullish case to remain intact, DOGE price must hold support near the 50-week EMA at $0.227. A price drop below that threshold may invalidate the breakout and lead the price back to about $0.215. Momentum indicators are also biased in favor of upward movement. RSI remains below oversold territory, and a recent MACD crossover suggests continued strength and buying interest. ETF buzz and market drivers Dogecoin’s outlook is also based on the imminent ETF launch. REX-Osprey’s DOGE ETF will arrive on September 18, according to the RIC scheme. The structure allows a faster launch but carries heavier tax burdens and weaker institutional appeal. Analysts caution this could limit inflows compared to spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the other hand, 21Shares and Grayscale have spot DOGE ETF applications pending SEC action, which are expected to be issued in October. If approved, that could give Dogecoin greater institutional support — while delays might even slow near-term momentum. Meme coin face-off Analysts are comparing Dogecoin price with MAGACOIN FINANCE as meme rotation gains strength. Projections of 350x ROI have made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most hyped tokens of the year, with traders rushing to gain exposure. On the other hand, Dogecoin price remains the veteran. It is supported by years of community loyalty, merchant adoption, and cultural relevance. Furthermore, its size also provides stability, even though it can limit explosive short-term growth. By contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the new wave of meme speculation. Its political-themed branding has resonated with a growing base of retail traders, fueling rapid momentum and widespread FOMO. Analysts say it appeals most to investors seeking high-risk, high-reward plays. Together, the two coins illustrate different sides of the meme market: DOGE as the established heavyweight, MAGACOIN FINANCE as the aggressive newcomer with sky-high projections. Conclusion Dogecoin price movement towards $0.40 is technically sound with the right technical trends and increasing trading volume. Moreover, future ETF launches and regulatory action will determine the continuation or stagnation of momentum at resistance. However, meme rotation continues to channel attention into fast-moving opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured this energy with its bold forecasts, cultural relevance, and a fast-growing community. Its 350x projections reflect the appetite for asymmetric returns seen in the past memecoin rallies. For investors, the choice is less about one or the other and more about strategy. Dogecoin offers resilience, while MAGACOIN FINANCE offers urgency and potential for exponential upside.

PayPal’s Stablecoin Now On Tron, Avalanche, & Seven Other Networks As announced by LayerZero in a blog post , PayPal USD (PYUSD) is getting a major expansion through integration with its Stargate Hydra system, allowing users to move the stablecoin to blockchains on which it is natively unavailable. This is made possible with PYUSD0, a new permissionless token that’s fully fungible with the original PYUSD. Currently, PayPal’s stablecoin is natively issued by Paxos on Abritrum, Solana, Ethereum, and Stellar. With PYUSD0, it will now also be transferable to Abstract, Aptos, Avalanche, Ink, Sei, Stable, and Tron. According to LayerZero, more networks beyond these are also set to come. Previously, PYUSD was already bridged to two other networks, Berachain (BYUSD) and Flow (USDF), and both will now be receiving upgrades to PYUSD0. This makes a total of nine networks on which the new token will be accessible. “As the stablecoin market continues its rapid growth beyond $270 billion, innovations like this are essential for creating the seamless, interoperable financial infrastructure that users and developers demand,” says David Weber, Head of Ecosystem, PayPal USD. PayPal launched its stablecoin back in 2023, becoming one of the first payment processing giants to embrace fiat-tied tokens. Since then, the firm has been taking measures to increase the reach of its coin, most recently with the Stellar version launch on Thursday. Now, with the LayerZero integration, the company has taken another step toward its goal. “By working together, we will enable PYUSD to reach new markets faster while maintaining compliance and composability from day one,” notes Weber. The PYUSD0 system is built on three pieces of infrastructure: PayPal’s stablecoin itself, Stargate Hydra, and LayerZero. Stargate, which was acquired by LayerZero last month, acts as the transfer interface, while LayerZero handles minting, burning, and deployment of PYUSD0 to the new blockchains. “With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s,” says Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO at LayerZero Labs. “Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.” Besides its stablecoin, PayPal has also been making developments in its cryptocurrency payments ecosystem lately. In late July, the payments processor firm unveiled a “Pay with Crypto” service to help merchants receive digital asset payments, and earlier this week, it also announced cryptocurrency integration into its peer-to-peer (P2P) payments system. Bitcoin Has Seen A Pullback During The Past Day Bitcoin recovered to $117,900 on Thursday, but the asset has since gone down as its price is back at $116,400. The below chart shows how the coin’s recent trajectory has looked.

A cut in interest rates is likely to benefit risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). Fed Cuts Interest Rate, Bitcoin Supply Ratio Falls According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, the latest data from Binance shows that the interest rate cut has rekindled investors’ interest in BTC. Notably, the exchange supply ratio has declined to 0.0291, hinting that investors are choosing to withdraw their BTC from exchanges and hold it for the long-term instead of selling it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? To support their analysis, Arab Chain shared the following chart, which shows a tumbling exchange supply ratio while the BTC price continues to shoot up. The analyst noted that the interest rate cut has increased risk appetite and improved liquidity in the market. This behavior shows that the Fed’s monetary policy will remain dovish for the near term, which could mitigate selling pressure on BTC for the time being. Low exchange supply is creating relative buying pressure, as Bitcoin’s stability above $115,000 further supports this trend. The analyst remarked that if BTC outflows from crypto exchanges continue at the current pace, then the digital asset may target the $120,000 resistance level. However, liquidity must continue to flow into digital assets, driven by the Fed’s decision. Arab Chain added: The continued decline in the Exchange Supply Ratio for Bitcoin, coupled with a rising price, reinforces the bullish scenario, especially if traditional markets stabilize after the Fed’s decision. Conversely, if the Exchange Supply Ratio turns upward again (if Bitcoin reenters exchanges), it could signal that investors are preparing to take profits at levels near 118K–120K. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto had similar thoughts. In an X post, the analyst shared the following chart, saying that BTC is currently stuck under the bearish fair value gap. A daily close above this gap – highlighted in red – could pave the way for a new high for BTC. Is BTC Facing A Supply Crunch? A declining exchange supply ratio further suggests that BTC may be approaching a bullish ‘supply crunch’ that could lead to significant price appreciation for the digital asset in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap? Recently, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index recorded its first spike since June 2025, indicating potential upward price pressure on BTC. Meanwhile, BTC outflows from Binance continue at a rapid pace, further reducing the digital asset’s active circulating supply. That said, some concerns still linger, specifically due to the lack of participation of whales in recent BTC price action. At press time, BTC trades at $116,374, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

On September 19, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a net inflow of an impressive $48 million. This marked another day of positive momentum, building on previous gains. Such figures are not just numbers; they represent tangible capital moving into the Ethereum market through accessible investment products.

This substantial figure highlights the significant influence of major financial institutions in driving the adoption of crypto-backed ETFs. Institutional Confidence: The consistent inflows, particularly from prominent asset managers like BlackRock, suggest increasing institutional comfort and conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Why Are Consecutive Spot ETH ETF Inflows So Significant? Two consecutive days of net inflows into Spot ETH ETFs are more than just a fleeting trend; they indicate a strengthening pattern of investor interest.

Understanding the implications of these inflows is crucial: Market Validation: Continuous inflows serve as a strong validation for Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class within traditional finance.

Mixed Performance: On the same day, Fidelity’s FETH saw net outflows of $53.4 million, and Grayscale’s Mini ETH recorded outflows of $11.3 million.

Investors are keenly watching these instruments, which offer a regulated gateway to Bitcoin exposure. The latest figures show a significant positive shift, signaling renewed confidence and growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space. Understanding the Latest Surge in Spot Bitcoin ETFs On September 19, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a notable net inflow of $222.75 million. This marks the second consecutive day of positive flows, according to financial data from TraderT. Such sustained positive movement is a key indicator for market watchers, suggesting a robust appetite for these investment products.

This substantial contribution from BlackRock underscores the growing influence of major financial institutions in the crypto arena. Conversely, Grayscale’s GBTC observed an outflow of $23.5 million. The remaining exchange-traded funds in the sector reported no significant net changes in their flows for the day. What Drives the Momentum for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The consistent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not just random fluctuations; they reflect broader market dynamics. Several factors contribute to this momentum, making these ETFs an increasingly attractive option for both retail and institutional investors. Transparency and regulatory clarity are paramount, and these products offer a structured way to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. Institutional Confidence: The participation of major asset managers like BlackRock signals a maturing market. Their involvement lends credibility and stability to the entire ecosystem. Accessibility: ETFs simplify investment in Bitcoin. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts, which many investors already use. Diversification: For many portfolios, Bitcoin offers a new avenue for diversification. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide this exposure without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges directly. Navigating the Future Landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows are positive, the landscape for Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains dynamic.

The continued growth and acceptance of these financial instruments could pave the way for further innovation in crypto investment products. Challenges still exist, including ongoing regulatory scrutiny and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the increasing demand, as evidenced by these inflows, highlights a clear trend: traditional finance is embracing digital assets.

It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment vehicle without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why are these inflows important?

This sudden downturn has left many traders pondering the immediate future and the volatility inherent in digital assets, serving as a powerful reminder of the risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? Over the last day, perpetual futures markets saw a significant wave of forced selling. When traders use leverage to open “long” positions – essentially betting that an asset’s price will rise – and the price instead drops significantly, their positions can be automatically closed, or “liquidated.” This mechanism is designed to prevent further losses beyond their initial margin. The sheer scale of these recent crypto liquidations indicates a strong, rapid downward price movement that caught many leveraged long traders completely off guard, leading to a cascade of closures. Ethereum (ETH): Experienced a staggering $86.17 million in liquidations. A remarkable 94.95% of these were from long positions, suggesting a pronounced bearish sentiment took hold for ETH in the short term. Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $42.61 million liquidated, with an even higher proportion of long positions making up 97.69%. This shows that even the market leader, often considered more stable, is not immune to sudden price corrections, impacting those who were overly optimistic. Solana (SOL): Faced $24.34 million in liquidations, with 90.73% originating from long positions. SOL’s well-known volatility often amplifies such market movements, making it particularly susceptible to rapid shifts. Why Were Long Positions So Vulnerable to These Crypto Liquidations? The overwhelming dominance of long positions in these liquidations is a critical aspect to understand. It fundamentally means that the vast majority of traders caught in this market downturn were betting on prices to go up. When prices fell sharply, these leveraged long bets were wiped out, triggering a chain reaction of selling. This scenario frequently unfolds after periods of extended bullish sentiment or market consolidation, where many traders accumulate substantial long positions, only to be “flushed out” by an abrupt price reversal. Grasping the intricate mechanics of crypto liquidations is absolutely vital for any participant navigating the derivatives market. What Are the Broader Implications of These Crypto Liquidations for the Market? Such large-scale crypto liquidations can have several significant ripple effects across the entire market. Firstly, they often contribute to further price declines as the forced selling adds intense downward pressure, creating a feedback loop. Secondly, these events can act as a crucial “reset” for the market, effectively clearing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable, organic growth, albeit usually after a period of market consolidation and recovery. Traders must always be acutely aware of the amplified risks associated with high leverage, especially in a market as inherently dynamic and unpredictable as cryptocurrency. This event serves as a stark and timely reminder that market sentiment can shift with breathtaking speed, impacting even the most confident predictions and established trends. For long-term investors, this recent event powerfully underscores the paramount importance of robust risk management strategies. This includes diversifying portfolios across different assets, diligently setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and consciously avoiding excessive leverage that can quickly magnify both gains and, more importantly, losses. While the enticing allure of quick and substantial gains is undeniably strong in crypto, the harsh reality of market volatility, vividly demonstrated by these recent crypto liquidations , unequivocally demands a disciplined and cautious approach. Thoroughly analyzing these market events can provide invaluable insights into underlying market dynamics and ultimately help refine and improve individual trading strategies for future success. How Can Traders Mitigate Risks from Future Crypto Liquidations? Navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency requires a strategic mindset, especially when faced with events like the recent wave of crypto liquidations . A key takeaway is the necessity of prudent risk management. Firstly, consider your leverage ratios carefully; while leverage can amplify profits, it equally amplifies losses, making you more susceptible to liquidation during minor price swings. Secondly, always implement stop-loss orders. These automatic sell orders can limit your downside exposure, preventing small corrections from turning into catastrophic losses. Thirdly, avoid putting all your capital into a single trade or asset; diversification can cushion the blow if one asset underperforms. Moreover, understanding market sentiment and technical indicators can offer early warnings. Look for signs of over-extension in bullish trends, which often precede sharp corrections. Staying informed about macroeconomic factors and regulatory news is also crucial, as these can significantly influence market direction. Ultimately, the goal is to protect your capital and participate sustainably in the crypto market, rather than chasing fleeting, high-risk opportunities that could lead to another round of massive crypto liquidations . In conclusion, the recent $153 million in crypto liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL serves as a powerful testament to the inherent volatility and risks of leveraged trading in the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be unsettling, they also offer invaluable lessons for traders and investors. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations, practicing diligent risk management, and maintaining a balanced perspective, participants can better navigate market turbulence and build more resilient portfolios. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and adapting to its dynamic nature is key to long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Liquidations What exactly are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because the market price moves against their bet, and their margin collateral falls below a certain threshold. This is done to prevent the trader from losing more money than they have in their account. Why do long positions get liquidated more often during a market downturn? Long positions are bets that an asset’s price will increase. During a market downturn, prices fall, which directly opposes long positions. If these positions are leveraged, even a small price drop can quickly deplete the margin, triggering automatic liquidation to cover potential losses. How can I protect my crypto investments from liquidations? To protect against liquidations, you should avoid excessive leverage, use stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level, diversify your portfolio, and maintain sufficient margin in your trading account. Always prioritize risk management. Do liquidations always mean a bearish market? Not necessarily. While large-scale long liquidations often accompany bearish price movements, liquidations can also occur for short positions during sudden price pumps. However, the dominance of long liquidations, as seen recently, typically indicates significant downward pressure and often precedes further market corrections. What is the difference between spot trading and perpetual futures in relation to liquidations? Spot trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly, with no leverage, so liquidations do not occur. Perpetual futures trading, on the other hand, involves leveraged contracts that track the price of an asset without an expiry date. It is in these leveraged futures markets that liquidations are a common risk due to margin requirements. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your fellow crypto enthusiasts!

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.8883 Market cap $888.02M Trading volume $197.63M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.9502 24-hour low $0.8871 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.28% 50-day SMA $0.8896 14-Day RSI 56.59 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.7985 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is under pressure after failing to hold above $0.90. The coin’s immediate support sits at $0.88. As it stands, bulls need to reclaim $0.90–$0.93 to stop further downside. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of September 20, WIF is trading at $0.889, with sellers pressing the price back toward the Alligator’s red support line around $0.892. The upper bound at $0.916 capped the last rebound, and now momentum is waning WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview WIF’s volume remains decent at 29.3M, but the recent string of red candles shows buyers losing grip. The MACD is flattening close to neutral, hinting at indecision but with a slight bearish lean. If the $0.89 price level holds, WIF could make recovery attempts toward $0.93. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe highlights the weakness more clearly. WIF slipped under the $0.902 level and is now hovering just above $0.890, with the next support marked at $0.859. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD histogram is deep in the red, showing steady bearish momentum, while the 21-SMA at $0.933 is keeping WIF from breaking to the upside. Unless buyers reclaim $0.90 quickly, the bearish drift may extend further. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9029 SELL SMA 5 $0.9073 SELL SMA 10 $0.9296 SELL SMA 21 $0.8771 BUY SMA 50 $0.8896 BUY SMA 100 $0.9119 SELL SMA 200 $0.7985 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8583 BUY EMA 5 $0.8420 BUY EMA 10 $0.8377 BUY EMA 21 $0.8601 BUY EMA 50 $0.8980 SELL EMA 100 $0.9038 SELL EMA 200 $1.0009 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF looks bearish in the short term. If $0.88 price level breaks, traders can expect a slide toward $0.8. However, reclaiming $0.93 could shift momentum back toward $1. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Savvy traders know that simple yet effective strategies can mean the difference between chasing hype and achieving real wealth. Meanwhile, new projects, like MAGACOIN FINANCE , are about to pick up traction as analysts shed light on what could be one of the top opportunities next year. For speculators, a blend of tested strategies and access to fledgling developments could be a successful blend. Master the Art of Dollar-Cost Averaging One of the most underrated tactics is also one of the strongest: dollar-cost averaging (DCA). Rather than make such a large commitment at one price point, investors spread their purchases over time. This relieves you of the burden of nailing market bottoms (a challenge that even professionals can’t meet). Investors get the added benefit of smoothing volatility by building a position slowly. When markets take a dip, you accumulate more tokens at lower prices – creating potential long-term gain when the market bounces back. Focus on Utility, Not Just Hype Every cycle introduces hype tokens that are pushed higher before crashing. The actual “winners” are projects with real use cases. While it showed promise in enabling DeFi and NFTs, Ripple found success in cross-border payments. The next generation of superstars will also come from projects that solve real-world problems. It’s those who focus on adoption, partnerships, and developer activity rather than memes who will more often than not enjoy long-term gains. One such utility-focused example is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike the many tokens primarily driven by speculation, its roadmap is built on actual use cases and further utility for holders. This young project is building an ecosystem where its tokens will provide access to financial tools, community incentives, and decentralized services of tomorrow, enhancing the end-user’s experience with friendly rewards for its token holders. Analysts say that emphasis on utility is what is causing early rounds to sell out so quickly. With estimates showing that early backers could see a 7800% return, MAGACOIN FINANCE is establishing itself as a project here to stay. It’s a new build, combining technology with a growing community and long-term view, that doesn’t look like anything modern on the market today. Learn to Ride Market Narratives Crypto isn’t just about technology — it is fueled by stories. Narratives such as “Bitcoin is digital gold” or “Ethereum is the foundation for decentralized apps” steer investment flows and sentiment. Understanding how to spot the next big story before it becomes a household name is a hack that separates the good investors from the great. Whether its digital tokens for real-world assets, AI-integrated coins, or in-game products, it pays to see momentum and ride the technology wave before everyone else does. The key is not just to follow the hype but to decide which of these themes are actually well-positioned, and that’s where we’re focused on as investors.” Pretty soon, investors who had brushed off early signals around DeFi in 2020 and metaverse tokens in 2021 saw other people, braver than they are (or perhaps with less good sense), seize gains that transformed their lives. Why These Hacks Matter Now With the global markets still in uncertainty and Bitcoin’s halving already past, altcoins are anticipated to have a bigger part this cycle. Those investors who can effectively blend these hacks—steady acquisition, fundamentals-based focus, narrative mastery—will be better positioned to survive the volatility and profit from opportunities. Increasing attention is currently being paid to MAGACOIN FINANCE, and new narratives are indeed emerging – and early believers can be part of the next wave. In conclusion, crypto investing doesn’t require a crystal ball – it requires discipline, strategy, and a sharp eye for emerging projects. As the market gears up for what could be another historic cycle, applying these three hacks could set investors apart. And with analysts projecting massive upside for MAGACOIN FINANCE, the window for early entry may not stay open for long.

51999336,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83785,1758340817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Historic First: Bitcoin Lands on Mars, While MAGACOIN FINANCE Attracts $13.5 Million",https://timestabloid.com/historic-first-bitcoin-lands-on-mars-while-magacoin-finance/,"With the current pace of crypto adoption growing globally, there is a dawn of new frontiers that had previously been pure science fiction. According to researchers, Bitcoin may soon be utilized outside of the planet, and it may serve as currency on Mars. Simultaneously, investors on Earth are desperately seeking the next big thing, and with MAGACOIN FINANCE raising an astonishing $13.5 million in record time , a roadmap that offers potential explosive returns. Bitcoin Goes Interplanetary Over the years, Bitcoin has been referred to as borderless money, which is beyond the limitations of traditional finance. Instead, scientists are taking that definition to the literal boundaries of human imagination: interplanetary payments. A team led by researchers Jose E. Puente and Carlos Puente has proposed a scheme known as Proof-of-transit Timestamping (PoTT), which might enable Bitcoin to become useful in Earth-Mars transactions. Rather than simply using the existing infrastructure on Earth, PoTT envisions payments traveling through the air via satellites and space relays, dropping digital marks on every waypoint. The outcome would be a verifiable record of the movement, with reliability even over millions of kilometers. This is a continuation of previous milestones. In 2018, Blockstream proved that Bitcoin was everywhere through satellite coverage of blockchain information. The first Bitcoin transaction through the International Space Station was recorded by Spacechain 2 years later. But PoTT pushes further to consider interplanetary payments as a routing and verification problem, a role that can be undertaken by networks such as Starlink, provided by SpaceX, or NASA optical communication networks. How Bitcoin Could Work on Mars The greatest space payment hurdle is not technical, but distance. The distance between Earth and Mars can require a signal between 4-24 minutes, depending on surface contact. This would be excruciatingly slow to the base layer of Bitcoin, which already handles transactions in blocks of 10 minutes. The solution offered by PoTT consists of integrating the Lightning Network technology with relay satellites. With this model, the payment would be made in only 12-15 minutes, despite the long distance. Relays would be placed between satellites where a transaction is verified and stamped every time it rolls closer to Mars. The researchers go as far as collectively explaining the worst obstacle: the two-week blackout when the Sun obscures the signals between Earth and Mars. They suggest putting up resilient relay satellites that will be set to bypass solar disruption so that the payments can still be made even during the times when there is a cosmic inconvenience. It may sound futuristic, but it raises a very tangible question: what currency is humanity going to be using if we colonise other planets? According to Puente, the most viable option for a multi-planetary civilization would be a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, which is neutral and decentralized, and unattached to any government. MAGACOIN FINANCE Raises $13.5 Million While Bitcoin eyes the stars, back on Earth, investors are turning their attention to the next breakout projects with explosive growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $13.5 million in record time , drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. What makes it stand out is not just the speed of its fundraising, but the vision behind it. Analysts are already comparing its momentum to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, when small early investments turned into life-changing gains. With audits confirming security and a roadmap that highlights continuous development, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a reputation as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. Some projections suggest early participants could see returns exceeding 7,800% , with a clear path to major exchange listings. In a market hungry for new opportunities, the project’s success so far reflects a growing belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next big name in crypto. The Future of Interplanetary Finance Returning to the Mars discussion, PoTT raises intriguing possibilities for how humans might handle money in space. Imagine astronauts receiving their salaries in Bitcoin while living on a Martian colony. Instead of dealing with intergovernmental disputes about which currency to use, they could rely on a system that is trustless and borderless. This is particularly important given the potential for geopolitical competition over Mars. Just as Bitcoin offers financial sovereignty on Earth, it could do the same on the Red Planet, ensuring colonists aren’t dependent on the policies of Earth-based governments. Of course, the technology is still theoretical. At present, Mars has no residents, only rovers and orbiters. But if settlement becomes a reality, interplanetary finance may evolve from science fiction into a necessity. Why Investors Should Pay Attention The significance of these developments is twofold. First, they show how far Bitcoin’s influence has stretched. What started as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system is now being considered for interplanetary commerce. Second, they highlight how the crypto market continues to expand into uncharted territory, both technologically and financially. For investors, this means opportunities are not just in the established names like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also in emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which combine strong fundamentals with explosive growth potential. As the market matures, those who position themselves early in promising ventures often stand to gain the most. Conclusion Bitcoin may not yet be ready to buy coffee on Mars, but the research into systems like PoTT suggests it could one day serve as the financial backbone of a multi-planetary society. While these futuristic scenarios unfold, investors today are already seeing exciting opportunities here on Earth. With $13.5 million raised quickly and projections of massive ROI , MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. As always, the crypto market rewards foresight. Those who spot the potential early often benefit the most when innovation meets adoption.

After soaring to nearly $118,000—just 5% shy of its all-time high—the market has faced renewed uncertainty. Despite this setback, experts emphasize that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains optimistic, especially as September 21 approaches, a date identified as pivotal for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Will September 21 Mark The Start Of A New Bull Run? Market analyst Timothy Peterson highlights that historically, Bitcoin has finished the year higher 70% of the time after September 21, with a median increase exceeding 50%. He has dubbed this date “Bitcoin Bottom Day,” suggesting that the odds of a price increase are significantly favorable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Expert Predicts 70% Chance Of New Highs Within Two Weeks Peterson notes that two of the three downturns in Bitcoin’s history occurred during established bear markets in 2018 and 2022, conditions that do not reflect the current market situation. This leads him to believe that the chances of a price rise are closer to 90% this year. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s track record suggests it has a nearly perfect chance of holding its gains six months post-September 21. Peterson estimates there is at least a 70% probability that Bitcoin will not drop below the $100,000 mark again. Analysts Warn Of ‘Sell the News’ Bitcoin Phase Ryan Lee, chief analyst at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, also points to the recent 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed as a factor that initially boosted Bitcoin’s price, briefly pushing it above $117,000. This cut, the first in nine months, reflects increased liquidity in the market. However, Lee cautions that the median projection of only 50 basis points in total cuts for the year could temper some of the optimism, introducing potential volatility as traders adjust their strategies. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced a dip of 5% to 8% following rate cuts before resuming its upward trend, suggesting a possible “sell the news” phase in the coming days. Related Reading: Warren Calls Out US DOJ Over Binance Settlement And Alleged Trump Ties In New Letter Despite these fluctuations, Lee remains bullish about the macroeconomic environment, asserting that lower yields on money-market funds (MMFs) are likely to direct capital toward alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a hedge in this risk-on climate, especially with approximately $7.2 trillion currently held in cash-like instruments. Looking ahead, Lee predicts that the cryptocurrency may consolidate in the near term before targeting prices between $123,000 and $150,000, should additional rate cuts materialize. Analysts at Bitfinex also share a positive outlook, projecting that with three anticipated rate cuts by the end of the year and steady inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin could reach between $125,000 and $135,000 by year-end. However, they also caution that if inflation or economic growth data hinder the Fed’s ability to proceed with further cuts, Bitcoin might stabilize within a range of $110,000 to $115,000 as institutional participation and ETF assets under management provide a solid floor.

52000961,585343,1758340843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52000961.jpeg,Gary Gensler Insists His Crypto Enforcement Actions Were Justified,https://bitcoinist.com/gary-gensler-insists-his-crypto-enforcement-actions-were-justified/,"Former US SEC Chair Gary Gensler defended his record on crypto enforcement in a television interview this week, saying he was “proud” of actions taken while he led the agency and repeating that, aside from Bitcoin, most crypto tokens lack clear fundamentals. Gensler pushed back against critics who say his approach blocked innovation, and he framed his enforcement work as aimed at protecting everyday investors. Gensler Stood By Enforcement Record According to his interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Gensler argued that many crypto tokens trade on hype more than on underlying business metrics, and he used rough figures to note there are “5 or 10 thousand” such tokens in circulation. His comments echoed past statements that a large share of crypto tokens should be treated under securities laws. Those remarks prompted fresh debate online, with some industry figures calling his stance harmful to innovation and others defending the need for strict oversight. A second line of argument around Gensler’s legacy is tied to a notable policy outcome: spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products were approved while he was chair. On January 10, 2024, the SEC issued orders allowing a set of spot Bitcoin ETP listings — a move observers said reflected both legal pressure and shifts inside the agency. That approval has been cited as one of the major market milestones from his tenure. Regulatory Shift Under New Leadership Reports have documented a clear change in tone at the SEC after leadership moved to Paul Atkins . Since that shift, the agency has stepped back from several high-profile cases that were lodged during Gensler’s time in office. Lawsuits and investigations involving big exchanges — including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken — have been dismissed or closed, and the long-running dispute with Ripple has come to an end following recent filings. Market watchers say this marks a meaningful pivot in enforcement posture at the regulator. Reaction on social platforms was swift. Some prominent crypto voices called Gensler’s comments unacceptable; posts resharing the interview included sharp criticism from known industry figures. At the same time, exchange leaders publicly emphasized that what matters now is clear rules and investor protections, not personal attacks.

While both tokens have enjoyed explosive rallies in the past, the question now is whether they can sustain momentum and reach new milestones. For Pepe, that means the elusive $0.01 level; for Shiba Inu, the much-discussed $0.000020 mark. But are these price points realistic in the long run? This article takes a closer look at market dynamics, adoption potential, and tokenomics to assess whether these goals are achievable—or if they remain a distant dream. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView PEPE is trading near 0.00001150 after a lively week. The token gained 8.18% in 7 days and 6.56% over the past month. The 6-month chart shows a 58.13% climb, putting it ahead of many meme rivals. The current range, 0.000010025-0.00001289, shows buyers stepping in on dips. The 10-day average sits at 0.00001145, above the 100-day at 0.00001110, hinting at steady upside pressure. Momentum gauges are neutral to firm, with RSI at 57.9 and stochastic at 72.57. Bulls focus on the nearest ceiling at 0.00001422; bears watch the floor at 0.000008487. Volume clusters around the middle of this band, keeping price boxed in for now. A clean push through 0.00001422 would open a run to the next barrier at 0.00001709. That move would add roughly 24% and 49% from the mid-range level in turn. Failure to hold 0.000008487 could drag price down about 26% to the deeper support at 0.000005617. Given the positive short-term trend and rising averages, the path of least resistance still tilts upward, but the coin must punch through 0.00001422 soon to keep the momentum alive. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.0055 . Adding to its growing recognition, XYZVerse has been chosen as #1 in the “ best memecoin presale ” category by BestICOlist , further validating its potential in the competitive meme coin space. At the next stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.0056 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView SHIB has slipped into a tight band after edging up 2.38% over the past week, 5.11% over the past month, and 6.88% across six months. The gains are gentle but steady, placing the token at $0.00001244-$0.0000149. Traders now see a coin that refuses to break down yet struggles to burst higher. The 10-day moving average at $0.00001347 sits just above the 100-day line at $0.0000133058, hinting at a slight upward tilt. RSI at 54.67 and Stochastic at 68.40 both hover in neutral territory, while a positive MACD shows mild upward momentum. Together they paint a picture of cautious optimism rather than hype. A push through the nearest resistance at $0.00001609 would open a path to the next cap at $0.00001854, a jump of about 18% and then 36% from today’s mid-range. Failure to break higher could drag the coin back to $0.00001119, roughly 17% lower, or even $0.00000874, near a 36% slide. Right now SHIB leans slightly toward the upside, yet the looming ceiling demands a firm surge in volume to turn promise into price. Conclusion PEPE eyes one-cent by 2030, SHIB sustains momentum as the bull wave builds; yet newcomer XYZVerse seeks to outshine both through sports-driven memes, community power, and live presale rewards.

Analyst Sees Path To $0.45,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-ready-to-bark-again-analyst-path-0-45/,"An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin could see a rally to $0.36 or even $0.45 if its price can manage to break past this resistance barrier. Dogecoin Is Retesting Upper Boundary Of A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 1-day price of Dogecoin. The pattern is a “Parallel Channel,” which forms when an asset observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. There are a few different types of parallel channels, each with a distinct orientation of the trendlines in respect to the graph axes. The Ascending Channel forms when the trendlines are angled upward. That is, when the price travels to a net upside inside the channel. Similarly, the Descending Channel has trendlines that have a negative slope. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Plunges 6.7% As Social Media Shows Overhype In the context of the current topic, neither of these versions of the Parallel Channel is of interest, but rather the most simple case of the pattern: a channel parallel to the time-axis. When the asset is moving inside this type of channel, it observes resistance at the upper line and support at the lower one, and moves in an exactly sideways manner trapped between the two. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that Dogecoin has been stuck inside for the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin retested the upper line of the Parallel Channel earlier in the month, but found rejection. The memecoin now appears to be approaching another retest of this line situated at $0.29. Generally, a break above the upper line of a Parallel Channel is considered to be a bullish signal. Thus, if DOGE can manage to surge above the pattern, it may see a sustained rally. Martinez has suggested two potential targets for the memecoin: $0.36 and $0.45. These are based on the fact that Parallel Channel breakouts can be of the same length as the height of the channel; the former corresponds to half this distance and latter to the full one. It now remains to be seen whether Dogecoin can surpass this huddle in the near future and if any sustained bullish momentum will follow.

Beginners often struggle to separate hype from substance, which makes it tempting to chase every breakout headline. Yet the investors who tend to thrive over years, not months, are those who enter with a strategy. That means focusing less on quick flips and more on building sustainable positions. It’s not about predicting the next candle – it’s about structuring decisions around principles that stand up over multiple cycles. And while Bitcoin and Ethereum are the natural starting points, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now entering the discussion as potential long-term positions for those willing to diversify early. Diversification: balancing majors and emerging assets One of the most common mistakes new investors make is going all in on a single asset. Bitcoin has history and stability, Ethereum offers smart contract utility, and both are core holdings in many portfolios. But long-term success often comes from balancing these anchors with emerging projects. Diversification smooths risk: when one sector slows, another can shine. Meme tokens, DeFi plays, and new Layer 1s can all offer asymmetric upside – provided beginners size them modestly. The key isn’t to guess perfectly, but to ensure exposure across categories so that opportunity has a chance to compound. Timing entries with patience Markets reward patience more than speed. Beginners who rush in at peak euphoria often find themselves underwater when corrections hit. Long-term strategies emphasize dollar-cost averaging – buying smaller amounts consistently, rather than trying to time the perfect dip. This builds a base position that can weather volatility without constant stress. Patience also extends to holding periods. Selling at the first sign of weakness might protect against short-term losses, but it often means missing the exponential growth phases that define crypto’s history. Success comes from respecting cycles and allowing assets the time to mature. This approach explains why many investors are watching emerging presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Social media buzz shows thousands have already redeemed PATRIOT50X, amplifying their MAGACOIN FINANCE stacks and fueling FOMO for those still on the sidelines. Presale insiders whisper that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 14,500% returns , making it the second chance investors prayed for after missing DOGE and PEPE. Its momentum is undeniable, and analysts warn it won’t stay under the radar much longer. What makes this compelling for beginners is that it illustrates how early positioning works. Those who understand the importance of vetted audits, token distribution fairness, and community traction can see why projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE capture early inflows. It’s not about chasing every presale; it’s about identifying the rare ones where fundamentals and culture align. Risk management: protecting your capital Crypto’s volatility is legendary, which makes risk management non-negotiable. Beginners should decide in advance how much capital they’re willing to allocate – and accept the possibility of losses without overextending. Stop-loss orders can help limit downside in active trading, but for long-term investors, risk management is often about position sizing. Never put so much into a single coin that its collapse would derail your portfolio. Instead, spread allocations and keep a reserve in stablecoins for flexibility. This way, when new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE or others arise, beginners can participate without having to liquidate existing positions at bad prices. Staying informed without drowning in noise Crypto never sleeps, and neither does its news cycle. For beginners, information overload is a real hazard. Long-term success depends on curating sources carefully: following reliable analysts, using data dashboards, and engaging with communities that emphasize facts over speculation. Social media can amplify FOMO and panic, but it can also highlight early narratives if approached with discipline. The trick is to filter aggressively. Check whether claims are backed by audits, roadmaps, or verifiable metrics. Beginners who master the balance between being informed and not being overwhelmed will find they make clearer, calmer decisions. Community and culture as growth signals One overlooked strategy for beginners is paying attention to community strength. The most explosive crypto stories are not just about technology – they’re about people rallying behind a vision. DOGE thrived because of humor and identity. PEPE surged because of culture-driven liquidity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing a similar dynamic, with community traction already spreading across Telegram and X. For long-term investors, this cultural base is more than hype – it’s a network effect that supports liquidity and adoption. Beginners who treat community health as a fundamental metric often spot opportunities before charts reflect them. Conclusion For newcomers, crypto investing doesn’t need to be chaos. A long-term playbook built on diversification, patience, risk management, and informed decision-making can smooth the ride. At the same time, beginners should remain open to emerging opportunities that align fundamentals with momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its PATRIOT50X buzz and whispers of 14,500% potential returns, exemplifies how early projects can fit into a broader strategy. The bull and bear cycles will continue, but those who combine discipline with selective risk can thrive across them. Crypto’s story is still unfolding, and beginners who build the right habits now could find themselves well-positioned for the next decade of growth.

Notably, the RCMP seized digital assets worth 56 million CAD (40 million USD) from an unlicensed crypto exchange. Canadian Police Seize Crypto Worth $40 Million Canada’s national police – the RCMP – recently shared details pertaining to the biggest bust of an unlicensed crypto exchange in the country’s history. The federal police agency confiscated digital assets worth $40 million. Notably, the assets were seized from a non-KYC crypto trading platform, TradeOgre. The incident also marked the first time ever that a digital asset trading platform was dismantled by Canadian law enforcement. Following a tip from Europol, the Money Laundering Investigative Team (MLIT) opened the case in June 2024. During their investigation, the agency found that TradeOgre violated Canadian laws and regulations about virtual asset trading platforms. The statement reads: Investigators have reason to believe that the majority of funds transacted on TradeOgre came from criminal sources. The main attraction of this type of platform, which doesn’t require users to identify themselves to make an account, is that it hides the source of funds. This is a common tactic used by criminal organizations that launder money. It is worth highlighting that TradeOgre’s website now displays a banner from the RCMP, mentioning the seizure of crypto assets from the platform. The official statement adds that the transaction data obtained from the platform is being analyzed, and charges are likely to follow. Digital Asset Seizures Around The World The RCMP’s seizure of TradeOgre’s crypto assets is just the latest development in the global crypto seizure trend. Due to crypto’s lack of standard global regulations, nefarious elements tend to take advantage of the lack of oversight on the new asset class. In July 2025, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) shared details on one of its largest-ever digital assets seizures. At the time, the DOJ confiscated digital assets worth $225 million, associated with an extensive network of “pig butchering” scams. Similarly, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) – in association with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – seized more than $10 million worth of cryptocurrencies while targeting the Sinaloa cartel’s operations in Miami, Florida. In related news, the UK Government recently shared plans to sell confiscated BTC worth $7 billion, in an attempt to finance a part of the public budget. However, how much of it has already been sold remains to be seen. Most recently, US authorities seized USDT worth $600,000 from an Iranian national accused of supplying critical technology to Iran’s regime. At press time, BTC trades at $115,919, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Canada|crypto|crypto seizure|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|RCMP|Royal Canadian Mounted Police|TradeOgre,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 05:00:51

Analyst Asks,https://cryptopotato.com/are-you-properly-positioned-for-xrps-face-melting-rally-analyst-asks/,"TL;DR Another analyst has weighed in on XRP’s price chart, indicating that the asset’s upcoming rally will melt faces. For now, though, Ripple’s token continues to consolidate and is even close to breaking below a key support level again. EtherNasyonaL, a popular crypto analyst on X, outlined a possible scenario for XRP in the near future that relies on historic data, and especially its performance during the 2017 cycle. The chartist noted that the asset is currently following a very similar path, which sent it flying eight years ago. If history is to repeat, the analyst predicted that XRP could resume its bull run from earlier this year and peak somewhere between $5 and $7 in 2025. Naturally, similar mindblowing price projections excite the XRP Army, and they are quick to pick up and comment on them. Ripple Bull Winkle, one of the loudest on X, was among the first. In a recent video, he outlined several bullish factors for Ripple’s native token for the near future, including regulatory clarity after the conclusion of the lawsuit against the US SEC. Additionally, he noted the network’s building infrastructure, impressive partnerships as of late, and the highly anticipated (but not guaranteed) approvals for spot XRP ETFs. Such a product already reached the US markets this week, but the majority of applications sitting on the regulator’s desk are still to be greenlighted. However, experts, as well as Ripple Bull Winkle, remain bullish on these approvals, as current odds are above 90%. Consequently, the analyst doubled down on the “face-melting rally predictions” for XRP and asked his followers whether they are adequately positioned before this happens.

It has pushed toward new highs as interest gathers pace and conditions look more favorable. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also racing upward, buoyed by tech upgrades and growing ETF chatter that could bring more big money in Q4. As BTC eyes key resistance zones, ETH’s recent gains suggest its infrastructure and DeFi use cases are increasingly appealing to both traders and institutions. And lurking in this backdrop is an emerging altcoin project, Remittix . It is an innovative payments-focused ecosystem that could ride this wave of institutional adoption and real world demand. Bitcoin: BTC Eyes Breakouts Towards $125,000+ Bitcoin has recently been trading near $115,746, testing resistance that held it back before. If BTC price clears that zone decisively, many analysts expect a run toward $125,000–$150,000, with some more aggressive models pushing toward $180,000 by year-end. Other analysts say that Bitcoin may be forming the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders. It is believed that there is a potential dip to $112,000 before a rally to $130,000 . Several believe that once BTC sustains a move above $116,000, momentum will accelerate. One analyst pointed out that volume is consolidating, meaning accumulation is happening beneath the surface. Ethereum: ETH Gearing Up for Institutional & Tech-Fueled Gains Ethereum briefly saw its price climb past $4,500, with key resistance around $4,800 forming the next target in many analysts’ charts. Sustained gains depend on both Layer-2 developments and continued demand from staking, DeFi protocols, and possibly ETH-based ETFs. Reports show that 820,000 Ethereum tokens, worth $3.80 billion, were bought by whales within 72 hours. Some ETH analysts believe a push above $5,000 is likely if Bitcoin continues its trend upward, especially with favorable macro conditions. Others caution that regulatory risks or slower adoption of scaling solutions might slow ETH’s ascent, suggesting support zones between $3,600-$4,000 will be important if dips happen. Remittix: A Payments Altcoin Ready for Institutional & Community Growth Remittix enters this market moment as a project built around real payments, security, and usability. Unlike many that promise utility in vague terms, this one is delivering tangible features: wallet beta testing is live, the team is fully verified by CertiK (a top blockchain security firm), and there are confirmed listings on centralized exchanges BitMart and LBank. In comparison to Ethereum or other layer-1 / layer-2 altcoins, Remittix aims for lower gas fees, faster crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries, and strong community rewards (including a 15% bonus when someone refers a new user, paid in USDT directly). On top of that, Remittix is running a $250,000 giveaway to grow awareness and reward early adopters. What Sets Remittix Apart Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation. Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms. Utility-first token powering real transaction volume. Momentum is building as beta wallet testing is now live. Why Buying Remittix Now Looks Like More Than Hype Remittix is not just another token riding the BTC and ETH buzz. It is a project with infrastructure, security, community, and utility in motion. The beta wallet is live. CertiK has verified the team. Listings on BitMart and LBank give real liquidity. There’s an active referral reward program, a $250,000 giveaway, and a product roadmap aimed at payments across 30+ countries. For those seeking the next big altcoin with passive income potential, low gas fees, and a project solving real world problems in DeFi and PayFi, Remittix offers a strong case.

People with knowledge of the matter said the deal would see Oracle provide Meta with infrastructure to build and roll out AI models over several years. They added that the agreement’s size could grow, with terms still under negotiation. Shares of Oracle Corp. closed 4% higher Friday after reports of the deal surfaced. It rose to $308.66 in New York. If completed, the agreement would see Oracle supply Meta with massive computing firepower for training and deploying artificial intelligence models, to complement Meta’s existing cloud infrastructure capabilities. Oracle’s stock has jumped over 80% in 2025 Oracle’s latest move follows its agreement to deliver 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity for OpenAI, enough energy to power several hundred thousand homes per gigawatt. Shortly after the partnership was announced, the Wall Street Journal, citing sources, even reported that the project could be worth as much as $300 billion over five years. Overall, the company’s stock has climbed more than 80% in 2025, lifted by surging AI infrastructure demand from customers, including OpenAI and Meta. The bulk of that rally followed last week’s earnings, where the company reported a 359% year-over-year jump in total remaining performance obligations, reaching $455 billion. The figure represents more than a fourfold increase from last year’s level and is roughly four times larger than Google’s backlog. Bloomberg Intelligence even noted it could be a sign that Oracle’s cloud growth could soon outpace Google’s. CEO Safra Catz had even commented, saying, “It was an astonishing quarter, and demand for Oracle cloud infrastructure continues to build.” She added that over the quarter, Oracle inked four multibillion-dollar contracts with three clients, and more deals are expected in the near future, setting the stage for obligations to climb above $500 billion. Oracle took a while to decide on its cloud infrastructure strategy According to Bloomberg, Oracle also provides computing power for Musk’s xAI via a Utah facility. It is also putting together tens of thousands of Nvidia chips in Singapore. Moreover, the company faces commitments worth tens of billions to build massive data centers at a time of tight energy and materials supply. Insiders claimed the company will allocate over $1 billion annually to fuel gas generators at its West Texas data center rather than wait for a grid connection. However, people familiar with the matter said Oracle’s resurgence was built on persuading CEO Safra Catz to prioritize cloud and sign major customers like TikTok, and the growing influence of forthright executive Clay Magouyrk. They noted that there had been extended friction around defining OCI’s role within the company. Reportedly, some executives viewed OCI as a tool to protect the core database business and update Oracle’s applications. In contrast, others pushed to take on Amazon and Microsoft in the broader cloud market, aiming for a share of an industry worth hundreds of billions annually. The effort to secure Catz’s support took time. Her concerns over cost and skepticism over the economics of cloud infrastructure drove OCI to start small. However, major customer wins such as TikTok and later OpenAI helped persuade her and other leadership to back a more aggressive strategy.

The city has announced a groundbreaking initiative to directly sell seized crypto assets from individuals who have failed to pay their local taxes. This proactive approach marks a significant evolution in how authorities are addressing digital asset ownership and tax enforcement. Cheongju’s Groundbreaking Approach to Seized Crypto Assets On September 20, Cheongju City officially confirmed its strategy to open a dedicated cryptocurrency exchange account. This account will serve as the central hub for managing and liquidating digital assets confiscated from tax delinquents. The city’s plan is straightforward: transfer the seized crypto assets into this government-registered account and then proceed with their liquidation if the overdue taxes remain unpaid. Direct Sales: Unlike traditional methods that might involve third-party auctions, Cheongju is taking direct control of the sale process. Government-Registered Account: This ensures transparency and adherence to regulatory standards during the liquidation. Targeted Enforcement: The current focus is on 161 individuals who collectively owe a substantial 1.5 billion won, approximately $1.1 million, in local taxes. This initiative not only streamlines the recovery process but also sends a clear message about the city’s determination to enforce tax laws in the digital age. It’s a crucial step towards ensuring fairness for all taxpayers. Why Direct Sales of Seized Crypto? The decision to directly sell seized crypto assets highlights several key advantages for the city. Firstly, it allows for greater control over the timing and method of sale, potentially maximizing recovery values. Secondly, it reduces reliance on external brokers or intermediaries, which can often add layers of complexity and cost. Moreover, the direct sale mechanism demonstrates the city’s adaptability to the evolving financial landscape. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so does the potential for its misuse in tax evasion. Cheongju’s strategy provides a robust framework for dealing with such challenges head-on. This approach also serves as a strong deterrent for others contemplating similar tax evasion schemes involving digital assets. It signals that cryptocurrency is not an untouchable realm when it comes to legal and financial obligations. The Impact of Cheongju’s Seized Crypto Initiative Cheongju City’s pioneering move is likely to have far-reaching implications, not just within South Korea but globally. Other municipalities and national governments are undoubtedly observing this initiative closely. If successful, it could set a new precedent for how authorities worldwide handle seized crypto assets. Benefits of this approach include: Enhanced Tax Recovery: A more efficient way to reclaim unpaid taxes, benefiting public services. Deterrence: A clear warning to tax delinquents that digital assets are not immune to seizure. Legal Clarity: Helps establish clearer legal frameworks for the seizure and liquidation of cryptocurrencies. However, this innovative approach also comes with its own set of challenges. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets means that the value of seized crypto can fluctuate rapidly. This volatility could impact the final amount recovered and requires careful timing for liquidation. Additionally, handling digital assets demands specialized technical expertise and robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Cheongju City will need to ensure its systems are secure and its personnel are adequately trained. Navigating the Future of Seized Crypto Enforcement The landscape of digital asset enforcement is continually evolving. Cheongju City’s initiative is a testament to the growing sophistication of government agencies in adapting to new technologies. It underscores the global trend of authorities becoming more adept at tracing, seizing, and liquidating digital assets. For individuals, this development highlights the critical importance of fulfilling tax obligations, regardless of the asset class. The days of using cryptocurrency as an untraceable means to avoid taxes are rapidly drawing to a close. Governments are developing powerful tools to ensure compliance. Ultimately, Cheongju’s bold action provides valuable insights into the future of financial enforcement. It suggests a world where digital assets are fully integrated into legal and tax frameworks, ensuring that everyone contributes their fair share. Cheongju City’s decision to directly sell seized crypto assets from tax delinquents is a landmark development. It represents a significant stride in digital asset enforcement, demonstrating a proactive and innovative approach to tax recovery. This initiative not only promises to recoup substantial unpaid taxes but also establishes a crucial precedent for how governments can effectively manage and liquidate digital assets in the future. It’s a clear indication that the digital frontier is no longer a hiding place for financial obligations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Cheongju City doing with seized crypto? Cheongju City has opened a cryptocurrency exchange account to directly sell digital assets seized from local tax delinquents who have failed to pay their overdue taxes. How much crypto has been seized in Cheongju? The current enforcement targets 161 individuals with a combined 1.5 billion won (approximately $1.1 million) in unpaid local taxes, implying a corresponding value of seized crypto assets. Why is Cheongju selling crypto directly? Direct sales allow the city greater control over the liquidation process, potentially maximizing recovery values, reducing reliance on intermediaries, and demonstrating a proactive stance against tax evasion in the digital realm. Will other cities follow Cheongju’s example? It is highly probable. Cheongju’s initiative is being closely watched by other municipalities and national governments, and if successful, it could set a new standard for how authorities worldwide handle seized crypto assets for tax enforcement. What are the risks involved in selling seized crypto? Key risks include market volatility, which can affect the recovered value, and the need for specialized technical expertise and robust security measures to manage and liquidate digital assets safely.

Taylor Swift Shakes Off Justin Baldoni Deposition News of Baldoni’s latest legal move comes just one week after Judge Lewis Liman rejected his team’s request for an extension to depose Taylor Swift – a longtime friend of Lively’s, though their current relationship status remains unclear. Liman argued that Baldoni’s lawyers waited too long to depose Swift and noted that Baldoni’s camp had withdrawn a subpoena sent to the pop star this past spring after voluntarily being provided information by Swift’s legal team. “Discovery has been going on in this case for approximately six months,” Liman said. “They have offered no evidence that they have served a renewed subpoena on Swift… Having failed to demonstrate appropriate diligence, the requested extension is denied.” SBF Awaits Key Appeal Date Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried is serving his 25-year sentence for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme behind bars at FCI Terminal Island, a low-security prison in his home state of Southern California. Oral arguments for his appeal are scheduled for November 4 at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. However, with the average criminal appeal success rate historically low, it remains to be seen if Shapiro will be successful in overturning Bankman-Fried’s conviction.

According to the trumpcard.gov website, individuals can pay $1 million to receive US residency after undergoing a vetting process and paying additional processing fees. Corporations can secure residency for employees for $2 million per worker. There is an additional option featured as a “Trump Platinum Card,” which is priced at $5 million. Holders will be permitted to spend up to 270 days in the United States annually without being subject to taxes on non-US income. “Today we are proud to announce THE TRUMP GOLD CARD,” President Trump wrote on his Truth Social account Friday. Trump cards to replace EB-1 and EB-2 visas Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who joined Trump in the Oval Office for the launch yesterday, said the Gold Card program would replace the EB-1 and EB-2 visa categories, previously available to individuals with “extraordinary ability” or advanced degrees. President Trump’s Gold Card announcement. Source: Truth Social “We were taking in the bottom quartile… We are going to stop doing that. We are going to only take extraordinary people at the very top, instead of people trying to take the jobs from Americans,” Lutnick told reporters. The administration initially plans to issue 80,000 Gold Cards, but could also phase out more visa programs if the new model succeeds. The website for the program, launched after a waiting list opened in June, includes an application form requesting names, regions, and email addresses from prospective applicants. In the executive order published on the White House website, Trump bashed the previous administration’s immigration policies. The order argued that former President Joe Biden allowed millions of unauthorized migrants to cross into the country, which was a danger to national security. The document accused international cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and foreign actors of taking advantage of the US “open borders policies,” adding that some towns and cities were overwhelmed to the point of declaring emergencies. “It is a priority of my administration to realign federal immigration policy with the nation’s interests by ending illegal immigration and prioritizing the admission of aliens who will affirmatively benefit the nation, including successful entrepreneurs, investors, and businessmen and women,” the order stated. Raising revenue with tightened immigration laws Lutnick said the Gold Card could generate at least $100 billion, supporting Trump’s remarks that the money would be used to lower taxes and pay down the $36 trillion and counting US debt. “The main thing is we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” Trump said at the White House. Some policymakers have been making whispers that such a change might require congressional approval, since the current visa categories were created by statute. It is not clear how soon the cards could be issued. The executive order specifies that applications will be adjudicated by the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security. It directs them to treat the required financial contribution as proof of “exceptional business ability and national benefit,” consistent with existing provisions under US immigration law. The Trump administration’s Gold Card comes against the backdrop of discussions to change the H-1B visa system, which is used by technology firms to hire skilled foreign workers. Under the proposed changes, applicants for H-1B visas would be required to pay a $100,000 fee. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Some analysts believe the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive rally in the coming months. Related Reading: SUI Breakout In The Horizon? Price Eyes $4 Retest As Momentum Builds ADA Holds Key Support Zone Following Thursday’s market rally, Cardano has seen its price retrace 4% in the last 24 hours, failing to reclaim the range high for the second time over the past week. The altcoin has been trading between $0.72-$0.96 since July, hitting a local high of $1.01 last month. Despite the dip, ADA has held the $0.85-$90 zone as support, attempting to stabilize around this area throughout Friday morning. Analyst Sebastian suggested that the cryptocurrency must “start setting a new higher high, otherwise we could find ourselves in a head and shoulders pattern, which could result in a bigger retrace.” Cardano has been trading above an ascending support trendline since early August, bouncing from this key level twice this month. To the analyst, ADA’s trend will remain bullish as long as the price holds the trendline. On the contrary, a breakdown from this level could see the altcoin retrace to the macro support zone, between $0.50-$0.60. Market Watcher Altcoin Gordon pointed out that ADA recently broke out of its multi-month descending resistance after reclaiming the $0.85 level last week. Since then, the cryptocurrency has retested the trendline area as support, confirming the breakout. To Gordon, if the price continues to hold above this level, Cardano could see “a HUGE move to the upside.” Meanwhile, analyst Crypto Kid asserted that Q4 seasonality could see the altcoin repeat its 2024 end-of-year playbook. Notably, ADA broke out of its nine-month downtrend line during the November 2024 run, rallying 270% to its three-year high of $1.32. Now, the cryptocurrency displays a similar price action, retesting this level in the weekly timeframe multiple times over the past two months. “I’m betting on ADA repeating its history by breaking out October/November this year,” the analyst wrote. Cardano ETFs To Fuel Q4 Rally? In a late Thursday post, Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson also shared a bold outlook, affirming that it is “going to break the internet.” Despite not offering more details, the community noted that the recent growing momentum of crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could propel ADA’s rally. On Friday, Grayscale Investments launched its Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC), the first multi-asset crypto ETF launched in the US. The investment product holds the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the digital asset manager’s request to convert its Grayscale Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund into an ETF earlier this week. Since the announcement, investors consider the odds of a spot ADA ETF approval are higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set Up For ‘Promising’ Q4, Next Two Weeks Could Be Decisive According to data from the prediction platform Polymarket, the chances of the SEC approving the investment product in 2025 have increased from 79% on Wednesday to 91%. Notably, the regulatory agency delayed the deadline for Grayscale’s spot Cardano Exchange-Traded Fund in August, postponing the final decision date to October 26, 2025. Many expect that most spot crypto-based ETFs will be approved at the start of Q4, which could fuel a “spicy end-of-year” for many altcoins, including ADA. As of this writing, Cardano is trading at $0.89, a 1% decline in the weekly timeframe.

NBA star Kevin Durant has regained control of a Coinbase account that had been inactive for about 10 years, according to reports. The account, opened after a 2016 dinner where Bitcoin was discussed, had been unreachable to Durant and his business partner Rich Kleiman until this week. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed the recovery on X. Lost Credentials Locked Funds Based on reports , the issue boiled down to lost login details. Kleiman told reporters the holdout was the result of “user error.” That meant the Bitcoin stayed untouched while the market moved dramatically. At the time of the original purchase, Bitcoin traded at roughly $600 per coin. That figure stood in stark contrast to prices in 2025, which have climbed past $117,000 per coin. We got this fixed. Account recovery complete! https://t.co/TWYFpQkXsb — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 19, 2025 The pair did not access or sell the holdings because they could not sign in. The inactivity effectively left the position static as the asset’s market value climbed over the years. Reports have made clear that exact figures — how many coins sat in that account and the total current value — remain private. How The Recovery Was Confirmed Reports say Coinbase staff worked through account recovery procedures with Durant’s team. Brian Armstrong’s post on X was cited as confirmation that the exchange completed the recovery process. Public statements from Kleiman also framed the matter as administrative rather than technical, suggesting standard identity checks and support channels were used. No source has published the precise steps taken during the recovery, and Coinbase has not released an itemized timeline of its actions. That silence leaves room for questions about how long the process took and what documentation was required to reestablish access after such a long dormancy. Durant’s entry into crypto traces back to a 2016 dinner hosted by venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, where the subject came up repeatedly and prompted Durant and Kleiman to open the Coinbase account that later made headlines. What Remains Unknown Several key details are still missing from public accounts. Neither Durant nor Kleiman has disclosed the number of Bitcoin in the account. The original amount invested also has not been confirmed, though the low $600 per coin price at purchase means any holding would have grown many times over by today’s values.

The move, if implemented, would represent a significant shift in the regulatory approach, as it would allow applicants to meet generic listing standards rather than undergoing lengthy individual vetting. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan described the potential development as a pivotal moment for the industry, referring to it as “ETPalooza.” According to the Coinbase report, the SEC is considering adjustments that would simplify the listing process, which analysts believe could pave the way for a wide range of crypto ETFs. The timing, as early as next month, signals an acceleration in regulatory openness toward digital asset products. Hougan noted that the SEC’s adoption of generic listing requirements would be a major milestone for the industry, emphasizing that it would mark crypto’s entry into what he described as the “big leagues.” COINBASE: NEW CRYPTO ETFs COULD BEGIN TRADING AS SOON AS OCTOBER AFTER SEC RULE CHANGE + SEVERAL XRP ETFs COULD LAUNCH SOON Documented. pic.twitter.com/v4hWzmeV3U — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 18, 2025 Expanding ETF Applications Data referenced in the report shows that the SEC currently has applications for more than 90 new crypto ETF products under review. These include funds tied to XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and other leading cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart added that the next 12 to 18 months could see hundreds of crypto-related exchange-traded products approved, signaling a considerable broadening of available market options. SMQKE drew particular attention to the role of XRP in these developments. Several applicants for XRP ETFs reportedly amended their filings with the SEC in recent weeks. Analysts interpret this as a possible indication that an approval and subsequent launch may be approaching. The potential introduction of several XRP-based ETFs is being closely monitored, as it would mark one of the most prominent instances of a digital asset gaining an investment vehicle on regulated exchanges. Market Expectations and Investor Sentiment The commentary following SMQKE’s report reflects strong expectations from investors. X user Erik G responded by suggesting that the development could lead to capital inflows into the broader crypto ecosystem, with subsequent price appreciation across major digital assets. He remarked that long-term holders who have remained committed despite previous market challenges may now see the benefits of their patience. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market observers argue that the introduction of multiple ETFs, including those tied to XRP, could enhance liquidity and accessibility for both institutional and retail investors. If approved, the products would also give traditional market participants regulated avenues to gain exposure to digital assets, which has long been seen as a crucial step for mainstream adoption. Outlook for the Coming Months If the SEC finalizes the rule change in October, the approval pipeline for crypto ETFs is expected to move significantly faster. With over 90 applications in progress and industry experts forecasting potentially hundreds of launches within the next year and a half, the coming period may reshape the digital asset investment landscape. The developments emphasized by SMQKE align with growing expectations that regulatory clarity will unlock new opportunities for digital assets in the U.S. financial system. As regulatory adjustments converge with industry demand, the months ahead may mark one of the most active periods for crypto-related investment products in the United States.

For many traders, understanding market sentiment is absolutely crucial. One powerful metric that offers a glimpse into this sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio. This ratio helps us gauge whether traders are leaning towards anticipating price increases (going long) or expecting declines (going short) in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Paying attention to these subtle shifts can provide a significant edge in navigating the market. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Really Mean? At its core, the long/short ratio for BTC perpetual futures represents the proportion of open positions held by long traders versus short traders on an exchange. When the percentage of long positions is higher, it generally suggests a bullish sentiment among participants, indicating a collective belief that prices will rise. Conversely, a higher percentage of short positions signals a more bearish outlook, with traders anticipating a downward price movement. This data is particularly insightful for perpetual futures, which are derivatives contracts without an expiry date, designed to closely track the underlying asset’s spot price. Monitoring these ratios on major exchanges provides a comprehensive view of how professional and retail traders are positioning themselves. It’s akin to taking the market’s temperature, offering a real-time snapshot of collective trader expectations and helping to identify potential areas of support or resistance based on sentiment alone. Decoding Current BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment Across Top Exchanges Let’s dive into the most recent 24-hour long/short position ratio for BTC perpetual futures across three of the world’s leading crypto futures exchanges, ranked by open interest. This data offers a fascinating look at current market positioning and the prevailing sentiment: Overall Market: The aggregated sentiment across these top exchanges shows Long 49.75% / Short 50.25%. This indicates a slight, yet noticeable, lean towards short positions collectively, suggesting a cautious or slightly bearish outlook across the broader market. Binance: On this massive exchange, a key player in the crypto derivatives space, the ratio stands at Long 47.22% / Short 52.78%. Binance traders are clearly expressing a stronger bearish bias, with a significant majority positioned for a price decline. This could reflect a lack of immediate confidence among its user base. Bybit: In contrast, Bybit reveals a ratio of Long 50.75% / Short 49.25%. Here, the sentiment is marginally bullish, with more traders betting on an upward movement for Bitcoin. This indicates a segment of the market retaining optimism. Gate.io: Gate.io shows an even stronger bullish leaning with Long 52.15% / Short 47.85%. Traders on Gate.io appear more optimistic about Bitcoin’s immediate future, perhaps anticipating a rebound or continuation of an upward trend. This mixed bag of data highlights the diverse perspectives within the BTC perpetual futures market. While the overall trend across the top three exchanges leans slightly bearish, individual platforms exhibit varying degrees of optimism and pessimism. This divergence can sometimes signal market uncertainty or an ongoing battle between different trading factions, making the next price move less predictable. Actionable Insights: Navigating the BTC Perpetual Futures Market with This Data So, how can you effectively use this information to inform your own trading decisions? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a valuable tool, but it’s most effective when integrated as part of a broader analytical strategy. It’s not a standalone crystal ball, but rather a powerful sentiment indicator that complements other forms of analysis. Here are some crucial benefits of monitoring these ratios: Gauge Market Extremes: Extremely high long or short ratios can sometimes precede a significant market reversal. For instance, if everyone is overwhelmingly long, it raises the question: who is left to buy? This scenario often signals an impending correction as buying pressure exhausts. Identify Divergence: Significant differences in ratios between major exchanges can highlight localized sentiment shifts or even potential arbitrage opportunities, although these are typically fleeting. Such divergences can also point to varying regional or demographic trading behaviors. Confirm or Contradict Trends: If the price is rising and the long ratio is also increasing, it can confirm the strength of the bullish trend, suggesting conviction among buyers. Conversely, a rising short ratio during a downtrend can confirm bearish momentum, indicating strong selling pressure. However, if the ratio contradicts the price action, it might signal a potential reversal. However, it’s vital to consider these challenges: Lagging Indicator: Sometimes, the ratio reacts to price movements rather than predicting them, meaning it confirms a trend rather than forecasting it. Whale Influence: Large institutional or individual traders (often referred to as “whales”) can significantly skew these ratios with their substantial positions, potentially creating misleading signals for smaller, less capitalized traders. Not a Guarantee: No single indicator guarantees future price movements. Always combine sentiment data with thorough technical analysis, fundamental understanding of Bitcoin, and broader macroeconomic factors. For instance, observing Binance’s strong short bias while other exchanges are slightly long might suggest that a significant portion of the market expects a downturn, despite pockets of optimism elsewhere. This insight encourages caution and a deeper look into other technical indicators, such as order books and funding rates, before making a move. Ultimately, understanding the collective positioning in BTC perpetual futures empowers you to make more nuanced and strategic trading decisions. In conclusion, keeping a vigilant eye on the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio provides a fascinating and often insightful perspective on market sentiment. While it’s just one crucial piece of the intricate crypto puzzle, it offers a valuable window into the collective mindset of traders positioning themselves in the dynamic digital asset space. By understanding these proportions, you can better contextualize price movements and refine your trading approach, making more informed decisions in your journey through the volatile world of digital assets. This metric is undeniably powerful for those seeking to understand the deeper currents of the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a BTC perpetual future? A1: A BTC perpetual future is a type of derivatives contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual futures track the spot price of Bitcoin very closely through a funding rate mechanism. Q2: How is the long/short ratio for BTC perpetual futures calculated? A2: The long/short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total open interest of long positions by the total open interest of short positions on an exchange. Some platforms might present it as a percentage breakdown, as seen in this article. Q3: Does a high long ratio for BTC perpetual futures always mean the price will go up? A3: Not necessarily. While a high long ratio indicates bullish sentiment, it can also suggest that the market is becoming over-leveraged on the long side. This can sometimes lead to a “long squeeze” if the price moves against them, causing rapid liquidations and a sharp price drop. It’s a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. Q4: Which exchanges are included in the “top 3 crypto futures exchanges by open interest”? A4: The specific exchanges can vary slightly over time as open interest fluctuates. However, typically, these top three spots are held by major platforms like Binance, Bybit, OKX, or Gate.io, which consistently have the highest volume and open interest in BTC perpetual futures. Q5: How often is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data updated? A5: This data is typically updated in real-time or near real-time by analytics platforms and exchanges. The 24-hour ratio, as discussed in this article, provides an aggregated view over the past day, but minute-by-minute data is often available for active traders.

The two assets have found themselves back in the spotlight once again due to very different reasons: prices, flows, and macro headlines. And with traders gearing up to make the next big move, other traders are also looking at higher-upside plays. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to appear in discussions: a new project that has done audits, promises transparency, and investor trust. It has projections among analysts of up to a 55x surge – a dream that you aren’t likely to hear talked about at the gold pits or on Bitcoin blue chips. Bitcoin vs. Gold Market Caps The most notable contrast between Bitcoin and gold is sheer scale. CoinGecko and the World Gold Council reported that the market capitalization of gold is currently estimated at $25.39 trillion , whereas Bitcoin is estimated at approximately $2.26 trillion . To be on an equal level with gold, Bitcoin would have to increase its value to approximately $1.27 million per coin , which is 10 times higher than its current value. This disparity underscores the magnitude of what Bitcoin enthusiasts deem yet achievable. Achieving the same level as gold would imply reaching record levels of adoption not only among retail traders but through institutional customer portfolios, central banks, and reserves, as well. Diverging Performance Bitcoin has significantly surpassed gold even in a long-term perspective. Over the last five years, Bitcoin has increased its price by over 1,000% compared with the 89% upsurge in the price of gold. This explosive future is in part what makes several investors refer to Bitcoin as the digital gold engine, giving it the opportunity for returns that would greatly exceed any returns possible from other safe-haven assets. However, shorter-term data tell a different tale. Gold has so far performed better than Bitcoin in 2025 because it has risen by 39% compared to Bitcoin’s 22% progress. The past month has been more eye-opening: as Bitcoin fell 2.3% , gold gained almost 8% , highlighting the switching preferences of the investors according to the macroeconomic environment. Scarcity and Inflation The defined scarcity of Bitcoin is one of its most notable strengths. The supply is fixed at 21 million coins, and the current annual growth in the supply of the cryptocurrency is less than 1%. And as each halving cycle – the sixth will occur in 2028 – this rate of inflation decreases further, further establishing Bitcoin as a deflationary asset. Gold is a more stable commodity, being in short supply yet valued at a stable inflation rate of about 1.7% annually due to continued mining and processing. That rate has been sustainable over centuries, although Bitcoin advocates say that digital scarcity, which is embodied in code, is a much better avenue of preserving long-term value. A Hidden Gem Enters the Spotlight Meanwhile, as Bitcoin and gold dominate headlines, investors looking for exponential growth are turning to rising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE . The project has already raised more than $13.5 million in record time , drawing both retail investors and whales who see parallels with the early breakout days of coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its focus on audits, transparency, and investor trust . Analysts suggest that early participants could capture returns of up to 55x , a level of upside that simply isn’t possible with assets as established as gold or Bitcoin. By combining strong tokenomics with a growing community and a roadmap focused on utility, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most talked-about opportunities heading into 2025. Investor Psychology: Why the Debate Persists The Bitcoin vs. gold debate is psychological as much as it is about money. To most people, gold is something stable, traditional, and secure. Its applications as money, jewelry, and a store of value date back thousands of years. Investors inclined toward gold tend to value its physical nature – you can feel it, put it in a safe deposit box, and be assured that it will find demand in non-financial sectors of the economy. On the other hand, Bitcoin appeals to individuals who value innovation, independence, and high rates of growth. Its digital format renders it borderless, easy to carry across, and hard to control by the government. Younger investors especially view Bitcoin as a way out of not only inflation but also obsolete financial systems that do not favor all equally. It is this psychological separation that gives rise to the continuing debate. Gold will still be preferred by risk-averse investors, whereas Bitcoin suits investors who want to get asymmetric gains. The consequence is that they coexist and both attract capital due to other reasons, as some investors diversify and hold them. Two Stores of Value, Two Roles The comparison between Bitcoin and gold is not only about price. It also reflects their roles in global markets. Gold has served as a store of value for thousands of years, used in jewelry, reserves, and financial systems across civilizations. Its history, tangibility, and universal recognition make it the ultimate safe-haven asset during uncertain times. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a volatile challenger . It offers digital scarcity, borderless transferability, and independence from governments or central banks. These qualities appeal to a new generation of investors who see it as a hedge not just against inflation, but against the traditional financial system itself. Yet its short track record and wild price swings make it a riskier bet compared to gold. The Road Ahead Whether Bitcoin can ever match gold’s $25 trillion market cap remains an open question. To achieve such a milestone, Bitcoin would need widespread adoption across multiple layers of finance: central bank reserves, corporate treasuries, and mainstream investment portfolios. In the near term, Bitcoin’s prospects will depend heavily on macroeconomic conditions. If inflation remains a concern and central banks lean toward looser monetary policies, both gold and Bitcoin could continue to rise as investors seek safe havens. However, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it could outperform gold in bullish cycles but also underperform during corrections. Conclusion The Bitcoin versus gold debate underscores two very different kinds of assets. Gold is the time-tested store of value that has preserved wealth across centuries. Bitcoin is the bold new contender that has already delivered 1,000% gains in five years , with the potential for much more if adoption grows. For investors, both assets may serve important roles: gold as a foundation of stability, and Bitcoin as a high-growth hedge against monetary uncertainty. At the same time, those seeking outsized returns are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE , a project backed by transparency and audits, with forecasts suggesting up to 55x ROI . While Bitcoin and gold continue to compete for dominance, new opportunities are emerging that could define the next phase of the crypto market.

Expert Explains How,https://timestabloid.com/blackrock-and-jpmorgan-secretly-positioning-in-xrp-expert-explains-how/,"Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah raised the issue of whether BlackRock and JPMorgan are secretly accumulating XRP. He credited insights from Digital Perspectives and Digital Asset Buy, attaching a video featuring commentary from Digital Asset Investor and Bradley Kimes of Digital Perspectives. Commentary on valuation and career movements In the video, Digital Asset Investor began by pointing to Robbie Michnik and Susan Athey, who he said were the only ones to conduct a legitimate XRP valuation in 2018. He noted that Michnik later joined BlackRock, removing his affiliation with Ripple from LinkedIn. He then questioned why Michnik now focuses exclusively on Bitcoin while BlackRock publicly only discusses Bitcoin and Ethereum in relation to exchange-traded funds. He argued that it was unrealistic to assume that BlackRock has no interest in other digital assets, particularly XRP. The devil is in the detail. Are @BlackRock and @JPMorgan secretly positioning in #XRP ? Absolutely. They’ve been suppressing the tech while misdirecting the public, classic move. Powerful insights from @DigPerspectives and @DigitalAssetBuy https://t.co/MkdHNfK8OX pic.twitter.com/kPHEHR6bPc — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 18, 2025 Digital Perspectives on Accumulation Practices Bradley Kimes of Digital Perspectives expanded on this point by suggesting that institutions often talk about one asset publicly while accumulating another privately. He said this was part of a standard strategy, where firms may even criticize XRP while simultaneously purchasing it. He emphasized that this practice is not illegal, but rather a common approach used by financial institutions to avoid driving up the price before they have finished their accumulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 References to historical pre-allocations Kimes also connected the discussion to earlier allocation practices, pointing to instances where XRP was pre-allocated through option contracts. He mentioned that R3 was allocated 5 billion XRP and that Greg Kidd had an option contract on 1% of the total supply. He argued that it was implausible that only these two parties had secured such arrangements, pointing to the possibility that other large entities, including major banks or international institutions, could also have been involved. The tweet and accompanying video suggest that BlackRock and JPMorgan may be preparing positions in XRP while publicly maintaining a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The arguments presented rely on observed career shifts, carefully interpreted public messaging, and references to historical allocation deals that are frequently cited within the community. The claim, however, is constructed on interpretation and circumstantial evidence rather than on official disclosures, regulatory filings, or verifiable transaction records that would directly confirm such holdings.

Recently, Saylor shared a fascinating perspective that could redefine how we view Bitcoin institutional adoption and its impact on future price movements. His insights suggest a significant shift on the horizon, one that promises both stability and perhaps a touch of unexpected calm for the often-turbulent crypto market. What Does Increased Bitcoin Institutional Adoption Mean for Volatility? During a recent appearance on the CoinStories YouTube channel, Michael Saylor elaborated on a crucial trend: the growing involvement of institutional investors in the Bitcoin ecosystem. He believes this influx of capital from large financial entities will fundamentally alter Bitcoin’s market behavior. Saylor explained that as institutions commit more capital, the market naturally becomes more robust and less susceptible to the dramatic price swings retail investors have grown accustomed to. This isn’t just a theory; it’s a natural progression for any maturing asset class. Essentially, more money from stable, long-term players means fewer sudden spikes and crashes driven by speculative fervor. Decreased Price Swings: Institutional capital tends to be ‘sticky,’ meaning it’s less likely to panic sell during minor corrections. Enhanced Market Depth: Larger orders from institutions provide greater liquidity, making it harder for single events to drastically move the price. Increased Stability: A more stable market is often seen as a prerequisite for even wider Bitcoin institutional adoption . This shift, while beneficial for long-term growth and legitimacy, might present a different experience for day traders who thrive on high volatility. Is Market Maturation a Disappointment for Some Investors? While the idea of a more stable Bitcoin might sound appealing to many, Saylor acknowledged that it could be a bittersweet development for a segment of the investor community. Specifically, those who have profited immensely from Bitcoin’s notorious volatility might find a subdued market less exciting. He described this as a natural part of Bitcoin’s maturation process. Think of it like a wild frontier slowly becoming a developed city; the excitement of the untamed wilderness gives way to established infrastructure and predictable routines. For Bitcoin institutional adoption to truly flourish, a certain level of predictability is necessary. However, this doesn’t mean Bitcoin will become boring. Instead, it suggests a transition from a speculative asset to a more recognized store of value and potentially a global reserve asset. The focus might shift from rapid, short-term gains to sustained, long-term appreciation, mirroring traditional financial assets that have undergone similar transformations. Bitcoin has indeed shown signs of this evolution, trading around the $115,000 level since reaching a new all-time high in August. This consolidation around higher levels suggests a foundational strength building up, rather than wild, unpredictable movements. Navigating the New Landscape of Bitcoin Institutional Adoption Understanding this evolving market dynamic is crucial for all participants. For institutions, a less volatile Bitcoin offers a more attractive risk profile, making it easier to justify larger allocations and integrate it into diversified portfolios. This further fuels Bitcoin institutional adoption . For retail investors, the strategy might need to adapt. Instead of chasing quick pumps and dumps, a long-term hodling strategy focused on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition could become even more paramount. The benefits of this maturation are clear: Greater Legitimacy: Institutions bring credibility and regulatory clarity. Reduced Risk: Less volatility means a safer asset for broader investment. Long-Term Growth Potential: A stable foundation supports sustainable value appreciation. The challenge, however, lies in managing expectations. Those accustomed to parabolic surges might need to adjust to more modest, albeit consistent, growth. This isn’t a signal to abandon Bitcoin, but rather to recognize its evolution into a more sophisticated financial instrument. Michael Saylor’s perspective highlights that while the ride might become smoother, the destination – a globally adopted, robust digital asset – remains incredibly compelling. The path to mainstream acceptance often involves shedding some of the wildness that initially attracted many, in favor of stability that appeals to the masses. Michael Saylor’s insights offer a powerful glimpse into Bitcoin’s future. The increasing tide of Bitcoin institutional adoption is set to transform its market dynamics, potentially ushering in an era of more subdued price action. While this might temper the excitement for some, it signifies a profound maturation, solidifying Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate and enduring asset class. This evolution is not a setback but a necessary step towards its ultimate potential, inviting a new wave of investors seeking stability alongside innovation. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin’s Market Evolution Q1: What does Michael Saylor mean by “subdued BTC price action”? A1: Saylor suggests that as more institutional investors enter the Bitcoin market, its price swings (volatility) will likely decrease. This means fewer extremely large daily percentage gains or losses, leading to a more stable and predictable price trajectory. Q2: Why would institutional investors lead to less Bitcoin volatility? A2: Institutional investors typically operate with larger capital, longer investment horizons, and more rigorous risk management strategies. Their presence adds significant liquidity and depth to the market, making it less susceptible to rapid price movements caused by smaller, speculative trades. Q3: Is decreased volatility a good thing for Bitcoin? A3: For the long-term health and widespread acceptance of Bitcoin, yes. Lower volatility makes Bitcoin a more attractive asset for large corporations, pension funds, and traditional financial institutions, fostering greater Bitcoin institutional adoption and legitimacy. However, it might be less appealing for short-term traders who profit from large price swings. Q4: How should retail investors adapt to this potential shift? A4: Retail investors might consider shifting their focus from short-term trading to long-term investment strategies, often referred to as “hodling.” Emphasizing Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation could become even more pertinent in a less volatile market. Q5: Has Bitcoin shown signs of this maturation already? A5: Yes, the article mentions Bitcoin trading around the $115,000 level since reaching a new all-time high in August, suggesting a period of consolidation rather than extreme volatility, which aligns with Saylor’s observations.

With the ADA price prediction pointing toward a multi-dollar breakout and RTX disrupting cross-border payments, investors see huge upside in both projects. Remittix has already raised over $26.1M at $0.10, and some forecasts suggest the PayFi token could rally to $50, rivaling top altcoins in adoption and growth. Cardano Price Prediction Targets $1 And Beyond Cardano is flashing bullish technicals, with multiple chart setups pointing toward a potential breakout. The ADA price today is moving within a symmetrical triangle, with a decisive close above $0.925 opening the door to $1.25. A cup-and-handle pattern on shorter timeframes also supports an upside target near $1.20, reinforcing positive sentiment. The Cardano price prediction gains further weight as open interest in ADA futures hit a record $1.95 billion, reflecting intense speculative demand. Such a surge in OI has historically preceded sharp rallies, as seen when ADA nearly doubled after similar conditions earlier this year. Optimism is also supported by rising ETF approval odds, with Polymarket showing a 90% probability. Analysts argue that breaking the $1 psychological barrier could set the stage for a move toward $2 or higher. Cardano news continues to emphasize growing institutional attention. This is positioning ADA as one of the most-watched altcoins. For long-term investors, the ADA price prediction for 2030 remains highly ambitious, potentially aligning with market-wide growth. Analysts See Remittix As Potential $50 Token By 2030 While Cardano price predictions remain bullish heading into 2030, analysts argue that Remittix (RTX) may offer even greater upside. Unlike speculative tokens such as Dogecoin, Remittix is built for real-world adoption through its instant crypto-to-fiat conversion system. By allowing users to send crypto directly to global bank accounts with no hidden fees, RTX is bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance. At $0.1080, with more than $26.1M already raised and over 665M tokens sold, investors see Remittix as a PayFi disruptor with room to grow. The wallet beta is now live, BitMart has confirmed the first CEX listing, and LBank is preparing to follow. Add CertiK verification and a #1 pre-launch ranking, and it’s clear why RTX is on whale watchlists.

52004229,585613,1758351647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52004229.jpeg,Ethereum Devs Disclose New Fusaka Upgrade For December 3: What You Need to Know,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-devs-disclose-new-fusaka-upgrade/,"Ethereum (ETH) is set to introduce its latest upgrade, dubbed the Fusaka upgrade, on December 3, 2025, a timeline that has been accelerated from previous expectations of a 2026 launch. This announcement comes from Christine Kim, a researcher monitoring Ethereum’s development progress. The confirmation of the mainnet activation date was made during the recent All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, where developers also established schedules for public testnet upgrades and the blob-parameter-only (BPO) hard fork related to Fusaka. Ethereum’s Fusaka Devnet Update The developers reached a consensus on these matters with surprising ease, indicating a smooth path forward despite ongoing testing challenges. They remain committed to the December activation date, barring any major setbacks during the next few months of testing. Currently, two versions of the Fusaka Devnet are in operation. Devnet-3 is stable, with client teams actively addressing software fixes. Meanwhile, Devnet-5 is also stable but encountered issues earlier this week, including multiple client bugs and node misconfigurations. These problems have reportedly limited the team’s ability to gather critical data on Blob-Parameter-Only (BPO) values. However, insights were still derived from a brief period of stability on Devnet-5, leading to recommendations for setting maximum blob counts for the upcoming hard forks. Looking ahead, the Ethereum Foundation’s EthPandaOps team plans to roll out Fusaka Devnet-6 in the coming weeks to validate the findings from Devnet-5. The team is focused on addressing a bug in the Prysm client that has emerged on Devnet-5, which appears to be linked to high blob counts resulting in orphaned blocks. Additionally, a recent update to the “ckzg” library has resolved prior issues, with a new version now available on GitHub. Upcoming Testnets The timeline for the Fusaka rollout is well-defined, with several key upgrades scheduled before the mainnet activation. Upcoming testnets include the Holesky upgrade on October 1, the Sepolia upgrade on October 14, and the Hoodi upgrade on October 28. Developers agreed that client teams should consolidate their releases for these testnet upgrades but can individually publish updates closer to the mainnet activation. In a separate but related development, the Ethereum community is engaged in discussions regarding the naming of a new consensus layer upgrade, referred to as Glamsterdam. This will also involve the deprecation of the Sepolia testnet, although developers assured that there would be ample time for the community to adapt to this change, with the new testnet expected to launch in March 2026. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $4.460, recording a 3.5% price drop in the 24-hour time frame. Still, the altcoin registers gains of 80% year-to-date.

In a recent post , he emphasized that his outlook remains firm regardless of differing opinions from general technical analysts. He underscored that credible analysts also anticipate a significant upward move for XRP, aligning with his projection of a future surge. Reference to Previous Analysis Egrag Crypto highlighted that his $27 target was not newly established but a long-standing expectation. He drew attention to an earlier post from August 2023, where he outlined the same forecast. In that earlier statement, he explained that for many, even a move to $2 seemed out of reach at the time, while others regarded it as inevitable over the course of market cycles. He asserted that the $27 level was already identified as a long-term goal and remained on the horizon as a matter of timing rather than possibility. #XRP – ONLY FEW : For many, reaching $2 seemed impossible, but for others, it was simply a matter of time. The $27 target was established long ago, and it’s definitely on the horizon, just a question of time! Remember: Men lie, Women lie, but CHARTS do not lie.… https://t.co/xKRuQI9maH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 19, 2025 Technical Emphasis on Charts In his earlier analysis, which he referenced again in his current post, Egrag Crypto stressed the importance of technical patterns over speculative sentiment. He stated that while opinions may differ, the structure of the charts remains consistent and reliable. His comment, “Men lie, women lie, but charts do not lie,” reflected his perspective that the predictive power of technical analysis should not be underestimated when assessing long-term price movements. Commitment to the XRP Community Alongside his technical forecast, Egrag Crypto addressed the XRP community directly, encouraging holders to remain steady. He described the journey toward higher valuations as a collective effort, urging the so-called XRP Army to maintain patience and conviction while awaiting potential confirmation of the projected price levels. His messaging combined technical analysis with a motivational appeal, reinforcing his view that eventual success is within reach. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Going Forward Egrag Crypto’s maintained projection of $27 positions his analysis at the more optimistic end of XRP forecasts. By referencing both historical and current chart structures, he reaffirmed his view that market conditions are aligning toward a breakout that could eventually lead to a major revaluation. Whether such a move materializes remains dependent on broader market dynamics, adoption factors, and technical confirmation. However, his consistent stance highlights his confidence in the long-term trajectory of the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Among cryptos most investors are watching are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However the coin drawing the biggest attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced under a dollar at $0.035 in its ongoing presale. With a dual lending-and-borrowing protocol, overcollateralized stablecoin plans, and presale phases filling up rapidly, MUTM is starting to look more and more like the wildcard that has the potential to really reward buyers with huge gains in 2025. Shiba Inu Holds Near $0.00001345 Amid Meme-Coin Dynamics Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at approximately $0.00001345, with its intraday range between approximately $0.00001289 and $0.00001360. The price continues to exhibit the volatility typical of meme-coins, with recent gains largely driven by social momentum and speculative demand rather than fundamental news. Support is located close to $0.00001280, and resistance between $0.00001400-$0.00001450 is limiting near-term gains in the lack of new stimulus or positive news. Compared to SHIB’s speculative model, Mutuum Finance is being viewed by some investors as having higher return potential under supportive market conditions. Dogecoin Price Steadies Amid Changing Meme-Coin Market Dogecoin (DOGE) is resting at around $0.2545, with comparatively subdued action over the past 24 hours. It has continued to trade comfortably above its recent support levels at $0.22–$0.24 but has encountered resistance at around $0.28–$0.30, making significant upward movements increasingly doubtful in the lack of fresh catalysts. Much of DOGE’s recent momentum has been based on community momentum and social activity, as opposed to fundamental developments or further utility. On the other hand, there are investors comparing the prospects of DOGE to Mutuum Finance’s, arguing MUTM might offer a more stable path to higher gains in the next bull run. Mutuum Finance Presale Increase Mutuum Finance has had a record-breaking presale rate of traction and has over 16,410 investors buying coins to raise over $16.01 million raised to date. During Phase 6, tokens can be bought at $0.035 per token. Its tiered system is a reward structure and early birds are set to gain maximum advantages. In a bid to provide security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to introduce a formal bug bounty program and a reward pool, which is valued at $50,000 USDT. All vulnerabilities found will be rewarded for, in a system given in four severity levels i.e., critical, major, minor and low. By making its platform available for external developer and researcher scrutiny, Mutuum is thus exposing itself to the latest security measures, giving a sense of security and assurance to its pool of investors. The ultimate goal of Mutuum Finance is to revolutionize the idea of DeFi as it stands today. Aside from that, the project is also promoting early adopters by providing $100,000 giveaway where 10 winners will receive a reward of 10,000 MUTM. Building a Trustworthy and secure Ecosystem Beyond the overall creation of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance will introduce a USD stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In comparison to algorithmic stablecoins, which have depegged in times of financial stress, the stablecoin introduced by Mutuum will be considered to be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and hence can retain its peg in times of financial distress. The mechanism uses the stability of idle collateral reserves to be long-term stable with a value preservation guarantee. This renders the stablecoin a safe medium of exchange, and a safe depository. The top 2025 altcoin bet goes in favor of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with at least 15x ROI for early investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the best under-$1 cryptocurrency with more substance than meme-driven hype like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Currently in Stage 6 at $0.035, MUTM has raised $16.01M+ from 16,410 investors, with strong demand pushing it toward the next stage at $0.04. Lock in Stage 6 tokens now before the price increases.

In the past, the halving events have led to a decrease in miner rewards and a tightening of supply. As a result, this often brings forth a bull run that spreads throughout the entire market. Although Bitcoin often leads the way, once the tide picks up, altcoins usually outperform it on a percentage basis. As projects which are likely to benefit from the dynamics have been analyzed by experts, Solana and Cronos look like favorites. Both possess strong ecosystems, improving fundamentals, and rising institutional visibility. Yet while established projects attract analyst attention, newer entrants are also beginning to make noise. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has started to feature in early discussions about how scarcity and cultural branding might set up fresh opportunities. Solana: speed, scale, and staying power In 2025 Solana has definitely changed its narrative; no longer subject to outages, it is widely considered to be among the fastest and most resilient Layer-1s in the market. It features a bustling landscape of cryptocurrencies, including DeFi, NFTs, meme-coin projects, and more. Hence, it also became a cultural powerhouse. Transaction speeds at millisecond levels and transaction costs expressed in microcents have made it the go-to choice for developers and retail users alike. There has also been more institutional activity. There have been structured funds and ETF requests that have Solana-based tokens. Analysts expect Solana to take a big chunk of post-halving capital, as some investors look for high-throughput alternatives to Ethereum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: scarcity aligned with growth The conversation around the halving also shines a spotlight on projects structured to maximize scarcity and community alignment. Scarcity is baked into MAGACOIN FINANCE’s design: 60% of supply is locked for presale buyers, while only 1% goes to the team. Analysts call this rare and powerful, since tokenomics built this way fuel trust, amplify demand, and often transform hype into historical breakout momentum. They emphasize that the foundation for explosive listing-day performance is already in place. Community scale is no longer in question, it has become the engine powering forecasts of 37x to 57x returns . With presale momentum intensifying and chatter spreading from niche groups to mainstream discussions, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being described as a standout play for growth-seeking investors looking ahead of the halving cycle. CRO: building beyond an exchange token The native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, Cronos (CRO), is another name grabbing recent attention ahead of the halving. CRO is one of the few exchange-backed tokens that have evolved into a multi-chain asset in its own right, and it also features its own DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Crypto.com’s aggressive branding, from stadium sponsorship to global campaigns, has implanted CRO firmly into the mainstream. Lately, the on-chain data indicates that the growing usage of the Cronos DeFi protocols with healthy staking and wallet growth. According to experts, a strong brand and growing technical adoption could make CRO a likely beneficiary when the next bull phase kicks-off. If history repeats itself, CRO could be looking at the entrance of thousands of new retail participants after the market halving. Halving impact: why altcoins shine afterward Having looked at previous cycles, Bitcoin’s halving leads to rallies in the market. After Bitcoin moves normally, capital flows next into Ethereum and then down to mid-caps and presales. According to analysts, CRO and Solana have sufficient liquidity and brand recognition to capitalise on the recent Solana hype. Smaller projects using structured scarcity e.g., MAGACOIN FINANCE can get disproportionate attention during these periods. Retail traders often look for asymmetric returns, while whales use halving-related liquidity to accumulate riskier structures. This interplay creates opportunities that can eclipse the gains from top Layer-1s. The upcoming halving is not likely to breach this historical pattern meaning preparation now may be important. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out Growth-oriented investors often look for projects combining strong narratives with credible safeguards. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks both boxes, pairing cultural momentum with independent audits by HashEx and CertiK . Its presale model is designed to create urgency and community cohesion, traits analysts say are common in early-stage success stories. Expanding visibility on Telegram and X shows retail traction, while reports of whale participation suggest smart money is validating the setup. This blend of credibility and hype positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout choice for investors chasing breakout growth. Conclusion: setting the stage early The next Bitcoin halving may not just be a countdown, but also a contributor to a potential cycle in the crypto world. Analysts are already keeping a close eye on Solana and CRO ahead of the halving event. History shows that failure often leads to breakthrough success from fresh entrants. Expectations of 37x to 57x and tokenomics anchored on trust and alignment. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming a part of that conversation. Investors seeking stability while also looking for potential for significant growth may combine a proven ecosystem with a fast and scaled presale.

However, crypto analyst XForceGlobal has debunked it and said that the market cap argument is not valid. In their view, the XRP price is definitely primed for the $10 mark and is only a matter of time before the digital asset reaches this level. Don’t Be Fooled By The Market Cap Argument In a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the crypto analyst warned XRP investors not to be fooled by those who say that the price cannot rise to $10+. Most especially, the argument that the market cap would be too high at this price would be irrelevant.

This is because with the triangle breakout that began back in 2024, the XRP price remains quite bullish. Hence, there is still a small window of opportunity where the altcoin could continue its run. Going by the analyst’s chart, in the event of a breakout, the XRP price could quickly rally toward $4 to set a new all-time high. Then through the year 2026, the bullish wave is expected to persist, triggering an over 200% increase to break $10, and eventually rally toward $14. XRP Price Still Bullish Despite Decline Another crypto analyst, TradingShot, has also pointed out why the XRP price is still bullish, alluding to a technical setup on the 1-day chart. The analyst points to the fact that the price had bottomed back in April after months of onslaught due to Donald Trump’s tariff wars. Then, with the recent recovery, the price has been testing and holding the 1-Day MA50 as support above $2.7. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Tells Dogecoin Investors To Stay Sharp Amid Historical Bullish Setup The significance of this is that the XRP price is holding this support after bottoming from its bearish leg on the 1-Day MA100 chart. Thus, this means that is the 1-Day MA50 is confirmed, then it would be the push needed for the altcoin to continue to rally. The target for the rally here is an over 60% increase in price to reach the $5 mark. “That Bullish Leg peaked on the 2.0 Fibonacci extension level. If this sequence is repeated, expect the next high to be around $5.00,” the crypto analyst explained.

The filing confirms months of speculation after Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley declined to comment on the matter in June. According to the Crypto In America podcast host Eleanor Terrett, the crypto bank for institutions submitted an application to federal regulators on August 28. Another semi-interesting thing in this latest update: the Fed has rejected a request from a Tier 1 institution. Notable because under the Fed's 2022 guidelines applications from Tier 1 institutions are ""generally … subject to a less intensive and more streamlined review"" pic.twitter.com/vn8uYkycui — Bank Reg Blog (@bank_reg) September 19, 2025 Anchorage is the only digital asset company that holds a national trust bank charter, a designation it received from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in 2021. That charter authorizes Anchorage to operate as a federally regulated trust bank but does not grant the same payment access that comes with a Fed master account. What is a Fed master account? A master account is the operational foundation that allows banks to settle transactions directly with the central bank and hold balances with the Federal Reserve. Depository institutions use these accounts to hold reserves and access the Fed’s payment services, including settlement of wire transfers, check clearing, and other interbank transactions. Without such access, banks must use third-party intermediaries to route payments. If Anchorage Digital acquired the account, it could become the first and only crypto bank that could hold assets outside digital currencies, just like traditional financial institutions. Anchorage became one of the first federally chartered digital-asset banks when the OCC conditionally approved its national trust bank charter in January 2021. However, a little over a year later, the OCC issued a consent order citing failures in its compliance program on anti-money laundering (AML) standards. However, in August of this year, the OCC terminated that order, stating that Anchorage’s compliance now meets regulatory expectations. “We received, and have now resolved, feedback from regulators as we set the standard for federally-chartered custody of digital assets,” McCauley wrote in a blog post. “With our consent order lifted, we’ve proven definitively that crypto and federal oversight are not mutually exclusive, and can in fact be stronger working in tandem.” Public companies and crypto firms seek bank licenses Anchorage is not the only digital asset company seeking a pathway to federal banking systems. Several companies’ applications for Fed master accounts were documented, including those from WisdomTree Digital Trust, Standard Custody & Trust Company, and Commercium Financial, between June and July. Stablecoin RLUSD issuer Ripple submitted an application for a US national bank charter on July 2, while companies like Paxos and Circle have made moves toward federal charters or trust-bank status, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. For the first time since the Federal Reserve adopted its 2022 guidelines for master account access, a Reserve Bank has rejected a Tier 1 institution’s request, according to the Fed’s latest master account and services database update, shared by the bank regulation blog X account. Tier 1 applicants, federally insured depository institutions, have always seen near-universal approvals, but one request has now been formally denied. Out of 92 Tier 1 applications logged, 76 have been approved, 10 remain pending, five were withdrawn, and one has been rejected. Tier 3 institutions, which include firms such as crypto banks and trust companies, have only one approval against three rejections and 20 pending cases. According to the database, this is the first time a Reserve Bank has rejected a request from a Tier 1 institution since the Fed adopted the 2022 guidelines and started publishing the outcomes My (amateurish) visualization of the data: pic.twitter.com/aLtOXg17Sq — Bank Reg Blog (@bank_reg) September 19, 2025 Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department has taken a step forward in formal stablecoins rulemaking.

This consolidation has come following a significant rally since April, pushing the asset past multiple resistance levels, and will likely continue if the market is able to break through the $4,800 level in the coming weeks. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The daily chart shows a clear overview of ETH’s uptrend inside a large ascending channel since April this year, with the price reclaiming several key levels, including the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now located around $3,700 and $2,900 marks, respectively. Currently, the asset is rising gradually within a tight ascending channel, which is also located around the midline of the larger channel. If the smaller channel is broken down, the market will likely revisit the $4,000 level. On the other hand, if the market bounces higher and breaks above the $4,800 resistance zone, a historical rally toward $5,000 and higher would be expected. The 4-Hour Chart Dropping down to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes clear that the recent consolidation has been mainly bounded inside a range between the $4,300 demand zone and the $4,800 supply zone. With the lower trendline of the green ascending channel also closing in on the price, the time for the market to make a decision is near. A breakdown of the channel and the demand zone would lead to a retest of the $3,850 demand zone and the lower boundary of the larger ascending channel, while a rebound from this zone would likely push the price past the $4,800 supply area and into the vicinity of the key $5,000 level. Onchain Analysis Finding Rates (7-day moving average) Moving away from technical analysis, this chart presents the 7-day moving average of Etheremu’s funding rates. The funding rates metric measures how aggressive the buyers and the sellers are in the futures market, with positive values indicating more aggressive position-taking by the buyers. As evident from the chart, the 7-day moving average of the funding rates has shown positive values for quite a long while now. Yet, these values are not comparable to the peaks witnessed in March 2024 and late 2024, when the price also reached long-term highs. This can be an indication that the market still has room to grow, as the futures market is yet to become significantly overheated. However, caution is still advised because positive funding rates can always lead to liquidation cascades.

Musk was responding to a post by Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, who said the social platform is trying to help users move away from “the mainstream algo and the political crusades.” In an X post late Friday, Musk, who acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022 and rebranded it as X, said that the company plans to “open source the algorithm every two weeks or so” to help build it up into what users prefer. “By November or certainly December, you will be able to adjust your feed dynamically just by asking Grok,” the billionaire entrepreneur wrote . Bier says X is working on improving the algorithm Product head Bier had posted about the company’s plan to make the X timeline reflect users’ genuine interests instead of divisive content. “The goal for your X timeline is to get out of the mainstream algo and the political crusades and find your niche,” Bier wrote. “If you’re seeing gas station fight videos, your account is not ramped up yet. We are working every day to fix this.” He reiterated that the company wants users to post about their passions and engage with “friendly, relevant people.” ""Show me the posts from the people I'm following, and don't show me the posts from the people I'm not following."" How hard is it? Why is there even a follow button if an algo is just going to decide what gets seen or not? Will you let Grok do that very simple thing if I ask? 😒 — Adam Gaertner 🇺🇸 (@veryvirology) September 19, 2025 The current “For You” feed algorithm rides on several signals to determine what appears in a timeline. Engagement with a post, such as likes and shares, is considered the determinant of which topics are to be displayed on the page, as does the user’s history of interacting with similar media formats, including videos and images. Other factors include activity in specific topics or communities, signals from followed accounts, and trending conversations from hashtags or local events in the X account holder’s physical location. Many users are unhappy with the platform’s recommendations for the “For You” page, some of whom are asking Musk to “undo whatever was done” after he bought Twitter, restoring it to how it was during former owner Jack Dorsey’s tenure. “Keep the ‘don’t ban people for being funny’ part. Before Elon, I regularly saw posts from my friends, we had inside jokes, and the timeline made sense. Now it’s an AI slop fest and my friends are nowhere to be found,” complained one disgruntled X account. Musk refutes xAI fundraising reports The announcement on X’s algorithm changes comes on the backdrop of chatter about Musk’s AI company xAI fundraising. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Friday, the startup is supposedly raising $10 billion from investors in a deal valuing it at $200 billion. The figures would take the company up from the $150 billion valuation in Musk’s last fundraising round weeks earlier, and a $6 billion raise last December. Earlier this year, Musk merged xAI with X in an all-stock deal that valued the AI startup at $80 billion and the social network at $33 billion. If true, xAI would join several AI startups garnering investments, including Anthropic, which recently secured $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation, alongside OpenAI’s secondary share sale that valued the company at $500 billion. Later on Friday, Musk denied the news about a fundraiser, calling it “fake news” in a post on X. He said xAI was “not raising any capital right now.” “We are the only company where the mission is truth,” Mr. Musk told his workers in a meeting held last Wednesday, The New York Times reported . “If you force the AI to lie or believe things that are not true, you’re at great risk of creating a dystopian future.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|X|xAI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-20 07:59:49

Most larger-cap alts are slightly in the red on a daily scale, but even more painful declines come from the likes of M and PENGU. BTC Slips After Recovery The primary cryptocurrency had an overall positive week , in which the US Federal Reserve finally reduced the key interest rates. Leading up to the FOMC meeting that took place on Wednesday, BTC experienced some volatility and went up to $117,200 only to drop below $115,000 before the event. However, it had recovered to $116,000 when the US central bank announced the cut and remained relatively muted at first. It went on the offensive during the early Thursday morning trading session when it pumped to a multi-week peak of $118,000. After gaining over seven grand since the previous week’s low, though, came the inevitable rejections that pushed it south hard, especially on Saturday morning. Earlier today, bitcoin slipped to $115,200 before it staged a minor recovery to roughly $116,000 as of now.

This move, recently highlighted by Eleanor Terrett of Crypto in America, marks a pivotal moment, potentially reshaping how cryptocurrency firms interact with the traditional U.S. financial system. For those keen on understanding the future of crypto banking, this application represents more than just paperwork; it signals a direct pathway to mainstream financial integration. What Exactly is a Federal Reserve Master Account? A Federal Reserve master account is essentially a direct gateway to the U.S. central bank’s payment infrastructure. Think of it as having your own direct line to the Fed, bypassing the need for an intermediary bank. Traditionally, financial institutions like commercial banks rely on these accounts to settle transactions, access liquidity, and participate in the broader financial ecosystem. Without a master account, firms must partner with an existing commercial bank that already holds one. This adds layers of complexity, cost, and potential delays. For crypto companies, finding these banking partners has often been a significant hurdle due to regulatory uncertainties and risk aversion within traditional finance. Why is This Application Pivotal for Anchorage Digital? Anchorage Digital’s pursuit of a Federal Reserve master account is a game-changer for several reasons: Direct Access to Payment Systems: It grants Anchorage Digital direct access to vital payment rails like FedWire and FedACH. This means faster, more efficient, and potentially cheaper settlement of transactions. Reduced Counterparty Risk: By removing intermediary banks, Anchorage can significantly reduce counterparty risk. This is a huge benefit for institutional clients dealing with large volumes of digital assets. Enhanced Stability and Trust: Operating directly with the Fed could bolster Anchorage’s reputation as a stable and trustworthy financial institution in the eyes of regulators and traditional finance. It signals a deeper level of integration and oversight. Operational Efficiency: Streamlined operations, fewer administrative burdens, and greater control over their financial processes are all direct benefits. This strategic step could position Anchorage Digital as a critical bridge between the burgeoning digital asset economy and the established financial world. Broader Implications: Reshaping Crypto Banking and Beyond The successful acquisition of a Federal Reserve master account by Anchorage Digital could send ripples throughout the entire crypto industry. It sets a precedent, demonstrating that crypto-native firms can achieve the same level of financial integration as traditional banks. This has several key implications: Increased Institutional Adoption: Direct access to Fed services could make digital asset services more appealing and accessible to large institutional investors and corporations who require robust, compliant financial infrastructure. Regulatory Clarity: While the application process itself is complex, a successful outcome could contribute to greater regulatory clarity for crypto firms seeking to operate within traditional financial frameworks. Competition and Innovation: It might encourage other qualified crypto firms to pursue similar master accounts, fostering greater competition and innovation in the digital asset banking sector. Lower Costs: Bypassing intermediaries could lead to lower transaction costs, which could ultimately benefit end-users and businesses leveraging digital assets. This isn’t just about one company; it’s about validating the maturity and seriousness of the digital asset industry. The Path Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for a Federal Reserve Master Account While the potential benefits are clear, obtaining a Federal Reserve master account is not a simple task. The application process is rigorous, involving extensive scrutiny of a firm’s financial health, risk management protocols, compliance frameworks, and operational resilience. The Fed evaluates applicants based on a comprehensive set of criteria, ensuring that any direct participant in its payment systems meets the highest standards. For Anchorage Digital, navigating this path requires demonstrating: Robust Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, as well as other banking laws. Sound Risk Management: Comprehensive strategies to manage operational, credit, and market risks associated with digital assets. Technological Security: Ironclad security measures to protect customer assets and maintain system integrity. The outcome of this application will be closely watched, as it could indeed pave the way for a new era of crypto banking. Anchorage Digital’s application for a Federal Reserve master account is a landmark event in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset economy. It represents a bold step towards integrating crypto firms directly into the core of the U.S. financial system, promising greater efficiency, reduced risk, and enhanced trust. While the journey is challenging, the potential rewards—for Anchorage Digital and the broader crypto industry—are immense, signaling a future where digital assets are seamlessly woven into the fabric of global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Federal Reserve master account? A Federal Reserve master account provides direct access to the U.S. central bank’s payment systems, allowing institutions to settle transactions and access liquidity without needing an intermediary bank. Why is Anchorage Digital applying for a master account? Anchorage Digital seeks a master account to gain direct access to payment systems, reduce counterparty risk, enhance operational efficiency, and build greater trust and stability within the traditional financial system. How does a master account benefit the crypto industry? It can increase institutional adoption of digital assets, contribute to greater regulatory clarity, foster competition among crypto banking services, and potentially lower transaction costs by removing intermediaries. Is it easy for a crypto firm to get a Federal Reserve master account? No, the application process is highly rigorous. It involves extensive scrutiny of a firm’s financial health, risk management, compliance protocols, and operational resilience to ensure the highest standards are met. What happens if Anchorage Digital secures the master account? If successful, Anchorage Digital would gain direct access to FedWire and FedACH, becoming a more integrated and stable player in the U.S. financial system, setting a precedent for other qualified crypto firms.

Jonathan Wes Griffith, the customer experience lead at Coinbase, said it is “consistently improving” and “wants to bring customers along the way.” Griffith wrote an X post on Friday, trying to calm the public’s anger towards the crypto exchange, admitting that service quality has not met expectations. “In August, our Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) hit an all-time high, up +20% over the last 2 months. Reduced customer contact transfers to 10% to make support quicker. Less customer effort, faster resolutions, and higher satisfaction…This is a good step forward, but we’ve got plenty more to do,” he conceded. Support team lists steps to improve user experience Griffith detailed a four-step plan to improve how the exchange’s support team handles account issues. The first priority, he said, is saving customers’ time by addressing product issues before they lead to support requests. Coinbase is reportedly investing in automation with enhanced application programming interfaces (APIs), an expanded knowledge base, and artificial intelligence-powered tools. But the company has been bashed for using AI when customers submit tickets about their problems, so the third step is replacing chatbots with them to speak to a live representative. Finally, Coinbase is introducing new tools for its staff to expedite resolutions and provide quality service during live interactions. Chief Executive Brian Armstrong quoted Griffith’s proposal, saying Coinbase must improve both product design and customer care. “We’re putting a big focus on getting better at customer support at both ends,” Armstrong wrote on X late Friday. “Improving products so fewer people need support, and providing a faster, higher quality experience when you do.” Growing on one hand, heavy criticism on the other Coinbase, launched in 2012, is arguably North America’s most used centralized crypto exchange, now publicly listed on Nasdaq. Although it’s undoubtedly successful, the trading platform’s customer service is lucklustre. The biggest complaints have been coming from sudden account closures and frozen assets, all those without timely resolutions. As reported by Cryptopolitan on Friday, NBA champion Kevin Durant had invested in Bitcoin in 2016, but lost access to his Coinbase account after forgetting his password. Durant was unable to retrieve the funds for nearly a decade. After his manager publicly talked about it earlier this week, Coinbase finally gave him back access after nine years. In June, Armstrong conceded that account restrictions had plagued the company for too long. Writing on X, he said account freezes had “been a problem for longer than is acceptable” and like Griffith, he promised the exchange will improve. “The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming,” Armstrong said. He asked users still experiencing frozen accounts to contact Coinbase Support directly. Many have complained about their accounts being frozen for months, sometimes even years, which has led some to abandon the platform altogether. Looking at grievances shared on social media, users claim they only interacted with chatbots that couldn’t solve their issues. There’s also chatter about live customer service being availed exclusively to those with premium accounts. “I canceled Coinbase One last month after paying for it since inception,” one user commented. “Premium support was four hours chatting with a CSR in another country who escalated my issue into a black hole. I never heard back.” Griffith responded to the comment directly, apologizing and offering compensation. “That’s not good. Let’s get you a free month and some 1:1 time with a Concierge. Can you DM your account email, and I will get this setup?” Beyond service delays, Coinbase’s reputation was hit by a large-scale data breach affecting more than 70,000 customers. The company initially linked the breach to a rogue staff member at an overseas vendor. Still, investigators later identified Ashita Mishra, an employee of TaskUs in Indore, India, as the prime suspect.

While that number excites institutional whales, retail investors are beginning to weigh whether crypto is a good investment when entry costs for bluechips are already high. With SOL trading in triple digits, chasing a 2x or 3x move requires large capital. For many, the smarter path lies in presale projects still priced under a dollar but designed with long-term utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of those alternatives. Sitting at just $0.035 in its presale, this DeFi protocol is building a lending ecosystem around stablecoin mechanics, mtToken staking with buybacks, and dual lending layers. Its tokenomics and roadmap are structured in a way that analysts now point to a potential 1500% upside by next year—an outcome far easier to chase than SOL’s more modest rally. Dual lending models driving utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate two complementary lending systems. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending will handle bluechip assets and stablecoins, pooling deposits into audited smart contracts. A lender supplying $25,000 BTC-equivalent into the mtBTC pool will receive mtBTC 1:1. At a 10% APY, the interest is calculated directly at 2,500. Add the principal, and the total becomes 27,500 BTC-equivalent after one year. This automated yield mechanism will allow lenders to grow holdings with predictable outcomes while maintaining flexibility to use mtTokens as collateral elsewhere in the system. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will serve a different purpose. Here, lenders and borrowers will directly agree on rates and terms. Isolated from pooled liquidity, P2P will be the venue for higher-risk or less liquid assets, ensuring that the core pools remain stable while still giving users optionality. The presale metrics already show strong traction. Out of a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, Phase 6 is currently priced at $0.035 and has generated about $16M. Over 16,450 holders have participated so far, with 44% of the 170M tokens allocated for this round already sold. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will rise 15% to $0.040. For new entrants, that makes Phase 6 the last chance to secure tokens at $0.035. Why 1500% upside is realistic Borrower interest will partially be captured by the reserve factor to offset defaults and shocks. As borrowing activity grows post-launch, accumulated reserves will become deployable assets. A stronger on-chain balance sheet will make Mutuum more attractive to users, increasing platform activity and indirectly supporting demand for MUTM when it is used in governance or utility roles. Second, Deposit and Borrow Caps combined with the Restricted Collateral Mode will limit systemic risk. By capping exposure to volatile assets, the protocol will make itself attractive to institutional treasuries. For example, a certain allocation from treasuries into low-risk stablecoin pools would directly add to TVL and strengthen confidence in repayment guarantees. Third, a Robust Oracle Strategy using Chainlink feeds with fallback oracles will guarantee accurate collateral valuations. This will prevent undercollateralized lending, ensuring liquidations happen smoothly even during volatile market swings. Together, these mechanics will justify the scaling required to reach that market cap. Catalysts will accelerate the process. Layer-2 scaling will make transactions cheaper, allowing the platform to onboard millions of users during the beta launch. As stable-rate borrowing is introduced, corporate treasuries seeking predictable costs will be drawn in. Expected exchange listings on Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC are expected to further deepen liquidity, while adoption of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized $1-pegged stablecoin will embed the project firmly into the DeFi market. Confidence is reinforced by security and incentives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is under CertiK audit, with a TokenScan score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79, reviewed through both manual and static analysis. The audit request was filed on February 25, 2025, with the revised completion timeline set for May 20, 2025. To complement this, the platform has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program with rewards ranging from $200 for low-severity findings to $2,000 for critical ones. On top of that, a $100,000 giveaway is live, where 10 winners will each secure $10,000 in MUTM tokens. With analysts placing SOL at $460, whales may well continue to accumulate bluechips. But for those looking at the crypto fear and greed index and choosing projects with stronger upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the alternative. At $0.035 in Phase 6, it represents a presale entry that aligns innovation with accessible capital and a clear roadmap toward a 1500% run.

Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Bitcoin: The 21-Million Coin Changing Money Forever Bitcoin is the first digital coin. It was launched in 2009 by a person or group called Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was clear: let people send money to each other without banks. Each trade is written on thousands of computers at once. This shared list is called a blockchain. Helpers named miners check each move by solving tough puzzles. When they succeed, they earn new coins. The reward drops by half about every four years, a moment known as a halving. Only 21 million coins will ever exist, so supply stays tight. This fixed limit has turned Bitcoin into a kind of online gold. In past cycles, prices rose sharply after a halving as new supply slowed. Many watchers expect the same pattern again, though swings can be wild. Other coins promise faster speed or fancy apps, yet most still depend on Bitcoin’s mood. Big firms now hold it on their balance sheets, and some countries see it as a store of value. With inflation fears and fresh demand from exchange-traded funds, the current stage looks bright. Still, newcomers should be ready for bumps on the way up. Conclusion BTC looks on track for $150,000 by December amid strong ETF inflows. Yet brighter upside may lie in XYZVerse (XYZ), the sports-meme pioneer targeting PEPE-style gains through community-driven GameFi expansion.

But while DOGE is well known for hype-driven cycles, analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the project positioned to surpass the $1 mark with stronger fundamentals. For many investors wondering what is going on with crypto today, the contrast between meme coins and utility-driven platforms highlights where the next wave of serious growth could come from. Why DOGE’s momentum differs from MUTM’s utility Hype has always been good for DOGE. Because its community drives its movements, it comes up a lot when a crypto meltdown turns into a bounce. Traders have learned to expect times when interest rates go up and down, followed by times when they stay the same. This can lead to immediate chances, but it rarely leads to long-term growth based on economic activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) does things quite differently. The ecosystem is built around borrowing, lending, and a steady demand for its coin. Lenders provide liquidity to audited smart contracts through Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, and they receive interest based on how much the pool is used. At the same time, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending lets riskier tokens get funding in a safe space, which keeps the whole system safe. These layers work together to keep capital moving all the time, with the MUTM token at the center. The mtToken system makes this need even stronger. When people put money into pools, they get mtTokens as proof that they own that money. You can then stake these mtTokens to get MUTM incentives, which come from the money made via lending. Every loan or repayment makes sure that new token demand enters circulation since platform money is utilized to purchase back MUTM on the open market and provide it to stakers. On the other hand, DOGE doesn’t have a way to connect activity to token value. It depends on people’s feelings, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing an economy where growth is naturally linked to platform use. Presale momentum and path toward $1 The traction behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already becoming clear through its presale. Currently in Phase 6, the token is priced at $0.035. The project has raised around $16 million, attracted more than 16,450 holders, and already sold 44% of the allocation for this round. With Phase 7 set at $0.040, investors face a 15% price step-up — a key reason why participation has accelerated. The timing of the beta launch at the token listing will strengthen this momentum. New participants from major exchanges will not just be purchasing MUTM but immediately interacting with live features such as borrowing, lending, and staking. This early exposure to real functionality creates lasting engagement rather than one-off trading spikes. Risk controls are another driver of confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets clear Loan-to-Value ratios: ETH and stablecoins will allow up to ~75% borrowing with an 80% liquidation threshold, while more volatile tokens remain capped at ~35–44% LTV with a 65% liquidation trigger. This system ensures lenders are protected, borrowers know their limits, and liquidators are incentivized to keep the platform stable. Layer-2 deployment adds efficiency by reducing transaction costs and accelerating processing times compared to Layer-1. For liquidators acting on price changes or stakers adjusting positions, speed and cost-effectiveness are essential. These upgrades give Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a technical edge that directly enhances user satisfaction and capital retention. Looking ahead, exchange accessibility is expected to expand rapidly. Analysts are watching for listings on major platforms, including Binance and Coinbase. These listings will make MUTM widely discoverable, broaden liquidity, and bring institutional attention to its utility-first model. Conclusion Security has been prioritized through a CertiK audit, adding credibility to its smart contract infrastructure. To further reinforce community trust, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has funded a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards researchers for finding vulnerabilities. A $100,000 giveaway campaign is also running to energize its growing holder base. Together, these initiatives make the project attractive to both security-conscious investors and community-focused participants. This combination of presale momentum, utility-based token demand, beta availability at launch, and streamlined Layer-2 operations provides the structure for MUTM to cross the $1 mark faster than meme-driven assets like DOGE. While DOGE will continue to draw headlines for its hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building the type of sustained ecosystem that traders searching for the next big crypto investment are eager to find.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.7215, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.7594. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.6564, beginning a bearish trend to $0.599. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. As a result, sellers are pushing the price toward $0.67. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.65 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX has updated its 2025 roadmap, outlining plans to launch a Telegram trading integration as the platform faces declining earnings. According to the roadmap, dYdX plans to roll out a series of software upgrades that include a partner fee share, scale and TWAP orders and designated proposers, targeting the reduction of end-to-end trading latency. dYdX price prediction September 2025 August was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin surged toward $0.76 but failed to maintain its buying momentum. As a result, dYdX dropped below $0.6. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.75 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.9, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction September 2025 $0.45 $0.75 $0.9 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41.

Key Takeaways: The FTX Recovery Trust will distribute $1.6 billion to creditors on September 30, bringing total payouts to $7.8 billion. US customer claims will receive 40%, while convenience claims are set for a 120% reimbursement in this latest round. With over $16 billion in recoverable assets, how remaining funds are handled could impact crypto market sentiment and future investor protections. The latest tranche is scheduled for September 30 , with payouts expected to reach recipients within three business days. FTX Recovery Trust Details Payout Breakdown in $1.6B Distribution The round includes varied percentages depending on the type of claim. U.S. Customer Entitlement Claims will receive 40%, General Unsecured and Digital Asset Loan Claims get 24%, and Dotcom Customer Claims are set for a 6% reimbursement. Convenience claims, meanwhile, will receive a 120% payout in this cycle. The trust has already disbursed $6.2 billion across two prior rounds, $1.2 billion in February and $5 billion in May—bringing total recoveries to nearly half of the $16.5 billion earmarked for victims of the exchange’s collapse. FTX’s downfall in November 2022 marked one of the most dramatic failures in crypto history, triggering a chain reaction that intensified the ongoing market downturn. The exchange’s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted on seven counts, including fraud and money laundering. In March 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. BREAKING: FTX TO DISTRIBUTE $1.6 BILLION TO CREDITORS ON SEPTEMBER 30. MORE LIQUIDITY COMING pic.twitter.com/ofNklEObY3 — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) September 19, 2025 While the criminal case closed one chapter, legal battles continue. Bankman-Fried’s legal team is expected to appeal his conviction this November, arguing procedural flaws and asserting that FTX was never insolvent. Creditors and market participants remain watchful of the trust’s activities, as large inflows of recovered funds could affect market sentiment and liquidity in the short term. With over $16 billion on the table, how the rest is returned could shape both the reputations of key players and the future of crypto investor protections. 3AC Targets FTX Execs Over $1.5B Liquidation in New Subpoenas The liquidators of collapsed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have subpoenaed former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried , ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and FTX executive Ryne Salame. The move follows allegations that over $1.5 billion in 3AC assets were liquidated unlawfully by FTX-linked entities. Bankman-Fried’s deposition is scheduled for October 14, 2025, at Terminal Island prison, where he is currently serving time. 3AC co-founder Zhu Su claims Bankman-Fried executed unauthorized liquidations that contributed to 3AC’s downfall. He also accuses Salame of using insider knowledge to front-run trades and pocket over $1 billion in profits before FTX’s collapse. Ellison is expected to be questioned regarding Alameda’s trading strategies that may have played a role in the alleged misconduct. As reported, FTX and Alameda have also withdrawn approximately 192,000 Solana (SOL) tokens, worth around $44.9 million, from staking. The move follows a consistent pattern observed over the past year, with the estate redeeming Solana assets on a near-monthly basis. Since November 2023, FTX and Alameda have unstaked and transferred nearly 9 million SOL, valued at $1.2 billion, averaging $134 per token.

One is holding firm, another is making slow gains, and a third is causing excitement with its big jumps. What sets these coins apart and makes each path interesting? The coming analysis looks at how these strategies could shape their future and what it might mean for traders. From Meme to Mainstream: Is Dogecoin Ready for Another Lift-Off? Dogecoin burst onto the scene in 2013 with a grinning Shiba Inu and a shrug. Its creators, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, wanted a light-hearted twist on serious crypto. They set no hard limit on coins; in fact 10,000 fresh DOGE roll out every minute. What began as a joke became a juggernaut. Social media rallies, led by Elon Musk, pushed its worth above $50 billion in 2021, planting it in the top ten. The surge proved one thing: an online crowd can turn a meme into a market force. Under the hood DOGE runs on the same proof-of-work idea as Bitcoin, yet blocks clear faster and fees stay tiny. That makes tipping gamers, streamers, and friends quick and cheap. The endless supply fuels spending but also keeps a lid on scarcity. In today’s cycle Bitcoin’s rebound has traders hunting for lagging plays. New meme coins flash brighter, yet many fade fast. Dogecoin still owns the biggest fan club and sits on every major exchange, giving it staying power. If utility grows—or another Musk tweet lands—momentum could return in a hurry. Shiba Inu: The Meme Dog That Sniffed Out a Spot on Ethereum Shiba Inu burst onto the scene in 2020, barking at Dogecoin’s heels. Built on Ethereum, it plugs into a huge network of apps and wallets. Its maker, known only as Ryoshi, unleashed one quadrillion tokens. Half went to Vitalik Buterin, who later gave much away and burned the rest. That bold move grabbed headlines and trust. At the same time, it showed the coin was more than a joke. Today, SHIB powers ShibaSwap, a place to trade tokens without a middleman. Soon, holders may vote on new changes and even mint art pieces called NFTs. This wider plan gives SHIB tools that Dogecoin still lacks. The market cycle now rewards coins with clear stories and active teams. Meme coins often ride big waves, and Ethereum-based ones get extra attention because they fit with popular chains like Uniswap and OpenSea. SHIB also has a huge, vocal fan base that can drive fast moves. Prices are still far below last year’s peak, so some see room for a fresh run if the next bull phase appears. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.0055, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.0056. With an anticipated listing price of $0.10, the token is set to launch on leading CEXs and DEXs. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Conclusion DOGE offers steadiness, SHIB moves upward in steps, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) blends sports and memes, presale live, community-led, aiming to beat past 17,000% stars in the 2025 bull run.

52007482,https://invezz.com/?p=2890756,1758357164,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,5 reasons why MUTM is tipped to become next crypto to explode with 30x ROI potential,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/20/5-reasons-why-mutm-is-tipped-to-become-next-crypto-to-explode-with-30x-roi-potential/,"The race to identify the next breakout project in decentralized finance is intensifying. While many investors still focus on large-cap assets, those with foresight are turning toward presale-stage opportunities that blend utility, strong tokenomics, and institutional-grade security. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most compelling cases for high-growth crypto investment, with analysts already projecting up to 30x returns as adoption accelerates. Presale momentum backed by strong community growth One of the clearest signals of early strength comes from Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale traction. In Phase 6, tokens are currently priced at $0.035, with more than 44% of the 170 million allocation already sold. Over $16 million has been raised so far, supported by more than 16,450 holders who recognize the project’s long-term vision. The next phase will lift the price to $0.040, representing a 15% step-up. For retail buyers, hesitation means a higher entry cost in the very near term, creating urgency to act before the transition. The presale also highlights what early participants have already secured. Phase 1 buyers entered at $0.01, which has already translated into a 250% gain by Phase 6 on paper. With projected post listing targets around $0.30, those earliest investors are positioned for 30x ROI, while even today’s entrants at $0.035 are tracking a confident 9x return at the same milestone. This kind of growth is rare when investing in crypto through established names, but presales like MUTM still provide that window of accessibility. Revenue-driven staking and buybacks Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not positioning itself as a short-lived trading token. Instead, its model focuses on building recurring value for long-term users. Users who deposit assets into liquidity pools—ranging from stablecoins like USDT and USDC to majors such as BTC and ETH—receive mtTokens as proof of their share. These mtTokens can then be staked, rewarding participants with MUTM distributions. What makes this cycle powerful is the buyback mechanism. Revenues generated by the platform will be used to purchase MUTM from the open market, which will then be redistributed to stakers. This means participation not only generates yield from lending activity but also taps into the project’s growth flywheel, where expanding activity strengthens returns for those securing the ecosystem. It introduces a dynamic absent in traditional crypto ETF structures and positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an evolving, self-reinforcing economy. Stability through predictable borrowing models A critical challenge in decentralized finance has always been interest rate volatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses this head-on through its Stable Interest Rate Model. Borrowers will be able to lock in predictable repayment costs, offering a level of certainty especially attractive for institutions managing long-term positions. The model begins by setting a stable rate at the time of borrowing, typically higher than variable rates to reflect the benefit of predictability. However, to protect liquidity, a rebalancing mechanism is embedded. If market conditions shift drastically—for instance, when variable supply rates outpace stable ones beyond a defined margin—the protocol will adjust stable rates upward to preserve fairness. This ensures that stability for borrowers does not come at the cost of system solvency. Not all assets will qualify, with higher-risk or volatile tokens excluded from stable borrowing, but for major assets, this model introduces unmatched predictability in DeFi lending. Risk controls that prioritize long-term resilience Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing its base on more than just dependable borrowing. It is also using innovative risk metrics. Deposit restrictions limit exposure to assets that are hard to sell or that change value quickly, while borrow caps stop people from borrowing too much money, which might make the system unstable. Overcollateralization secures every loan by making sure that the value of the collateral is always more than the amount borrowed. Liquidation triggers and penalties make sure that unhealthy positions are quickly dealt with, and liquidators are rewarded with bonuses for keeping their businesses solvent. The protocol also sets aside a reserve component, which is a buffer made up of interest that accumulates money into a pool to cover unexpected losses or defaults. Meanwhile, the restricted collateralization mode applies to high-risk tokens, which limits their effect on the system as a whole. Enhanced collateral efficiency, on the other hand, lets safer correlated assets like stablecoins borrow more money. All of these safety measures show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a platform for long-term use, not short-term investment. Roadmap built for adoption and global reach The last part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s value story is its roadmap. The presale and early audits have set the stage. The following steps will be to finish the core smart contracts, do testnet demos, and check the security. After these technological milestones, Phase 4 of the roadmap will see the project go live, get listed on exchanges, and expand to many chains. Institutional partnerships are also in the works. These will connect Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s DeFi architecture with well-known financial investors who are looking into investing in crypto through decentralized platforms. This rollout is all about security. The CertiK audit has already given MUTM a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. The project has set up a $50,000 bug bounty program with payouts that range from $200 for low-severity issues to $2,000 for major vulnerabilities. This is to keep security up at all times. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting more attention and involvement as it develops its technology. For example, it has a $100,000 giveaway campaign and a community of more than 12,000 followers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has all the signs of the next cryptocurrency to explode: presale momentum, revenue-driven staking, stable borrowing models, strict risk constraints, and a growth-oriented strategy. Analysts say the initiative might bring in 30X its initial investment, which is why smart money is already getting in early, before the rest of the market catches on.

Key Takeaways: The CFTC has added top crypto and Wall Street figures to its Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee. JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas and Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul were named co-chairs. The CFTC is pushing forward with a “Crypto Sprint” and broader efforts to clarify jurisdiction alongside the SEC. Among the latest appointees to DAMS are Katherine Minarik of Uniswap Labs, Avery Ching of Aptos Labs, James J. Hill of BNY, and Ben Sherwin of Chainlink Labs, key figures in blockchain infrastructure, legal policy, and institutional crypto strategy. The appointments signal the CFTC’s continued push to incorporate industry expertise into policymaking around digital assets. JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton Executives Named Co-Chairs of CFTC Crypto Subcommittee JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas has been named co-chair of the subcommittee, joining Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul. They replace Caroline Butler in the role. Lucas emphasized the importance of shaping “clear and effective regulatory frameworks” for digital markets, while Kaul highlighted the need to expand digital asset access with “well-designed consumer protections.” DAMS was established to guide the CFTC on developments in blockchain, tokenization, and decentralized finance. It plays a central role in evaluating market risks, recommending policy changes, and supporting the agency’s goal of harmonizing oversight across financial sectors. The new appointments come under the leadership of Acting CFTC Chair Caroline D. Pham, who assumed the role in January 2025. Congrats to @chainlinklabs General Counsel Ben Sherwin on his appointment to the @CFTC ’s Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee of the Global Markets Advisory Committee! @chainlink https://t.co/aqcrasmOwb — Caroline D. Pham (@CarolineDPham) September 19, 2025 With a commissioner term running through 2027, Pham has launched a “Crypto Sprint” aimed at executing key recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The initiative also aims to address the overlapping authority between the CFTC and the SEC. Wall Street institutions have shown increased interest in tokenized finance. BNY Mellon recently partnered with Goldman Sachs to tokenize money-market funds, while JPMorgan continues to explore crypto-backed lending and blockchain-based settlement. The regulatory momentum comes as President Donald Trump signs the GENIUS Act into law and champions crypto-friendly legislation in Congress. The House has already passed bills focused on market structure and banning a central bank digital currency (CBDC), with both measures now awaiting Senate review. Together, these developments mark a decisive shift in US regulatory posture, with the CFTC expanding its role as a key player in shaping the future of crypto finance. Crypto Bill Redefines SEC-CFTC Roles, Shields DeFi Developers A newly revised draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 outlines a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets in the US , aiming to reduce conflict between the SEC and CFTC. The bill proposes a Joint Advisory Committee on Digital Assets, with both agencies required to publicly respond to its findings, a move intended to boost transparency and coordination. A public roundtable on the topic is scheduled for September 29. The draft includes explicit protections for DeFi developers, validators, wallet builders, and infrastructure contributors, so long as the underlying protocol is not centrally controlled. Additionally, the bill redefines how common crypto activities are treated under securities laws. Airdrops, staking rewards, and DePIN tokens are categorized as “gratuitous distributions” rather than securities.

52008383,https://invezz.com/?p=2890766,1758357437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"As BNB soars past 10% last week crossed $1,000, while an altcoin already up 250%",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/20/as-bnb-soars-past-10-last-week-crossed-1000-while-an-altcoin-already-up-250/,"When traders ask what is going on with crypto today, headlines often highlight explosive moves from established names like Binance Coin (BNB). Last week, BNB crossed the $1,000 milestone after a double-digit surge, reigniting confidence in exchange-backed tokens. Yet beyond the spotlight, another story is quietly unfolding: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an altcoin already up 250% in its presale, is attracting attention with a blend of structured tokenomics, lending mechanics, and early momentum that sets it apart from market hype. BNB’s momentum and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s rising alternative BNB’s rapid climb showcases how established tokens benefit from strong infrastructure, global branding, and deep liquidity. Its rally reassures investors that, despite talk of a crypto crash today, capital continues to flow into projects with visible utility. But the same rally also highlights a challenge: entering BNB now requires heavy capital, and the room for outsized growth narrows compared to emerging alternatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as one of those alternatives. While BNB’s strength comes from its exchange ecosystem, MUTM is building a lending and borrowing network that connects retail and institutional users under one protocol. Its foundation is built on two complementary models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows users to supply blue-chip tokens and stablecoins into audited pools, earning interest while borrowers access liquidity at governed rates. Alongside P2C, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) framework is being designed to accommodate riskier assets in isolated environments, ensuring the core liquidity pools remain protected. This dual-structure approach allows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to serve different layers of the market without exposing its foundation to volatility shocks. Another standout feature is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. Platform revenue generated from borrowing and lending fees will be allocated toward open-market repurchases of MUTM. The repurchased tokens will then be distributed among mtToken stakers, directly linking network usage to sustained token demand. This creates a feedback loop where every new loan, repayment, or stake transaction increases competition among users to participate, amplifying long-term value. To ensure stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has built strict liquidity parameters. For example, ETH and stablecoins are expected to support Loan-to-Value ratios around 75% with liquidation thresholds at 80%. In contrast, more volatile tokens are capped near 35–44% LTV with a 65% liquidation trigger. These measures safeguard the system during market swings, ensuring liquidators remain incentivized and lenders remain protected. Presale momentum and utility-driven catalysts While BNB is going up in secondary markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting more popular in its presale. Tokens are now worth $0.035 in Phase 6, and more than 16,450 holders have raised more than $16 million. It’s important to note that 44% of Phase 6’s allotment has already been sold. Since Phase 7 costs $0.040, investors will automatically have to pay 15% more to get in. This presale pricing dynamic provides a sense of urgency for people who are looking for high-growth crypto investment options. The blueprint gives you more confidence. When Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are listed, the project will launch its beta site, which will let early users test lending, borrowing, stablecoin mechanics, and staking. Layer-2 scalability gives the system the power to keep transaction costs low and speed up settlements. This is important for resolving liquidations quickly and getting a lot of retail users on board. This Layer-2 method, together with expected listings on Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, Coinbase, and MEXC, will make it easier for anyone to use. It is thought that listing depth will bring in more money from investors and give institutional investors the price discovery and liquidity they need. These catalysts are similar to the forces that helped BNB grow from a small project to a multi-billion-dollar giant. Security and incentives make the image stronger. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been checked by CertiK and got a Token Scan Score of 90.00 and a Skynet Score of 79.00. There is a $50,000 bug bounty program with tiered payouts of up to $2,000 for important findings. This encourages continued protection. In addition, there is a $100,000 giveaway campaign going on to get more people involved in the community. It already has more than 12,000 followers on social media. People who are interested in the larger market may see BNB cross important milestones, but those who are questioning what is happening with crypto today are also finding the next wave of initiatives that might make them a lot of money. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a protocol that stands out in a market where confidence is tested by volatility. It combines borrowing activity, staking rewards, liquidation efficiency, and buyback systems to promote long-term growth. Investors have to choose between going after huge caps that are already worth billions of dollars or getting in early on a platform whose presale has already brought in $16 million and whose token is meant to capture lending demand at every level.

According to new revelations, the fund, which the Vancouver Firefighter Charities administer, is set to accept both cash donations and digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. In the statement released by the Mayor’s office, the development comes from figures released by the Canadian Mental Health Association that show that suicide rates among firefighters are 30% higher than those of the general public, due to the trauma they face on the job. “To date, donors have pledged a combined total of 3.5 bitcoin to the fund, a value equivalent to approximately C$550,000,” said a statement from the mayor’s office. Vancouver mayor floats firefighter mental health fund Initially, the Vancouver Fighter Charities had raised about 2.7 million Canadian dollars last week during a fundraiser. It was during the fundraiser that Sim announced the fund, explaining to the audience how it would help victims. According to the Mayor’s office, the pledges will be added to the raised funds, noting that it will go a long way to help victims of mental health issues among the firefighters in Vancouver. Eric Himmelman, the executive director of the Vancouver Firefighter Charities, said that the organization will do its best to distribute the funds meaningfully. “Any funding and awareness going towards delivering more mental health support for firefighters who are struggling is greatly appreciated and necessary now more than ever before,” he added. A report is expected to be presented by staff this fall. This initiative is coming at a time when there is increased volatility in the crypto market. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the Federal Reserve recently announced its first interest rate cut for 2025, leading analysts and experts to speculate that it could trigger bears in the short term. In addition, the cut has awoken whales, who are now shifting assets, which, according to analysts, might be moves to take profits before the asset drops further. Ken Sim continues to push for a Bitcoin-friendly city This is not Ken Sim’s first brush with digital assets, with the Vancouver Mayor mentioning last year that he is interested in cryptocurrency investments. He mentioned it at a council meeting in November 2024, noting that he plans to present a motion titled, “Preserving the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Resources Becoming a Bitcoin Friendly City.” The push came at a time when corporations were moving into Bitcoin, and countries were also looking to set up their Bitcoin strategic reserve. When asked for more information on his motion, Sim, at the time, did not give too many details. He noted that he did not have any additional details to share until he submitted the final motion, a move that has since caused division among residents in Vancouver. According to some of the residents, Sim appears to be pro-Bitcoin, and they love him for it. They believe that he wants Vancouver to become the next Bitcoin-friendly city in the world. “That seems to be the goal, so we’ll see where that goes, but it’s exciting,” a resident said. Meanwhile, the thought didn’t seem to go down well with Andreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, who urged caution on these kinds of investments. “I don’t actually like it when government officials, in any form, invest public money in anything,” he said. “It’s not their business to do.” Park mentioned that instead of diving headfirst into digital assets, the government should focus on blockchain technology, noting that it could be useful to the entire city. Meanwhile, Sim has continued to push for Vancouver to become a Bitcoin-friendly city, with the mayor quoted in a recent interview saying that pushing for Bitcoin is a hill he is willing to die on.

Market screens showed Dogecoin edging back toward levels last seen during its spring rally, while XRP recaptured price points lost after last year’s courtroom drama, both moves fueled by the prospect that fund managers could soon seek formal approval for products tracking the pair. Against this backdrop, Zexpire’s freshly issued $ZX token has surfaced as an unexpected subplot, positioning the start-up’s prediction market as a venue for wagering on the timing and outcome of ETF filings. Early adopters are already placing stakes on regulatory milestones, turning the token into a barometer for sentiment around new listings and offering traders an additional outlet to hedge or amplify bets sparked by the renewed ETF narrative. Shiba Smiles and Crypto Miles: Dogecoin's Journey From Meme to Market Born in 2013 from the playful minds of Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin pairs the internet’s beloved Shiba Inu with a digital coin that moves funds between people in seconds. Built on code once used by LuckyCoin and Litecoin, it offers faster confirmations and no hard cap on supply, turning the project into an open-ended playground rather than a scarce treasure hunt. The light-hearted mascot and friendly branding quickly set the tone for a coin that never wanted to act like a stiff suit in a boardroom. That easygoing spirit captured hearts well beyond early tech circles. Tweets from high-profile fans such as Elon Musk sent the coin rocketing to an all-time peak of $0.7376 in May 2021, though the figure later settled near one-third of that mark. Community-driven campaigns have paid for Olympic bobsledders, drilled water wells in Kenya, and tipped content creators across social media, proving that crypto can fuel generosity as easily as speculation. Wild price swings have become part of the lore, yet a devoted fan base keeps daily trading volumes humming and market-cap rankings comfortably within the global top ten. Zexpire Introduces One-Click Simplicity to Capture Crypto Options Boom Crypto options has become one of DeFi’s fastest-growing segments, as its daily trading volumes average around $3 billion. Traditionally, this market has long been dominated by professionals, but now it’s starting to open up to a broader audience. Zexpire, the first 0DTE DeFi protocol, removes the complexity of options trading and turns it into a one-click prediction experience. The process is reduced to a binary choice: users bet on whether the price will stay within a defined range or break out in the next 24 hours Simply put, trading with Zexpire works like this: Guess right, and you win. Guess wrong, and your loss is capped at your stake. No margin calls. No cascading liquidations. $ZX Serves the Fuel Behind Simplified Options Trading with Zexpire To earn on volatility with Zexpire, you need its native token ZX. It serves as a governance token and provides its holders with discounts on game tickets and cashback on losses. Before its exchange debut, $ZX is available in in seed access at just $0.003, nearly 800% cheaper than the planned listing price of $0.025. Besides the reduced price, early participants get more advantages such as: Staking rewards up to 5% before a TGE Loyalty bonuses Airdrops and beta access $ZX Rises with Each Stage — Buy Now for the Steepest Discounts Zexpire has also built in a deflationary mechanism. 20% of platform fees will be burned, and a buyback program is designed to support demand. $ZX is available across multiple chains including Base, Solana, TON, and Tron and can be purchased directly with a card. Why $ZX Could Be the Next Breakout Token Options trading has become one of crypto’s biggest growth stories. BTC options volumes regularly hit billions, yet participation is dominated by pros. Zexpire is making a contrarian bet by stripping it all down to a fast, gamified format. HYPE became one of this cycle’s strongest tokens by riding the derivatives boom on Hyperliquid. Zexpire is aiming to do the same in the options niche, but with an even broader retail angle: fixed-risk mechanics and gameplay simplicity that make it accessible to anyone. If Zexpire can capture even a fraction of the momentum that HYPE did, $ZX could be DeFi’s next breakout token. Buy $ZX, the Next Breakout Token XRP’s Fast Lane: Can Ripple’s Token Outpace the Market in 2025 and Beyond? Born as the fuel for Ripple’s lightning-quick payment network, XRP moves funds across borders in seconds while handling up to 1,500 transactions each second—far faster than the queues seen on many rival blockchains. Its consensus model skips energy-hungry mining and leans on trusted node lists, keeping fees tiny and making the coin a natural fit for banks and payment firms that already tap Ripple’s rails for everyday transfers. The token’s price story has been a roller-coaster, sliding from less than a cent in 2013 to a $3.84 peak in 2018, then dipping to $2.42 today. A long legal tussle with U.S. regulators clouded sentiment, yet the August 2024 decision that trimmed Ripple’s penalty to $125 million sparked a 26 percent bounce and fresh headlines. With Bitcoin and Ethereum often hogging the spotlight, XRP still stands out for sheer speed and its growing roster of institutional partners, including banks in Europe and Latin America. Conclusion DOGE and XRP kept their momentum as traders weighed fresh ETF talk. Both coins held firm even as wider markets wobbled, showing that buzz can still lift the most familiar names. Their resilience underscores a steady appetite for simple, liquid assets in a field crowded with complex plays. That backdrop sets the stage for the next twist in crypto speculation. Zexpire offers that twist. The platform turns daily Bitcoin swings into a yes-or-no call on range or breakout, capping losses while removing margin calls. Each move is settled in $ZX, driving constant demand for the token through fees, discounts, and programmed buybacks. Buying $ZX now means a spot in line before wider adoption and represents a promising opportunity too.

They excel at securing executive bylines and mainstream finance coverage, ensuring trust and authority. Best forBlockchain firms seeking trust, credibility, and C-level visibility rather than short-term hype. 5. FINPR (Cost-Effective PR for Startups) FINPR offers performance-oriented PR services that are budget-friendly. With strong DeFi and NFT experience, they’re an efficient option for startups and lean teams that need clear deliverables. Best forEarly-stage companies with tight budgets seeking ROI-focused campaigns. 6. Wachsman (Legacy Brand with Global Reach) One of the earliest crypto PR firms, Wachsman has a broad network and experience with high-profile launches. Their reputation and scale make them attractive to enterprises and projects needing a safe, established partner. Best forBig players needing multi-region campaigns and corporate-grade visibility. Final Takeaway The crypto PR landscape has matured. Today’s leading agencies balance media relationships, analytics, and cost-efficiency.

She currently holds 144,187 shares in the company, with 48 transactions executed throughout the past six months. Kress’s cumulative sales over the past six months are 196,290 shares worth about $332.8 million. Nvidia insiders executed 344 stock trades over the past six months Nvidia CEO Huang Jensen sold the most shares over the past six months, cumulatively amounting to 4.05 million through 224 transactions. Quiver quantitative analysis revealed that the transactions granted him about $689.2 million. Mark A. Stevens, one of the board members at the AI chip company, executed the sale of 2.52 million shares for $377 million, while Tench Coxe sold one million shares for $142.8 million. Other senior executives in the firm who were noted include Brooke Seawell, Ajay Puri, and Dawn E. Hudson. Some analysts have attributed the sales to profit-taking rather than a lack of investor confidence in the company’s growth following heavy backing from institutional investors. Large institutional investors such as Kingstone Capital have increased their stake in the company’s stock, showing great confidence in its performance. Kingston Capital Partners Texas added 382.2 million shares worth about $60,388,694,648 in Q2 of 2025, effectively increasing its stake by 267,959%. Capital Research Global Investors accumulated 46,228,880 shares in Q2, estimated to be worth around $7,303,700,751. JPMorgan Chase & Co., on the other hand, acquired 41,486,164 shares worth approximately $6,554,399,050 in Q2 2025. Gamma Investing LLC, Vanguard Group Inc., Price T Rowe Associates Inc., and UBS AM, a distinct business unit of UBS Asset Management Americas LLC, are other notable institutional investors who increased their stake in the Nvidia stock in Q2 of 2025. Rating firms issue a ‘Buy’ rating for Nvidia stock Government institutions and politicians in the U.S. Congress have also reported atleast 76 trades in Nvidia stock in the past six months. Representative Cleo Fields made the largest transaction with 40 stock purchases worth about $11.9 million. Representative Jefferson Shreve accumulated approximately $250,000 in the stock through 4 purchases made within the past six months. Rating firms have also shown a strong confidence in the Nvidia stock, with recent Buy ratings issued by several firms. DA Davidson, Citigroup , Rosenblatt, Benchmark, and Needham have all issued the ‘Buy’ rating. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley issued an “Overweight” rating on 08/28/2025. Multiple analysts have also issued their price targets for $NVDA, with a median target of $214.0. At least 31 analysts gave a stock price range between $200 and $230. John Vinh from Keybanc set the target price of $230.0 on 08/28/2025, which is notable as the highest, and Atif Malik from Citigroup set the lowest target price of $200.0 on 09/08/2025. $NVDA current price is $176.6, which is up 0.2% over the past 24 hours, with a daily range of $175.18 – $178.08.

Miss the right entry, and you watch others run away with the gains. Momentum is building across major names, but one emerging PayFi altcoin is stealing attention for real utility and rapid adoption. Yes, Remittix is on that shortlist. By the end of this read, you will know which project looks like the best crypto to buy now for asymmetric upside. Dogecoin’s Current Status: The Meme Coin’s Endurance Dogecoin (DOGE) trades around $0.275 with liquidity supported by a massive community and constant retail interest. Developers are discussing improvements such as zero knowledge proof verification and better bridges to improve throughput and interoperability. That said, DOGE still lives and falls by social energy. If momentum stalls, upside can fade quickly. For traders who need steady catalysts, DOGE can struggle to qualify as the best crypto to buy now, but it remains a liquid vehicle for shorter moves. Chainlink Update: Oracle Powerhouse Holding Strong Chainlink (LINK) changes hands near $24 after a 24-hour range between roughly $23.84 and $24.83. Integrations continue to expand, and demand for high-quality oracle data across DeFi and TradFi keeps the network essential. LINK is respected for reliability and long-term fundamentals. However, with the market seeking faster multiples right now, some investors question whether LINK is the best crypto to buy now for the highest near-term returns. Remittix: The DeFi Project Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments Here is where urgency kicks in. Remittix (RTX) is priced around $0.1080 and built for crypto to bank transfers in more than 30 countries. The team has completed full verification with Certik and currently holds the top position on that auditor’s pre-launch leaderboard. Wallet beta testing is live, with real users in the community already putting features through their paces. Add confirmed exchange listings on BitMart and LBANK, and you get credibility plus immediate market access. Compared with Dogecoin and Chainlink, Remittix blends utility, speed, and narrative. DOGE relies on culture. LINK relies on integrations. RTX targets daily payments and remittances that the world already performs. If you want the best crypto to buy now for real-world traction and a clear path to scale, this is the name to watch. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Global reach that lets users send crypto directly to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. Real-world utility for freelancers, remitters, and businesses that need instant value transfer. Independently verified security with a top ranking among pre-launch tokens. Live wallet beta delivering real-time FX conversion and a mobile-first experience. Strong market proof with more than $26.1 million raised and a rapidly growing holder base. For investors asking which project is the best crypto to buy now, Dogecoin offers culture, and Chainlink offers infrastructure. However, Remittix offers product progress, exchange access, and a price point that can still move. Act before the next catalysts land or accept the regret of watching from the sidelines.

Given the size of U.S. financial markets, expectations are high that the ETF debut could help XRP target higher levels, with OpenAI’s ChatGPT offering potential projections to watch. Notably, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) began trading on the Cboe BZX exchange on September 18, ranking among the most successful debuts of the year. XRPR recorded about $37.7 million in first-day volume, including roughly $24 million within the first 90 minutes. Despite the strong inflows, XRP’s price hovered near $3, suggesting investors are waiting for broader adoption and additional ETF approvals to trigger the next rally. Those additional products may be close considering several major issuers have pending spot XRP ETF applications, including Bitwise, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale, and Canary Capital. XRP price prediction On the price outlook, Finbold consulted ChatGPT-5 for insights into XRP’s potential trajectory. The model noted that when U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in early 2024, BTC surged nearly 70% in two months to a record high. Ethereum’s spot ETFs, fueled a 50% rally within weeks. If XRP follows a similar path, analysts expect meaningful upside. In this case, ChatGPT-5 outlined three scenarios: a conservative case where XRP climbs to about $5 by early 2026, a moderate case reaching $7 by mid-2026, and a bullish case, driven by strong ETF inflows, fresh approvals, and favorable market conditions, where XRP could hit $10 by the end of 2026.

XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $3.01, down about 1% in the past 24 hours and more than 4% on the week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The token is holding near its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at the same level, while the 200-day SMA sits lower at $2.56, pointing to a sustained upward trend. At the same time, short-term indicators remain mixed, with the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) at 50.50, reflecting a neutral stance. Meanwhile, volatility stands at 3.38%, signaling modest but steady price swings.

With Ripple aiming toward $4.50, many are asking what the best altcoin to buy is right now. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly entering that conversation as one option gaining buzz. REX-Osprey XRP ETF delays keep traders guessing The launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF has been a story of shifting deadlines. Initially set for September 11, it was pushed to the 12th, and now analysts like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart say it could go live later this week. His colleague Eric Balchunas suggested September 18 as the most likely date for the Dogecoin ETF, which might launch before XRP’s own product. These delays highlight how difficult the ETF process can be, even for big issuers like REX and Osprey. The products are structured under the Investment Act of 1940, making them slightly different from spot ETFs. For XRP, this means the much-anticipated “first spot ETF” tag may not apply just yet. Still, the attention is there, and every update adds fuel to Ripple’s climb. DTCC lists Canary XRP ETF Another twist came when DTCC listed the Canary XRP ETF (XRPC) alongside other upcoming funds. Many in the XRP community viewed this as a positive sign. However, ETF expert Nate Geraci was quick to caution that listing does not equal approval. It’s more about back-end readiness, not a green light from the SEC. The SEC continues to review several XRP ETF applications, with deadlines in October and November. If approved, they could add serious visibility and attract inflows. For now, the market is watching and waiting, keeping XRP’s price in focus. CME Reports $1 billion in XRP Futures Even without a spot ETF, institutional demand for XRP is strong. Futures products have already seen billions in activity, with CME reporting $1 billion in open interest within three months. Teucrium’s leveraged XRP ETF even became its top product in record time. This activity shows how much appetite exists for XRP exposure, especially among funds and larger players. Analysts argue that once a spot ETF is live, it could magnify this effect and give Ripple the push it needs to break above $4.50 and beyond. MAGACOIN FINANCE: a best altcoin to buy alongside XRP While XRP fights for ETF approval, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving its place as the best altcoin to buy right now. Dubbed by some as the next SHIB or PEPE, this token is newer, has exchange listings underway, and could deliver gains faster than XRP. Many who missed XRP’s early run are now looking at MAGACOIN as the fresh entry point. Some analysts suggest it could surge up to 80x before XRP completes its next move. How traders can position With XRP aiming for $4.50 and ETFs driving headlines, traders have two clear plays: stay tuned for Ripple’s regulatory news and explore rising stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE before listings hit. Timing matters, and acting early on altcoins can often be the difference between watching the rally and being part of it.

In its statement, the body cited several reasons, highlighting serious national security and financial integrity concerns as the major reasons. In its statement, the Council mentioned that virtual assets like cryptocurrencies pose huge risks of money laundering, terrorist financing , and proliferation financing due to the anonymous and decentralized nature of the assets. “Cryptocurrencies enable rapid, cross-border transactions that are difficult to trace, making them attractive to criminal networks and extremist groups,” the Council chairperson, Selina Kuruleca, said. Fiji remains adamant on the prohibition of VASPs According to Kuruleca, the stance of Fiji concerning digital assets is based more on the risks attached to them and is in line with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). She mentioned that while most countries have opted to regulate their crypto space, the current enforcement and supervision capabilities in Fiji do not yet support safe oversight of a sector she describes as “complex.” “The Council’s priority remains the protection of Fiji’s financial system and the safety of its people, while promoting a secure and transparent environment that supports legitimate investment and economic growth,” Kuruleca said. The Council added that even though the regulation of virtual assets could offer benefits, regulation without the needed infrastructure will expose the country to serious vulnerabilities. The National Anti-Money Laundering Council is responsible for coordinating efforts against money laundering and financial crimes. It assembles top-level representatives from several industries, including the Reserve Bank of Fiji, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Fiji Police Force, Customs Services, the Financial Intelligence Unit, and Fiji Revenue. The prohibition on VASPs in Fiji will remain in place until the country strengthens its regulatory and technological capacity. Crypto-related activities are banned, the RBF notice reads This is not the first time that Fiji has released a notice concerning crypto-related dealings, with the RBF releasing a notice to caution the public on the use and investment in digital assets . In the document, the Reserve Bank of Fiji advised the public that digital assets are not recognized as legal tender in Fiji, and therefore, they cannot be used either for payment of goods or as payment for services. The RBF also added that the only legal tender recognized is its currency and coins issued by the bank. In addition, the bank also added that it is illegal for residents to purchase or invest in digital assets from funds held in Fiji. This includes the use of debit cards or credit cards to pay for such transactions. According to the premier bank, penalties will be served under the Exchange Control Act and will also be applied if a resident in Fiji invests in digital assets or any related instruments abroad without express approval from the RBF. The bank also warned against the promotion of investment schemes tied to digital assets, warning persons or entities involved to steer clear. According to the bank, the investment schemes are promoted across several channels, including social media. The bank added that it has yet to release a license, and neither has it authorized any party to offer crypto trading or investment opportunities in the country. It added that anybody found guilty of this breach will be subject to punishments under the RBF Act (1983) and the Exchange Control Act (1950). Fiji’s strict stance against crypto closes the door on digital assets being used as a cheaper and faster alternative for businesses looking to carry out transactions across the border. This forces businesses to rely on traditional banking channels, which often come with higher fees and slower processing times. While these are some of the negatives, the ability to monitor financials and curb money laundering and other forms of financial misconduct has been fingered by the country as a win.

Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More Based on reports, the purchases were made through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter desk and arrived in several chunks rather than a single block. Purchase Broken Into Four Tranches The recent buys were split into four settlements: 3,247 ETH ($14.50 million), 3,258 ETH ($14.6 million), 4,494 ETH ($20 million), and 4,428 ETH ($19.75 million). That totals about 15,427 ETH, which sums to roughly $69 million at the prices reported. According to public trackers cited in the coverage, these were likely coordinated OTC trades designed to avoid moving the spot market. TOM LEE IS BUYING EVEN MORE $ETH Tom Lee’s Bitmine just bought another $69M of ETH from Galaxy Digital. They now hold $8.66 BILLION of ETH.$BMNR is bullish on $ETH. pic.twitter.com/t9BWh9btPR — Arkham (@arkham) September 19, 2025 How Much Of Ethereum Does BitMine Hold Reports have disclosed that BitMine now holds about 1.95 million ETH. That holding is valued at about $8.66 billion using the same pricing used in the coverage. Analysts tracking corporate treasuries say that corporate and institutional ETH reserves together amount to a few percent of circulating supply, and BitMine is listed among the largest single holders. The figures can look large when compared with total ETH supply, but the share depends on which supply measure is used — circulating, staked, or otherwise locked. Market Mechanics Behind The Move Buying large amounts on OTC desks is common for public companies and big players. It reduces slippage and keeps big orders off public order books. The ETH here moved without obvious price spikes. Some transfers were visible on chain; the private terms of OTC trades usually remain confidential. Based on reports citing blockchain trackers like Arkham, the on-chain flows matched the size and timing described. Risk, Accounting And Strategy Holding vast amounts of a volatile token carries real risks. A sharp fall in ETH would hit BitMine’s balance sheet. At the same time, steady accumulation signals a clear strategic bet on future appreciation. Market observers compare this approach to other firms that hold crypto as part of their corporate treasury, and regulators and accountants will watch how such holdings are reported in quarterly filings.

Reports cite Arkham and Strategic Ether Reserve as the primary sources, but OTC trades do not reveal full pricing details and the exact terms are often private. Because those settlements happen off-exchange, public records show transfers but not every pricing details. Large holders’ activity tends to attract extra attention when ETH moves sharply up or down. Based on these numbers, the move is one more sign of large corporate accumulation of ETH.

The Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF, which begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker “GDLC,” combines the five largest and most liquid digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Grayscale CEO Declares New Era Of Crypto Index Investing Peter Mintzberg, CEO of Grayscale, emphasized the nature of this new launch, suggesting it heralds a new era of crypto index investing. In an interview with CNBC, he stated, “We are typically in the first mover position. Grayscale will continue innovating at scale for investors to access the fastest growing asset class of the last 10 years.” The increasing demand for diversified exposure to cryptocurrencies is evident among both institutional and retail investors amid rising prices. The movement towards mainstream acceptance of digital assets has gained momentum, particularly under the Trump administration , which facilitated the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in retirement plans and a new regulatory framework. The GDLC fund allocates approximately 70% of its assets to Bitcoin and 20% to Ether, and it has been trading in various forms since 2018, most recently in over-the-counter markets. In 2025, Grayscale’s GDLC has already achieved major growth, surging over 40% as many cryptocurrencies reach record highs. Notably, the fund has outperformed Bitcoin by nearly 11% since June, thanks to the strong performance of its other constituent assets. Analyst Predicts Over 100 New Crypto ETFs Experts are optimistic that this new standard will streamline the process for launching similar products, potentially ushering in a wave of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds . Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, noted on social media that the last time a generic listing standard was implemented for ETFs, the number of launches tripled. He predicts a surge of over 100 crypto ETFs could enter the market in the coming year. Supporters of this initiative argue that it could position digital assets on equal footing with traditional financial products, a goal that past SEC commissions have been hesitant to embrace. Greg Xethalis, General Counsel at MultiCoin Capital, commented on the SEC’s previous regulatory stance, noting that prior commissions often used regulatory frameworks as a means of imposing merit regulations on well-established product structures, despite the novelty of the underlying assets. He remarked, “As shown by the Bitcoin ETP launch, the market wants this product option, and this latest move both heeds that call and is a welcome return to normal course at the Commission.” In addition to the GDLC launch, the SEC is reportedly on the verge of approving Bitwise’s BITW, an index fund that tracks the top ten cryptocurrencies by weighted market capitalization. Next month, the SEC is also expected to consider a series of individual spot crypto ETPs, including those focused on Ethereum staking, Litecoin (LTC), Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE).

52007439,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83831,1758358958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit: If XRP Doesn’t Blast Up to $200+ By EOY After 8 Years of Waiting…,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-if-xrp-doesnt-blast-up-to-200-by-eoy-after-8-years-of-waiting/,"Crypto enthusiast Stephanie Starr recently stated on X that XRP should reach more than $200 before the end of the year. In her post , she highlights eight years of waiting, the arrival of several ETFs, and the revelation of 1,700 partnerships during the lawsuit, which she emphasized has now concluded. Starr framed her remarks as both a forecast and a sign of impatience, making clear that she believes the combination of these developments should result in a dramatic surge in price. Her post captured a tone of anticipation, stressing that after years of setbacks and delays, the present market conditions should be enough to propel XRP to an unprecedented valuation. If XRP doesn't blast up to $200+ by EOY after 8 long years of waiting and all these ETFs, 1,700 partnerships under NDA discovered during the lawsuit, (WHICH BY THE WAY, IS NOW OVER.) I'm going to scream The anticipation is killing me pic.twitter.com/VEEUED6Vun — Stephanie Starr (@StephanieStarrC) September 19, 2025 Frustration From Other Community Members In the replies, one X user, Tony Phan, echoed similar dissatisfaction with XRP’s pace of progress. He noted that after eight years, the asset has yet to deliver what he considers meaningful returns. According to his response, XRP should already be trading between $13 and $20 . But instead, holders are faced with the possibility of waiting several more years for a significant rally. This reflected a viewpoint held by a segment of the community that the timelines for XRP’s expected appreciation have continually shifted, leaving long-term holders frustrated with the lack of substantial movement. Quantitative Counterpoint From OFella Another reply, written by a user identifying as OFella, took a more analytical approach. He placed XRP’s current value at about $3 and calculated that a price of $200 would represent a 66-fold increase, translating to a market capitalization of approximately $12 trillion. He argued that such a valuation would exceed the combined worth of Apple, Microsoft, and Saudi Aramco, double the entire gold ETF market, and amount to nearly half of U.S. GDP. Based on this reasoning, he concluded that a $200 valuation this year was not plausible under current liquidity and market structure. Instead, OFella suggested more moderate projections. He noted that under a base case scenario of ETF inflows combined with technical breakouts, XRP could reach $10 to $20. He then outlined an “extreme case” in which ETF-driven momentum combined with geopolitical shocks could send the price to $25 to $40 over the next one to two years. Beyond $50, he argued, would require XRP to replace multiple global financial systems, which he considered theoretically possible over a much longer horizon but not feasible within the next few months. Starr’s post underscored a strand of optimism within the community that views recent institutional developments and the conclusion of the lawsuit as immediate catalysts for dramatic appreciation. However, the responses demonstrated that many participants remain cautious, with some applying market-level arithmetic to highlight why certain projections may be unrealistic in the short term.

ADA, SOL, and XRP Struggle at Key Resistance Levels",https://bitzo.com/2025/09/bull-trap-ahead-ada-sol-and-xrp-struggle-at-key-resistance-levels,"ADA, SOL, and XRP are facing pivotal moments, potentially hinting at a bull trap. Their current price struggles at major resistance zones spark interest and speculation. Powered by data-driven insights from Outset PR , this analysis tracks how ADA, SOL, and XRP are navigating critical resistance levels that could shape their next moves. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Growth Amid Stable Prices Source: tradingview Cardano's price is currently nestled between 83 and 95 cents. It hasn't moved much this week but climbed almost 6% over the past month. In half a year, it's grown over 27%. Despite its quiet week, Cardano shows promise. Key challenges are a little over a dollar, with firmer levels beyond a dollar and ten cents. If Cardano breaks the closest barrier, it could climb 7% from where it is now, with room for more if it surges past the next hurdle. With a low RSI, there's room for buyers to step in, potentially pushing ADA higher. Keep an eye on how it tackles these levels for signs of growth. Solana’s Price Steadily Rises Amid Potential Growth Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between around $214 and $258. It's riding a wave of upward momentum, showing a nearly 85% increase over six months. Recently, it also rose by about 35% in the past month. The nearest resistance level is at $275, and the coin could potentially test this limit soon. If Solana manages to break through, it might aim for additional gains toward the next resistance at $319. On the downside, support kicks in at $187, offering a safety net if prices dip. With Solana's recent growth, it’s a vibrant time for followers of the coin. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter?

Over the past month, XRP moved up nearly 5%. Short-term indicators like the RSI and Stochastic suggest it might be oversold, which could hint at a rebound. If it climbs past the $3.35 mark, it may target $3.67, offering potential growth of over 15% from its lower range. However, if it slips, it might find support at $2.71 or even $2.39. In the bigger picture, its six-month climb of nearly 27% indicates XRP has room to grow, but it needs to rally past those resistance levels to unlock further potential. Conclusion The struggles of ADA, SOL, and XRP at key resistance zones highlight the fine balance between opportunity and risk in the crypto market. A decisive breakout could spark renewed momentum, but failure to overcome current barriers risks trapping bullish sentiment. Outset PR’s strength lies in monitoring these evolving market narratives and translating them into stories that align with broader investor sentiment—showing how data-backed clarity can reveal which assets are primed for growth in the next phase of the cycle.

According to the company's statement, the corrective bullish structure indicated in previous analyses for Solana proved effective, but the price retreated again with an impulsive (c) wave. While a recovery is currently underway, it was stated that significant resistance levels must be overcome for the upward trend to become sustained. According to the analyst firm, the overall downward movement in Solana is still corrective within the (A)-(B)-(C) formation. Analysts stated that the upcoming period will be decisive in determining whether an impulsive recovery will begin. Analysts shared their views on critical resistance and liquidity zones as follows: $223: A strong resistance level combined with high liquidity. Breaking above it would be the first positive signal for a sustainable recovery. $246: A breakout of this level could open the rally towards the $270 target. $198 (0.5 Fibonacci) and $193 (0.618 Fibonacci): First defensive zones in case of possible pullbacks. $188: Offers strong support. However, a drop below this level could trigger a new downward wave. Related News: Cryptocurrency Crisis on X - Company Issues Statement Technical analysis chart shared by MakroVision. MakroVision noted that Solana is trading just below critical resistance levels, adding that an impulsive break above $223 would be a turning point for bulls. Otherwise, the price could retest the $188 support level, he warned. *This is not investment advice.

The model features a two-million token context window and introduces a unified architecture that integrates reasoning and non-reasoning modes. This could help developers adjust the computational effort applied to their use cases without sacrificing performance. “2M context window!” CEO Elon Musk wrote on X, quoting the announcement for the new model. Grok 4 Fast has efficient tokens working on reduced prices xAI reported that Grok 4 Fast was trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning to autonomously decide when to use external resources such as code execution or web browsing. The tech company claimed it can move rapidly through links, analyze multimedia on X, and synthesize information in real time. In internal tests , the system required 40% fewer tokens on average than Grok 4 to complete complex reasoning tasks, a 98% reduction in the cost of reaching comparable benchmark results. Intelligence density benchmark. Source: xAI Independent evaluations from Artificial Analysis ranked Grok 4 Fast as having the best price-to-intelligence ratio among publicly available models. A chart released from the review showed Grok 4 Fast competing closely with systems such as GPT-5 , Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 4.1 Opus, while being nearly 47 times cheaper to operate than Grok 4. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, Grok 4 Fast has been tested in LMArena, an independent leaderboard where models compete in text and search challenges. Under the “Menlo” codename, Grok 4 Fast topped the Search Arena with an Elo rating of 1,163. The margin was 17 points higher than its closest competitor, o3-search. For now, the model is available free of charge through OpenRouter and Vercel AI Gateway. xAI also launched the system in two variants: grok-4-fast-reasoning and grok-4-fast-non-reasoning. Both versions share the two-million token context window. Through the xAI API, pricing for grok-4-fast is set at $0.20 per million input tokens below 128,000 tokens, and $0.40 per million input tokens above that threshold. Output tokens cost $0.50 per million for smaller requests and $1.00 per million for larger ones. Cached input tokens are priced at $0.05 per million. xAI laid off AI tutors before Grok 4 Fast launch The launch comes just a week after xAI laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team, the largest unit within the company. These employees were responsible for labeling and categorizing data that trains the Grok models. Emails sent to staff on the evening of September 12 informed them of the layoffs, with those affected being promised continued salaries until November 30. However, their access to internal systems was cut off immediately. The AI company shared a post on X announcing it was recruiting specialist AI tutors, alongside plans to increase the size of its specialist tutor group from STEM fields by tenfold. The layoffs follow several high-profile exits from the company. Among them was Mike Liberatore, xAI’s chief financial officer, who recently stepped down. Musk is reportedly trying to reorient the company after his personal and political setbacks earlier this year. The 54-year-old billionaire has focused all his time on xAI since parting ways with President Donald Trump in June. Once aligned on technology and economic policy, and even sharing stages during Trump’s presidential campaign, the two clashed publicly, leading Musk to declare the government a “hopeless problem.” Don’t just read crypto news.

52009243,https://invezz.com/?p=2890773,1758360318,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"BNB breaks four digits, but retail investors rush into a cheaper altcoin expected to rally faster than BNB did",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/20/bnb-breaks-four-digits-but-retail-investors-rush-into-a-cheaper-altcoin-expected-to-rally-faster-than-bnb-did/,"When Binance Coin (BNB) first launched, few imagined it would ever cross four digits. Yet today, BNB’s surge past $1,000 has cemented its place among the giants of the market. While this milestone is celebrated by early adopters, many retail investors are left priced out, unable to enter at a level that feels accessible. As larger crypto coins rise into territory that small investors struggle to reach, attention is now shifting to the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an altcoin still in its early stages but expected to accelerate faster than BNB ever did. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at just $0.035. Over $16 million has already been raised, with 44% of the Phase 6 allocation sold. Urgency is building, as Phase 7 will increase the token price by 15% to $0.040. For retail investors searching through crypto predictions and crypto charts to find the next breakout, this presale is becoming the focal point. A stablecoin-driven protocol with built-in demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not another speculative token. It introduces a decentralized finance protocol with a $1-pegged stablecoin at its core. The stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral, creating disciplined issuance that is always backed by assets. Repayments or liquidations will burn supply, ensuring circulation remains tied to real borrowing activity. Governance will play a key role in peg stability, adjusting borrowing interest rates when needed. If the stablecoin trades below $1, rates can be raised to encourage repayment, while if the price trends above $1, rates can be lowered to support expansion. Arbitrage opportunities will keep the system balanced, while overcollateralization rules mean every loan is safely backed. If collateral values drop due to market volatility, automated liquidations will ensure the platform’s solvency remains intact. This stablecoin system will underpin all of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending activity, making it central to long-term adoption and positioning the protocol as a unique competitor among crypto coins. Staking, buybacks, and sustainable liquidity Lenders and depositors on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will receive mtTokens that represent their share of pooled assets. These mtTokens can be staked to earn MUTM rewards, providing consistent incentives for long-term participation. Beyond staking, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has committed to a buy-and-distribute model: platform revenues will be used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, which will then be distributed to stakers. This creates a reinforcing cycle where higher usage directly translates into greater staking rewards. Fair valuation of collateral will be ensured through Chainlink oracle feeds, with fallback oracles and decentralized exchange trading data acting as additional safeguards. Liquidity will be maintained through utilization-based borrowing rates, which adjust dynamically depending on how much of the pool is being used. When liquidity is abundant, rates will remain attractive for borrowers; when liquidity becomes tight, higher rates will incentivize new deposits and repayments. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ability to blend stablecoin innovation with staking and buyback mechanics is a key reason crypto charts and analysts are now comparing its early trajectory with that of BNB in its formative years. Roadmap, security, and community incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has outlined a four-phase roadmap. Phase 1 initiated the presale, marketing campaigns, and external audits. Phase 2 is focused on core contract development and infrastructure, while Phase 3 will prepare for beta testing, exchange listings, and final audits. The pivotal Phase 4 will see the platform go live with MUTM claim activation, institutional partnerships, multi-chain expansion, and advanced features. Security is treated as a non-negotiable foundation. The project is undergoing review by CertiK using both manual analysis and automated scanning. It has already achieved a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, with a revised audit timeline set for May 20, 2025. To strengthen this framework, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $50,000 bug bounty program, with rewards scaling by severity: $2,000 for critical issues, $1,000 for major, $500 for medium, and $200 for low. The community is also being rewarded through a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. These initiatives are designed to attract engagement, strengthen security, and build confidence during the presale stages. An accessible opportunity before the next phase What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its affordability and its stage in the growth curve. Investors who joined during Phase 1 at $0.01 are already holding tokens worth 3.5X more at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. With the presale designed to culminate at $0.06 before listings, those entering today still stand to see strong appreciation before the token even reaches major exchanges. As adoption builds and the beta launch progresses, crypto predictions are already suggesting that MUTM could follow a trajectory similar to BNB, only this time accessible to retail participants from the start. Expected exchange listings on big platforms will broaden its visibility, and the integration of its $1 stablecoin and staking rewards will provide consistent demand drivers. BNB crossing $1,000 shows how high utility-driven tokens can rise. But with BNB already priced out of reach for many, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an opportunity at just $0.035 today — a point in time that retail investors will look back on as the true beginning of a breakout story.

But while SOL will benefit from the momentum, chatter among investors is shifting to newer cryptos with bigger upside potential. One of the ones that continually resurfaces in conversation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Still only $0.035 in presale, MUTM is gaining due to its lending and borrowing protocol which aims to reshape DeFi. For investors who feel Solana’s ETF increases are already priced in, Mutuum Finance is starting to appear like the safer bet for disproportionately outsized returns into the next bull cycle. Solana to Receive a Boost from ETF Tailwinds Solana (SOL) is currently at $244.84, with intraday prices ranging from $232.55 to $247.77. Institutional buying interest will likely drive SOL to levels above resistances, possibly to $300-$350 in the next leg of the rally, considering the imminent approval for spot ETFs. Key support appears to be standing strong at $220-$230 levels, giving some room for upside as market sentiment picks up. Whereas SOL can potentially gain a lot from capital inflow driven by ETFs, some investors rate newcomer DeFi token Mutuum Finance as having even more percentage upside on the upswing. Mutuum Finance Presale Impresses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is doing great in its sixth presale phase where it is gaining monumental momentum as investors in the market grow interested. Over 16,410 investors have already joined the project and the platform has already achieved the $16.01 million capital milestone. The trend is expected to continue gaining steam. Record-breaking milestones like these are an encouraging sign of increasing confidence of the investors as the platform nears launch. In addition to buying tokens at a lower cost, investors can anticipate massive gains in the long run as the ecosystem continues to grow. Investors are flocking to the project because of its dual lending model, long-term potential, open-source and fully audited codebase, and serious tokenomics. A Secure Platform Mutuum Finance has tried once again in a bid to provide security in its platform by joining forces with CertiK in the release of an official bug bounty program, with a guaranteed reward pool of up to $50,000. The reward is provided in four tiers of severity i.e. critical, major, minor and low in such a way that any weakness can be discovered and removed. By extending the invitation of outside auditing of its website by researchers and developers, Mutuum also invites the latest security features, which is an asset to its investor base security and trust. Tiered levels of Mutuum Loans to Value and levels of liquidation are determined according to the underlying collateral’s volatility. Reserve multipliers between a 10% level of safer and up to 35% of riskier items constitute the second source of stability. The system is as balanced in terms of access and safety and more market participation becomes possible and systemic risk is kept under control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the altcoin to keep an eye on as Solana (SOL) sets the stage for ETF-driven profits. Experts believe SOL will climb to $300–$350 once institutional investment through spot ETFs begins, but much of that upside already may be discounted. That leaves MUTM, currently at Stage 6 presale value at $0.035, offering investors significantly higher percentage upside potential. The project has brought in $16.01M+ and has 16,410+ holders, which is a marker of rapid momentum in the run-up to launch. With a dual lending protocol, $50K bug bounty on CertiK, and robust tokenomics, Mutuum Finance brings security, utility, and scalability together to be more than just a short-term trade.

According to several sources, the media house is not the only one on the list, with the recent cuts reflecting broader efforts by the company to cut costs. Google has been implementing several cost reductions across 2025, including the removal of 35% of managers who oversaw teams of at least three people. “Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of a meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.” Google begins cost reduction measures Google has also been offering voluntary exit programs across several divisions since January. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi mentioned late last year that the company will continue to push for more cost cuts, a development that has remained unchanged despite Alphabet seeing a strong Q2 2025, with $496.4 billion in revenue. These cuts may save thousands for Google, but they also come at a time when the company is facing strained relationships with publishers. According to August data from the trade association Digital Content Next, median referral traffic from Google Search to publishers dropped by 10% between May and June 2025, with non-new brands seeing a drop of 14%. In a report submitted by SimilarWeb, major outlets, including Business Insider, CNN, and HuffPost, have seen sharper traffic drops of 30%, 40%, and 40%, respectively. Publishers have attributed the drops to the company’s AI Overview feature, which has seen its click-throughs to external websites reduce from 56% to 69% since its launch, according to data from Pew Research. This spring, Pew mentioned that it analyzed data from 900 United States adults, with about six in ten seeing an AI-generated summary when they conducted at least a Google Search in March 2025. Publishers criticize AI web crawling activities As previously reported by Cryptopolitan earlier this month, Neil Vogel, the CEO of People, did not hold back in his criticism of Google. The CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the United States called the tech company a “bad actor” and accused it of using the same bot to crawl websites for its search engine as it does to support its AI features. “Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” said Vogel. Vogel claimed that Google Search represented more than 65% of People’s traffic, but the number has since dropped to around 20%. He also shared an AdExchanger statistic, which claimed that as of several years ago, Google accounts for about 90% of the platform’s traffic from the open web. “I’m not complaining. We’ve grown our audience. We’ve grown our revenue,” Vogel told conference attendees. “We’re doing great. What is not right about this is: You cannot take our content to compete with us.” In a scathing op-ed written this summer, Digital Content Next CEO Jason King mentioned that Google’s AI overviews were creating what he described as a “zero-click” environment where all traffic dead ends at Google. In his post, Kint claimed that it is not a call for special treatment, as he wants to preserve the integrity of the open web. “We must ensure that the same AI “answers” users see at the top of Google Search don’t become a free substitute for the original work they’re based on,” he said.

That resilience extends a three-week recovery as risk appetite improves after the Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut, which lowered the target range to 4.00%–4.25%. Just as important, the Fed’s outlook softened : the median path points to 3.6% for 2025, easing further to 3.4% in 2026 and 3.1% in 2027. If those estimates hold, the market could still see two more 25-bp moves (or one 50-bp step) this year. JUST ANNOUNCED: The Federal Reserve has just CUT RATES by 0.25%. Thanks, President Trump! #BullMarket Fed Chair Jerome Powell: ""Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower our policy interest rate by 1/4 percentage point."" THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA BEGINS RIGHT… pic.twitter.com/2Y6HImPR4q — AJ Huber (@Huberton) September 17, 2025 Lower expected policy rates tend to loosen financial conditions, and crypto—being the furthest out on the risk curve—often feels the upside first. Layer in steady institutional interest and corporate treasury attention, and you’ve got a constructive backdrop for BTC. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC continues to track a rising channel. After completing an ABCD advance, price faded from the wedge top near $118k–$119k and is now grappling with a supply band at $116.2k–$116.8k. The 50-SMA ($116,050) is capping rebounds intraday, while the 200-SMA (~$113,350) and a prior shelf at $114,400 define demand. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlesticks show spinning-top hesitation (small bodies, upper wicks), and RSI ~47 confirms cooling momentum, not capitulation. The structure of higher lows remains intact unless $113,300 breaks—only then does the risk skew toward a deeper mean-reversion. Key levels Support: $114,400–$114,600; $113,350–$113,300 Resistance: $116,200–$116,800; $117,980; $119,150 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade plan and risks For beginners, patience near support beats chasing into resistance. Consider a buy-the-dip only if price revisits $114,400–$114,600 and prints a bullish hammer or engulfing on the 4H close—evidence that buyers absorbed supply. Place a stop below $113,200 (under the 200-SMA and last swing low) to keep risk defined. First take-profit sits at $116,600 (mid-supply/50-SMA), with a second target at $117,980; if momentum flips decisively—think three white soldiers or a strong break-and-hold above the blue zone—leave a runner toward $119,150. If instead you see three black crows driving a close below $113,300, step aside. That would signal the channel has failed and opens room toward $112,100. Big picture, the Fed’s gentler path and growing institutional demand keep the upside case alive, but the chart still demands confirmation above $116.8k for the next leg higher. A genuine “surprise effect” could arrive if incoming data nudges the Fed even faster—fuel for a momentum pop—yet disciplined entries and exits remain your best edge.

The agency’s Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham named several crypto industry leaders to the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS). Pham appointed Katherine Minarik, chief legal officer at Uniswaps Labs; Ben Shwerwin, general counsel at Chainlink Labs; Avery Ching, co-founder and chief technology officer at Aptos Labs; and James J. Hill, managing director and head of structure innovation at BYN, as DAMS members. Scott Lucas, head of digital assets at JPMorgan, will join as co-chair of DAMS, along with Sandy Kaul, executive vice president at Franklin Templeton.

Pham (@CarolineDPham) September 19, 2025 Robert Boonij, CEO of Eurex, was appointed a GMAC member, while Laura Fuson, vice president and head of futures at Cboe Global Markets, joined as a GMSS member. Pham is also named Brad Sullivan, COO of ICE Futures, a member of the Technical Issues Subcommittee (TISS). CFTC Chair acknowledged Caroline Butler’s service as co-chair, recommending her for delivering regulatory clarity with the first-ever U.S. digital asset taxonomy and proposals for tokenized non-cash collateral. Pham also believes that Scott’s experience and deep knowledge of distributed ledger technology and the digital ecosystem will be indispensable to the subcommittee. “We look forward to working with the Commission and broader industry partners to help shape clear and effective regulatory frameworks in a well-structured digital asset market.” – Scott Lucas , Head of Markets Digital Assets at JPMorgan. Kaul also noted the contributions that GMAC and the DAMS provided to support President Donald Trump’s Working Group and introduce the current compliance program. She promised to continue advancing crypto innovation into the mainstream with well-crafted market outlooks, enabling greater efficiencies and opportunities for all investors. Trump is also eyeing additional candidates to lead the CFTC after the current nominee Brian Quintenz’s confirmation process stalls. The Trump Administration is allegedly looking for government officials working on crypto policy as potential candidates for the role. Bloomberg reported that the White House is considering Michael Selig, the current chief counsel to the SEC’s crypto task force. Tyler Williams, current counselor to the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on crypto policy, has also emerged as a potential candidate. Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Quintenz’s confirmation process as CFTC chair faced a setback after the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to pause the vote on his nomination. The source revealed that the request came after Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss asked Trump to stop or delay the process for Quintenz’s confirmation. Quintenz said on September 10 that he believes the President might have been misled. He disclosed messages showing Tyler Winklevoss’s questions regarding his prior litigation with the agency. He added that protecting the President and his agenda are more important than any job, and he was looking forward to continuing to support Trump’s agenda in whatever capacity he can. CFTC introduces second Crypto Sprint initiative Together, the @SECGov ’s Project Crypto and the @CFTC ’s Crypto Sprint are coordinating to answer President @realDonaldTrump ’s call to action for American leadership. We are going to win on crypto! 🇺🇸🫡 https://t.co/yi74rNCK16 — Caroline D. Pham (@CarolineDPham) August 21, 2025 Pham mentioned that she would resign once the Senate confirms the new chair, with reports indicating that she will be joining crypto firm Moonpay. Meanwhile, she has made several moves in the agency to favor the U.S. crypto industry, including allowing offshore exchanges to serve in the country via the Crypto Sprint initiative. Pham maintained that the Trump Administration wants to ensure that the immediate trading of digital assets at the Federal level is a top priority. She also called for public input from crypto market participants on how the CFTC can better regulate spot crypto trading via the second Crypto Sprint. Pham argued that the feedback will assist the agency in carefully considering issues for leveraged, margined, or financed retail trading on exchanges. The first Crypto Sprint initiative was launched earlier this month and aimed at enabling the trading of digital asset contracts on CFTC-registered futures exchanges. The Trump Administration had also previously issued a 166-page report outlining policy recommendations for regulating crypto in the U.S. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Yet for many retail investors, BNB’s lofty valuation feels out of reach. Buying a single unit already requires a four-figure commitment, limiting accumulation for smaller portfolios. This reality is turning attention toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project still in presale at just $0.035 and increasingly seen as a low-entry, high-upside opportunity. BNB’s $1,000 Milestone Binance Coin (BNB) achieved a historic milestone by surpassing $1,000 for the first time on September 18, 2025, trading at approximately $1,012 amid widespread market euphoria. This breakthrough, marking a 191% yearly gain from its starting price of around $350 in January 2025, propelled BNB’s market cap above $145 billion, solidifying its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. The surge was catalyzed by the BNB Chain’s Maxwell upgrade, which reduced transaction costs by 20% and boosted daily transactions to over 4 million, alongside institutional inflows including a $108 million purchase and a $500 million treasury allocation by key players. Technical indicators show BNB breaking through $962 resistance, with RSI at 72 indicating overbought conditions but strong momentum, support at $950, and potential resistance at $1,100. Social media buzz reflects investor excitement over Binance’s regulatory progress and DeFi TVL surge to $7.8 billion, though macro pressures like U.S. tariffs could trigger pullbacks. Analysts project a $1,200 target if $1,050 holds, but a drop below $950 risks $900. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A More Accessible DeFi Model Built for Long-Term Growth What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from high-priced alternatives is not just the entry point but its ecosystem design. The platform will operate two distinct lending frameworks: peer-to-contract (P2C) pools and peer-to-peer (P2P) arrangements. P2C pools will cover established tokens like ETH, BTC, SOL, and stablecoins, providing predictable liquidity for borrowers. P2P will allow isolated agreements for riskier tokens, protecting the system from instability while still rewarding lenders willing to engage in higher-yield contracts. Users who supply liquidity will receive mtTokens representing their deposit share. These mtTokens can be staked for MUTM rewards or even used as collateral themselves, adding a second layer of utility. Revenues generated from borrowing activity will fund ongoing MUTM buybacks, with the acquired tokens redistributed directly to mtToken stakers. This creates a continuous cycle where platform growth directly benefits active participants. In comparison to large-cap assets, this model positions MUTM as a platform where everyday investors can engage meaningfully without requiring the scale of capital that accumulating BNB now demands. For those looking at crypto investment through the lens of accessibility, this dual-revenue model stands out as a forward-thinking approach that strengthens user incentives over time. Why Analysts Are Targeting 300% Gains for MUTM The presale momentum further validates interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6, having already generated $16 million with more than 16,450 holders onboard. At the current $0.035 price, nearly half of this stage’s allocation is already sold. Once Phase 7 begins, the cost per token will rise to $0.040 — a 15% increase overnight. Hesitation simply means paying more later, which is why analysts are encouraging early positioning before the remaining stages close. When projecting returns, the framework is equally compelling. At today’s price, reaching $0.14 by 2026 would deliver a 300% return on entry. For context, an investment of $3,500 at this presale rate secures 100,000 MUTM tokens, translating into $14,000 at the targeted exchange valuation. Unlike BNB, which required years to scale and now delivers slower multiples due to its size, MUTM benefits from its smaller starting point and expanding roadmap. That roadmap includes a testnet demo launch, full exchange listings, multi-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships, all of which are designed to strengthen adoption. Unlike passively holding a crypto ETF, investing in crypto through a token like MUTM means exposure to both the growth of decentralized lending activity and the revenue cycle that redistributes value to its participants. Security and community trust also anchor the project’s credibility. A CertiK audit has already reviewed its framework, supported by a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards ethical disclosures up to $2,000 for critical findings. Alongside this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway that further builds engagement across its growing community of more than 12,000 Twitter followers. These safeguards and initiatives show a clear commitment to transparency and long-term viability. For investors who missed earlier waves in projects like BNB, the story of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a rare opportunity to start from the ground floor. With a presale price of just $0.035, a clear utility framework, and strong safeguards in place, it represents a project aligned with where the next cycle of investing in crypto is heading. By 2026, the expectation of 300% returns does not appear speculative but firmly rooted in the way the ecosystem has been structured.
