Each cycle decreases supply, enhances scarcity, and very often will cause massive rallies. Analysts now project a possible rally of BTC to $250K in the next bull run. At the same time, liquidations are shaking out weak positions. Over $176.9 million in short positions were liquidated in the past day, boosting bullishness. As confidence builds back up, investors are starting to rotate to promising altcoins. Among the most-discussed are Hyperliquid and MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin Halving and Market Outlook The halving reduces the flow of new coins every 210,000 blocks. This event is foundational to Bitcoin’s model of scarcity and value proposition. Historically, halvings caused large price increases, with the cycles getting larger than the previous one. Importantly, the impact does not end with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin gains, altcoins tend to follow, but with greater percentage increases. Consequently, capital normally turns into innovative tokens with higher upside potential. This rotation opens the door for platforms such as Hyperliquid and emerging projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. $176.9M Short Liquidations: Market Confidence Returns In the past 24 hours, crypto liquidations hit $370.62 million. Shorts made up $176.93 million of that total. Longs were slightly higher at $196.16 million, showing volatility cuts both ways. Notably, the single largest liquidation happened on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, worth $2.65 million. These liquidations reveal how quickly sentiment shifts when prices move sharply. Yet, they also reinforce bullish momentum by removing leveraged sellers. Investors now see liquidations as signals of strength rather than weakness. Capital is shifting toward altcoins where growth potential is higher. Hyperliquid and Magacoin Finance are clear beneficiaries of this shift. Hyperliquid’s Breakout and Stablecoin Ambitions Hyperliquid has quickly established itself as a force in decentralized trading. Its native token, HYPE, surged past $55, setting a new all-time high. That represents over 1,200% growth from late 2024 lows. The rally was fueled by proposals around USDH, Hyperliquid’s upcoming stablecoin. Governance activity has intensified, with multiple players submitting proposals. Paxos suggested using reserve interest for HYPE buybacks, backed by Treasury bills and stable reserves. Frax Finance proposed minting USDH against a basket of stable assets, with revenue directed to staking or buybacks. Institutional support is also emerging. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck publicly endorsed Hyperliquid, confirming investment and long-term interest. His comments boosted confidence in Hyperliquid’s vision and strengthened its reputation. The combination of governance growth, stablecoin development, and institutional recognition positions Hyperliquid strongly. If altseason follows the halving, Hyperliquid could attract massive liquidity and adoption. Magacoin Finance: A Hidden Gem in Rotation MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly joining discussions about the best altcoins before the halving . Investors are searching for assets with upside potential beyond majors, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that category. Unlike larger-cap tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still selling at a low entry price many consider undervalued. Its limited supply and growing community create a scarcity-driven environment. Whale accumulation has increased steadily, a sign of strong confidence. As shorts get liquidated and capital rotates, traders are eyeing altcoins with breakout potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum, combined with its fundamentals, makes it a hidden gem in this environment. With scarcity, transparency, and community backing, it is attracting fresh attention as the halving nears. Why Altcoins Could Outperform Post-Halving Altcoin seasons usually follow Bitcoin rallies. As Bitcoin dominates headlines, investors eventually diversify into riskier assets for higher gains. Historically, this rotation led to massive runs in Ethereum, Solana, and other layer-1s. This cycle could follow the same pattern. Hyperliquid offers exposure to DeFi innovation and stablecoin growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides scarcity-driven value and growing adoption. Together, they represent two different but complementary opportunities for investors. As Bitcoin pushes toward a possible $250K target, altcoins could multiply at even faster rates. Investors preparing early have the best chance to capture these moves. Conclusion The upcoming Bitcoin halving is more than a supply event. It is a catalyst for the entire crypto market. With $176.9M shorts liquidated and confidence returning, the stage is set for growth. Hyperliquid’s governance and stablecoin progress show its potential as a DeFi leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by scarcity and accumulation, is emerging as a hidden gem. As the market looks beyond Bitcoin, these two altcoins stand out. Positioned before the halving, they could be the keys to outsized returns in the next cycle.

The plans are direct: Expand $USDe adoption across centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms Launch Ethena on BNB Chain Develop new products USDtb and Converge Strengthen growth with TVL now above $13B, according to DeFiLlama https://t.co/AfzsqtAPwb — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) September 19, 2025 $USDe: The Synthetic Dollar Taking DeFi by Storm Ethena’s $USDe is designed to be a synthetic dollar, independent from traditional banking rails. Unlike centralized stablecoins, it generates yields through delta-neutral strategies, combining spot and futures positions to hedge volatility while still delivering returns. That design makes $USDe attractive for both retail and institutional DeFi users. It’s not just a dollar substitute, it’s a yield-bearing asset integrated across lending, liquidity pools, and trading protocols. On CoinMarketCap, $USDe currently holds a market cap above $3.2B, climbing rapidly in 2025 as adoption spreads. TVL Growth Signals Strong Market Demand Ethena’s total value locked (TVL) has crossed $13B, a sharp rise from $6B earlier this year. This surge highlights just how quickly USDe and its ecosystem are becoming embedded into the DeFi landscape. For perspective, Ethena now ranks among the top 5 DeFi protocols by TVL, rivaling established players like Aave and MakerDAO. This rapid scaling also reinforces why YZi Labs sees Ethena as a key driver in the shift toward decentralized stable assets. YZi Labs doubles down on $ENA USDe is now the 3rd largest $USD asset in crypto with $13B+ supply & TVL, the fastest ever to $10B. Backed since incubation, YZi is fueling Ethena’s next phase: • USDe adoption across CEXs + DeFi • Expansion on BNB Chain • New… pic.twitter.com/8Pn5VsEhA4 — CryptoED (@Crypto_ED7) September 19, 2025 Strategic Expansion Into BNB Chain One of the most significant steps in YZi Labs’ roadmap is extending Ethena’s deployment to BNB Chain. BNB Chain brings access to a massive retail user base, with daily active wallets consistently ranking among the top across blockchains. Integrating USDe here positions Ethena to tap into liquidity, DeFi yield markets, and cross-chain opportunities within the Binance ecosystem. This also connects back to the origins of YZi Labs, founded by Binance co-founders CZ and Yi He, showing how their support is evolving from exchange-native products into broader Web3 infrastructure. New Products: USDtb and Converge Beyond scaling USDe, Ethena Labs is preparing to roll out two new products: USDtb → A new stable asset designed to complement USDe, with enhanced liquidity and interoperability across DeFi and CEXs. Converge → A protocol aimed at bridging centralized and decentralized finance, expanding yield opportunities and cross-market integrations. Together, these additions strengthen Ethena’s role as more than just a stablecoin issuer, it becomes a full-stack synthetic dollar ecosystem. ENA Token Gains From Ecosystem Growth The ENA token, Ethena’s governance and rewards asset, has already benefited from ecosystem expansion. Earlier this year, ENA spiked in value after Ethena’s TVL crossed $6B. With TVL now over $13B, investors are watching closely for another wave of upside momentum. On CoinMarketCap, ENA is trading at $0.68 with a $900M market cap, cementing its place among top DeFi governance tokens. As USDe adoption spreads across CEXs, DeFi, and BNB Chain, ENA stands to capture further value through governance rights, staking incentives, and fee participation. Institutional Backing Adds Credibility Institutional capital continues to flow into DeFi, but YZi Labs’ renewed investment carries unique weight. As the family office of CZ and Yi He, YZi Labs isn’t just a random fund. Its roots trace back to Binance Labs, historically one of the most influential venture arms in Web3. By expanding its stake in Ethena Labs, YZi Labs is signaling confidence in synthetic dollar protocols as the future of stable assets. For Ethena, this credibility boost could draw in more liquidity providers, institutional partners, and retail trust. Regulatory and Market Risks Still, stablecoins remain one of the most heavily scrutinized sectors in crypto. Regulators across the US, Europe, and Asia continue to assess how to classify synthetic dollar assets. At the same time, market volatility and yield compression pose risks to sustainability. Ethena’s delta-neutral design reduces exposure, but ongoing improvements in risk management and transparency will be critical for long-term adoption. Digital Dollars in Web3 YZi Labs’ investment is part of a larger trend: institutional capital moving toward mature, revenue-generating DeFi protocols. The growth of USDe shows that users are demanding dollar-denominated stability that isn’t tied to banks, especially in an era where centralized stablecoins face increased regulatory pressure. If successful, Ethena Labs’ model could set a blueprint for how synthetic dollars power the internet economy, from payments to trading to savings. With TVL at $13B, a growing user base, and new products on the horizon, Ethena Labs is cementing itself as a major player in the stablecoin sector. YZi Labs’ deeper stake sends a strong signal: USDe isn’t just another DeFi experiment. It’s a core building block for digital dollars, positioned to expand across CEXs, DeFi, and into BNB Chain. For ENA holders, USDe users, and the wider ecosystem, the message is clear, the future of stablecoins is becoming increasingly synthetic, decentralized, and yield-bearing.

51990326,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425804,1758321000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990326.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin and Pi Coin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-dogecoin-and-pi-coin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s homegrown ChatGPT alternative, DeepSeek AI, predict that XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network could post substantial gains for investors before the year’s end. The broader crypto market seems to be laying the groundwork for such a move. Just last month, Bitcoin reached a fresh record high of $124,128, beating the prior peak of $122,838 set only a month earlier. However, enthusiasm faded after July’s hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation numbers led to a temporary pullback. Regulators are also accelerating their efforts. In July, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive federal law governing stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC announced Project Crypto, an initiative aimed at updating securities laws and providing clearer rules for digital asset companies. With new rules rolling out and market confidence returning, analysts believe the upcoming wave in altcoins and meme tokens could surpass the 2021 bull run. If DeepSeek’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network could be the leading beneficiaries. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Sees a Potential 230% Rally Toward $5 According to DeepSeek, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could advance to $10 by late 2025, marking a significant 230% jump from its current level near $3.03. XRP has already shown resilience this cycle. On July 18, it hit $3.65, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40, before easing roughly 17% due to risk-on sentiment from various macroeconomic pressures. Ripple’s global payments network continues to expand. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a cost-effective solution for remittances in developing nations. The end of Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC in early 2025 removed one of the biggest uncertainties surrounding the project. The SEC dropped its lawsuit after a 2023 ruling confirmed that retail XRP sales do not qualify as securities. If XRP can reclaim and sustain its July highs, DeepSeek AI expects $5-10 to be within reach, though other market experts have floated far more ambitious targets of $10–$20. On the technical side, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) has pulled back from 59 yesterday to 53, signalling a brief flurry of buying in yesterday day trading before an overnight dip. Despite the Fed’s rate cuts and the rollout of the first spot XRP ETF , markets are cautious, potentially waiting for the SEC verdict on a raft of ETF applications due middle of next month, along with the rollout of comprehensive US crypto legislation. Over the last twelve months, XRP has skyrocketed 420%, much quicker growth than Bitcoin’s 87.5% and Ethereum’s 86% appreciation over the same period. Dogecoin ($DOGE): DeepSeek Predicts a Push Past $1 for the Original Meme Token First launched in 2013 as a parody cryptocurrency, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since evolved into a top-10 digital asset, with a market capitalization of about $41.3 billion within the $88.2 billion meme coin sector. Its staying power comes from its dedicated community and growing role as a payments option. DOGE often tracks Bitcoin’s moves, but thanks to its strong liquidity and fan base, it has managed to weather several market downturns. Now trading near $0.2738, Dogecoin has more than doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. In the last two weeks alone, DOGE gained 27%, briefly pushing its RSI up to 75 before cooling back to 62 amid profit-taking and market dips. Chart watchers highlight recurring bullish falling wedge patterns from November through April, and again in July and August, hinting at potentially explosive further upside. DeepSeek’s conservative projection places DOGE at $1 to $2 by December. The upper range would spell a staggering 630% increase for current holders. Additionally, it would mean the “Doge Army” could finally reach its dream target of $1 per coin, a major psychological milestone given Doge’s ATH during the 2021 bull run was $0.7316. DeepSeek suggests a strong bull market could finally make that goal a reality. Adoption is also growing steadily: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin transfers. Pi Network ($PI): DeepSeek AI Tips Tap-to-Mine Coin for Explosive Growth Pi Network ($PI) has drawn attention for its mobile-based “tap-to-mine” model, where users earn tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily. Currently priced at about $0.3577, DeepSeek predicts an extremely bullish scenario of up to $10 per coin by year’s end, a meteoric 28× gain in a matter of months. While such a surge seems improbable given today’s market conditions, the project’s roadmap and technicals signal some small space for hope. Since its launch in February 2025, PI has been highly volatile, including a 171% spike in May. Its current RSI of 49 suggests a fairly valued token with potential for further upward moves. The development team continues to roll out incremental updates, with version 23 and a possible mainnet launch expected soon, which could inject new momentum into the project. Realistically, analysts argue that a retest of February’s $2.99 high would be a strong outcome. Even if the extreme bullish case doesn’t materialize, October is traditionally a bullish month for crypto and we could see the price climb up to its previous resistance level, around $1.25. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Alternative For those seeking speculative opportunities outside DeepSeek’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) positions itself as a risk-heavy alternative to Dogecoin, marketing itself as the degen cousin of crypto’s original original meme coin. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream crypto asset, Maxi Doge is embracing volatility and community-driven culture. The presale has already brought in over $2.3 million within its first month. Built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, MAXI is focused on viral growth via Telegram and Discord engagement, trading competitions, and cross-project partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion tokens, about 25% are reserved for the Maxi Fund to drive marketing and collaborations. Staking is live, with current yields of 141% APY, though these returns are expected to fall as more users participate. The presale price is $0.000258, with the next price increase set in just under 36 hourws. Investors can purchase through the official Maxi Doge site, using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet .

51990298,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425767,1758321000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990298.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy 19 September – XRP, Shiba Inu, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-19-september-xrp-shiba-inu-pepe/,"With the vast number of choices available, deciding which crypto is the best to buy right now is far from straightforward. Lingering concerns around inflation, US policy, and global tensions have kept market growth in check, although Bitcoin managed to hit a new all-time high of $124,128 just last month. Beyond Bitcoin, investor interest remains strong in both leading altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the last year, many tokens have hit new price benchmarks, signaling growing enthusiasm across the crypto sector. This renewed confidence has largely been driven by two pivotal policy changes in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive U.S. regulation focused on stablecoins. Second, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize and clarify securities laws as they apply to digital assets. With sentiment gradually turning positive, it’s worth taking a closer look at how major altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are setting up for potential gains. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Titan is Best Blue Chip Crypto for 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) surged to an all-time high of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40. Since then, XRP has cooled to around $3.03, about 17% below that peak. The token’s main strength lies in its ability to facilitate fast and low-cost international payments, offering a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its standing has been reinforced by endorsements from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even recognition from the White House. Ripple’s influence in policymaking was underscored earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse was invited to a high-profile presidential roundtable on cryptocurrency regulation. XRP’s momentum also received a significant boost in 2023 after a U.S. court ruled that its retail sales did not qualify as securities, effectively closing a five year conflict with the SEC while achieving a pivotal victory for the wider industry. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 418%, compared to Bitcoin’s 88% gain. Following its July rally, the token has managed to hold steady near the $3 mark, despite broader market volatility. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 53 after briefly hitting 59 yesterday. This reflects a brief sharp spike followed by a cooldown. The brief spike may have been the result of the Fed’s interest rate cuts this week and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF, but those headlines have not catalyzed a major XRP gold rush yet. Looking ahead, the SEC is set to decide on a raft of additional spot XRP ETFs in mid-October. That could propel the token above $4 within weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Meme Coin Giant With Expanding Real-World Use Cases Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the second-largest meme coin, commanding a market cap of nearly $7.8 billion. In the past 24 hours, SHIB’s price has dipped 2%, although it retained value better than the collective meme coin sector, which dropped 3%. Given that the wider $4.11 trillion crypto market also dipped 0.4% overnight, SHIB’s resilience, utility, and multibillion dollar market cap means it often has less volatility than a typical meme coin and behaves more like a blue chip crypto. It currently trades around $0.00001321. Technical charts point to further potential upside. Over the past year, SHIB has formed two bullish patterns: a descending wedge from November through March and a flag pattern since mid-May. Breaking through the key resistance at $0.000022 could trigger a run toward $0.00003 by late October. In a broader bull run, analysts see possible targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by the end of the year. Unlike most meme tokens, SHIB has real-world utility, including enhanced privacy tools and Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 network that lowers fees and accelerates transactions. Pepe ($PEPE): Internet Meme Sensation Positioned for Breakout Introduced in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) rapidly climbed into the ranks of top meme coins by market cap, fueled by the popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic frog character. Its meteoric rise inspired numerous copycats, though none have replicated its success. With a market valuation above $4.6 billion, and even a brief feature as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X, PEPE has firmly secured its place as a meme coin heavyweight. Currently priced near $0.00001106, PEPE has grown 15% in the past fortnight, though it still sits 60.5% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 in late 2024. Chart analysts note the development of a falling wedge pattern, a setup often preceding a breakout. With its RSI around 53, PEPE remains in a neutral trading zone, suggesting balanced buy and sell pressure with room for upward movement. The meme coin sector as a whole dipped 3% overnight to a collective market cap of $88.9 billion. While PEPE dipped in line with it, it has gained 4% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Supporters believe favorable macro conditions and rising investor optimism could drive PEPE to fresh highs as the summer unfolds. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2 Makes for One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the most talked-about presales of 2025, aiming to launch the first Bitcoin Layer 2 network that blends viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. Its mission is to enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster transactions, smart contracts, and community-driven decision-making. The presale has already raised around $16.9 million, with analysts projecting potential 10× or higher gains post-launch. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers lightning-fast smart contracts while keeping transaction costs low. One of its standout innovations is the Canonical Bridge, which allows near-instant BTC transfers on its Layer 2 while powering dApps, meme tokens, and payments with minimal fees. A recent Coinsult audit found no security vulnerabilities, adding confidence among investors. The $HYPER token will support multiple roles, including staking, transaction processing, and governance. Early presale participants can earn staking rewards of up to 68% APY while also gaining voting rights on upgrades after the platform’s launch.

Everyday Benefits for Users Trust Wallet framed the update as a way of making every action count. Here’s what that means for users: Lower fees on swaps & buys Gas discounts when paying with TWT Loyalty rewards via Trust Alpha (Launchpool 2.0) Premium support & faster service Voting rights in governance decisions Every swap, buy, and transaction inside Trust Wallet now carries a clear benefit layer powered by TWT. Roadmap: From 2025 Into 2026 The litepaper also lays out a timeline of future rollouts: Q4 2025 → Everyday crypto finance, faster buys, simpler transfers 2026 → Deeper trading, earning, and ecosystem integrations At each stage, TWT is the growth fuel, embedded into every new feature. Market Outlook: More Than a Meme Pump The sharp 60% pump was sparked by CZ’s spotlight, but the fundamentals suggest TWT may be at the start of a structural re-rating. Utility expansion is clear. User base scale is unmatched in the wallet space. Tokenomics reset provides long-term sustainability. With a direct tie between user actions and token value, TWT shifts from being a passive governance coin into an active driver of the Trust Wallet ecosystem. Trust Wallet just reintroduced TWT to the market, this time with clear use cases and ecosystem-wide integration. The timing couldn’t be sharper: the token broke out of a six-month downtrend with CZ’s backing and a roadmap that stretches well into 2026. For users, it means cheaper fees, real rewards, and influence. For TWT, it could mean the start of a new growth cycle. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

51990504,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425803,1758321480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990504.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 19 September – XRP, Solana, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-19-september-xrp-solana-cardano/,"The crypto price prediction for top altcoins like XRP , Solana , and Cardano is turning bullish again, following a short cooldown after the Fed’s 0.25% rate cut . While the total market cap dipped 1% over the past 24 hours and traders locked in profits from this week’s rally, this looks more like a setup for the next leg higher. Bitcoin and Ethereum only dropped 0.5% and 1%, respectively, which are minor moves that suggest consolidation rather than a reversal. With market conditions still favorable and most tokens bouncing from oversold levels, the stage is set for weekend breakouts. XRP, SOL, and ADA are now on many traders’ watchlists, with fresh capital likely to rotate into these names in the coming days. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Set to Surge Amid Ripple Growth and ETF Approvals XRP is trading at $3.01 today after consolidating around this level for several sessions. Even with today’s flat performance, XRP remains up 6.5% in the past 14 days and 420% higher than one year ago — signaling a strong macro uptrend. More importantly, technical indicators suggest that a massive breakout may be brewing . As shown in the chart, XRP is coiling beneath the critical resistance at $3.65 — the same zone that capped gains during August. If bulls manage to reclaim this level and flip it into support, analysts expect a quick surge toward $5 , with $10 as the year-end target if momentum continues. Both the RSI (42.44) and MACD show signs of neutral-to-bullish strength, leaving room for acceleration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s continued expansion across real-world finance, including new partnerships with BBVA and Franklin Templeton , is setting a strong fundamental backdrop. And with the first XRP ETF already approved and more ETF applications pending, institutional demand could explode in Q4. If approvals land and momentum holds, this XRP price prediction remains valid: $5 by October, $10 by December . Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Institutional Demand Will Push Altcoin to New ATHs This Year At $242, Solana is down by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, yet it holds onto an 18% gain in a fortnight and a 33% increase in a month. These are very healthy percentages, and now may still be a good time to buy SOL, before it rallies later in the year. Its momentum has been growing because of the appearance of Solana treasury companies in recent weeks, including the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries , which has been buying over $1 billion in SOL. At the same time, Solana is also waiting on numerous ETF applications, and if the SEC does approve the corresponding funds, then the SOL price is likely to rise strongly. Source: TradingView Its indicators do suggest that the coin should correct a little in near term, and it may experience further losses over the weekend. That said, the medium- and long-term trajectory is clearly positive, and once the aforementioned ETF approvals do arrive, the SOL price could hit new heights. It may reach $ 350 in October, before climbing towards $500+ by the New Year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Network Growth and Grayscale ETF Can Push ADA to New Highs ADA is trading at $0.9045 , up 9% in two weeks and continuing its steady uptrend. While Cardano only has one ETF application on file, it’s from Grayscale, and Bloomberg analysts believe it is highly likely to be approved. The ADA price could therefore receive its own boost in the next few weeks, while it will also benefit from Cardano’s ongoing growth as a layer-one network. It now has a total value locked in of $383 million , making it the 19th-biggest platform in crypto. Its position is likely to increase over time, with the Cardano ecosystem witnessing significant development , and with important upgrades still on the horizon. On the technical side, MACD and RSI both suggest renewed bullish momentum , with the RSI at 55 and climbing, leaving room for significant upside. The chart shows a clean breakout above the descending wedge and a strong support trendline forming. A reclaim of the $1.32 high could trigger a move to $3 , with $5 and $10 the next targets if macro conditions align. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Token Raises $1.3 Million in Presale: Next 100x Coin? As strong as the coins above seem right now, the approach bull rally will also see other tokens perform well, including newer coins. In fact, some of the newest coins may outperform the market average by considerable margins, with presale tokens in particular having the potential to do well. One such token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new Ethereum-based coin that has taken an original approach to staking. All in a hard days work. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/MNflyozHp2 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 18, 2025 It has now raised $1.3 million in its sale, which will run for the next few weeks, before PEPENODE launches and lists on exchanges. PEPENODE’s unique draw is that it’s the market’s first mine-to-earn token, one which offers holders the chance to build virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, holders can boost their staking yields. This dynamic is likely to incentivize greater accumulation of PEPENODE, which in turn should push its price up over time. And when combined with viral Pepe memes, PEPENODE has the ingredients needed to take the market by storm once it lists. Invests can buy it now at the PEPENODE website , where the coin is currently selling for $0.001066. This price will rise repeatedly until the sale ends, so newcomers should move quickly.

SOL Strategies Inc. has secured approval to join the Nasdaq Global Select Market , where it will begin trading on September 9, 2025 under the ticker STKE. By moving onto Nasdaq, the firm expects to tap a broader base of investors, especially institutions seeking direct exposure to companies tied to Solana. The added liquidity is also seen as a major benefit for existing shareholders. Shares will automatically convert from the OTCQB Venture Market, where the company previously traded as CYFRF, while its listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange (HODL) will remain intact. For Solana investors, the move represents a meaningful bridge between blockchain innovation and U.S. capital markets, an alignment that could unlock the next wave of growth. And while Solana builds credibility through institutional channels, cultural tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly gaining momentum on the retail side. CEO on a Year-Long Push Chief executive Leah Wald described the Nasdaq approval as a validation of more than a year’s worth of preparation and persistence. In a social media post, she framed the milestone as proof that both the company and Solana’s ecosystem are gaining recognition among the world’s most prominent technology players. She added that the listing provides the foundation to scale validator growth and strengthen access to U.S. capital markets. One of the company’s top priorities is expanding validator partnerships and staking operations, which are essential for Solana’s performance and security. Analysts note the timing is deliberate. The debut coincides with Solana’s recent Alpenglow upgrade , designed to accelerate throughput and efficiency on the network. With Nasdaq capital behind it, SOL Strategies hopes to play a larger role in ensuring validator infrastructure keeps pace with rising demand. Why Nasdaq Matters for Solana Wall Street’s embrace of a Solana-linked firm is more than a symbolic win. It signals the mainstreaming of Solana’s ecosystem , with new opportunities for institutional money to flow into blockchain-backed businesses. Nasdaq listings carry a reputation for higher regulatory oversight, liquidity, and visibility, all of which can attract funds that were previously cautious about entering the crypto sector. For Solana, this represents a new form of legitimacy. Beyond its technical milestones, it now has a corporate vehicle in one of the world’s most influential financial arenas. As institutional capital hunts for exposure to scalable blockchain platforms, Solana’s Nasdaq presence could ignite fresh momentum in both price action and long-term adoption. While Solana makes inroads on Wall Street, a very different story is unfolding in the presale arena. MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the spotlight with 7,000% growth predictions, making it a standout even among top-tier presales. As institutions pile into Solana, retail traders are rushing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting that smaller caps will deliver the truly life-changing multiples. Unlike countless presales that fade after a brief hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been defined by scarcity-driven demand . Each round has sold out faster than the last, creating a sense of urgency across both whale investors and retail participants. What sets it apart is not just marketing, but an ability to turn cultural branding into measurable momentum. For many observers, the fact that MAGACOIN FINANCE is even being discussed alongside established giants underscores how powerful its narrative has become. Where Solana represents institutional validation, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents speculative ambition—an early-stage opportunity with exponential upside potential. Parallel Stories: Institutions vs. Retail The contrast between Solana’s Nasdaq listing and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale surge highlights the two sides of today’s crypto market. On one hand, institutional adoption is strengthening, with regulatory frameworks, ETFs, and stock listings guiding billions in capital toward large-scale infrastructure plays. On the other, retail investors are chasing asymmetric returns in presales, where small allocations can snowball into transformative gains. Neither path is inherently better, they simply appeal to different strategies. Institutional plays like Solana promise long-term growth and relative stability. Cultural tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE thrive on timing, scarcity, and community energy, delivering risk but also the chance for extraordinary upside. Together, they illustrate why crypto remains one of the most diverse, and unpredictable, asset classes. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out 7,000% ROI forecasts: Analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could rival some of crypto’s most explosive breakouts. Scarcity model: Rapid sellouts across presale rounds amplify urgency and buyer confidence. Retail magnet: Smaller investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as their chance to capture DOGE- or PEPE-style multiples. Cultural branding: Positioning that resonates beyond crypto-native circles ensures broader traction. These elements make MAGACOIN FINANCE more than just another speculative token—it’s becoming a case study in how early momentum and cultural resonance can combine to drive rapid growth. Conclusion Solana’s Nasdaq debut marks a pivotal moment, bringing Wall Street capital and institutional visibility to one of crypto’s fastest networks. It validates years of progress and strengthens the case for Solana as a top-tier ecosystem. Yet, as institutions prepare to stake their claims in SOL infrastructure, retail traders are embracing a very different opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 7,000% growth predictions and scarcity-fueled momentum , is proving to be the cultural wildcard of 2025. For investors, the smartest play may not be choosing one over the other, but recognizing how institutional milestones and presale surges together shape the next bull market.

The latest acquisition brings Bitmine’s holdings to roughly 1.95 million ETH, valued at $8.66 billion, according to Arkham data. Blockchain transaction records show a series of large transfers carried out between Galaxy Digital and Bitmine in recent hours. TOM LEE IS BUYING EVEN MORE $ETH Tom Lee’s Bitmine just bought another $69M of ETH from Galaxy Digital. They now hold $8.66 BILLION of ETH. $BMNR is bullish on $ETH . pic.twitter.com/t9BWh9btPR — Arkham (@arkham) September 19, 2025 The settlements included 3,247 ETH ($14.55 million), 3,258 ETH ($14.6 million), 4,494 ETH ($20.06 million), and 4,428 ETH ($19.77 million), totaling 15,427 ETH, about $69 million, in under an hour. The structured timing suggests coordinated OTC settlements, which allow institutional buyers to accumulate large amounts without disrupting open market prices. Bitmine Crosses 2M ETH, Controls Nearly 2% of Ethereum’s Supply The purchase underlines Bitmine’s aggressive accumulation strategy. Data shows that Ethereum accounts for nearly the entirety of its $8.65 billion portfolio, positioning the firm as the largest corporate ETH treasury holder. Other tokens in its portfolio are negligible by comparison, including minor holdings of MakerDAO’s MKR and a handful of experimental tokens with only a few thousand dollars in value. Bitmine’s latest purchase follows a series of substantial buys over recent weeks. On September 11, the company received 46,255 ETH worth $201 million from a BitGo wallet across three addresses. A week earlier, on September 4, Bitmine acquired 80,325 ETH valued at $358 million from Galaxy Digital and FalconX. These acquisitions have lifted its total stash well above 2 million ETH in circulation, equivalent to about 1.8% of Ethereum’s entire supply. According to treasury reserve data, corporate and institutional entities now collectively hold about 4.99 million ETH worth $22.2 billion, representing 4.13% of the token’s circulating supply. Bitmine leads this group with 2.15 million ETH, valued at $9.59 billion at peak pricing, followed by SharpLink Gaming with 838,000 ETH ($3.74 billion) and The Ether Machine with 495,000 ETH ($2.2 billion). Source: SER The Ethereum Foundation, by comparison, holds about 225,000 ETH, while Coinbase’s treasury sits at 136,800 ETH. The scale of Bitmine’s holdings has drawn comparisons to Strategy’s long-standing bitcoin strategy under Michael Saylor, where large corporate accumulation became a cornerstone narrative for BTC’s institutional adoption. Bitmine appears to be positioning itself as Ethereum’s equivalent, building a multi-billion-dollar ETH balance sheet as a long-term treasury reserve. Ethereum itself has been trading under pressure despite the accumulation. At the time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $4,465, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours and 4.2% over the week. Ethereum Treasury Firms Expand Holdings Amid SPAC Deals and Buybacks The competition among Ethereum treasuries is heating up as corporate strategies evolve under market pressure. On September 17, The Ether Machine, an Ethereum-focused treasury firm, filed a draft registration statement with the SEC to go public via a merger with Nasdaq-listed SPAC Dynamix Corporation. @TheEtherMachine has filed a draft registration statement with the SEC as it moves forward with plans to go public through a merger. #Ethereum #ETH https://t.co/vq7CHuD3Y7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 17, 2025 The deal, first announced in July, is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder approval. The company has built a sizable position of 495,362 ETH after adding 150,000 ETH in August . Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming announced the repurchase of 1 million shares at an average price of $16.67, part of its ongoing buyback program. Since late August, the firm has repurchased nearly 1.94 million shares , citing undervaluation as the driver. SharpLink reported a net asset value of $3.86 billion, or $18.55 per share, and confirmed it carries no outstanding debt. Analysts say Ethereum is emerging as the key beneficiary of the digital asset treasury (DAT) boom. In a report this week, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, argued that ETH-focused treasuries are better positioned than their Bitcoin and Solana counterparts. Standard Chartered said Ethereum has benefited more than Bitcoin or Solana from digital asset treasury buying, citing stronger staking yields. #Ethereum #Bitcoin #treasuries https://t.co/p5yNkvvW87 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana generate staking yield, which supports higher valuations and long-term sustainability. Since June, Ethereum treasuries have accumulated about 3.1% of the token’s circulating supply. With valuations for many DATs under pressure, consolidation is expected, but Ethereum-focused firms appear to be gaining ground.

A staggering 7,441 BTC, valued at approximately $860 million, moved from the popular exchange Coinbase to an entirely new, unknown wallet. This monumental transaction, reported by Whale Alert, immediately captured the attention of investors and market analysts alike. Such large movements often signal important shifts in the market, prompting questions about the motives behind the transfer and its potential impact on Bitcoin’s future. What Exactly Happened in This Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer? On a recent day, a significant amount of Bitcoin left the Coinbase exchange. Specifically, 7,441 BTC was transferred out. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer is notable not just for its size but also for its destination: an entirely new wallet with no known history. This means the funds are no longer on a centralized exchange, moving into a private holding. The Source: Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. The Amount: 7,441 BTC, equivalent to roughly $860 million at the time of the transfer. The Destination: An unknown, newly created wallet address. The Reporter: Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. These movements are crucial because they involve ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Their actions can often influence market sentiment and price dynamics. Why Do These Significant Bitcoin Whale Transfers Grab Attention? When a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer occurs, it naturally sparks curiosity and analysis. The primary reason is the potential market impact. A transfer of this magnitude can be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for Bitcoin’s price and stability. Investors closely monitor these movements for clues about future market direction. For example, if a whale moves BTC to an exchange, it might signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, moving BTC off an exchange to an unknown wallet often suggests long-term holding or an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, which could be seen as a bullish signal. Understanding the Implications of Such a Bitcoin Whale Transfer What does it mean when such a large sum of Bitcoin leaves a major exchange for an unknown destination? There are several possibilities, and understanding them helps in deciphering the potential impact of this Bitcoin whale transfer . Increased Security: Moving funds off an exchange to a private wallet, often referred to as ‘cold storage,’ is a common practice for enhanced security. This protects assets from potential exchange hacks or vulnerabilities. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might be intended for an OTC sale, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without affecting the open market price. This is common for institutional investors. Long-Term Holding: The whale might be consolidating holdings for long-term investment, indicating a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Institutional Accumulation: A large institution or fund could be accumulating Bitcoin quietly, moving it to secure custody. The lack of immediate clarity creates a sense of mystery, but the move itself is a powerful indicator of significant capital at play within the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Waters: What Should Investors Do? For individual investors, news of a Bitcoin whale transfer can be a source of anxiety or excitement. However, it is important to approach such events with a measured perspective. While these transfers can influence short-term market sentiment, they don’t always dictate long-term trends. Here are some actionable insights: Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Conduct Research: Understand the broader market context, not just isolated transactions. Look at overall market sentiment, regulatory news, and fundamental developments. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Short-term whale activity should not derail a well-thought-out strategy. Consider Diversification: A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden market shifts caused by large transactions. Ultimately, these events highlight the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market, underscoring the need for informed decision-making. The recent Bitcoin whale transfer of 7,441 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is a compelling reminder of the significant capital movements that characterize the crypto space. While the exact motives remain shrouded in mystery, such large transactions underscore the growing institutional interest and the ongoing quest for secure asset management. Whether this move signals a major sale, a strategic long-term hold, or an OTC deal, it undoubtedly reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a critical asset in the global financial landscape. As the crypto market continues to evolve, these whale movements will remain a key indicator for those looking to understand the underlying currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. The exact threshold varies, but it generally refers to holders of thousands of BTC. Why do Bitcoin whales move large amounts of BTC? Whales move large amounts of BTC for various reasons, including consolidating holdings, transferring to cold storage for security, facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) trades, rebalancing portfolios, or preparing for a large sale or purchase. Does this specific Bitcoin whale transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? While a single large transaction moving off an exchange usually suggests long-term holding or an OTC deal (which are generally not bearish), the sheer size can still trigger speculation and short-term volatility. The immediate impact is often on market sentiment rather than direct price action unless the funds are moved to an exchange for selling. How can I track Bitcoin whale transfers? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many crypto news outlets and analytics platforms also report on significant whale movements, providing insights into potential market implications. Is it safe for a whale to move such a large amount of Bitcoin? Yes, transferring Bitcoin to a secure, private wallet (cold storage) is often considered safer than keeping it on an exchange, as it reduces exposure to exchange-specific risks like hacks or regulatory freezes. However, the security of the funds then depends entirely on the whale’s private key management. We hope this deep dive into the recent Bitcoin whale transfer has provided valuable insights.

With Bitcoin trading at over $111,000 and Ethereum closer to $4,250, compared with that psychology, putting $100 to work may not seem like too much. However, smart allocation is not the possession of an entire coin; it is positioning early on in assets that have the potential to grow. Whether this be through exchange-traded funds based on the performance of bitcoin or investment into upcoming altcoins, even small amounts can add up to meaningful profits as well. The key lies in not being tempted by chasing after meme tokens and instead looking at things with proven or growing credibility. Alongside Bitcoin and its ETFs, newer players, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are proving that $100 can make a difference in the right hands. Bitcoin: The Foundation Allocation Despite volatility, Bitcoin has been the core of crypto investing. It makes up almost 60% of the total market value and is typically the first asset built up by institutions. Its track record is quite superior: for the last ten years, no other asset has equated its long-term growth. Buying $100 of Bitcoin directly on an exchange might only give you about 0.0009 BTC, but that’s a part of a proven store of value. More importantly, it gives you exposure to what many analysts think could reach $1m within five years. That kind of upside potential makes Bitcoin a logical place to start, regardless of the size of the investment. The Case for Bitcoin ETFs For those investors who are anxious about the idea of exchanges and wallets, Bitcoin ETFs have provided a simple, regulated way to gain market access. Products such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) trade under $100 a share. That means with just one bill, you can buy the exposure to the price performance of Bitcoin; you’re not concerned with private keys and custody. These ETFs track Bitcoin on a 1:1 basis, which means that once Bitcoin is up 100% in the course of a year, your ETF shares will be too. With expense ratios as low as 0.21%, they provide cost-effective and beginner-friendly access that’s easy to scale over time. Managing Allocation With Small Capital A $100 investment might seem insignificant in the scheme of a $10,000 portfolio, but it is a starting investment allocation of 1%. From there, you can scale up or down depending on how comfortable you are. Bitcoin ETFs make things particularly easy, as investors can refine their exposure as they increase their conviction. And while Bitcoin brings stability to the crypto space, there’s still importance in diversification. Smaller tokens and cultural projects provide the sort of upside that might not be present with Bitcoin on its own. That’s where early-stage opportunities enter the conversation. For those looking for asymmetric upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is really emerging as one of the more interesting new allocations. Contrary to speculation, meme coins that disappear after a hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum through scarcity, cultural branding, and community-driven growth. Its early presale rounds have been sold in a short period of time, showing demand far ahead of widespread exchange listings. Analysts cite forecasts of 44x , and this represents a rare opportunity where even a $100 entry turns into thousands if momentum stays on track. For investors who already hold Bitcoin or Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the type of high-risk, high-reward complement that completes a portfolio strategy. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Now Cultural identity: MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a token; it’s building a narrative that resonates far beyond crypto-native circles. Explosive upside: With projections of up to 44× gains, it represents one of the cycle’s strongest opportunities. Community momentum: Its swelling presence on Telegram and X shows conviction that can carry through multiple market phases. These qualities put MAGACOIN FINANCE in a unique position compared to other new tokens. It’s not a replacement for Bitcoin; it’s a speculative complement that could magnify returns for those nimble enough to catch it early. Building Smarter With $100 The smartest move with $100 in crypto isn’t to spread it thin across dozens of low-quality coins, but to create a balance of foundation and opportunity. Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF is the tried and tested anchor. MAGACOIN FINANCE, being one of the newer projects with explosive growth potential, offers the speculative edge. Taken together, they form a dual approach: stability plus upside. Even if you’re investing on a small scale, this approach lets you experience both the predictability and the thrill of crypto investing. Conclusion With prices soaring, $100 may not be a lot in crypto, but used wisely, it can still cause exposure of significance. Bitcoin, either directly or through ETFs, is still the focal asset. Yet, investors seeking tremendous potential are increasingly looking to high-momentum powers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. With scarcity, cultural resonance, and forecasts of up to 44X gains , MAGACOIN FINANCE is the bold allocation that makes even a modest investment count. The wisest action in today’s context is to balance the old and new, to lay the foundation while keeping open the space for explosive growth.

This move would mark a pivotal shift for one of the world’s largest crypto asset managers, bringing billions of dollars worth of ETH into active network participation. In an X post, on-chain analyst CryptoGoos has brought to light a significant development in the institutional crypto space. Grayscale is reportedly preparing to stake its massive Ethereum holdings. Although not yet confirmed, such a move, which was flagged by on-chain data following a transfer of over 40,000 ETH, is a significant signal of Grayscale’s evolving strategy and a potential game-changer for the ETH market. Why The Grayscale Move Could Accelerate Mainstream Adoption According to the data, Grayscale’s alleged transfer of a large sum of ETH is consistent with preparatory steps for staking. The firm, which holds approximately 1.5 million ETH in its various trusts, is now positioning a portion of that vast holding to earn staking rewards. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock If this is indeed the case, it would be a historic moment. Grayscale would become the first US-based ETH ETF sponsor to offer staking in the market, a feature that has been a point of contention with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While reports suggest Grayscale is preparing to stake ETH, market analyst TheKingfisher has issued a significant warning based on the ETH GEX+ chart, which he states is flashing a strong negative signal. This analysis centers on a key options metric known as Gamma Exposure (GEX), an indicator that provides insight into how professional traders, or dealers, are positioned in the market. The dealers are short gamma at the current implied volatility (IV) of 61 and an index price of $4,593. This dynamic is where volatility is likely to be amplified. Instead of a market that moves slowly and predictably, the ETH GEX+ signal suggests that price swings could be sudden and extreme, catching most retail traders off guard with the speed of moves. However, smart money considers the development a rare opportunity to capitalize on aggressive dealer hedging. In the meantime, this environment demands tight risk management. The Gateway To Price Discovery Ethereum price is at a pivotal point, currently consolidating between the $4,000 support level and its previous all-time high. MilkRoadDaily has also revealed that the next crucial step for ETH is a weekly close above its all-time high, which would put the asset into a phase of price discovery, where history shows the biggest moves have happened. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For $10,000: Charts Flash Parabolic Rally Signals Drawing on this historical pattern, MilkRoadDaily suggests that in the previous market cycle, ETH cleared its old highs with a parabolic run, ripping an additional 240%. If this historical pattern were to repeat itself, a similar move from its current position could project a new price target of around $16,500.

51991086,585222,1758322851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51991086.jpeg,Michigan Advances Bill To Build Crypto Reserve – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/michigan-advances-bill-to-build-crypto-reserve-details/,"Michigan lawmakers moved a bill that would let the state hold crypto assets closer to a vote, advancing House Bill 4087 to a second reading in mid-September 2025. According to reports, the proposal would change the Michigan Management and Budget Act to create a strategic crypto reserve under the control of the state treasurer. Michigan Bill Allows Up To 10% Investment The measure would let the state treasurer place up to 10% of certain state funds into qualifying digital currencies. The funds named include the countercyclical budget and the economic stabilization fund. The bill does not list a single currency by name; rather it sets rules that a digital asset must meet to qualify. Those who back the bill say this gives the state a new tool to diversify holdings and hedge inflation risks. NEW: Michigan Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill has progressed for the first time since February. HB 4087 been placed on the House second reading calendar, and referred to the Committee on Govt. Operations. The bill would allow 10% of state funds to be invested. pic.twitter.com/vN7Irm7Fr3 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) September 18, 2025 Security And Custody Rules The text would impose strict custody and security standards before any purchase is made. Reports have disclosed requirements such as exclusive government control of private keys, the use of state-regulated or bank custodians, and the option to invest through registered investment companies or exchange-traded products. The bill also calls for technical safeguards: end-to-end encryption, no access via smartphones, geographically split secure data centers, multiparty sign-offs for transactions, and regular security audits. Supporters Point To Diversification Supporters argue the rules reduce the main risks. They say a careful, limited position could protect the state from dollar weakness while offering upside. Lawmakers who introduced the bill — Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson — first filed it in February 2025, and its movement after roughly seven months of little action surprised some observers. Proponents also note that a few other US states have considered or passed similar measures. Concerns From Critics And Trade Groups Not everyone is sold. The Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council has argued the bill fails to set a market-cap floor, which could allow the state to buy smaller, less liquid tokens that swing wildly in price. Critics worry that even with custody rules, crypto’s sharp ups and downs could leave public dollars exposed. Implementation questions remain too: who will manage key recovery, how audits will be handled, and how losses would be covered in a severe market drop. Political And Practical Risks Reports say the bill now sits with the Committee on Government Operations and could face close scrutiny in committee hearings. If passed, Michigan would join a small group of states that have moved to let public treasurers hold crypto.

With ADA currently priced at around $0.83 , traders are watching closely to see if renewed demand can fuel a breakout similar to its past rallies. Meanwhile, the broader market is eyeing Bitcoin and Ethereum as barometers of sentiment, but rotation flows suggest investors are also looking beyond the majors. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught attention not just for growth potential but also for the credibility that comes with its completed audits, setting it apart in a crowded field of presale tokens. ADA’s Road Toward $2 ADA’s recent uptick is being driven in part by large wallet holders increasing exposure. On-chain trackers show whale addresses accumulating steadily, a pattern that has often preceded bullish moves in previous cycles. If momentum continues, analysts argue that ADA could test $1.20–$1.50 in the near term, with $2 being the bigger psychological target for the community. Cardano’s ongoing development progress also underpins confidence. The network’s Hydra scaling solution is designed to expand throughput, while updates to its governance model make ADA one of the more actively evolving proof-of-stake blockchains. Combined with its strong developer ecosystem, Cardano remains a consistent long-term player. Still, the climb back to $2 will require more than whale accumulation. ADA must break resistance zones and attract new liquidity inflows, which could hinge on broader crypto market conditions. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to strengthen, ADA could benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Security Comes in First Place In contrast to established giants like Cardano, newer projects are under constant scrutiny to prove legitimacy. That’s where this emerging player has carved out an advantage – it has already undergone independent smart contract audits by respected firms before its full public launch. This is not a trivial step. Audits reduce risk of contract flaws, exploits, or rug-pull events, and they provide confidence for cautious investors. In a market where scams and vulnerabilities regularly wipe out millions, the assurance of a third-party check makes a real difference. Compared to ADA, which already enjoys credibility from years of operation, this newcomer demonstrates a proactive stance on transparency. And unlike many presales that delay security reviews until later, this project’s audits were completed early, giving investors a rare blend of growth potential and peace of mind. Market Rotation and Investor Flows Investor behavior often rotates between major caps like BTC and ETH, mid-cap altcoins like ADA, and riskier early-stage tokens. Right now, ADA’s whale accumulation highlights interest in assets with a mix of credibility and potential for price expansion. But presale opportunities are gaining traction too, as investors look to capture exponential returns not available in established coins. That’s why audited presales stand out. By reducing the risk factor, they offer exposure to upside while minimizing one of the biggest deterrents – trust. This has made MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly attractive in recent months, as traders diversify from ADA and other names. For many, the logic is simple: ADA may double, but a presale token with audits and traction could multiply far more if execution is strong. Risks on the Horizon For ADA, the main risks remain its slower development pace and stiff competition from faster, cheaper chains. While Cardano excels in community governance and stability, some traders argue that momentum-driven markets favor networks with more aggressive expansion. Regulatory scrutiny of staking tokens is another factor that could weigh on ADA’s growth in certain regions. For the new project, the risks center around delivery. Audits confirm security but cannot guarantee execution. Investors must watch roadmap milestones, community growth, and liquidity conditions after launch. Still, the presence of completed audits helps position it ahead of peers in terms of credibility. Conclusion Whales are fueling speculation that ADA could revisit $2 in the coming months, supported by development upgrades and a loyal community. But as capital rotates across the market, investors are also eyeing new opportunities. Projects that arrive with the reassurance of independent audits stand out, and that’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is being closely watched. In a cycle where trust and growth potential both matter, this balance could prove decisive in determining which names outperform.

Kraken Just Turned Up with Direct USD to XRP,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-set-for-20-run-kraken-just-turned-up-with-direct-usd-to-xrp/,"Chad Steingraber, a prominent figure in the crypto space, has drawn attention to an important market development involving XRP. In a recent post, he reported that Kraken had introduced direct USD-to-XRP trading and noted an inflow of $8.16 million, sharing graphics that illustrated the movement of funds across major exchanges. Steingraber, who frequently comments on digital asset activity, used the post to emphasize a notable increase in XRP trading volumes, which he believes could swiftly send XRP to $20 price level. Kraken just turned up with DIRECT USD to XRP!! $8.16Million just flooded in… https://t.co/gc9B8H6e0G pic.twitter.com/ZdR2U8oGQW — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) September 18, 2025 Chart Shows Heavy Inflows to Kraken The chart in Steingraber’s post displays a heatmap tracking XRP movement across exchanges. According to the data shown, Kraken recorded a net inflow of $8.16 million in XRP/USD trading, significantly larger than the figures from other exchanges on the chart. Binance followed with $2.02 million, while Coinbase, Bybit, and others saw smaller inflows. This visualization highlights the size of the inflows on Kraken compared with its competitors, and shows the high demand for XRP and Kraken’s direct trading pair. The figures are especially striking because they show direct USD-to-XRP movement on Kraken, an option that not all major exchanges support. By emphasizing the direct USD pair, Steingraber’s post drew attention to increasing liquidity and easier access for traders. Large net inflows on a single exchange can signal strong buying interest , especially when contrasted with lower activity elsewhere. Market Optimism and Price Expectations Alongside the inflow announcement, Steingraber previously expressed his outlook for XRP’s price. He wrote , “When XRP makes its first run to $20 soon, there’s gonna be a lot of hate and anger. Don’t worry, they’re just jealous.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This statement reflects confidence in XRP’s future performance and indicates his belief that the asset could reach a substantially higher price. While price predictions are speculative, Steingraber’s remark captures optimism among XRP supporters at a time of rising volumes. A Positive Signal for XRP Such high-volume inflows, particularly from a direct USD trading pair, can boost liquidity and trading depth. Increased liquidity generally benefits active traders and may reduce slippage on large orders. This environment can also help establish a more robust market for institutional participants who may prefer exchanges with higher liquidity and fiat currency options.

This bullish structure often signals an explosive breakout. Right now, SHIB is pressing against the upper boundary of this wedge. With market sentiment turning favorable and momentum building, a breakout appears imminent. Trading volumes have surged in recent days, consistently holding between $200 million and $300 million — a range that typically accompanies major trend reversals. Combined with this technical retest, SHIB looks poised to push above the $0.00001500 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained in a steady uptrend and currently sits above 50, reinforcing the case for continued strength. A breakout above $0.000017 would likely confirm a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction , unlocking upside targets of $0.000035 and even $0.0001. That would represent a 680% surge for the second-largest meme coin. But while SHIB prepares for liftoff, early investors are turning their attention to Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a high-potential presale that’s already raised $2 million and could leave legacy meme coins in the dust once it hits major exchanges. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): The Meme Coin Going All-In With 1000x Leverage Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that fully embraces the ‘up only’ attitude that typically comes with crypto bull markets. This dog-themed token is what happens when a Shiba Inu takes too many Red Bulls for breakfast and stares for too long at price charts. Through the Maxi Fund, the project will allocate up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds on the most promising tokens. The size of these positions will be boosted by using 1000X leverage to reap the highest returns as the market keeps pumping. To join the $MAXI presale early, simply head to the Maxi Doge official website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto or use a bank card to invest.

This pivotal move, confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, marks a major step for the digital asset custodian. BitGo, a crucial player in securing digital assets for institutions, confidentially submitted its initial public offering (IPO) documents back in July. This development follows a successful August 2023 funding round where the company raised $100 million, achieving a robust valuation of $1.75 billion. For many, this moment highlights the growing maturity of the crypto industry, potentially bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset landscape. What Does the BitGo IPO Mean for the Crypto Ecosystem? An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is when a private company first offers its shares to the public. For BitGo, a company deeply embedded in the digital asset space, pursuing an IPO carries immense significance beyond just raising capital. It’s about legitimizing the crypto industry further in the eyes of mainstream investors and regulators. This move introduces a new level of transparency and scrutiny to a sector often perceived as opaque. Increased Legitimacy: A successful BitGo IPO could enhance the credibility of digital assets by demonstrating that crypto companies can meet stringent public market requirements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Going public means adhering to strict SEC regulations, which can set a precedent for other crypto firms considering similar paths. Mainstream Adoption: Publicly traded crypto companies make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to the digital asset market without directly holding cryptocurrencies. The influx of capital from an IPO can also fuel BitGo’s expansion, allowing it to innovate further in secure digital asset custody and other services. Navigating the Path to a BitGo IPO: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of a BitGo IPO is exciting, the journey to becoming a publicly traded company is complex, especially in the crypto sector. The regulatory environment in the U.S. remains uncertain for digital assets, requiring BitGo to navigate carefully and ensure full compliance with all SEC requirements. This process can be demanding for any company. However, significant opportunities also lie ahead. BitGo’s established position as a leading digital asset custodian gives it a unique advantage. Institutions increasingly seek secure, regulated solutions for holding cryptocurrencies, and BitGo is well-positioned to meet this demand. The IPO could provide the necessary capital to scale its operations, enhance technology, and expand its global reach, solidifying its role as a trusted partner for institutional investors. BitGo’s Journey: From Funding Rounds to an Impending IPO BitGo’s path to this milestone has been marked by strategic growth and substantial investment. The company’s ability to raise $100 million in August 2023, securing a $1.75 billion valuation, underscores investor confidence in its business model and the growing need for robust digital asset infrastructure. This funding round demonstrated the market’s recognition of BitGo’s critical role in providing secure, compliant solutions for institutional clients. BitGo offers a comprehensive suite of services, including: Digital Asset Custody: Securely storing cryptocurrencies for institutions. Trading Solutions: Facilitating institutional-grade crypto trading. Prime Brokerage Services: Offering integrated solutions for large-scale crypto investors. These services are vital for attracting traditional financial players to the digital asset market. The impending BitGo IPO highlights the maturation of the crypto industry, moving beyond speculative trading to embrace fundamental infrastructure and regulatory compliance. In conclusion, BitGo’s submission of its IPO filing to the SEC is a truly landmark event for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a significant stride towards greater institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. As BitGo prepares to make its debut on the public markets, it paves the way for a more integrated and mature financial ecosystem where digital assets play an increasingly vital role. This is not just an IPO; it’s a testament to the enduring potential and evolving legitimacy of the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is BitGo?

With the XRP and Solana ETFs under consideration, the institutions and retail traders alike are preparing for a pivotal moment. The regulators will signal if approval is near or if the delay is still the dominant theme. The outcomes of this will shape the next phase of the momentum. XRP and Solana will join Bitcoin and Ethereum in providing institutional-grade access to all investors around the world if green lights are afforded. If delays continue, frustration may lead to selling of assets across the board in the market with a focus on altcoins. Right now, investors are glued to the regulatory calendar, knowing October can make or break the quarter. At the moment all eyes are on ETFs, but some are starting to bring up MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next altcoin to watch. Solana’s ETF Push and Market Confidence Solana has been recovering after suffering outages and resilience queries over a period of time. The Ethereum network has managed to reestablish itself among the top-performing Layer-1 networks thanks to its renewed stability and regional NFT and gaming ecosystems. A Solana ETF would bring a wave of mainstream adoption for a blockchain that is often praised for its speed and scalability. The institutions are on board, but there are concerning regulatory ambiguities. The issue is whether regulators can be talked into giving the green light for ETF approvals to anything other than Bitcoin and Ethereum so soon. Solana could have its own moment of XRP like surge in October that could either make or break adoption. Recent analysis suggests MAGACOIN FINANCE could skyrocket 45×. It’s being compared with Solana and XRP. The very fact they’re comparing it to institutional favorites is telling a strong narrative that we think this presale could do the impossible. MAGACOIN FINANCE didn’t just rely on hype like other presales but achieved growth thanks to scarcity and quick sellouts in multiple rounds. As allocations continue to be taken up in fast succession, the sense of urgency builds and the signal of real demand emerges. It has a strong brand and cultural positioning that appeals to a more mainstream audience beyond the crypto-native. It’s no longer a question of if MAGACOIN FINANCE will do well but rather how great of a force with continued momentum. Those investors watching on the sideline as the XRP and Solana ETFs attempt to begin trading have a different story to buy into: an early entry, a cultural energy, and the likelihood of exponential returns without worrying about regulatory approval. That story is MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s ETF Battle for Legitimacy Regulatory challenges have made XRP a loser in the battle for market position on more than one occasion. The hope of institutional validation has renewed thanks to the optimism surrounding an ETF. People think that the XRP ETF will bring large amounts of liquidity from the money that it will release. But uncertainty lingers. Recent filings suggest the SEC still cautious, and we won’t have clarity for some time. This puts October into clear view. If approval occurs, true demand will likely be triggered and prevent XRP from making progress. In contrast, if this continues to hesitate, we could see XRP remain stagnant beneath key resistance. Currently, traders view October as an important moment for XRP to prove its legitimacy on Wall Street. The October Trade-Off The crypto market will face tests in October when XRP and Solana ETFs get important decisions. If it is approved, institutional adoption could ramp up. If it is delayed, investors will be upset. In this situation, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a presale token that is being compared to the giants and is currently getting predicted for 45× growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE proves that, for those who don’t want to wait on the regulators’ press release, sometimes the biggest stories are under the radar. As October rolls around, investors must decide: wait for the ETF clock or ride the wave already building in presales. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Explosive projections: Forecasts suggest 45× ROI , putting it in the conversation with some of crypto’s biggest breakouts. Scarcity-driven demand: Every presale round has sold out faster than the last, highlighting urgency and strong appetite. Cultural resonance: MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention as more than just a token, it’s becoming a movement. Comparisons to giants: Being discussed alongside Solana and XRP underscores its growing legitimacy in analyst circles. These factors show why MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out in a crowded field. While XRP and Solana battle regulators for ETF approval, MAGACOIN is accelerating through momentum, branding, and investor conviction. Conclusion In October, important decisions on XRP and Solana ETFs will test the crypto market. If it is approved, institutional adoption could ramp up. If it is delayed, investors will be upset. In this case, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a presale token compared to giants and is now predicted to achieve 45× growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that sometimes the biggest story is the one that most people are ignoring, for those who don’t want to wait on the regulators. With October around the corner, investors will have to choose. Wait for the ETF launch or get on board presales.

As traders look for the best altcoin to buy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its safety-first approach and ongoing audits, making it a standout choice in a shifting market. Bitcoin whales offload billions in September Bitcoin whales have been on a selling spree throughout September, moving billions of dollars’ worth of BTC across exchanges. According to on-chain data, wallets that had been dormant for nearly a decade have suddenly begun transferring large amounts, creating waves across the market. One whale alone sold more than $4 billion worth of Bitcoin for Ethereum last month, and has since resumed selling as Bitcoin touched $116,000 for the first time in weeks. Lookonchain tracked the whale depositing 1,176 BTC (worth $136 million) into trading platforms, which kicked off fresh selling. This activity follows a massive 115,000 BTC sell-off worth $12.7 billion, the largest since mid-2022. Analysts note that these moves have pressured Bitcoin’s price structure in the short term, keeping it below the $116,000 line despite several retests. For traders, the takeaway is clear: whale movements often signal where capital is rotating next — and many are now eyeing altcoins. Ethereum swap highlights sentiment shift The same whale that sold 35,991 BTC for Ethereum earlier this month offers an important clue to market behavior. By rotating out of Bitcoin into ETH, the whale essentially signaled that “smart money” is searching for better opportunities outside BTC. Even though the ETH/BTC ratio remains flat near 0.0401, Ethereum has gained nearly 6% over the past month. This shows that whales are not just reducing exposure to Bitcoin but are also diversifying their holdings. The scale of these swaps matters because it highlights how capital rotation works in crypto cycles. When whales reduce Bitcoin exposure, attention often turns to the best altcoins to buy during a dip, giving smaller projects the chance to shine. Bitcoin price struggles near $116,000 Bitcoin has been flatlining around the $116,000 mark after hitting a local peak above $124,000 in mid-August. It has since dropped around 7%, moving in a tight band between $110,000 and $116,000. This stagnant action comes even as on-chain metrics suggest long-term stability. Analysts point out that despite whale dumping, institutional buyers and ETF inflows are providing balance. Still, traders should be cautious, as heavy whale activity can continue to weigh on price action in the near term. For smaller players, this range-bound movement is frustrating — but it also sets the stage for capital to flow into altcoins that carry strong narratives and trust factors. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on trader radars As Bitcoin whales trigger uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being noticed as one of the best altcoins to buy in this dip. Its focus on safety and security appeals to traders who want stability even in volatile times. Audited for safety — CertiK ongoing, HashEx completed Security-first design with anti-phishing protocols Active community presence driving adoption For traders watching capital rotate out of Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a safer and cheaper way to get exposure to an altcoin backed by transparent practices. Positioning in this market With whales selling billions in Bitcoin, altcoins are set to attract fresh attention. Traders should prepare by diversifying into projects that emphasize security and transparency, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Timing matters, and waiting too long could mean missing the early entry advantage. Visit MAGACOIN FINANCE today to explore before the next move.

51992786,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=178434,1758326350,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/51992786.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Could Rally 470% as MAGACOIN FINANCE and AVAX Join Analyst Favorites,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-price-prediction-ripple-could-rally-470-as-magacoin-finance-and-avax-join-analyst-favorites/,"XRP is once again stirring excitement, with some analysts suggesting the token could stage a 470% rally if momentum aligns. At around $3.05 , XRP has already attracted billions in whale accumulation and continues to benefit from its role in global payments. Avalanche (AVAX), trading near $37.20 , is also gaining recognition for its rapid throughput and growing ecosystem. But while both XRP and AVAX are respected names with bullish forecasts, many investors are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the project with the ability to outpace them both in raw upside. Why Analysts See a 470% Rally for XRP The optimism around XRP stems from whale accumulation and technical setups. With whales now holding over $2.1 billion worth of tokens, supply on exchanges is tightening. If XRP clears major resistance levels at $3.30–$3.50 , technical targets point toward $15–$16 in the longer term, equating to a potential 470% gain from current levels. Ripple’s progress in the payments sector also underpins this outlook. Partnerships with financial institutions and ongoing regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions are creating a stronger use case. However, XRP’s large market cap means that moves of this size require huge inflows, making rallies slower to materialize than in smaller-cap tokens. AVAX Gains Momentum Avalanche has built a strong reputation as one of the faster and more efficient Layer-1 blockchains. With AVAX priced around $37.20 , it continues to grow in DeFi, GameFi, and enterprise solutions. Its subnets model allows customized blockchains, which has attracted developers and institutions alike. Analysts believe that AVAX could climb toward $70–$100 in the next cycle if adoption accelerates. While that represents a significant gain, it still pales in comparison to what smaller-cap projects can deliver when they gain traction. Like XRP, Avalanche offers a strong foundation but less explosive upside due to its size. Where Bigger Gains Could Be Found This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Unlike XRP or AVAX, which need billions in liquidity to move multiples higher, MAGACOIN is at an early stage with room to grow dramatically. Analysts point to the possibility that MAGACOIN could outpace XRP’s projected 470% and AVAX’s 200% by delivering exponential gains as adoption spreads. The reasoning is simple: XRP and AVAX are established players with slower growth curves, while MAGACOIN has a smaller starting base and a presale community already demonstrating strong momentum. Early-stage entries historically provide the biggest returns, as seen with SHIB or DOGE in prior cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines that early entry point with a clear roadmap and transparent structure, reducing risks often seen in presale tokens. For investors, the choice is not necessarily between XRP, AVAX, and MAGACOIN—it’s about balance. But those chasing outsized multiples know that smaller-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN have the edge when it comes to raw upside potential. Comparing Risk and Reward Both XRP and AVAX remain solid long-term bets. XRP benefits from whale support and real-world adoption in payments, while AVAX has technical strengths and ecosystem growth. Their risks—regulatory hurdles for XRP and competitive pressure for AVAX—are notable but manageable. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s risk comes from being early-stage: execution, roadmap delivery, and market adoption are critical. But the reward side of the equation is significantly larger. While XRP may deliver a 4-5x and AVAX a 2-3x, MAGACOIN is positioned to potentially outpace them many times over if its launch trajectory follows through. Conclusion XRP’s potential 470% rally and AVAX’s growth to higher price targets keep them both strong choices in the current market. Yet, for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as the project with the potential to outpace both . In a market defined by risk and reward, XRP and AVAX offer relative stability, but MAGACOIN could be the one that turns small allocations into life-changing outcomes.

Recently, Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran delivered a significant statement, indicating his expectation for additional Fed rate cuts in the coming months. This news is a crucial development that could reshape market dynamics, influencing everything from lending rates to investment sentiment across various asset classes, including digital currencies. What Do Expected Fed Rate Cuts Mean for the Economy? Governor Miran’s remarks follow a previous move by the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points (bp). His current stance suggests a continued dovish approach, with plans to advocate for swift interest rate cuts among fellow policymakers. But what does this really signify? Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates typically make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can encourage spending and investment, thereby stimulating economic activity. Inflation Management: While rate hikes combat inflation, rate cuts can sometimes risk accelerating it. However, if the Fed believes inflation is under control or economic growth needs a boost, cuts become more appealing. Market Reaction: Financial markets often react positively to expected rate cuts, as they can lead to higher corporate profits and increased liquidity. Why is Miran Pushing for Further Interest Rate Cuts ? The Federal Reserve’s primary mandate involves maintaining maximum employment and stable prices. When economic indicators suggest a slowdown, or when inflation appears to be cooling, the Fed often considers adjusting its monetary policy. Governor Miran’s advocacy for more interest rate cuts likely stems from an assessment that the economy could benefit from further stimulus, or that existing inflationary pressures are sufficiently mitigated. His intention to persuade other policymakers highlights that such decisions are not unilateral. They involve careful consideration and consensus-building among the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who weigh various economic data points and forecasts. How Might These Fed Rate Cuts Impact Your Finances? The prospect of additional Fed rate cuts carries broad implications for everyday finances and investment portfolios. Understanding these potential shifts can help individuals and businesses make informed decisions. Borrowing Costs: Expect to see lower rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit card interest. This could be an opportune time for refinancing or taking on new debt for large purchases. Savings Returns: On the flip side, interest earned on savings accounts, CDs, and money market funds might decrease. Savers might need to explore alternative investment avenues for better returns. Stock Market: Generally, lower rates are favorable for stock markets as they reduce borrowing costs for companies and make equity investments more attractive compared to bonds. Cryptocurrency Market: Lower interest rates can increase liquidity in the broader financial system. This often translates to increased investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, as traditional fixed-income returns diminish. This potential shift underscores a period where vigilance and adaptability will be key for investors, especially those with exposure to volatile assets like digital currencies. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After Expected Fed Rate Cuts ? As Governor Miran pushes for more Fed rate cuts , market participants will be closely watching for subsequent announcements and economic data. Key indicators like inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP growth will continue to influence the Fed’s decisions. The coming months are set to be a dynamic period, where economic policy could significantly shape financial landscapes globally. Staying informed about these developments is crucial. The impact of these decisions can ripple through various sectors, from housing to technology, and certainly into the burgeoning world of digital assets. Prepare for potential shifts and consider how a lower interest rate environment might affect your financial strategies. In conclusion, Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran’s expectation for additional Fed rate cuts signals a potentially transformative period for the economy. His commitment to persuading other policymakers suggests a strong push towards further monetary easing. This bold outlook could provide a much-needed boost to economic activity, while also prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming months will reveal the extent of these changes and their long-term effects. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Fed rate cuts? Fed rate cuts refer to the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. This benchmark interest rate influences other interest rates throughout the economy, making borrowing cheaper and potentially stimulating economic growth. 2. How do interest rate cuts impact inflation? Lowering interest rates can make borrowing and spending more attractive, which can increase demand for goods and services. If demand outpaces supply, it can lead to higher prices, potentially accelerating inflation. However, the Fed considers many factors before making such decisions. 3. What does 25 bp mean? 25 bp stands for 25 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. So, a 25 bp rate cut means the interest rate was lowered by 0.25%. 4. How might Fed rate cuts affect the cryptocurrency market? Lower interest rates can make traditional, safer investments (like bonds) less attractive due to reduced returns. This often encourages investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up demand and prices in the crypto market. 5. Who is Steven Miran?

Way too much.” The post reprises his data-driven commentary from early 2024, when he argued that “#Bitcoin could reach $112K this year driven by ETF inflows, worst-case $55K.” That framework came conspicuously close: Bitcoin went on to register a 2024 high above $108,000, narrowly under his $112,000 projection. Why Bitcoin Price Could Top Above $208,000 The chart Ki published on September 18 visualizes three time series derived from CryptoQuant’s realized-cap methodology: the spot price of BTC (black), a model “ceiling_price” (red) and a model “floor_price” (green). As of 17 September 2025 (UTC), the panel annotated a spot marker at $116,453, a ceiling at $208,310 and a floor at $41,662, with the dashboard showing it was “last run” two hours prior. In other words, the model currently locates Bitcoin well above its inferred floor and still materially below the band it treats as an overvaluation zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds $117,500 On Retail Support While Whales Stay Quiet – Cause For Concern? The implication of Ki’s share is not a guarantee, but a statement that, given prevailing on-chain capital inflows and the realized-cap structure, the market has room—by this metric—to extend toward that $208,000 upper band. Realized cap values the network by summing each coin at the price it last moved on-chain rather than the current market price, a construction that tends to track investor cost basis over time. CryptoQuant’s dashboard projects dynamic “floor” and “ceiling” bands around spots that, historically, have framed multi-year expansions and contractions. Ki’s renewed bullishness ties those bands to what he describes as surging demand pressure visible in settlement flows and ETF-linked capital migration onto the network. The continuity with his February 2024 note is explicit: then he cited exchange-traded product inflows as the dominant driver of an advance toward six figures; now he points to “too much capital inflows onchain” while circulating a model that places the ceiling near $208,000. Related Reading: $1 Million Bitcoin Is Coming: Arthur Hayes Says Fed Just Pulled The Trigger It is noteworthy that Ki is not presenting an open-ended forecast but rather a model snapshot that updates with market structure. The same dashboard that prints a $208,310 ceiling today also marks the risk floor at $41,662, underscoring the spread of outcomes the realized-cap approach contemplates. His track record with the $112,000 “this year” guidance—followed by a print just above $108,000—will inevitably color how traders receive the new post. But the framing remains analytical: a data readout of where Bitcoin sits relative to its realized-value envelope after a year and a half defined by US spot ETF adoption and deepening institutional participation. For now, Ki’s message is simple and blunt—“I’m bullish on Bitcoin”—and anchored in the same on-chain lens he used 10 months ahead of the 2024 peak. Whether the market ultimately approaches the model’s $208,000 ceiling will depend on how those on-chain inflows evolve against macro liquidity, ETF and corporate treasury demand as well as miners’ supply behavior. What his chart makes clear is that, by CryptoQuant’s realized-cap bands, Bitcoin has not yet tested the top of its statistical range in this cycle. At press time, BTC traded at $116,173.

Grayscale has officially submitted a revised S-1 application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to transform its existing closed-end Dogecoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This development could mark a pivotal moment for Dogecoin, potentially opening doors to a wider range of investors. If approved, this Dogecoin ETF is slated to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GDOG, as reported by The Block. This action highlights the growing institutional interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Exactly is a Dogecoin ETF, and Why Does it Matter? An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities. These funds trade on stock exchanges just like regular stocks. A Dogecoin ETF would directly hold Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly buying and storing it themselves. This structure offers several key benefits: Accessibility: It simplifies investing in Dogecoin for traditional investors who might be hesitant about crypto exchanges or digital wallets. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like NYSE Arca provides a familiar and secure environment. Diversification: It allows for easier portfolio diversification within traditional investment accounts. Therefore, a Dogecoin ETF could significantly broaden the investment landscape for this popular meme coin. Grayscale’s Ambitious Journey: Paving the Way for a Dogecoin ETF Grayscale has a long history of pioneering crypto investment products. They are well-known for their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which have provided institutional and accredited investors with access to digital assets for years. Their persistent efforts have often pushed the boundaries of crypto integration into traditional finance. This revised S-1 application for a Dogecoin ETF demonstrates Grayscale’s continued commitment to expanding investment opportunities for a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Their experience in navigating the complex regulatory environment with the SEC positions them as a key player in this ongoing evolution. They are clearly leveraging their expertise to bring more digital assets into the mainstream. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: The SEC’s Stance on a Dogecoin ETF The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically approached cryptocurrency ETFs with caution, primarily due to concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a significant shift in their stance. The SEC will thoroughly review Grayscale’s application, considering factors such as market surveillance, liquidity, and the underlying asset’s resilience. Approving a Dogecoin ETF would signal a further maturation of the crypto market in the eyes of regulators. The outcome will depend on Grayscale’s ability to address these regulatory concerns effectively. Potential Impact: How Could a Dogecoin ETF Reshape DOGE’s Future? If the Dogecoin ETF receives approval, its impact on DOGE could be substantial. Such a product could: Increase Liquidity: Attract more capital, leading to higher trading volumes and potentially more stable prices. Boost Legitimacy: Elevate Dogecoin’s status from a ‘meme coin’ to a more credible, institutional-grade asset. Attract New Investors: Open the floodgates for traditional investors and institutions who prefer regulated investment vehicles. Moreover, the approval could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs, signaling a broader acceptance of diverse digital assets in the financial world. This would be a significant step for the entire crypto ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What Are the Next Steps for the Dogecoin ETF? The submission of a revised S-1 application is an important step, but it is part of a longer process. The SEC will now review the updated filing, which typically involves periods of public comment and further deliberation. There is no fixed timeline for approval, and the process can often extend over several months. Market participants will be closely watching for any announcements from the SEC. The potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF could undoubtedly spark considerable excitement and investment activity around DOGE. Conversely, a rejection could lead to temporary price volatility. Investors should stay informed about these regulatory developments. In conclusion, Grayscale’s revised application for a Dogecoin ETF represents a monumental effort to integrate Dogecoin further into the mainstream financial system. While the path to approval involves navigating complex regulatory hurdles, the potential benefits for Dogecoin’s liquidity, legitimacy, and investor accessibility are immense. This move underscores the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market and its increasing convergence with traditional finance. The crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, which could profoundly shape the future trajectory of Dogecoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Dogecoin ETF?

NYSE Arca has taken a bold step, submitting a revised proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply recently relaxed ETF listing standards to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF , including its Mini version. This move could fundamentally reshape how investors access Ethereum through traditional financial markets. What’s Driving the Push for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? This pivotal action by NYSE Arca follows a crucial prior approval by the SEC. The regulatory body recently greenlit a rule change that automatically streamlines ETF listings for cryptocurrencies. Specifically, this applies to those digital assets that have traded as futures for over six months on a derivatives exchange licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This means such cryptocurrencies no longer require a separate, often lengthy, review process for their ETF applications. For the first time, this new, more efficient pathway is being directly applied to the eagerly anticipated Grayscale Ethereum ETFs . Unpacking the SEC’s Relaxed Rules: A Game Changer for Ethereum? The SEC’s decision to relax its ETF listing standards marks a significant shift in its approach to cryptocurrency-backed financial products. Previously, each ETF application underwent an extensive, individual review. This often led to delays and uncertainty for issuers. Now, the automatic greenlight for certain futures-backed cryptocurrencies removes a major hurdle. This change acknowledges the maturity and regulatory oversight already present in the CFTC-licensed futures markets. For Grayscale Ethereum ETFs , this could mean a much quicker journey to market, opening up new avenues for investors. This development is particularly exciting because it signifies a growing acceptance of crypto assets within traditional finance, albeit under specific conditions. It reflects a maturing regulatory landscape that seeks to balance innovation with investor protection. What Benefits Could Grayscale Ethereum ETFs Bring to Investors? The potential approval of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs under these new rules could unlock several key advantages for investors: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors, who might be hesitant to directly buy and store Ethereum, could gain exposure through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle like an ETF. Institutional Adoption: The streamlined process may encourage more institutional investors to allocate capital to Ethereum, potentially boosting its market stability and liquidity. Enhanced Market Transparency: ETFs trade on regulated exchanges, offering a layer of transparency and oversight that can build investor confidence. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Ethereum exposure through an ETF could offer new diversification opportunities for a balanced investment portfolio. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? While the relaxed rules offer a promising path, the journey for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs is not entirely without potential challenges. The SEC, despite its new framework, still maintains a level of discretion in its approval process. Here are some points to consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: Even with a more automatic process, the SEC will likely continue to scrutinize the underlying markets and the structure of the ETFs to ensure investor protection. Market Volatility: Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. This inherent characteristic will remain a consideration for both regulators and potential investors. Ongoing Dialogue: Issuers like Grayscale will need to maintain a constructive dialogue with regulators, addressing any concerns that may arise during the final stages of approval. This revised proposal is a testament to the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. It highlights a proactive approach by market participants like NYSE Arca to adapt to and leverage new regulatory frameworks, ultimately benefiting investors and the broader digital asset ecosystem. The move by NYSE Arca to apply these relaxed listing standards to Grayscale Ethereum ETFs is a landmark event. It signals a growing maturity in the crypto market and a willingness from traditional financial institutions to embrace digital assets. While final approval is still pending, this development undoubtedly brings us closer to a future where Ethereum is more seamlessly integrated into mainstream investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of NYSE Arca’s revised proposal for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? A1: NYSE Arca is proposing to use recently relaxed SEC rules that streamline ETF listings for cryptocurrencies with established futures markets. This could significantly expedite the approval process for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs , making them available to investors sooner. Q2: How do the SEC’s relaxed ETF listing standards work? A2: The new rule allows for automatic approval of ETFs for cryptocurrencies that have traded as futures for over six months on a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange, bypassing a lengthy individual review. Q3: What are the potential benefits of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs for investors? A3: They could offer easier access to Ethereum for traditional investors, attract more institutional capital, provide enhanced market transparency, and offer new opportunities for portfolio diversification. Q4: Are Grayscale Ethereum ETFs guaranteed to be approved now? A4: While the relaxed rules provide a more direct pathway, final approval still rests with the SEC. The proposal is a significant step, but it is not an automatic guarantee of immediate listing. Q5: What is the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and its Mini version? A5: These are proposed exchange-traded funds from Grayscale designed to hold Ethereum, offering investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning it. The Mini version is typically designed for lower expense ratios or different market segments. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Understanding market sentiment is absolutely crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes into play. This powerful tool offers a fascinating snapshot of investor psychology, helping us gauge whether the market is leaning towards panic or euphoria. Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dipped slightly to 48, settling firmly in the neutral zone. But what does this mean for you and your crypto journey? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts like a psychological barometer for the cryptocurrency market. Developed by Alternative.me, it distills complex market dynamics into a single, easy-to-understand number. Its primary goal is to illustrate whether market participants are feeling overly fearful or excessively greedy. This index operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are panicking, often seen as a potential buying opportunity by contrarians. 25-49: Fear – General anxiety and uncertainty in the market. 50-74: Greed – Investors are getting excited and eager, sometimes leading to irrational exuberance. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is overheating, often a signal for potential corrections. Currently, with the index at 48, we find ourselves in a neutral position. This suggests a balance between fear and greed, indicating that the market isn’t showing strong directional sentiment from the crowd. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Unveiling the Metrics It’s important to understand that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation based on several key factors. Each component contributes to the final score, offering a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of what goes into it: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. High volatility often signals a fearful market. Trading Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a negative market can indicate strong selling pressure, while high volumes during price surges can show strong buying interest. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzing sentiment around crypto-related hashtags and discussions on platforms like Twitter provides insights into public mood. Surveys (15%): While paused at times, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be flocking to Bitcoin as a perceived safe haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto bubble’ can reveal underlying fear or greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a holistic and dynamic representation of the market’s mood, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a powerful tool. Navigating Neutrality: What Does 48 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signify? A reading of 48, squarely in the neutral zone, presents an interesting scenario. It means that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market narrative. Instead, there’s a delicate balance. This can be interpreted in several ways: Uncertainty: Investors might be hesitant, waiting for clearer signals before committing to major moves. Consolidation: Prices might be moving sideways, as buyers and sellers reach a temporary equilibrium. Precursor to a Move: Neutrality can often precede a significant market movement, either upwards or downwards, as the market gathers momentum for its next trend. For traders, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests a time for caution and observation. It’s less about making impulsive decisions and more about preparing for potential shifts. This is when careful analysis of other indicators becomes even more vital. Actionable Insights for Traders: Leveraging the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct buy or sell signal, it is an invaluable tool when integrated into a broader trading strategy. Think of it as an emotional compass for the market. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Trading Opportunities: Some traders use extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity (when others are fearful, be greedy) and extreme greed as a potential selling opportunity (when others are greedy, be fearful). Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your existing technical or fundamental analysis. If your charts suggest a breakout and the index is showing increasing greed, it might add conviction. Risk Management: During periods of extreme greed, it might be wise to take some profits or tighten stop-losses. Conversely, extreme fear could signal a good time to accumulate positions gradually. Understanding Market Psychology: The index helps you understand the collective mindset, preventing you from getting swept up in herd mentality. Always remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used in conjunction with other research and not as a standalone indicator. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48, resting in the neutral zone, offers a fascinating glimpse into the current state of crypto investor sentiment. It highlights a period of balance, perhaps even anticipation, rather than strong directional conviction. For any cryptocurrency enthusiast or trader, understanding and effectively utilizing this index can be a powerful addition to their toolkit, helping them navigate the complex emotional landscape of digital assets. Stay informed, stay analytical, and always trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from extreme fear to extreme greed, on a scale of 0 to 100. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment based on the latest data points. What does a ‘neutral’ reading like 48 mean for the market? A neutral reading suggests a balance between buying and selling pressures, indicating market uncertainty, consolidation, or a period of calm before a potential significant move. It’s not strongly bullish or bearish. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict price movements? While it reflects market psychology, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct price predictor. It’s best used as a sentiment indicator to complement other technical and fundamental analysis, rather than as a standalone trading signal. Are there other sentiment indicators similar to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Yes, there are other sentiment indicators such as social media sentiment analysis tools, on-chain analytics focusing on investor behavior, and funding rates in perpetual futures markets, all of which provide different angles on market mood.

Under the notice, the Treasury said that although advance notice of proposed rulemaking was not normally necessary for implementing a law, it seeks public comment to refine and broaden its regulatory framework. The Treasury began a comment period in August and has set an Oct. 17 deadline for the public to provide input about any concerns or feedback it may have regarding possible illicit activity. The recent notice provides a 31-day window for feedback. “Treasury welcomes comments and views from a wide range of stakeholders on the [advance notice of proposed rulemaking],” the statement reads. The GENIUS Act was one of three cryptocurrency-related bills the House of Representatives advanced in July during Republicans’ “Crypto Week.” President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 18, joined by executives from major crypto firms including Gemini, Coinbase, Circle, and Kraken. Designed to regulate payment stablecoins in the US, the law is set to take effect either 18 months after enactment or 120 days following the release of final regulations from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve—placing implementation no earlier than late 2026. Congress advances market structure bill amid growing crypto oversight Meanwhile, i n one of its first legislative steps on crypto bills since passing the GENIUS Act in June, the US Senate is expected to vote on a digital asset market structure framework this month. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading American attorney and member of the Republican Party , has been pushing for market structure. She says the committee is expected to vote on the bill by the end of September, potentially being signed into law by 2026 . The market structure bill, tentatively titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, hopes to clarify US financial agencies’ roles in overseeing and enforcing digital asset laws.. Members of Congress, including Lummis, met with executives from crypto companies in three separate roundtable discussions this week to consider the market structure and Bitcoin BTC reserve bills. Kraken and Circle partnership expands stablecoin access and utility On related developments, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken recently partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to broaden access to and the utility of Circle’s USDC and EURC tokens. The collaboration will integrate Circle’s dollar- and euro-pegged stablecoins into Kraken’s platform, giving clients expanded ways to use USDC across existing applications and introducing support for EURC. “Stablecoins are the financial layer most aligned with crypto’s original architecture — permissionless, programmable, and global by default,” said Mark Greenberg, global head of Kraken’s consumer business. “Expanding support for Circle’s products isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about embedding new opportunities to benefit from Circle’s stablecoins into products our clients already use and trust.” Circle echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the role of stablecoins in shaping digital finance. “We’re focused on building the world’s largest, most widely used stablecoin network, and partnering with leading platforms like Kraken to drive new opportunities for onchain finance,” said Kash Razzaghi, Circle’s chief commercial officer. The companies said the partnership supports the “responsible growth of stablecoins” as a core component of the evolving online financial system.

A groundbreaking development is currently unfolding that could significantly change how investors engage with this popular meme coin. REX-Osprey has officially filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF , promising an intriguing new avenue for amplified exposure. What is a Leveraged DOGE ETF and Why Now? This isn’t just any ordinary investment product. A leveraged DOGE ETF is designed to provide magnified returns, aiming for 1.5 times the daily performance of its underlying Dogecoin ETF (DOJE). Decrypt recently reported on REX-Osprey’s ambitious application, highlighting the firm’s proactive approach in the crypto market. This filing comes on the heels of the impressive debut of their original DOJE ETF. The initial ETF recorded a remarkable $17 million in trading volume on its first day of listing on September 18th. This strong initial performance clearly signals a robust investor appetite for Dogecoin-related financial products. REX-Osprey’s decision to introduce a leveraged version underscores their confidence in this market demand. Consequently, it also reflects a growing sophistication within the crypto investment space, as firms explore more advanced instruments to cater to diverse investor strategies. Unpacking the Potential: Benefits of a Leveraged DOGE ETF For savvy investors and traders, a leveraged DOGE ETF offers several compelling benefits. The primary advantage is the potential for amplified gains. For instance, if Dogecoin’s price rises by 10% in a day, a 1.5x leveraged ETF theoretically aims to deliver a 15% return before fees and expenses. This product could particularly appeal to traders looking to capitalize on short-term price movements without the complexities of directly holding Dogecoin. It provides a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, making it easier for a broader range of investors to participate. Moreover, investing in such an ETF eliminates many common hurdles associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership, such as managing crypto wallets, dealing with various exchanges, and addressing security concerns. This enhanced accessibility can significantly lower the barrier to entry for many traditional finance participants. Navigating the Risks: What Investors Need to Know About This Leveraged DOGE ETF However, it is crucial to understand that leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify gains, it also amplifies losses. Therefore, a 10% drop in Dogecoin’s price could potentially lead to a 15% loss in the value of the leveraged DOGE ETF , before considering fees and rebalancing effects. These products are typically designed for short-term trading strategies and are generally not suitable for long-term holding. Daily rebalancing mechanisms, which are inherent to leveraged ETFs, can lead to performance decay over extended periods, especially in volatile markets. Investors must exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before committing capital. Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, a leveraged product becomes particularly high-risk. Understanding your personal risk tolerance and investment objectives is paramount before considering an investment in such a complex and potentially volatile instrument. The Regulatory Hurdle: SEC’s Stance on Leveraged DOGE ETF Approval The application for this leveraged DOGE ETF now rests with the U.S. SEC. Historically, the SEC has maintained a cautious stance on approving leveraged and inverse crypto products. Their primary concerns often revolve around potential market manipulation, extreme volatility, and ensuring robust investor protection measures are in place. The SEC’s decision on this filing will be a significant indicator of the regulatory body’s evolving perspective on complex crypto derivatives. The approval process for such novel financial instruments is often lengthy and subject to stringent review and public commentary periods. Nonetheless, REX-Osprey’s filing demonstrates continued institutional interest and confidence in bringing innovative crypto investment vehicles to market. This persistent effort actively pushes the boundaries of traditional finance and its intersection with digital assets. REX-Osprey’s pursuit of a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. While it offers an exciting opportunity for amplified returns and broader market access, it also comes with inherent risks that demand careful consideration and a clear understanding of market dynamics. As the SEC reviews this application, the entire industry watches closely, anticipating what this could mean for the future of crypto-backed financial products. This innovative step highlights the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios, paving the way for more sophisticated financial instruments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a leveraged ETF? A leveraged ETF is an exchange-traded fund that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index or asset. For example, a 1.5x leveraged ETF aims to return 1.5 times the daily performance of its benchmark. 2. How is a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF different from simply buying Dogecoin? Directly buying Dogecoin means your gains or losses mirror its price movement one-to-one. A 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF aims to amplify those daily movements by 1.5 times, meaning larger potential gains but also larger potential losses. It also offers exposure through a traditional brokerage account, bypassing direct crypto ownership. 3. Who is REX-Osprey? REX-Osprey is an asset management firm that focuses on providing innovative investment products, particularly in the cryptocurrency space. They are the firm behind the original DOGE ETF (DOJE) and are now seeking to launch a leveraged version. 4. What are the main risks of investing in a leveraged DOGE ETF? The primary risks include amplified losses (you can lose more than your initial investment faster), performance decay over longer periods due to daily rebalancing, and the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. These products are generally considered high-risk and are best suited for short-term, active trading. 5. Has the SEC approved other leveraged crypto ETFs? As of now, the SEC has generally been hesitant to approve leveraged or inverse cryptocurrency ETFs due to concerns about market volatility, manipulation, and investor protection. This application for a leveraged DOGE ETF is significant because it represents a continued push by firms to bring such products to market.

51993527,585052,1758328225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51993527.jpeg,Police Confirms Largest Crypto Seizure In Canadian History,https://bitcoinist.com/police-largest-crypto-seizure-canadian-history/,"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has confirmed a record-breaking seizure of cryptocurrency linked to the centralized exchange TradeOgre, taking control of assets worth more than 56 million Canadian dollars—about 40 million US dollars—following a federal policing investigation in Quebec. The agency described the operation as “the largest cryptocurrency seizure in Canadian history,” and said it dismantled the platform’s Canadian infrastructure. The news was announced on September 18 from Montréal. Canadian Police Confirms $40 Million Crypto Seizure According to details released by Canadian media quoting the RCMP, investigators seized servers in Beauharnois in the Montérégie region, which supported TradeOgre’s operations. RCMP Sgt. Mathieu Lagarde said: “The servers that allowed this platform to conduct these transactions were located in Canada. So we seized these servers and then seized the crypto assets controlled by the exchange.” Authorities added that this marks the first time a cryptocurrency exchange has been dismantled by police in Canada. The yearlong probe was run by the RCMP Federal Policing – Eastern Region’s Money Laundering Investigative Team and began in June 2024 after a tip from Europol, according to the accounts of the investigation provided by authorities and reported by national outlets. The RCMP alleges TradeOgre failed to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business and did not identify its customers, conditions that investigators say allowed criminal organizations to conceal the origins of funds. Open-source blockchain intelligence platform Arkham said its tooling was used in the case. In a public post, Arkham wrote that “as per the RCMP’s website, Arkham was used as part of the investigation,” and in a research note the firm documented earlier on-chain indicators—specifically messages embedded in Bitcoin transactions —signaling that Canadian police had claimed ownership of funds. Arkham’s report also noted TradeOgre’s social and site activity had gone dark earlier this summer (X account inactive since May; website offline since July 30). The RCMP said it is now analyzing transaction data from the platform and that enforcement actions may follow: “The transaction data obtained from the platform will be analyzed and charges may follow. The investigation is ongoing.” Authorities emphasized that no arrests had been announced as of the release and encouraged anyone with relevant information to contact investigators. While the RCMP’s statement framed TradeOgre as an unregistered venue used to launder proceeds of crime, the seizure has already prompted a broader debate among some users who claim legitimate balances were swept up with illicit funds. What is clear, however, is that Canadian law enforcement has established a new high-water mark for domestic crypto enforcement and, for the first time, has taken down the Canadian infrastructure of a cryptocurrency exchange as part of a money-laundering investigation. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $4 trillion.",Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|crypto news|Crypto News Canada|RCMP|TradeOgre,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ARKM|EXCHANGE|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 00:30:25

FTX, once a leading cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, imploded in November 2022 amid revelations of multi-billion-dollar fraud. Concerning the third round of payment mode, creditors in groups of four will secure their share of the funds at the end of this month, with a distribution rate ranging from 78% to 120%. According to a press release from the Trust, which manages the assets and claims linked to FTX’s bankruptcy, this distribution rate is the percentage of their FTX holdings worth when the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Additionally, it marks the third phase of FTX’s recovery plan, which will take place via the crypto exchanges Bitgo and Kraken, along with Payoneer, a financial services company. This is not the first time the FTX Recovery Trust has made the distribution plan public. In 2024, the legal entity had initially shared it. FTX collapse was due to mismanagement of funds Under FTX’s operation, its users were allowed to purchase, sell, and make speculations about the future prices of widely adopted cryptocurrencies and tokens. This greatly attracted customers and increased the exchange’s user base . However, its CEO, Bankman-Fried, alongside his senior partners, used customers’ funds invested in the exchange to cover high-risk investments that Alameda Research, a hedge fund connected to the company, made without their consent. Consequently, this mismanagement of customers’ funds resulted in FTX’s bankruptcy, with billions of investor funds missing. To track down the missing funds, John J. Ray III, an American attorney and CEO specializing in recovering funds from failed corporations, was assigned to get them back. While working on this, the American attorney pointed out that the exchange’s bankruptcy was greater than that of Enron, an energy firm, in the early 2000s. FTX’s CEO was arrested with fraud charges Following his actions, Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and later charged with defrauding clients. When the charges were presented in court, he was legally jailed. This was made possible because prominent figures from Bankman-Fried’s close team decided to testify against him during the trial. Interestingly, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, who used to lead engineering at FTX, acknowledged that they committed crimes because Bankman-Fried had commanded them to do so. After the verdict was announced, a Lawyer and former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York weighed in on the situation. He commented that Sam Bankman-Fried’s financial fraud was one of the largest in the history of America. According to him, the CEO carried out this multi-million dollar scheme to position himself as the ruler of crypto. Meanwhile, to serve as a warning to any individual with intentions similar to those of Bankman-Fried, the relevant authorities sentenced the CEO to serve 25 years in prison in Southern California for fraud and other offenses. On related developments, Bankman-Fried’s dormant X account suddenly became active this week, mass-following other profiles after months of silence. The unexpected activity sparked speculation and fueled a rally in the FTT token, which briefly climbed above $1. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the renewed activity raised questions about whether the former FTX founder, currently serving time in prison, somehow signals continued interest in crypto, or even hints at an early release. However, there has been no official word regarding his release, and the FTX bankruptcy process is still moving forward, with the next creditor distribution scheduled for September 30. On-chain data suggests Bankman-Fried has little to no funds left for trading, with one of his meme wallets now holding just 0.67 SOL. Meanwhile, wallets associated with Alameda Research continue to receive allocations of SOL from earlier distributions, but those funds are being directed toward bankruptcy settlements rather than trading.

This new investment vehicle isn’t just another fund; it represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption in traditional finance. What is the Grayscale GDLC ETF and Why is it Important? Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), now converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), offers investors exposure to a basket of major cryptocurrencies. Unlike single-asset ETFs, the Grayscale GDLC ETF provides diversification across several prominent digital assets, aiming to mirror the performance of the broader crypto market. Its recent launch follows a crucial approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This regulatory nod is a testament to the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within established financial frameworks. It opens doors for a wider range of investors, including institutions, to access the crypto market through a regulated and familiar investment product. A Strong Start: Decoding the $22 Million Volume for Grayscale GDLC ETF On its very first day of trading, the Grayscale GDLC ETF recorded an impressive $22 million in volume. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that this figure is notably higher than the typical debut for an ETF. What does this strong initial performance tell us? High Investor Interest: The substantial volume indicates significant pent-up demand for a diversified, regulated crypto investment product. Market Confidence: It suggests growing confidence among investors regarding the stability and potential of large-cap cryptocurrencies. Institutional Engagement: While not exclusively institutional, such volumes often reflect participation from larger investment firms seeking compliant ways to enter the crypto space. This early success underscores a pivotal shift. Investors are increasingly looking for accessible and secure avenues to participate in the digital asset economy. Benefits and Challenges of Investing in the Grayscale GDLC ETF The introduction of the Grayscale GDLC ETF brings several advantages, but also highlights ongoing considerations in the crypto investment landscape. Key Benefits for Investors: Diversification: Investors gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of major cryptocurrencies without needing to manage individual assets. Accessibility: It allows investors to buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying the investment process. Regulatory Oversight: As an SEC-approved ETF, it operates under stringent regulatory guidelines, offering a layer of protection and transparency. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer good liquidity, allowing for easy entry and exit from positions. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While diversified, the underlying assets are still subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Fees: Like all ETFs, there are management fees associated with holding the fund. Limited Scope: The fund focuses on large-cap cryptocurrencies, meaning investors seeking exposure to smaller, emerging altcoins might need to look elsewhere. Understanding these aspects is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The Grayscale GDLC ETF offers a robust entry point for many, yet it’s important to align it with individual risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and Grayscale’s Pivotal Role? The successful launch of the Grayscale GDLC ETF is more than just an individual product’s triumph; it’s a significant indicator for the broader crypto ETF market. It demonstrates a clear appetite from investors and potentially paves the way for further approvals of similar diversified or single-asset crypto ETFs. Grayscale has been a pioneer in bringing crypto investment products to traditional markets. Their persistent efforts in navigating regulatory landscapes have been instrumental in bridging the gap between digital assets and mainstream finance. This latest conversion and strong debut solidify their position as a key player in shaping the future of crypto investment vehicles. The trend suggests a future where investing in cryptocurrencies becomes as straightforward and accessible as investing in stocks or bonds. This evolution could significantly accelerate institutional adoption and bring greater stability and maturity to the crypto market as a whole. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Digital Asset Investing The debut of the Grayscale GDLC ETF marks a momentous occasion for the cryptocurrency investment landscape. Its impressive trading volume on day one signals robust investor confidence and a growing demand for regulated, diversified crypto exposure. This development not only provides a new, accessible pathway for investors but also reinforces the increasing legitimization of digital assets within the traditional financial system. As Grayscale continues to innovate and regulatory bodies adapt, we can anticipate further integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios. This ETF is a clear indicator that the digital asset revolution is not just ongoing, but accelerating, offering unprecedented opportunities for growth and diversification.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7572 Market cap $802.01M Trading volume (24-hour) $37.98M Circulating supply 1.059B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8253 24-hour low $0.7527 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.43% 50-day SMA $0.7809 14-Day RSI 55.98 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.6950 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos faces rejection at $0.80 and is now stabilizing near $0.755. XTZ’s daily support sits at $0.744. Short-term momentum leans bearish unless. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The 1-day price chart as of September 20 shows Tezos trading at $0.755, slightly under pressure after failing to hold the $0.80 resistance. The Bollinger Bands show price hovering just above the mid-band at $0.744, suggesting support is still intact, though the upper band at $0.804 continues to act as a ceiling. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Volume has picked up, showing stronger participation, but the latest red candle hints at short-term sellers stepping in. The MACD is flattening near the zero line, with a weak bullish cross but limited momentum, signaling indecision. If the $0.744 support is broken, Tezos (XTZ) could move downside toward $0.685. On the other hand, a sustained recovery above $0.80 would revive bullish momentum. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, the trend looks weaker. The price is consolidating just under $0.755 after consecutive red candles, with the Alligator lines showing a bearish alignment as the moving averages tilt downward. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The BoP remains negative at -0.12, highlighting selling pressure. The MACD is also trending below the signal line, confirming bearish momentum on intraday levels. Unless buyers reclaim $0.77–$0.78, the path of least resistance remains slightly downward, with $0.74 acting as near-term support. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7702 SELL SMA 5 $0.7814 SELL SMA 10 $0.7884 SELL SMA 21 $0.7545 BUY SMA 50 $0.7809 SELL SMA 100 $0.7153 BUY SMA 200 $0.6950 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7449 BUY EMA 5 $0.7461 BUY EMA 10 $0.7618 SELL EMA 21 $0.7846 SELL EMA 50 $0.7748 SELL EMA 100 $0.7387 BUY EMA 200 $0.7447 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos looks neutral-to-bearish in the short term. If the coin manages to hold above $0.744 support, the current setup remains. A failure to break past immediate resistance at $0.77 could result in further price drops toward $0.72–$0.68. A breakout above $0.80 would flip the momentum back to bullish. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

But while ETH’s overall direction remains strong, the real breakout coin could possibly be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Sold at lows of $0.035 today, MUTM waits for a potential 43x price pump, thanks to its borrowing- and lending-clad utility-based DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is offering investors the type of ground-floor potential ETH investors can’t ever see again. While capital seeks the next big performer, Mutuum Finance is rapidly becoming the coin to watch. Ethereum Sees $7,000-$10,000 On Building Signs Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $4,513.78, intraday ranging between $4,429.39 and $4,535.33. Momentum indicators are indicating steady firming up, volume has constricted, and support at $4,400-$4,500 is thought to be in place. For ETH to cross $7,000 or even $10,000 in subsequent cycles, it would ideally require positive macroeconomic contexts, continuous growth in DeFi adoption, and effective use of scaling solutions. Whereas ETH is the incumbent with a de facto place at the smart contract layer and less of a spec play than the majority of altcoins, investors believe Mutuum Finance has the potential to offer returns higher than ETH’s in 2025. MUTM Presale Momentum and FOMO Mutuum Finance offers investors the opportunity to be some of the project’s pioneers and invest in tokens at much less than they will be after launch. Available for sale at $0.035 per MUTM in presale Phase 6, the token will be priced at $0.04 in Phase 7. The presale has been successful, with over $16 million raised and over 16,400 token holders, which indicates positive sentiment among investors and trust in the market. To add a layer of protection for security, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK that guarantees rewards of up to $50,000 USDT. Openly available, the program welcomes white-hat hackers, developers, and researchers to scan the codebase for any possible weaknesses. Rewards are tiered according to severity level to ensure even low-severity bugs get fixed before release. The program is merely one example of Mutuum’s commitment to safety, transparency, and investor confidence. MUTM is a two-layer hybrid lending protocol, offering Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, to enable maximum flexibility. The P2C system is applied to cause the contracts to constantly monitor the market so that interest rates can be determined. It is designed such that investors shall receive passive income and lenders shall lend at minimal interest rates, and the contracts will automatically execute the transactions. The P2P model facilitates immediate real-time communication between borrowers and lenders without the intermediary. The more dynamic alternative best suits riskier items such as meme coins and gives freedom and efficiency in a trustless setup. To provide actual and timely prices, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles, which aggregate rates for top-cap assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, combined feeds, and on-chain data feeds are further used to provide security if volatile markets exist. The robust pricing foundation is used in stable collateral management, liquidations, and risk analysis to maintain the stability and efficiency of the protocol under all conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the breakout altcoin while Ethereum (ETH) targets $7,000–$10,000. Currently in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.035, MUTM will rise to $0.04 in Stage 7, giving early investors access to ground-floor pricing ahead of a projected 43x pump. The project has raised over $16M and onboarded 16,400 holders, showcasing strong confidence. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, dual P2C and P2P lending models, and Chainlink-powered price feeds, MUTM delivers security, scalability, and real DeFi utility.

A significant development is now capturing attention: Enosys, a prominent Flare-based DeFi protocol, has officially launched a pioneering XRP stablecoin protocol. This move is set to unlock new avenues for XRP holders and reshape how stability is perceived within the DeFi space. Introducing the Groundbreaking XRP Stablecoin Protocol Enosys’s new protocol marks a pivotal moment for the XRP community and the broader DeFi landscape. CryptoBriefing initially reported this exciting launch, highlighting the core mechanism: the stablecoin is collateralized by XRP itself. This isn’t just another stablecoin; it’s a strategic integration designed to leverage XRP’s potential within a decentralized framework. For those unfamiliar, Flare is a high-performance blockchain network focused on bringing smart contract capabilities to various cryptocurrencies, including XRP, that do not natively support them. Enosys, built on this network, is now enabling users to mint a new stablecoin. This is achieved by depositing FXRP, which is the wrapped version of XRP on the Flare network. FXRP acts as the bridge, allowing XRP to participate in Flare’s DeFi ecosystem. This initiative showcases the power of interoperability, allowing an asset like XRP to gain new functionalities and integrate seamlessly into the burgeoning world of DeFi applications. It’s a testament to the growing demand for diverse collateral options beyond established assets like Ethereum or Bitcoin. How Does XRP Collateralization Work? Understanding the mechanics behind this XRP stablecoin is key to appreciating its value and security. The process is designed to be straightforward yet robust, ensuring user confidence and protocol stability: Acquiring FXRP: Before minting, users need to wrap their native XRP into FXRP on the Flare network. This process is typically facilitated through secure bridging mechanisms. Depositing FXRP as Collateral: Users then deposit their FXRP into the Enosys stablecoin protocol. This FXRP acts as the backing for the stablecoin they wish to mint. Minting the Stablecoin: Upon successful deposit, users can mint the Enosys stablecoin, which is pegged to a fiat currency (e.g., 1:1 with the US Dollar). To safeguard against market volatility, the value of the deposited FXRP collateral usually exceeds the value of the stablecoin minted (overcollateralization). This buffer helps absorb potential price drops in XRP. Utilizing the Stablecoin: The newly minted stablecoin can then be used across various DeFi applications on Flare, such as lending, borrowing, trading, or payments, all while maintaining exposure to their underlying XRP. Redemption Process: When users wish to retrieve their original FXRP, they simply repay the minted stablecoin plus any accrued fees. This burns the stablecoin and releases their FXRP collateral, completing the cycle. This mechanism provides a capital-efficient way for XRP holders to unlock liquidity from their assets without needing to sell them, offering flexibility and new strategic opportunities within DeFi. What Are the Benefits and Implications of This XRP Stablecoin? The launch of an XRP stablecoin protocol by Enosys brings several significant advantages and implications, not just for individual users but for the broader cryptocurrency market: Enhanced Liquidity and Utility for XRP: This protocol significantly boosts XRP’s utility. Holders can now use their XRP as productive collateral in DeFi, accessing stablecoin liquidity without divesting their core asset. This can lead to increased demand and new use cases for XRP. Stability in a Volatile Market: The stablecoin offers users a reliable medium of exchange, shielded from the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. This stability is crucial for payments, remittances, and long-term financial planning within the decentralized world, particularly for those looking to avoid frequent conversions to fiat. Broader DeFi Integration: This development firmly embeds XRP within the decentralized finance landscape. It opens doors for XRP to interact with a wider array of DeFi applications and protocols on the Flare network, fostering greater interoperability and innovation. Showcasing Flare’s Potential: The successful deployment of such a complex protocol highlights the robust capabilities of the Flare network as a platform for sophisticated DeFi solutions. This can attract more developers, projects, and users to its ecosystem, driving further growth. New Financial Primitives: By creating an XRP-backed stablecoin, Enosys is introducing a new financial primitive that can be composed with other DeFi protocols, leading to novel financial products and services. While the benefits are clear, it is important for users to understand the risks associated with collateralized debt positions, such as liquidation risk if the collateral value drops significantly. However, the foundational design aims to mitigate these risks through established DeFi best practices like overcollateralization and transparent oracle feeds for price data. Navigating the Future of Decentralized Finance with XRP The introduction of the Enosys XRP stablecoin protocol represents a forward-thinking step in the evolution of decentralized finance. It exemplifies how specific cryptocurrencies, often seen as payment-focused, can be integrated into sophisticated DeFi structures, offering both stability and utility. This protocol not only empowers XRP holders but also enriches the entire Flare ecosystem by adding a crucial financial primitive. This innovation aligns with the broader trend of expanding collateral options in DeFi, moving beyond just a few dominant assets. It signifies a maturation of the ecosystem, where more diverse assets can unlock their potential value in a decentralized, permissionless manner. As the DeFi space continues to mature, solutions like Enosys’s XRP-collateralized stablecoin will play a vital role in expanding accessibility and fostering greater financial inclusion. It’s a testament to the ongoing innovation that drives the crypto market forward, creating new possibilities for digital assets. Conclusion: A New Horizon for XRP in DeFi Enosys’s launch of an XRP-collateralized stablecoin protocol is more than just a new product; it’s a significant milestone for both XRP and the Flare network. By providing a secure and innovative way to leverage XRP’s value for stability and liquidity, Enosys is paving the way for enhanced utility and broader adoption within decentralized finance. This development underscores the dynamic potential of the crypto world to continuously innovate and create value for its users, marking a truly exciting chapter for the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Enosys? A1: Enosys is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Flare network. It aims to bring advanced financial services, such as stablecoin minting, to various cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is FXRP? A2: FXRP is the wrapped version of XRP on the Flare network. It allows native XRP to be utilized within Flare’s smart contract ecosystem, enabling participation in DeFi protocols like Enosys. Q3: How is the Enosys stablecoin collateralized? A3: The Enosys stablecoin is collateralized by FXRP. Users deposit FXRP into the protocol to mint the stablecoin, with the FXRP acting as a secure backing for the stable asset. Q4: What are the main benefits for XRP holders using this protocol? A4: XRP holders can unlock liquidity from their assets without selling them, gain access to a stable medium of exchange for DeFi activities, and increase XRP’s utility within the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. Q5: Are there risks associated with using an XRP-collateralized stablecoin protocol? A5: Yes, like all DeFi protocols, there are risks, primarily liquidation risk if the value of the FXRP collateral drops significantly below the required ratio.

Bitcoin Cash Has Seen A Spike In Positive/Negative Sentiment In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin Cash. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the ratio between the positive and negative comments related to BCH that are currently present on the major social media platforms. Related Reading: PEPE Gearing Up For Triangle Breakout: Is A 78% Move Coming? The metric separates posts/threads/messages into bullish or bearish by putting them through a machine-learning model. Once they have been divided, it counts up the number of each and calculates their ratio to find the net sentiment on social media. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for Bitcoin Cash over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Cash Positive/Negative Sentiment fell to a low of 0.13 earlier in the month. Such a value corresponds to there being just 0.13 bullish comments for every bearish post. Thus, it would appear that social media traders were heavily leaning toward a negative outcome for BCH. Interestingly, what followed the market disbelief was a surge in the coin’s price to the $650 level for the first time since April 2024, around 17 months ago. This pattern is something that has actually been seen many times throughout the past. “Historically, prices move the opposite of the crowd’s expectations,” notes the analytics firm. This means that an excess of bearish sentiment tends to be a buy signal for the cryptocurrency, while overexcitement can lead to a top. While BCH initially observed the former type of effect, market balance quickly shifted, and it’s now facing the latter part of the pattern. From the chart, it’s visible that the sharp rally in the coin brought with it a huge spike in the Positive/Negative Sentiment to the 2.3 level. Bitcoin Cash has witnessed its price drop by around 6.7% since this dominance in bullish sentiment has emerged. It now remains to be seen how the market will react to the pullback and whether another shift in the Positive/Negative Sentiment would follow. Naturally, a pivot back to the bearish zone could help stabilize the price decline.

On Friday, the social networking service confirmed that the scam was associated with bigger criminal groups. A number of those accounts were suspended for crypto scams and platform manipulation. The company emphasized cooperating closely with law enforcement agencies in the investigation. In its announcement, the company noted that the scheme was uncovered with the help of blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which enabled investigators to track the perpetrators. X added that the suspended accounts attempted to bribe staff at social networks and payment providers through middlemen to restore their access. These were not individuals “acting alone,” the company said. They are affiliated with groups filling multiple online spheres beyond X, including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Minecraft, and Roblox. The methods typically include some form of crypto fraud, phishing, or other online manipulation. FBI is monitoring hacker group ‘The Com’ The bribe circle is connected to a network of hackers called The Com , which the FBI has identified and is monitoring. The agency said in July that The Com was a “growing and evolving online threat group” comprised largely of minors. The FBI said the group had grown increasingly sophisticated in the past four years. They are believed to be using sophisticated techniques to hide their identities, obscure financial transactions, and launder money. Their work ranges from cybercrime to fraud to trolling on online platforms. Bribery isn’t new to cybercrime cases. In May, United States authorities said hackers had sought to bribe Coinbase employees to help with an attack to gain access to confidential customer data. The overlap illustrates how insider threats and dollar signs can often subvert security systems. Crypto scams have beset X for years as the platform is an easy target. While Jack Dorsey still owned it in 2020, Twitter fell victim to one of its most severe breaches. Hackers hijacked accounts of people and companies, including former President Barack Obama, Apple, Uber, and Kanye West, using them to post messages that urged people to send money to a Bitcoin account. Scammers last year infiltrated several high-profile accounts to promote a Solana-based meme token. Among the victims were Lenovo’s division in India, the film director Oliver Stone, and the Brazilian soccer player Neymar Jr. These cases highlight the ongoing scourge of crypto fraud on major social platforms. They use more ingenious schemes, taking on insider conspiracy, bribery, and cross-platform operation methods instead of straightforward phishing. Criminal networks exploit corruption to evade bans The exposure of the bribery network highlights two urgent concerns: the vulnerability of insiders to corruption and the growing sophistication of organized cybercrime. Allowing scammers to buy their way back onto platforms undermines trust in content moderation and threatens overall platform safety. It is also a sign that online con artists are diversifying their tactics. They are no longer simply scamming from afar. They are actively working to undermine the system from the inside. X has committed to improving internal controls and increasing protections against insider threats. The company said it would work with law enforcement to continue prosecuting those responsible. At the same time, US authorities hope to intensify pressure on groups like The Com, which are now viewed as a combative force putting digital security at risk. The investigation remains open, and more arrests or indictments could come. With social media and crypto deeply intertwined, experts warn that we can expect to see more of these schemes unless platforms batten down the hatches and their employees have a stronger defense against bribery attempts.

The company said the update is available to download now, and according to Apple, it delivers a completely redesigned look called Liquid Glass, plus new tools like live translation, updated Messages effects, and a feature that saves your spot in line when you’re put on hold. Apple Intelligence also gained new abilities, but the much-talked-about smarter Siri is still not here. The software had been tested since June in beta form. Testers noted from the start that Liquid Glass would be the most obvious change, with the interface replacing flat designs with transparent, glass-like surfaces. Every feature in the new system was fine-tuned over the months leading up to release, and Apple is presenting iOS 26 as one of the most significant visual updates in years. Apple releases Liquid Glass design Liquid Glass alters the way menus, icons, and backgrounds appear. Menus now shine with a transparent window effect, while app icons have been turned into frosted tiles with faint colors. Even third-party apps had their logos reshaped into this design. Apple showed the way Liquid Glass reacts when touched. In Apple Music, a droplet moves between tabs as users tap them. Scrolling bends and twists the background image behind the menus, producing a refracted look. Users can make icons fully transparent, which allows wallpapers to show clearly. This Clear option is accessible by holding down on the home screen, tapping Edit, then Customize. Clear is available in both Light and Dark modes. Apple tested different versions of Liquid Glass during the beta, sometimes brightening the effect, sometimes making it more subtle. The company settled on a balance between clarity and usability. But the new transparency makes text harder to read for some people. Settings offer fixes for this problem. In Accessibility > Display & Text Size, the Reduce Transparency toggle decreases see-through visuals, while Increase Contrast thickens borders and strengthens backgrounds. Movement in Liquid Glass can also be reduced. In Accessibility > Motion, a Reduce Motion option removes the bouncing and wiggling of elements. But switching this on disables other animations across the system. The company said these adjustments were added to make sure people who dislike the effects can scale them back. Despite all the design changes, the way the phone functions stays the same. iOS 26 also expands functionality. Live translation lets users break language barriers without needing an app. Messages gained new visual effects, and the on-hold feature keeps your place in line when calling customer service. These features are included across the update and are live today. Chats now come with background customization. Users can open a conversation, tap the participant’s name or the group chat title, then select the Backgrounds tab. Six options are included. Photo allows images from the device’s photo library. Playground generates original artwork using Apple Intelligence. Color, Sky, Water, and Aurora are animated designs that move gently while you chat, and each has variations. But these backgrounds can only be applied if the other person is saved in Contacts.

This is a huge milestone for the XRP ecosystem, further cementing its position in DeFi and driving utility beyond remittances. Under the new system , XRP holders can borrow stablecoins without selling their tokens. Its model operates under a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) scheme, wherein users lock FXRP (wrapped XRP) or Flare’s native token wFLR as collateral. In return, they create a stablecoin class of cryptocurrency tied closely to the dollar. The model would allow investors to maintain long-term XRP exposure and enjoy liquidity for everyday purchases. In this way, they can use stablecoins to trade, lend, or make payments within DeFi. Flare’s Time Series Oracle (FTSO) feeds the price for collateral and stablecoins. This decentralized oracle provides transparency and stability, guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the market. The borrowing system is also accompanied by a stability pool, which keeps track of the stablecoin peg and covers liquidations. Users participating in the pool receive rewards from fees, liquidations, and interest payments. This incentive forms a self-regulating equilibrium between risk and rewards in the network. After launch, collateral is issued with FXRP and wFLR, which will soon change and support stXRP, adding to collateral flexibility. That means token holders can stake their XRP for yield, yet still use those staked assets as collateral for stablecoin loans. Users gain rewards and utility Enosys Loans goes beyond creating a stablecoin by introducing a broader incentive model within the Flare ecosystem. Borrowers and stability providers can earn reward Flare tokens (rFLR), which adds another layer of motivation for users to engage with and adopt the platform. Another distinctive feature is the ability for borrowers to set their own borrowing rate, but this flexibility comes with trade-offs. Loans taken at lower rates carry greater risk if the stablecoin loses its peg, since they are the first to be redeemed during correction events. This design balances individual choice with the need to maintain overall stability in the system. Everything Blockchain, a U.S. company, has already used Flare’s XRP DeFi framework to handle its crypto treasury. This early adoption is a strong vote of confidence for the platform and its capabilities to support real-world use cases. XRP-backed stablecoin unlocks new DeFi use cases The launch comes at a time of significant growth for the XRP Ledger, with data from XRPScan showing that the number of active accounts has recently surpassed 7 million, a clear indication of rising adoption and expanding activity across the network. XRP is primarily a payment token and bridge currency used in cross-border transactions . An XRP-denominated stablecoin provides new ways for holders to interact with the financial system, which is exactly what comes into sight when using the coin. This move now makes XRP available to be used not only as a payments asset but also as collateral for DeFi markets that run seamlessly worldwide. And finally, it solidifies a bridge between XRPL and Flare ecosystems, expanding the flexibility of investment in XRP for investors, developers, and institutions. The innovation also tackles one of the continual issues in crypto markets, selling tokens to obtain liquidity. Instead of selling, holders could borrow against their XRP, spend or invest stablecoins, and still profit from any rises in price in the underlying tokens. Enosys Loans is a prototype of the first on-chain debt protocol, backed by XRP. Its structure is built on the stability of Liquity V2 with the decentralization from Flare, bringing about a secure, efficient, and incentivizing borrowing system. If it finds adoption, XRP-backed stablecoins might play a part in expanding the use of digital assets in finance, trade, and Dapps. The achievement also paves the way to experimentation with Flare’s interoperability framework, bringing XRP into other ecosystems. Get seen where it counts.

The case, which was thrown out less than a week after it was filed, isn’t completely dead yet — the judge gave Trump four weeks to come back with a shorter and more focused complaint. But Judge Steven Merryday made it very clear: cut the noise or don’t come back at all. The lawsuit, which was supposed to target alleged defamation, instead ballooned into an 85-page rant. Judge Merryday pointed out that only the final pages actually mentioned the legal claims, while the bulk of it was filled with praise for Trump and attacks on his enemies. “Superfluous allegations” was the phrase he used. The court didn’t waste time ripping the case apart, saying it read more like a speech at a rally than a serious legal document. Judge blasts filing and demands a professional rewrite Steven, who was appointed by George H.W. Bush, didn’t hold back in his order. He said the court is not a stage for venting frustrations. “As every lawyer knows (or is presumed to know), a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective — not a protected platform to rage against an adversary,” Steven wrote in the decision. He also said, “A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally or the functional equivalent of the Hyde Park Speakers’ Corner.” Trump’s legal team had named four New York Times reporters and Penguin Random House as defendants. Penguin got dragged in because of a book they published, Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success , written by Times reporters Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner. Trump’s lawyers claimed the book was filled with false and malicious statements meant to harm his image. Steven told Trump’s team they have 28 days to revise and resubmit the lawsuit. But this time, they’re under strict rules. The complaint must not exceed 40 pages, not including the caption, signature, or attachments. And the judge warned that the case will “begin, continue, and end” under procedural law — no more legal theater. Trump lashes out, reporters respond, case remains on life support During an Oval Office event, ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl confronted Trump with the news that the lawsuit had been dismissed. Trump didn’t take it well. “I’m winning, I’m winning the cases,” he said before turning his frustration directly at Karl. “You’re guilty, Jon, you’re guilty. ABC is a terrible network, a very unfair network, and you should be ashamed of yourself. NBC is equally bad. I don’t know who’s worse.” After the ruling, a spokesman for Trump’s legal team issued a statement to CNBC saying, “President Trump will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against The New York Times , its reporters, and Penguin Random House, in accordance with the judge’s direction on logistics.” The Times also responded to the court’s decision, saying, “We welcome the judge’s quick ruling, which recognized that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency space, you know that institutional players are increasingly seeking secure solutions for their digital holdings. This context makes the latest announcement about BitGo revenue particularly significant, revealing an astounding quadrupling of its first-half earnings. What’s Behind the Astounding BitGo Revenue Surge? Digital asset custodian BitGo has made headlines with its impressive financial performance. The company recorded a remarkable first-half revenue of $4.19 billion. This figure represents an incredible fourfold increase year-over-year, as reported by Reuters, highlighting a substantial expansion in its operations and market penetration. This dramatic growth underscores the increasing demand for secure digital asset custody solutions among institutional investors. Despite this revenue boom, it’s interesting to note that BitGo’s operating profit saw a decline, moving from $30.9 million to $12.6 million during the same period. This suggests significant reinvestment or increased operational costs associated with scaling. BitGo’s Crucial Role in Digital Asset Custody and Its Impact on BitGo Revenue As a leading digital asset custodian, BitGo plays a critical role in providing secure infrastructure for cryptocurrencies. Its services are essential for institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto market without compromising security. The surge in BitGo revenue directly reflects this growing trust and reliance on specialized custody providers. The company’s robust security measures and compliance framework attract a wide array of clients, from hedge funds to exchanges. Therefore, the significant increase in its top-line earnings is a strong indicator of broader institutional adoption of digital assets. Navigating Growth: BitGo’s Financials and Future Ambitions While the quadrupling of BitGo revenue is a clear win, the dip in operating profit warrants a closer look. This scenario is not uncommon for rapidly expanding companies that are investing heavily in infrastructure, talent, and new product development to capture market share. Such investments, while impacting short-term profitability, are often crucial for long-term sustainable growth and market leadership. Furthermore, BitGo previously submitted an S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO). This move signals the company’s ambition to become a publicly traded entity, potentially seeking to raise substantial capital to fuel further expansion and solidify its market position. An IPO would also bring increased transparency and regulatory scrutiny, which could further build trust among institutional clients. What Does This BitGo Revenue Boom Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The substantial growth in BitGo revenue is more than just a company success story; it offers valuable insights into the health and direction of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. It suggests a maturing market where professional and institutional money is flowing in, demanding enterprise-grade solutions for managing digital assets. This trend indicates: Increased Institutional Adoption: More traditional financial institutions are comfortable holding and managing cryptocurrencies. Demand for Security: The need for secure, compliant, and insured custody services is paramount. Market Maturation: The infrastructure supporting digital assets is becoming more sophisticated and robust. This positive indicator could encourage more cautious investors to explore digital assets, knowing that reputable custodians like BitGo are providing essential services. In conclusion, BitGo’s phenomenal quadrupling of its first-half BitGo revenue to $4.19 billion is a testament to the surging demand for institutional-grade digital asset custody. While its operating profit saw a temporary decline, this often reflects strategic investments aimed at future growth and market dominance. With an eye towards a potential IPO, BitGo is not only securing digital assets but also shaping the future landscape of cryptocurrency finance. This impressive performance underscores the ongoing institutionalization of the crypto market and highlights the critical role played by secure, reliable custodians. Frequently Asked Questions About BitGo’s Performance Here are some common questions regarding BitGo’s recent financial disclosures and its role in the digital asset space: What is BitGo, and what services does it provide? BitGo is a leading digital asset custodian that provides secure and compliant custody solutions for cryptocurrencies. It offers services like multi-signature wallets, institutional trading, and asset management for businesses and institutional investors. Why did BitGo’s operating profit decline even with a significant increase in BitGo revenue? A decline in operating profit amidst revenue growth often indicates substantial strategic investments. BitGo is likely investing heavily in expanding its infrastructure, technology, security measures, and team to meet growing demand and pursue its IPO ambitions, which can temporarily impact short-term profitability. What is the significance of BitGo’s S-1 filing with the SEC? The S-1 filing is a preliminary step for companies planning an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the U.S. It signifies BitGo’s intention to become a publicly traded company, aiming to raise capital and enhance its market presence and transparency within the traditional financial system. How does the growth in BitGo revenue reflect on the broader cryptocurrency market? The impressive growth in BitGo revenue is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption and confidence in digital assets. It highlights a maturing market where professional investors are seeking robust and secure solutions for managing their crypto holdings, suggesting a positive trend for the overall ecosystem. What are the benefits of using a digital asset custodian like BitGo? Using a custodian like BitGo provides enhanced security against hacks and theft, regulatory compliance, insurance, and professional management of digital assets. This is crucial for institutions that need to meet stringent security and regulatory requirements. We hope this deep dive into BitGo’s impressive financial performance has shed light on the evolving digital asset landscape.

SOL is trading near $240 , with traders anticipating that institutional access through ETFs could propel the token toward new highs. Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, continues to hold steady at around $0.83 , supported by whale accumulation and a resilient developer community. Yet while SOL and ADA remain strong contenders, investors are increasingly looking toward projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has been hitting milestone after milestone and building momentum that could rival ETF-driven surges. Why Solana ETF Hype is Important The possibility of a Solana ETF has been one of the hottest topics this season. ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum have already proven successful, drawing billions in inflows and helping establish crypto as a mainstream asset class. If Solana follows suit, analysts expect demand to rise sharply, as institutional players gain easier access to the token. Technically, SOL has reclaimed major support zones and is eyeing resistance near $260–$280 . Breaking through could open the door to fresh all-time highs, especially if ETF approval arrives sooner than expected. The combination of speculation and technical strength is keeping sentiment high, with many traders treating Solana as the next big ETF-driven opportunity. ADA’s Steady Position Cardano continues to hold its place as a trusted Layer-1 blockchain. Trading near $0.83 , ADA has been buoyed by renewed whale activity and progress on its Hydra scaling solution. Cardano’s emphasis on sustainability, transparency, and governance makes it attractive to long-term holders, even if its price action is slower than more volatile competitors. Analysts expect ADA to remain a consistent performer, with potential upside toward $2 if broader market conditions improve. While ADA is unlikely to deliver the same explosive multiples as a smaller-cap token, it provides stability and exposure to one of the most engaged communities in crypto. Building Momentum Through Milestones While SOL and ADA are benefiting from institutional and whale support, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been carving its own path by consistently achieving major milestones. From surpassing funding targets to securing independent audits and building a rapidly growing community, each stage of its development has reinforced confidence in its trajectory. What makes this noteworthy is the speed of its progress. While Solana requires ETF approvals and ADA relies on incremental upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already demonstrated the ability to deliver results quickly. This kind of momentum often signals the potential for breakout performance once the token hits major exchanges. For many investors, it represents a chance to capture gains at an earlier stage than what’s possible with SOL or ADA. The comparison is striking: SOL’s growth depends on regulators, ADA’s depends on adoption pace, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is already proving its capacity to meet ambitious goals ahead of schedule. That milestone-driven momentum is why analysts see it as a candidate to outperform established names in percentage terms. Comparing Upside Potential Solana’s ETF narrative could easily drive another leg higher, but its large market cap means upside will likely be measured in multiples rather than exponential surges. ADA offers steady growth and long-term credibility, but its conservative pace means it won’t deliver life-changing returns in a single cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, still has the kind of early-stage positioning that allows for exponential growth. With each milestone achieved, it builds credibility and draws more investors into the fold, creating a compounding effect. While risk remains higher at this stage, the potential rewards are also significantly greater. For those looking to diversify, pairing SOL and ADA with a smaller allocation to MAGACOIN provides exposure to both safety and high-risk, high-reward upside. Conclusion Solana’s ETF speculation is injecting optimism into the market, and ADA continues to offer steady long-term exposure. But for those chasing breakout performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving itself through milestone-driven momentum that could rival the gains of larger tokens. If it continues on this trajectory, it may not just complement established altcoins—it could outperform them in the cycle ahead.

Nasdaq-listed Faraday Future (FFAI), known for its ambitious electric vehicle plans, is making a bold leap into the burgeoning world of Web3 and cryptocurrency. This exciting move, centered around a strategic partnership, signals a new era for the company and potentially for how we view vehicle manufacturers interacting with digital assets. Let’s dive into what this Faraday Future crypto initiative means. What’s Driving Faraday Future’s Crypto Ambition? Faraday Future has officially announced its entry into the cryptocurrency and Web3 sectors. This isn’t a solo journey; they’re teaming up with fellow Nasdaq-listed firm Qualigen Therapeutics (QLGN). This collaboration isn’t just about exploring new technologies; it involves a significant financial commitment. Faraday Future has led a substantial $41 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) into Qualigen. This investment highlights the seriousness of their commitment to this new digital frontier. The PIPE round saw participation from several high-profile investors, signaling strong market confidence in this strategic direction. Key participants included: Binance Labs Sequoia Capital IDG Such prominent names indicate a belief in the long-term potential of this Faraday Future crypto partnership. How Will Qualigen Therapeutics Transform for Web3? To fully embrace its new role in the Web3 space, Qualigen Therapeutics plans a significant rebranding. Pending shareholder approval, the company intends to change its name to CXC10. This rebranding is more than just a name change; it represents a strategic pivot towards a future deeply integrated with decentralized technologies and digital economies. This shift will likely see CXC10 focusing on developing solutions and services within the Web3 ecosystem, potentially leveraging blockchain technology for various applications. The synergy between an electric vehicle innovator like Faraday Future and a rebranded Web3-focused entity like CXC10 could lead to groundbreaking developments. Imagine decentralized identity for vehicles, blockchain-based supply chain management, or even crypto payments for charging and services.

A wallet linked to Arca has recently made substantial Arca crypto investments , accumulating a remarkable $10.7 million worth of ENA and IMX tokens. This strategic accumulation, first reported by AmberCN, highlights Arca’s calculated approach to the evolving digital asset landscape. What Sparked These Arca Crypto Investments? Over the past six hours, the wallet presumed to be associated with Arca received a hefty $6.16 million worth of IMX from Flowdesk. Furthermore, it acquired $4.54 million worth of ENA directly from Binance. These transactions indicate a clear and deliberate strategy by Arca to bolster its holdings in these specific digital assets. Such large-scale movements by an institutional player like Arca often signal a bullish outlook on the chosen tokens. Arca is known for its deep research and sophisticated investment strategies in the digital asset space. Therefore, these recent acquisitions are not merely speculative; they likely stem from a thorough analysis of ENA and IMX’s potential. IMX (ImmutableX): A leading Layer 2 scaling solution for NFTs and Web3 gaming on Ethereum. ENA (Ethena): The governance token for Ethena Labs, which offers USDe, a synthetic dollar protocol. Understanding the Potential of ENA and IMX Why would Arca focus its substantial Arca crypto investments on ENA and IMX? Both tokens represent key areas of innovation and growth within the blockchain ecosystem. ImmutableX, with its focus on scaling Web3 games, addresses a critical need for high-throughput and low-cost transactions in the rapidly expanding gaming sector. Its technology enables developers to build and scale games with true digital ownership, attracting a significant user base and developer community. Ethena, on the other hand, is at the forefront of creating a scalable, censorship-resistant synthetic dollar. Its USDe stablecoin aims to provide a crypto-native solution that is independent of traditional banking infrastructure. This innovation has garnered considerable attention, positioning ENA as a governance token for a potentially disruptive financial primitive. Arca’s decision to invest heavily in these projects suggests a belief in their long-term viability and potential to capture significant market share. What Do These Arca Crypto Investments Mean for the Market? Institutional accumulation often acts as a strong bullish signal for the broader market. When a reputable firm like Arca makes such substantial Arca crypto investments , it can inspire confidence among retail investors and other institutional players. This can lead to increased demand and potentially positive price action for ENA and IMX. Moreover, Arca’s involvement can bring more visibility and legitimacy to these projects. It signals that these tokens are not just speculative assets but have fundamental value and potential for future growth. The move also highlights the increasing sophistication of institutional participation in the crypto market, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to explore promising altcoins. Key takeaways from this development include: Increased Confidence: Arca’s backing can boost investor trust in ENA and IMX. Market Momentum: Potential for positive price movements as more investors take notice. Strategic Vision: Arca’s focus on Web3 gaming and synthetic dollars reflects key trends. The Strategic Vision Behind Arca’s Digital Asset Play Arca’s reputation as a pioneer in digital asset management is well-established. Their team comprises seasoned financial professionals with deep expertise in both traditional finance and blockchain technology. These latest Arca crypto investments align with their philosophy of identifying early-stage projects with strong fundamentals and significant growth potential. Their active management style often involves taking substantial positions in projects they believe will shape the future of finance and technology. By accumulating ENA and IMX, Arca is not just buying tokens; they are investing in the underlying narratives of scalable Web3 infrastructure and decentralized stablecoin solutions. This long-term perspective is crucial in the volatile crypto market. In conclusion, Arca’s $10.7 million accumulation of ENA and IMX tokens is a compelling development in the crypto space. It underscores the growing institutional interest in innovative altcoins and provides a strong vote of confidence in the future prospects of ImmutableX and Ethena. As the digital asset market continues to mature, strategic moves by firms like Arca will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its trajectory.

In a podcast interview on Friday, Steve told Sean Spicer that Scott should take over from Jerome Powell as Fed chair next year but still stay on as Treasury Secretary. The episode’s footage was obtained by CNBC’s Eamon Javers. “I am a big believer that on an interim basis, that Scott Bessent should be both the head of the Federal Reserve and the secretary of Treasury, and maybe get through the midterm elections, step down at Treasury and take over the Federal Reserve,” Steve said. Scott is already heading the search for Powell’s replacement when his term ends in May 2026. He was once thought to be a candidate himself, but publicly said he’s fine staying at Treasury. That hasn’t stopped Steve from pushing the idea anyway. Steve lasted only seven months as Trump’s White House strategist before getting fired. Still, he’s close to Trump and clearly feels comfortable tossing out these kinds of proposals. The White House, on the other hand, isn’t amused. “Such an arrangement is not being and has never been considered by the White House,” a spokesman said. The idea was immediately shut down. White House rejects plan as Scott leads search for Powell’s replacement There’s no real example of this happening before. Before the Banking Act of 1935, the Treasury Secretary did sit on the Fed’s board, but the chair role wasn’t created until later. Janet Yellen ran the Fed and then the Treasury, but those jobs were years apart. Scott doing both at once — even if temporary — would break that mold completely. Right now, Scott is running the process to find Powell’s successor. Reports say there are 11 names on the list. He was once on it too, until he said he wasn’t interested. Still, Steve thinks Scott should hold both posts until midterms, then leave Treasury and stay on as Fed boss. It’s not clear if anyone else in Trump’s circle supports that plan. Trump has repeatedly slammed the Fed for not slashing interest rates more. He wants a Fed that moves fast — his way. That pressure could be why Steve wants someone loyal like Scott at the top. But making him do both jobs, even for a few months, would raise serious legal, policy, and political questions. Fed’s Miran dismisses tariff inflation and calls for deeper rate cuts While Steve is pushing personnel moves, Fed Governor Stephen Miran is focused on policy. He voted against the Fed’s decision this week to cut rates by 0.25%. He wanted a 0.5% cut instead. Speaking on CNBC’s “Money Movers” Friday, Miran said he doesn’t think Trump’s tariffs will cause inflation. “I’m clearly in the minority in not being concerned about inflation from tariffs,” Miran said. “But that was also true in 2018-2019, and I think I probably could take a little victory lap about that.” He said he hasn’t seen any real evidence that tariffs are pushing up prices. “If you thought tariffs are driving inflation higher, you’d think imports would be differentially inflating at a higher pace,” he said. Miran also said the difference between inflation in U.S. core goods and other countries is tiny. “If I thought that tariffs were driving any material inflation in the United States, I’d look for evidence,” he added. Even so, the Fed’s own data says inflation is still above 2%, and might not fall back to target until 2028. Only Miran wanted the Fed to move faster on cutting rates.

51995928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=813475,1758333068,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51995928.jpeg,BitGo reveals fourfold revenue surge in US IPO filing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitgo-reveals-fourfold-revenue-surge/,"Crypto custody firm BitGo has unveiled plans to go public in the United States after reporting a sharp surge in revenue. The company’s initial public offering (IPO) filing highlights that its revenue nearly quadrupled in the first half of 2025, underscoring the accelerating growth of the digital asset sector. According to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, BitGo generated $4.19 billion in revenue for the six months ending June 30, 2025, up from $1.12 billion during the same period a year earlier. However, profit went the other way, with net income declining to $12.6 million, compared with $30.9 million a year earlier. Analysts said the decline indicates growing costs as the company grows to supply demand from institutional clients. BitGo, founded in 2013, is one of the largest crypto-custody companies in the United States. It focuses on storing and protecting digital assets for institutions. As mainstream custody has soared in popularity, investors new to the space see services such as BitGo’s as necessary. The company’s last known valuation was $1.75 billion in a 2023 funding round. BitGo to join IPO frenzy in crypto industry BitGo plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the “BTGO.” Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are leading underwriters, signaling Wall Street’s intense interest in digital asset infrastructure . Its IPO arrived as the U.S. market picked up again following months of sluggishness in early 2025. Analysts predict the drop will be among the busiest periods for IPOs since 2021. However, unlike in previous years, the new wave is driven by crypto firms, which are now driving broader market activity. Stablecoin issuer Circle , trading platform Bullish, and blockchain lender Figure have all made their stock market debuts this year. Both have captured strong first-day receptions, indicating that investors might be warming to the stocks of companies involved in cryptocurrencies. Their performances have engendered confidence that demand extends beyond retail traders, deep into institutional portfolios. Factors driving this momentum, according to market experts, are numerous. Wins in Washington on the regulatory front have provided more certainty about how digital assets will be treated and reduced the fear of abrupt policy changes. Over time, the approval and expansion of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have ushered in billions of dollars worth of inflows, cementing digital currencies as components of mainstream investment portfolios. “When it comes to digital assets, investors are now treating them as another asset class, not just something in the fantasy world where people can make billions of dollars every day,” said Josef Schuster, founder and chief executive officer of IPO research firm IPOX. The change in mindset has prompted large investment banks to pursue closer relationships with crypto firms, be it through direct investments or underwriting IPOs. The clustering of crypto listings also plays a role in redrawing the narrative around the IPO market itself. Where technology or health care companies had once reigned over splashy debuts, digital asset companies are now coming to the fore. For BitGo, this rush of optimism is a well-timed backdrop to capitalize on increasing investor enthusiasm for companies that can handle infrastructure and security in the sector. Crypto inches closer to the mainstream of finance BitGo’s decision to seek a public listing indicates how much crypto has penetrated the financial mainstream. Though it was once dismissed as a fringe experiment, the industry now boasts billions in funding from institutional investment and increasingly ambitious regulations. The steep revenue increase indicates increasing confidence in crypto infrastructure, particularly its custody vehicle, which secures the safety of assets for large investors. However, the drop in profit illustrates the tightrope of scaling businesses while keeping margins from deteriorating. The BitGo IPO will provide investors with a litmus test for their belief that Wall Street has the fortitude (screw the tolerance) to back crypto infrastructure companies, which return value over the long term. Its performance could affect how regulators, institutions, and retail traders think about future similar listings. If it succeeds, the offering could prompt other crypto companies to go public, cementing digital assets in global finance.

A safety driver will sit in the front seat while the cars run on their own. This move shows Tesla is getting ready to take its robotaxi program beyond Austin. The company told Arizona officials it wants to start in the Phoenix area. It reached out to the Arizona Department of Transportation back in late June to begin this process, and that’s when the permit application started rolling. According to Bloomberg, Tesla applied for two different kinds of permits — one for testing with a driver, and one for testing without one. But if it plans to start giving rides to the public, it still needs to get a transportation network license. That’s the same type of license Uber and Lyft need to operate in the state. So while the greenlight is a big win, it’s not the final step. Tesla adds Arizona after Texas and Nevada This makes Arizona the third state where Tesla is allowed to test these robotaxis. Texas and Nevada already gave the company the go-ahead, with Nevada granting its permit just earlier this month. Tesla first launched its robotaxi service in Austin back in June, but only for a small group of early users. In late July, Tesla quietly opened access to the robotaxi app in the Bay Area too. Still, none of these cars are fully driverless. They’re all using an unreleased version of Tesla’s Full Self Driving software, and there’s always a safety monitor sitting behind the wheel, ready to take over. Investors are watching every step. The market wants to know how fast Tesla can expand this network and actually turn it into a business. Right now, the cars aren’t completely autonomous, and there’s no confirmed date for when Tesla will try to remove the safety driver. But the pieces are clearly being put in place. Stock rebounds as Musk buys $1 billion in shares Tesla’s stock price has been through hell this year, but it’s finally turned around. After a rough first quarter, the worst since 2022, and a bloody April triggered by Trump’s tariff announcement, the shares have now jumped back into the green. They closed the week up 5.2%, ending Friday at $426. That’s more than $26 higher than Tesla’s last close in 2024. Since hitting a low of $221.86 in early April, the stock has gained 85%. A new SEC filing shows that Elon Musk, through his family foundation, just bought $1 billion worth of shares. That news came out this week and added fuel to the rebound. This marks the second year in a row Tesla’s stock made a comeback after a rough Q1. Last year, shares dropped 29% from January to March, then rallied to end 2024 up 63%. At the same time, analysts are still eyeing Musk’s new pay package, which could bring him a staggering $1 trillion over the next ten years, if certain performance targets are met. That plan hasn’t been finalized yet, but it’s out there and making waves. Tesla also rolled out new MegaBlocks battery systems. These come prebuilt and are sold to businesses trying to save on energy costs or get more power from solar and wind. It’s part of Tesla’s plan to make money beyond just cars. Even after all this, Tesla is still the second-worst performing stock among the big tech names in 2025. Only Apple has done worse, with its shares down 5% so far this year. Tesla’s still dealing with weak sales, too. Its cars are getting old, and cheaper EVs from BYD in China are eating up more market share, as Cryptopolitan reported previously.

51996559,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/here-is-what-every-investor-should-do-in-a-crypto-bear-market/,1758333600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51996559.jpeg,Here is What Every Investor Should Do in a Crypto Bear Market,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/here-is-what-every-investor-should-do-in-a-crypto-bear-market/,"When prices start to crater, crowds of traders run for the hills in fear, selling into a market bottom. But history has also shown that, painful as they are, downturns in crypto can be among the richest moments for those who know what they are doing. But unlike traditional markets, crypto never sleeps and trades off narratives, as well as moves right now on innovation, or news around the world. Which is why bear markets are so volatile — and also a time when they can be fertile ground for disciplined investors who are ready rather than panicked. In past cycles, the money managers who took this longer-term approach rather than chasing quick rebounds tended to make the biggest gains when the bull market returned. Against that kind of backdrop, the humpbacked migration-type of big-game whale behavior, like seen on MAGACOIN FINANCE , is a signal that pro money has already been quietly positioning for what’s upcoming, regardless of whether retail follows their tempo or not. Focus on Fundamentals Bear markets separate the wheat from the chaff, revealing who is genuinely building utility and who was just hype. Investors would do well to monitor developer activity, real-world applications and active partnerships along with them. Strongly established, tech-backed cryptocurrencies with active communities have the best chances of weathering a storm and also making it against the upcoming bull cycle. Accumulate Gradually Finding the exact bottom is nearly impossible. Instead of waiting for the “perfect” entry, strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) allow steady accumulation over time. This approach lowers the emotional pressure of market timing and builds exposure at more favorable prices, preparing portfolios for recovery when optimism returns. Diversify Wisely Focusing on one token is exhilarating when the market is booming, but it can also be destructive during down cycles. Holding a blend of established assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside a curated selection of altcoins can be an effective approach to risk management, whilst retaining the opportunity for upside. Investor controls: A more diversified portfolio gives investors a financial safety net to weather the volatility while not being overexposed to one project’s fate. In a market where most tokens struggle to survive, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads, with giant whale transactions and mounting institutional interest. Analysts cite its expanding ecosystem, a community-driven approach to development, and enthusiasm among early investors. Others predicted that once market sentiment recovers, the project may offer outsized gain potential — MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the few altcoins to watch closely in hopes it will rebound stronger after a bearish period. Stay Liquid and Manage Risk Having a stable of assets or cash allows investors to capitalize on unexpected opportunities. Risk management tools — like position sizing and rebalancing strategies — limit the likelihood of catastrophic losses. Having a plan can help you avoid making fear-based decisions about what to do during market price swings and keep you calm. * Keep Learning and Building Conviction Bear markets provide time for study. It is also when the eventual winners are quietly building, often away from mainstream headlines. Identifying opportunities that range from decentralized finance to tokenized assets to AI-tied blockchain projects can help investors find opportunities before everyone else. Education begets conviction, which in turn helps investors hold rather than sell into weakness/have factor investing. Conclusion Because bear markets challenge patience and discipline in ways bull markets never do, the headlines are dominated by short-term pain, but the framework for the next cycle is usually being set in the longer term. By going back to basics, accumulating sensibly, diversifying, and identifying opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors cannot only avoid falling victim to profitability expectations in downturns but also thrive in the next period of growth.

51995985,585137,1758333616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51995985.jpeg,Here’s How Much Dogecoin Whales Bought In Only One Week,https://bitcoinist.com/how-much-dogecoin-whales-bought/,"Dogecoin has witnessed a strong uptick in whale accumulation this week, with large investors aggressively increasing their holdings. On-chain analytics platform Santiment reveals that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE have ramped up their balances this week, which is one of the most notable buying sprees in recent weeks. This accumulation coincided with Dogecoin’s push from $0.26 on September 15 to briefly crossing above the $0.28 level on September 18, suggesting that whale activity has been an important factor in the token’s latest rally. Whales Add About 1 Billion DOGE To Holdings According to Santiment’s data , whales in the balance category of 100 million to 1 billion DOGE boosted their combined holdings from 26.48 billion DOGE on September 15 to 27.39 billion DOGE by September 19. This means about 910 million DOGE were accumulated by these addresses in just four days, equivalent to over $250 million at the current price of Dogecoin. This increase in whale-controlled supply typically signals growing confidence in the asset while also reducing the liquidity available in open markets. The timing of these purchases points to a deliberate accumulation strategy as Dogecoin tested a local price support at $0.26. Whales purchasing hundreds of millions of tokens not only reduce available supply but also tend to encourage retail traders to follow suit. The scale of this accumulation appears to have had a direct impact on Dogecoin’s price action. Between September 15 and 18, Dogecoin rose from $0.26 to above $0.28, a rally of nearly 8% within three days. This rally was all on the action of whales alone, as Santiment data shows a corresponding holding decrease in the cohort of addresses holding between 10 million DOGE and 100 million DOGE tokens. Dogecoin Technical Analysis As it stands, Dogecoin’s ability to extend its rally will depend on how it holds above the $0.28 price level in the coming days. However, a bullish technical analysis that aligns with this whale accumulation trend suggests that Dogecoin is now on track to new all-time highs. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade confirmed that Dogecoin’s weekly chart has broken out of a long-standing symmetrical triangle pattern. According to him, last week’s candle close validates the breakout and establishes a 1:29 risk-to-reward trading opportunity. The symmetrical triangle setup points to a strong trend continuation after a series of higher lows and lower highs since September 2025 that has now resolved upward. Interestingly, Trader Tardigrade predicted a rally that would see Dogecoin break above its current all-time high. Particularly, the analyst predicted that Dogecoin could rally as high as $1.7 if the breakout follows through.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Santiment|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 02:00:16

The team activated ASTER/USDT perpetuals with four-times margin and hourly funding rate settlements. The platform also introduced a Genesis Stage 2 scoring program that rewards more than just raw trading volume, aiming to favor what it calls “smart traders.” Top users have been reported to show realized gains greater than $645,000 in early trading sessions. Technical Features And Security Aster has positioned itself as a multi-chain protocol with native support across BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum, removing the need for manual bridging for many flows, according to technical notes. The protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs on its own Aster Chain for trade validation and taps Pyth Network oracles for price feeds. Reports show the platform uses collateral tokens like asBNB and USDF that can be staked to earn yield while remaining active in trading. Related Reading: From $2 Trillion To $400T?

With the September 17-18 FOMC meeting fast approaching, markets are almost unanimous: a 25 basis point rate cut is expected, with whispers of a more aggressive 50 bps move if labor data continues to soften. Inflation remains sticky, CPI held at 2.9% year-over-year in August , with core inflation still high, but momentum is clearly shifting toward easing. Weak job growth (only ~22,000 jobs added in August) and rising unemployment (now ~4.3%) have added to the pressure. Crypto traders are watching closely. Why? Because lower interest rates tend to make risk assets more attractive, and altcoins are first in line when capital seeks higher returns. As Bitcoin and Ethereum hold territory, many investors believe the next leg up might come from lesser-known names and presales. In that environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a focal point in speculative flows, its presale momentum, scarcity mechanics, and growing community chatter positioning it as a potential breakout when policy shifts drop. Fed Cuts, Markets, and Altcoin Sentiment The broader macroeconomic backdrop is shifting. Analysts and economists are broadly in line that the Fed will deliver a rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The IMF, for one, has opined that the Fed has scope to ease amid signs of labor-market softness. The weakening labor reports, slower job creation and uptick in unemployment, have helped prompt a reevaluation of risk asset potential. Crypto is reacting. Whales are building positions ahead of CPI releases and Fed decisions; volatility (as seen in VIX futures spreads) is signaling that traders expect increased turbulence post-Fed, but also that upside is being priced in before the cut. Ethereum and Bitcoin are steadying, preserving support zones, while many altcoins are seeing small inflows of interest, particularly from risk-tolerant capital. Some strategists argue a historic altcoin boom could follow, akin to late 2024’s surge, provided this rate cut acts as a trigger, liquidity enters, and macro pressures don’t snap back. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum & Speculative Positioning In the midst of all this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most watched presales. According to recent announcements, its presale rounds are closing faster than projected, reflecting growing demand. Each stage of its presale is designed with scarcity in mind, later rounds have reduced token allocations, rewarding early participants who lock in at lower prices. Its visibility is also rising: Bitcoin and XRP communities are increasingly including MAGACOIN FINANCE in their altcoin outlooks, highlighting a shift from being a niche presale project to one discussed alongside more established names. Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to other presale projects like BlockDAG and Remittix, noting its combination of community strength, scarcity mechanics, and presale performance as key differentiators. What makes its timing especially interesting is how presale momentum is aligning with macro signals: as traders brace for what many expect to be a Fed rate cut, speculative flows tend to accelerate. The belief is that once easier money starts flowing, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which already have momentum and scarcity, could benefit disproportionately, early entry becomes highly leveraged in such environments. Risks to the Boom Narrative & Altcoin Vulnerabilities Despite the optimism, several risk factors could derail or muddy expectations. First: inflation remains above target in many categories, and if the Fed signals caution (e.g. tight rhetoric, hesitance to commit to multiple cuts), markets could react with disappointment. Second: bond yields are creeping upward in many tenors, a rise in yields tends to reduce the appeal of risk-assets, including altcoins, especially those without strong fundamentals or clear roadmaps. Third, macroeconomic shocks (geopolitical risks, supply chain issues, energy price shocks) could force the Fed to pause or reverse easing. Also, liquidity isn’t guaranteed; even with rate cuts, capital flows depend heavily on sentiment, regulatory clarity, and market structure. Presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE must also execute properly, delays, security issues, or exchange listing problems could trigger negative feedback. Finally, post-Fed volatility is almost baked in the cake; VIX futures point to higher expected turbulence in October compared to September. If markets get too euphoric pre-Fed, there could be sharp corrections once the decision lands or if forward guidance disappoints. What Traders Are Watching: Indicators & Levels To assess whether the altcoin boom is real and sustainable, traders are focusing on: Fed Communication & Dot Plots : Will Powell and the FOMC signal a single cut, or multiple cuts through end-2025? The updated projections will matter. Inflation Data (CPI & Core CPI) : If inflation shows further cooling, odds of more aggressive easing increase. If it surprises upward, markets may temper expectations. Labor Market Reports : Job growth, unemployment, wage inflation. Weakness here supports more dovish policy. Whale Activity & Presale Fill Rates : Which projects are attracting large holders? Presales closing fast? Are allocations tight? This tends to indicate strong speculative flows. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such case. Support/Resistance Zones in Alts : For Ethereum, Bitcoin, but also mid-caps and presale names. If ETH holds above ~$4,250 support and breaks resistance around $4,500, that could cascade into broader altcoin strength. Conclusion Traders everywhere are anticipating that the Fed’s next move could mark a turning point — not just for interest rates, but for altcoins. With a rate cut expected, inflation cooling slightly, and macro risks mounting, the mood is aligning for what many hope will be a historic altcoin boom. Amid this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising in prominence: strong presale rounds, shrinking supply per stage, and growing recognition across Bitcoin and XRP communities all signal it may be one of those breakout stories when liquidity floods in. While risks are real — inflation surprises, yield spikes, or regulatory headwinds could upset the script — the potential upside feels unusually compelling. If you believe that policy pivots drive momentum, and early speculative bets offer skewed returns, this moment is one to watch closely.

Two prominent whale addresses recently transferred a staggering $14.19 million worth of WLFI tokens to Binance. This kind of large-scale movement often signals potential shifts in market dynamics and warrants a closer look. What’s Behind the Recent WLFI Deposit on Binance? According to reports, two specific whale addresses collectively deposited 64.43 million WLFI tokens onto the Binance exchange. This massive transfer, valued at approximately $14.19 million, is a notable event for the WLFI ecosystem. Interestingly, these whale addresses initially acquired their tokens from an address starting with 0xA71, precisely on the day WLFI was first listed on exchanges. For those new to crypto, a “whale address” refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their actions, such as a significant WLFI deposit , can often influence market sentiment and price action due to the sheer volume of tokens they control. Why Does a Large WLFI Deposit by Whales Matter? When whales make such substantial moves, especially depositing tokens to an exchange, it typically sparks questions about their intentions. A large WLFI deposit could indicate several strategic possibilities: Potential Selling Pressure: One common reason for moving large amounts of tokens to an exchange is to prepare for selling. If these whales decide to offload their WLFI, it could introduce significant selling pressure, potentially leading to a price correction. Profit-Taking: Given that these tokens were received on WLFI’s listing day, the whales might be looking to realize substantial profits from their early investment. Strategic Rebalancing: Whales often manage diversified portfolios. This deposit could be part of a larger strategy to rebalance their holdings, moving capital into or out of WLFI. Providing Liquidity: Less commonly, but still possible, they might be contributing to liquidity pools or engaging in other financial activities on the exchange. Understanding these potential motivations is crucial for investors trying to anticipate market movements. Navigating the Market After a Major WLFI Deposit The immediate aftermath of a significant WLFI deposit by whales often brings a period of increased volatility and uncertainty. Investors should consider several factors when interpreting such events: Monitor Price Action: Keep a close eye on WLFI’s price movements and trading volume on Binance. A sudden spike in selling volume could confirm a profit-taking scenario. Assess Market Sentiment: How are other investors reacting? Social media and crypto news outlets can offer insights into the prevailing sentiment. Look for Confirmation: A single deposit, while large, doesn’t always guarantee a sell-off. Subsequent transactions, such as actual sales or further deposits, would provide clearer signals. It’s always wise to approach such situations with caution and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a whale’s move. Thorough research remains paramount. What’s Next for WLFI After This Significant Deposit? The future trajectory of WLFI will depend heavily on how these whale addresses proceed with their deposited tokens. Will they sell? Will they hold? Or perhaps engage in other strategic maneuvers? The market will be watching closely for any further actions from these large holders. For WLFI holders and potential investors, this event underscores the importance of staying informed about significant on-chain movements. Whale activity is a powerful indicator, and while it doesn’t dictate the entire market, it certainly adds an element of intrigue and potential impact to WLFI’s journey. In conclusion, the recent $14.19 million WLFI deposit to Binance by two whale addresses is a significant development. It highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the profound influence large holders can exert. Whether this move precedes a period of selling or is part of a broader strategy, it serves as a crucial reminder for all participants to remain vigilant and well-informed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto whale? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, often enough to influence its market price through large transactions. Q2: Why do whales deposit large amounts of tokens to exchanges? A: Whales typically deposit tokens to exchanges for various reasons, including preparing to sell for profit, rebalancing their portfolio, or participating in exchange-specific activities like staking or providing liquidity. Q3: How does a large WLFI deposit affect the market? A: A large WLFI deposit can potentially increase selling pressure, leading to price volatility or a temporary dip if the whale decides to sell a significant portion of their holdings. Q4: Should I be concerned if a whale makes a large deposit? A: It’s a signal to pay attention to, but not necessarily a cause for panic. It indicates potential market movement. Always conduct your own research and consider your investment strategy before reacting. Q5: What is WLFI? A: WLFI refers to the native token of a specific blockchain project. Its value and utility are tied to that project’s ecosystem and adoption. Did you find this analysis helpful?

After climbing to $0.29 before easing back, the coin is once again attracting bullish speculation from both retail traders and institutions. After climbing to $0.29 before easing back, the coin is once again attracting bullish speculation from both retail traders and institutions. Analysts regard this surge as part of a broader meme rotation, with liquidity shifting to the tokens with strong communities and new narratives. That shift sparks interest not only in DOGE’s breakout potential but in other meme coins getting heavy FOMO. MAGACOIN FINANCE interestingly stands out, with some analysts predicting that it may deliver 350x returns in 2025. Dogecoin technical setup The Dogecoin price recently emerged from a multi-month symmetrical triangle: a textbook bullish continuation. With trading volumes going up to three times as much, buyers have a strong conviction on that move. The chart predictions from the breakouts put near-term goals in the range of $0.40–$0.45, and subsequently $0.60. Its point of resistance is going to be a challenge to momentum before another move up. For the bullish case to remain intact, DOGE price must hold support near the 50-week EMA at $0.227. A price drop below that threshold may invalidate the breakout and lead the price back to about $0.215. Momentum indicators are also biased in favor of upward movement. RSI remains below oversold territory, and a recent MACD crossover suggests continued strength and buying interest. ETF buzz and market drivers Dogecoin’s outlook is also based on the imminent ETF launch. REX-Osprey’s DOGE ETF will arrive on September 18, according to the RIC scheme. The structure allows a faster launch but carries heavier tax burdens and weaker institutional appeal. Analysts caution this could limit inflows compared to spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the other hand, 21Shares and Grayscale have spot DOGE ETF applications pending SEC action, which are expected to be issued in October. If approved, that could give Dogecoin greater institutional support — while delays might even slow near-term momentum. Meme coin face-off Analysts are comparing Dogecoin price with MAGACOIN FINANCE as meme rotation gains strength. Projections of 350x ROI have made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most hyped tokens of the year, with traders rushing to gain exposure. On the other hand, Dogecoin price remains the veteran. It is supported by years of community loyalty, merchant adoption, and cultural relevance. Furthermore, its size also provides stability, even though it can limit explosive short-term growth. By contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the new wave of meme speculation. Its political-themed branding has resonated with a growing base of retail traders, fueling rapid momentum and widespread FOMO. Analysts say it appeals most to investors seeking high-risk, high-reward plays. Together, the two coins illustrate different sides of the meme market: DOGE as the established heavyweight, MAGACOIN FINANCE as the aggressive newcomer with sky-high projections. Conclusion Dogecoin price movement towards $0.40 is technically sound with the right technical trends and increasing trading volume. Moreover, future ETF launches and regulatory action will determine the continuation or stagnation of momentum at resistance. However, meme rotation continues to channel attention into fast-moving opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured this energy with its bold forecasts, cultural relevance, and a fast-growing community. Its 350x projections reflect the appetite for asymmetric returns seen in the past memecoin rallies. For investors, the choice is less about one or the other and more about strategy. Dogecoin offers resilience, while MAGACOIN FINANCE offers urgency and potential for exponential upside.

51997646,585028,1758337232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51997646.jpeg,PayPal Expands PYUSD Stablecoin To 9 More Blockchains With LayerZero,https://bitcoinist.com/paypal-pyusd-stablecoin-9-blockchains-layerzero/,"PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD is now available on nine more blockchains, thanks to integration with LayerZero’s interoperability protocol. PayPal’s Stablecoin Now On Tron, Avalanche, & Seven Other Networks As announced by LayerZero in a blog post , PayPal USD (PYUSD) is getting a major expansion through integration with its Stargate Hydra system, allowing users to move the stablecoin to blockchains on which it is natively unavailable. This is made possible with PYUSD0, a new permissionless token that’s fully fungible with the original PYUSD. Currently, PayPal’s stablecoin is natively issued by Paxos on Abritrum, Solana, Ethereum, and Stellar. With PYUSD0, it will now also be transferable to Abstract, Aptos, Avalanche, Ink, Sei, Stable, and Tron. According to LayerZero, more networks beyond these are also set to come. Previously, PYUSD was already bridged to two other networks, Berachain (BYUSD) and Flow (USDF), and both will now be receiving upgrades to PYUSD0. This makes a total of nine networks on which the new token will be accessible. “As the stablecoin market continues its rapid growth beyond $270 billion, innovations like this are essential for creating the seamless, interoperable financial infrastructure that users and developers demand,” says David Weber, Head of Ecosystem, PayPal USD. PayPal launched its stablecoin back in 2023, becoming one of the first payment processing giants to embrace fiat-tied tokens. Since then, the firm has been taking measures to increase the reach of its coin, most recently with the Stellar version launch on Thursday. Now, with the LayerZero integration, the company has taken another step toward its goal. “By working together, we will enable PYUSD to reach new markets faster while maintaining compliance and composability from day one,” notes Weber. The PYUSD0 system is built on three pieces of infrastructure: PayPal’s stablecoin itself, Stargate Hydra, and LayerZero. Stargate, which was acquired by LayerZero last month, acts as the transfer interface, while LayerZero handles minting, burning, and deployment of PYUSD0 to the new blockchains. “With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s,” says Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO at LayerZero Labs. “Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.” Besides its stablecoin, PayPal has also been making developments in its cryptocurrency payments ecosystem lately. In late July, the payments processor firm unveiled a “Pay with Crypto” service to help merchants receive digital asset payments, and earlier this week, it also announced cryptocurrency integration into its peer-to-peer (P2P) payments system. Bitcoin Has Seen A Pullback During The Past Day Bitcoin recovered to $117,900 on Thursday, but the asset has since gone down as its price is back at $116,400. The below chart shows how the coin’s recent trajectory has looked. The pullback in Bitcoin and other digital assets has induced $133 million in long liquidations over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass .",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|LayerZero|PayPal|PayPal stablecoin|PayPal USD|PYUSD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|PYUSD|BTC|MARKET|APT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 03:00:32

A cut in interest rates is likely to benefit risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). Fed Cuts Interest Rate, Bitcoin Supply Ratio Falls According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, the latest data from Binance shows that the interest rate cut has rekindled investors’ interest in BTC. Notably, the exchange supply ratio has declined to 0.0291, hinting that investors are choosing to withdraw their BTC from exchanges and hold it for the long-term instead of selling it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Above Mid-Term Holder Breakeven – Is A Fresh Rally Brewing? To support their analysis, Arab Chain shared the following chart, which shows a tumbling exchange supply ratio while the BTC price continues to shoot up. The analyst noted that the interest rate cut has increased risk appetite and improved liquidity in the market. This behavior shows that the Fed’s monetary policy will remain dovish for the near term, which could mitigate selling pressure on BTC for the time being. Low exchange supply is creating relative buying pressure, as Bitcoin’s stability above $115,000 further supports this trend. The analyst remarked that if BTC outflows from crypto exchanges continue at the current pace, then the digital asset may target the $120,000 resistance level. However, liquidity must continue to flow into digital assets, driven by the Fed’s decision. Arab Chain added: The continued decline in the Exchange Supply Ratio for Bitcoin, coupled with a rising price, reinforces the bullish scenario, especially if traditional markets stabilize after the Fed’s decision. Conversely, if the Exchange Supply Ratio turns upward again (if Bitcoin reenters exchanges), it could signal that investors are preparing to take profits at levels near 118K–120K. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto had similar thoughts. In an X post, the analyst shared the following chart, saying that BTC is currently stuck under the bearish fair value gap. A daily close above this gap – highlighted in red – could pave the way for a new high for BTC. Is BTC Facing A Supply Crunch? A declining exchange supply ratio further suggests that BTC may be approaching a bullish ‘supply crunch’ that could lead to significant price appreciation for the digital asset in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap? Recently, the Bitcoin Scarcity Index recorded its first spike since June 2025, indicating potential upward price pressure on BTC. Meanwhile, BTC outflows from Binance continue at a rapid pace, further reducing the digital asset’s active circulating supply. That said, some concerns still linger, specifically due to the lack of participation of whales in recent BTC price action. At press time, BTC trades at $116,374, down 1.3% in the past 24 hours.

On September 19, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a net inflow of an impressive $48 million. This marked another day of positive momentum, building on previous gains. Such figures are not just numbers; they represent tangible capital moving into the Ethereum market through accessible investment products.

This substantial figure highlights the significant influence of major financial institutions in driving the adoption of crypto-backed ETFs. Institutional Confidence: The consistent inflows, particularly from prominent asset managers like BlackRock, suggest increasing institutional comfort and conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Why Are Consecutive Spot ETH ETF Inflows So Significant? Two consecutive days of net inflows into Spot ETH ETFs are more than just a fleeting trend; they indicate a strengthening pattern of investor interest.

Understanding the implications of these inflows is crucial: Market Validation: Continuous inflows serve as a strong validation for Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class within traditional finance.

Mixed Performance: On the same day, Fidelity’s FETH saw net outflows of $53.4 million, and Grayscale’s Mini ETH recorded outflows of $11.3 million.

Investors are keenly watching these instruments, which offer a regulated gateway to Bitcoin exposure. The latest figures show a significant positive shift, signaling renewed confidence and growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space. Understanding the Latest Surge in Spot Bitcoin ETFs On September 19, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a notable net inflow of $222.75 million. This marks the second consecutive day of positive flows, according to financial data from TraderT. Such sustained positive movement is a key indicator for market watchers, suggesting a robust appetite for these investment products.

This substantial contribution from BlackRock underscores the growing influence of major financial institutions in the crypto arena. Conversely, Grayscale’s GBTC observed an outflow of $23.5 million. The remaining exchange-traded funds in the sector reported no significant net changes in their flows for the day. What Drives the Momentum for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The consistent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not just random fluctuations; they reflect broader market dynamics. Several factors contribute to this momentum, making these ETFs an increasingly attractive option for both retail and institutional investors. Transparency and regulatory clarity are paramount, and these products offer a structured way to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. Institutional Confidence: The participation of major asset managers like BlackRock signals a maturing market. Their involvement lends credibility and stability to the entire ecosystem. Accessibility: ETFs simplify investment in Bitcoin. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts, which many investors already use. Diversification: For many portfolios, Bitcoin offers a new avenue for diversification. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide this exposure without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges directly. Navigating the Future Landscape of Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows are positive, the landscape for Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains dynamic.

The continued growth and acceptance of these financial instruments could pave the way for further innovation in crypto investment products. Challenges still exist, including ongoing regulatory scrutiny and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the increasing demand, as evidenced by these inflows, highlights a clear trend: traditional finance is embracing digital assets.

It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment vehicle without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why are these inflows important?

This sudden downturn has left many traders pondering the immediate future and the volatility inherent in digital assets, serving as a powerful reminder of the risks involved in leveraged trading. What Exactly Triggered These Massive Crypto Liquidations? Over the last day, perpetual futures markets saw a significant wave of forced selling. When traders use leverage to open “long” positions – essentially betting that an asset’s price will rise – and the price instead drops significantly, their positions can be automatically closed, or “liquidated.” This mechanism is designed to prevent further losses beyond their initial margin. The sheer scale of these recent crypto liquidations indicates a strong, rapid downward price movement that caught many leveraged long traders completely off guard, leading to a cascade of closures. Ethereum (ETH): Experienced a staggering $86.17 million in liquidations. A remarkable 94.95% of these were from long positions, suggesting a pronounced bearish sentiment took hold for ETH in the short term. Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $42.61 million liquidated, with an even higher proportion of long positions making up 97.69%. This shows that even the market leader, often considered more stable, is not immune to sudden price corrections, impacting those who were overly optimistic. Solana (SOL): Faced $24.34 million in liquidations, with 90.73% originating from long positions. SOL’s well-known volatility often amplifies such market movements, making it particularly susceptible to rapid shifts. Why Were Long Positions So Vulnerable to These Crypto Liquidations? The overwhelming dominance of long positions in these liquidations is a critical aspect to understand. It fundamentally means that the vast majority of traders caught in this market downturn were betting on prices to go up. When prices fell sharply, these leveraged long bets were wiped out, triggering a chain reaction of selling. This scenario frequently unfolds after periods of extended bullish sentiment or market consolidation, where many traders accumulate substantial long positions, only to be “flushed out” by an abrupt price reversal. Grasping the intricate mechanics of crypto liquidations is absolutely vital for any participant navigating the derivatives market. What Are the Broader Implications of These Crypto Liquidations for the Market? Such large-scale crypto liquidations can have several significant ripple effects across the entire market. Firstly, they often contribute to further price declines as the forced selling adds intense downward pressure, creating a feedback loop. Secondly, these events can act as a crucial “reset” for the market, effectively clearing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable, organic growth, albeit usually after a period of market consolidation and recovery. Traders must always be acutely aware of the amplified risks associated with high leverage, especially in a market as inherently dynamic and unpredictable as cryptocurrency. This event serves as a stark and timely reminder that market sentiment can shift with breathtaking speed, impacting even the most confident predictions and established trends. For long-term investors, this recent event powerfully underscores the paramount importance of robust risk management strategies. This includes diversifying portfolios across different assets, diligently setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and consciously avoiding excessive leverage that can quickly magnify both gains and, more importantly, losses. While the enticing allure of quick and substantial gains is undeniably strong in crypto, the harsh reality of market volatility, vividly demonstrated by these recent crypto liquidations , unequivocally demands a disciplined and cautious approach. Thoroughly analyzing these market events can provide invaluable insights into underlying market dynamics and ultimately help refine and improve individual trading strategies for future success. How Can Traders Mitigate Risks from Future Crypto Liquidations? Navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency requires a strategic mindset, especially when faced with events like the recent wave of crypto liquidations . A key takeaway is the necessity of prudent risk management. Firstly, consider your leverage ratios carefully; while leverage can amplify profits, it equally amplifies losses, making you more susceptible to liquidation during minor price swings. Secondly, always implement stop-loss orders. These automatic sell orders can limit your downside exposure, preventing small corrections from turning into catastrophic losses. Thirdly, avoid putting all your capital into a single trade or asset; diversification can cushion the blow if one asset underperforms. Moreover, understanding market sentiment and technical indicators can offer early warnings. Look for signs of over-extension in bullish trends, which often precede sharp corrections. Staying informed about macroeconomic factors and regulatory news is also crucial, as these can significantly influence market direction. Ultimately, the goal is to protect your capital and participate sustainably in the crypto market, rather than chasing fleeting, high-risk opportunities that could lead to another round of massive crypto liquidations . In conclusion, the recent $153 million in crypto liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL serves as a powerful testament to the inherent volatility and risks of leveraged trading in the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be unsettling, they also offer invaluable lessons for traders and investors. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations, practicing diligent risk management, and maintaining a balanced perspective, participants can better navigate market turbulence and build more resilient portfolios. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and adapting to its dynamic nature is key to long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Liquidations What exactly are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because the market price moves against their bet, and their margin collateral falls below a certain threshold. This is done to prevent the trader from losing more money than they have in their account. Why do long positions get liquidated more often during a market downturn? Long positions are bets that an asset’s price will increase. During a market downturn, prices fall, which directly opposes long positions. If these positions are leveraged, even a small price drop can quickly deplete the margin, triggering automatic liquidation to cover potential losses. How can I protect my crypto investments from liquidations? To protect against liquidations, you should avoid excessive leverage, use stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level, diversify your portfolio, and maintain sufficient margin in your trading account. Always prioritize risk management. Do liquidations always mean a bearish market? Not necessarily. While large-scale long liquidations often accompany bearish price movements, liquidations can also occur for short positions during sudden price pumps. However, the dominance of long liquidations, as seen recently, typically indicates significant downward pressure and often precedes further market corrections. What is the difference between spot trading and perpetual futures in relation to liquidations? Spot trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly, with no leverage, so liquidations do not occur. Perpetual futures trading, on the other hand, involves leveraged contracts that track the price of an asset without an expiry date. It is in these leveraged futures markets that liquidations are a common risk due to margin requirements. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your fellow crypto enthusiasts!

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.8883 Market cap $888.02M Trading volume $197.63M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.9502 24-hour low $0.8871 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.28% 50-day SMA $0.8896 14-Day RSI 56.59 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.7985 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is under pressure after failing to hold above $0.90. The coin’s immediate support sits at $0.88. As it stands, bulls need to reclaim $0.90–$0.93 to stop further downside. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart As of September 20, WIF is trading at $0.889, with sellers pressing the price back toward the Alligator’s red support line around $0.892. The upper bound at $0.916 capped the last rebound, and now momentum is waning WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview WIF’s volume remains decent at 29.3M, but the recent string of red candles shows buyers losing grip. The MACD is flattening close to neutral, hinting at indecision but with a slight bearish lean. If the $0.89 price level holds, WIF could make recovery attempts toward $0.93. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe highlights the weakness more clearly. WIF slipped under the $0.902 level and is now hovering just above $0.890, with the next support marked at $0.859. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD histogram is deep in the red, showing steady bearish momentum, while the 21-SMA at $0.933 is keeping WIF from breaking to the upside. Unless buyers reclaim $0.90 quickly, the bearish drift may extend further. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9029 SELL SMA 5 $0.9073 SELL SMA 10 $0.9296 SELL SMA 21 $0.8771 BUY SMA 50 $0.8896 BUY SMA 100 $0.9119 SELL SMA 200 $0.7985 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8583 BUY EMA 5 $0.8420 BUY EMA 10 $0.8377 BUY EMA 21 $0.8601 BUY EMA 50 $0.8980 SELL EMA 100 $0.9038 SELL EMA 200 $1.0009 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF looks bearish in the short term. If $0.88 price level breaks, traders can expect a slide toward $0.8. However, reclaiming $0.93 could shift momentum back toward $1. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

According to researchers, Bitcoin may soon be utilized outside of the planet, and it may serve as currency on Mars. Simultaneously, investors on Earth are desperately seeking the next big thing, and with MAGACOIN FINANCE raising an astonishing $13.5 million in record time , a roadmap that offers potential explosive returns. Bitcoin Goes Interplanetary Over the years, Bitcoin has been referred to as borderless money, which is beyond the limitations of traditional finance. Instead, scientists are taking that definition to the literal boundaries of human imagination: interplanetary payments. A team led by researchers Jose E. Puente and Carlos Puente has proposed a scheme known as Proof-of-transit Timestamping (PoTT), which might enable Bitcoin to become useful in Earth-Mars transactions. Rather than simply using the existing infrastructure on Earth, PoTT envisions payments traveling through the air via satellites and space relays, dropping digital marks on every waypoint. The outcome would be a verifiable record of the movement, with reliability even over millions of kilometers. This is a continuation of previous milestones. In 2018, Blockstream proved that Bitcoin was everywhere through satellite coverage of blockchain information. The first Bitcoin transaction through the International Space Station was recorded by Spacechain 2 years later. But PoTT pushes further to consider interplanetary payments as a routing and verification problem, a role that can be undertaken by networks such as Starlink, provided by SpaceX, or NASA optical communication networks. How Bitcoin Could Work on Mars The greatest space payment hurdle is not technical, but distance. The distance between Earth and Mars can require a signal between 4-24 minutes, depending on surface contact. This would be excruciatingly slow to the base layer of Bitcoin, which already handles transactions in blocks of 10 minutes. The solution offered by PoTT consists of integrating the Lightning Network technology with relay satellites. With this model, the payment would be made in only 12-15 minutes, despite the long distance. Relays would be placed between satellites where a transaction is verified and stamped every time it rolls closer to Mars. The researchers go as far as collectively explaining the worst obstacle: the two-week blackout when the Sun obscures the signals between Earth and Mars. They suggest putting up resilient relay satellites that will be set to bypass solar disruption so that the payments can still be made even during the times when there is a cosmic inconvenience. It may sound futuristic, but it raises a very tangible question: what currency is humanity going to be using if we colonise other planets? According to Puente, the most viable option for a multi-planetary civilization would be a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, which is neutral and decentralized, and unattached to any government. MAGACOIN FINANCE Raises $13.5 Million While Bitcoin eyes the stars, back on Earth, investors are turning their attention to the next breakout projects with explosive growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $13.5 million in record time , drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. What makes it stand out is not just the speed of its fundraising, but the vision behind it. Analysts are already comparing its momentum to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, when small early investments turned into life-changing gains. With audits confirming security and a roadmap that highlights continuous development, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a reputation as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. Some projections suggest early participants could see returns exceeding 7,800% , with a clear path to major exchange listings. In a market hungry for new opportunities, the project’s success so far reflects a growing belief that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the next big name in crypto. The Future of Interplanetary Finance Returning to the Mars discussion, PoTT raises intriguing possibilities for how humans might handle money in space. Imagine astronauts receiving their salaries in Bitcoin while living on a Martian colony. Instead of dealing with intergovernmental disputes about which currency to use, they could rely on a system that is trustless and borderless. This is particularly important given the potential for geopolitical competition over Mars. Just as Bitcoin offers financial sovereignty on Earth, it could do the same on the Red Planet, ensuring colonists aren’t dependent on the policies of Earth-based governments. Of course, the technology is still theoretical. At present, Mars has no residents, only rovers and orbiters. But if settlement becomes a reality, interplanetary finance may evolve from science fiction into a necessity. Why Investors Should Pay Attention The significance of these developments is twofold. First, they show how far Bitcoin’s influence has stretched. What started as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system is now being considered for interplanetary commerce. Second, they highlight how the crypto market continues to expand into uncharted territory, both technologically and financially. For investors, this means opportunities are not just in the established names like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also in emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which combine strong fundamentals with explosive growth potential. As the market matures, those who position themselves early in promising ventures often stand to gain the most. Conclusion Bitcoin may not yet be ready to buy coffee on Mars, but the research into systems like PoTT suggests it could one day serve as the financial backbone of a multi-planetary society. While these futuristic scenarios unfold, investors today are already seeing exciting opportunities here on Earth. With $13.5 million raised quickly and projections of massive ROI , MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. As always, the crypto market rewards foresight. Those who spot the potential early often benefit the most when innovation meets adoption.

After soaring to nearly $118,000—just 5% shy of its all-time high—the market has faced renewed uncertainty. Despite this setback, experts emphasize that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains optimistic, especially as September 21 approaches, a date identified as pivotal for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Will September 21 Mark The Start Of A New Bull Run? Market analyst Timothy Peterson highlights that historically, Bitcoin has finished the year higher 70% of the time after September 21, with a median increase exceeding 50%. He has dubbed this date “Bitcoin Bottom Day,” suggesting that the odds of a price increase are significantly favorable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Expert Predicts 70% Chance Of New Highs Within Two Weeks Peterson notes that two of the three downturns in Bitcoin’s history occurred during established bear markets in 2018 and 2022, conditions that do not reflect the current market situation. This leads him to believe that the chances of a price rise are closer to 90% this year. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s track record suggests it has a nearly perfect chance of holding its gains six months post-September 21. Peterson estimates there is at least a 70% probability that Bitcoin will not drop below the $100,000 mark again. Analysts Warn Of ‘Sell the News’ Bitcoin Phase Ryan Lee, chief analyst at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, also points to the recent 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed as a factor that initially boosted Bitcoin’s price, briefly pushing it above $117,000. This cut, the first in nine months, reflects increased liquidity in the market. However, Lee cautions that the median projection of only 50 basis points in total cuts for the year could temper some of the optimism, introducing potential volatility as traders adjust their strategies. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced a dip of 5% to 8% following rate cuts before resuming its upward trend, suggesting a possible “sell the news” phase in the coming days. Related Reading: Warren Calls Out US DOJ Over Binance Settlement And Alleged Trump Ties In New Letter Despite these fluctuations, Lee remains bullish about the macroeconomic environment, asserting that lower yields on money-market funds (MMFs) are likely to direct capital toward alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a hedge in this risk-on climate, especially with approximately $7.2 trillion currently held in cash-like instruments. Looking ahead, Lee predicts that the cryptocurrency may consolidate in the near term before targeting prices between $123,000 and $150,000, should additional rate cuts materialize. Analysts at Bitfinex also share a positive outlook, projecting that with three anticipated rate cuts by the end of the year and steady inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin could reach between $125,000 and $135,000 by year-end. However, they also caution that if inflation or economic growth data hinder the Fed’s ability to proceed with further cuts, Bitcoin might stabilize within a range of $110,000 to $115,000 as institutional participation and ETF assets under management provide a solid floor.
