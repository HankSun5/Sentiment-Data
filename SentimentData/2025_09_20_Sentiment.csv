Each cycle decreases supply, enhances scarcity, and very often will cause massive rallies. Analysts now project a possible rally of BTC to $250K in the next bull run. At the same time, liquidations are shaking out weak positions. Over $176.9 million in short positions were liquidated in the past day, boosting bullishness. As confidence builds back up, investors are starting to rotate to promising altcoins. Among the most-discussed are Hyperliquid and MAGACOIN FINANCE . Bitcoin Halving and Market Outlook The halving reduces the flow of new coins every 210,000 blocks. This event is foundational to Bitcoin’s model of scarcity and value proposition. Historically, halvings caused large price increases, with the cycles getting larger than the previous one. Importantly, the impact does not end with Bitcoin. When Bitcoin gains, altcoins tend to follow, but with greater percentage increases. Consequently, capital normally turns into innovative tokens with higher upside potential. This rotation opens the door for platforms such as Hyperliquid and emerging projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. $176.9M Short Liquidations: Market Confidence Returns In the past 24 hours, crypto liquidations hit $370.62 million. Shorts made up $176.93 million of that total. Longs were slightly higher at $196.16 million, showing volatility cuts both ways. Notably, the single largest liquidation happened on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, worth $2.65 million. These liquidations reveal how quickly sentiment shifts when prices move sharply. Yet, they also reinforce bullish momentum by removing leveraged sellers. Investors now see liquidations as signals of strength rather than weakness. Capital is shifting toward altcoins where growth potential is higher. Hyperliquid and Magacoin Finance are clear beneficiaries of this shift. Hyperliquid’s Breakout and Stablecoin Ambitions Hyperliquid has quickly established itself as a force in decentralized trading. Its native token, HYPE, surged past $55, setting a new all-time high. That represents over 1,200% growth from late 2024 lows. The rally was fueled by proposals around USDH, Hyperliquid’s upcoming stablecoin. Governance activity has intensified, with multiple players submitting proposals. Paxos suggested using reserve interest for HYPE buybacks, backed by Treasury bills and stable reserves. Frax Finance proposed minting USDH against a basket of stable assets, with revenue directed to staking or buybacks. Institutional support is also emerging. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck publicly endorsed Hyperliquid, confirming investment and long-term interest. His comments boosted confidence in Hyperliquid’s vision and strengthened its reputation. The combination of governance growth, stablecoin development, and institutional recognition positions Hyperliquid strongly. If altseason follows the halving, Hyperliquid could attract massive liquidity and adoption. Magacoin Finance: A Hidden Gem in Rotation MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly joining discussions about the best altcoins before the halving . Investors are searching for assets with upside potential beyond majors, and MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that category. Unlike larger-cap tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still selling at a low entry price many consider undervalued. Its limited supply and growing community create a scarcity-driven environment. Whale accumulation has increased steadily, a sign of strong confidence. As shorts get liquidated and capital rotates, traders are eyeing altcoins with breakout potential . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum, combined with its fundamentals, makes it a hidden gem in this environment. With scarcity, transparency, and community backing, it is attracting fresh attention as the halving nears. Why Altcoins Could Outperform Post-Halving Altcoin seasons usually follow Bitcoin rallies. As Bitcoin dominates headlines, investors eventually diversify into riskier assets for higher gains. Historically, this rotation led to massive runs in Ethereum, Solana, and other layer-1s. This cycle could follow the same pattern. Hyperliquid offers exposure to DeFi innovation and stablecoin growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides scarcity-driven value and growing adoption. Together, they represent two different but complementary opportunities for investors. As Bitcoin pushes toward a possible $250K target, altcoins could multiply at even faster rates. Investors preparing early have the best chance to capture these moves. Conclusion The upcoming Bitcoin halving is more than a supply event. It is a catalyst for the entire crypto market. With $176.9M shorts liquidated and confidence returning, the stage is set for growth. Hyperliquid’s governance and stablecoin progress show its potential as a DeFi leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by scarcity and accumulation, is emerging as a hidden gem. As the market looks beyond Bitcoin, these two altcoins stand out. Positioned before the halving, they could be the keys to outsized returns in the next cycle.

The plans are direct: Expand $USDe adoption across centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms Launch Ethena on BNB Chain Develop new products USDtb and Converge Strengthen growth with TVL now above $13B, according to DeFiLlama https://t.co/AfzsqtAPwb — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) September 19, 2025 $USDe: The Synthetic Dollar Taking DeFi by Storm Ethena’s $USDe is designed to be a synthetic dollar, independent from traditional banking rails. Unlike centralized stablecoins, it generates yields through delta-neutral strategies, combining spot and futures positions to hedge volatility while still delivering returns. That design makes $USDe attractive for both retail and institutional DeFi users. It’s not just a dollar substitute, it’s a yield-bearing asset integrated across lending, liquidity pools, and trading protocols. On CoinMarketCap, $USDe currently holds a market cap above $3.2B, climbing rapidly in 2025 as adoption spreads. TVL Growth Signals Strong Market Demand Ethena’s total value locked (TVL) has crossed $13B, a sharp rise from $6B earlier this year. This surge highlights just how quickly USDe and its ecosystem are becoming embedded into the DeFi landscape. For perspective, Ethena now ranks among the top 5 DeFi protocols by TVL, rivaling established players like Aave and MakerDAO. This rapid scaling also reinforces why YZi Labs sees Ethena as a key driver in the shift toward decentralized stable assets. YZi Labs doubles down on $ENA USDe is now the 3rd largest $USD asset in crypto with $13B+ supply & TVL, the fastest ever to $10B. Backed since incubation, YZi is fueling Ethena’s next phase: • USDe adoption across CEXs + DeFi • Expansion on BNB Chain • New… pic.twitter.com/8Pn5VsEhA4 — CryptoED (@Crypto_ED7) September 19, 2025 Strategic Expansion Into BNB Chain One of the most significant steps in YZi Labs’ roadmap is extending Ethena’s deployment to BNB Chain. BNB Chain brings access to a massive retail user base, with daily active wallets consistently ranking among the top across blockchains. Integrating USDe here positions Ethena to tap into liquidity, DeFi yield markets, and cross-chain opportunities within the Binance ecosystem. This also connects back to the origins of YZi Labs, founded by Binance co-founders CZ and Yi He, showing how their support is evolving from exchange-native products into broader Web3 infrastructure. New Products: USDtb and Converge Beyond scaling USDe, Ethena Labs is preparing to roll out two new products: USDtb → A new stable asset designed to complement USDe, with enhanced liquidity and interoperability across DeFi and CEXs. Converge → A protocol aimed at bridging centralized and decentralized finance, expanding yield opportunities and cross-market integrations. Together, these additions strengthen Ethena’s role as more than just a stablecoin issuer, it becomes a full-stack synthetic dollar ecosystem. ENA Token Gains From Ecosystem Growth The ENA token, Ethena’s governance and rewards asset, has already benefited from ecosystem expansion. Earlier this year, ENA spiked in value after Ethena’s TVL crossed $6B. With TVL now over $13B, investors are watching closely for another wave of upside momentum. On CoinMarketCap, ENA is trading at $0.68 with a $900M market cap, cementing its place among top DeFi governance tokens. As USDe adoption spreads across CEXs, DeFi, and BNB Chain, ENA stands to capture further value through governance rights, staking incentives, and fee participation. Institutional Backing Adds Credibility Institutional capital continues to flow into DeFi, but YZi Labs’ renewed investment carries unique weight. As the family office of CZ and Yi He, YZi Labs isn’t just a random fund. Its roots trace back to Binance Labs, historically one of the most influential venture arms in Web3. By expanding its stake in Ethena Labs, YZi Labs is signaling confidence in synthetic dollar protocols as the future of stable assets. For Ethena, this credibility boost could draw in more liquidity providers, institutional partners, and retail trust. Regulatory and Market Risks Still, stablecoins remain one of the most heavily scrutinized sectors in crypto. Regulators across the US, Europe, and Asia continue to assess how to classify synthetic dollar assets. At the same time, market volatility and yield compression pose risks to sustainability. Ethena’s delta-neutral design reduces exposure, but ongoing improvements in risk management and transparency will be critical for long-term adoption. Digital Dollars in Web3 YZi Labs’ investment is part of a larger trend: institutional capital moving toward mature, revenue-generating DeFi protocols. The growth of USDe shows that users are demanding dollar-denominated stability that isn’t tied to banks, especially in an era where centralized stablecoins face increased regulatory pressure. If successful, Ethena Labs’ model could set a blueprint for how synthetic dollars power the internet economy, from payments to trading to savings. With TVL at $13B, a growing user base, and new products on the horizon, Ethena Labs is cementing itself as a major player in the stablecoin sector. YZi Labs’ deeper stake sends a strong signal: USDe isn’t just another DeFi experiment. It’s a core building block for digital dollars, positioned to expand across CEXs, DeFi, and into BNB Chain. For ENA holders, USDe users, and the wider ecosystem, the message is clear, the future of stablecoins is becoming increasingly synthetic, decentralized, and yield-bearing.

51990326,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425804,1758321000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990326.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin and Pi Coin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-dogecoin-and-pi-coin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s homegrown ChatGPT alternative, DeepSeek AI, predict that XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network could post substantial gains for investors before the year’s end. The broader crypto market seems to be laying the groundwork for such a move. Just last month, Bitcoin reached a fresh record high of $124,128, beating the prior peak of $122,838 set only a month earlier. However, enthusiasm faded after July’s hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation numbers led to a temporary pullback. Regulators are also accelerating their efforts. In July, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive federal law governing stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain full reserve backing. Soon after, the SEC announced Project Crypto, an initiative aimed at updating securities laws and providing clearer rules for digital asset companies. With new rules rolling out and market confidence returning, analysts believe the upcoming wave in altcoins and meme tokens could surpass the 2021 bull run. If DeepSeek’s outlook proves correct, XRP, Dogecoin, and Pi Network could be the leading beneficiaries. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Sees a Potential 230% Rally Toward $5 According to DeepSeek, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could advance to $10 by late 2025, marking a significant 230% jump from its current level near $3.03. XRP has already shown resilience this cycle. On July 18, it hit $3.65, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40, before easing roughly 17% due to risk-on sentiment from various macroeconomic pressures. Ripple’s global payments network continues to expand. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund endorsed XRP as a cost-effective solution for remittances in developing nations. The end of Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC in early 2025 removed one of the biggest uncertainties surrounding the project. The SEC dropped its lawsuit after a 2023 ruling confirmed that retail XRP sales do not qualify as securities. If XRP can reclaim and sustain its July highs, DeepSeek AI expects $5-10 to be within reach, though other market experts have floated far more ambitious targets of $10–$20. On the technical side, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) has pulled back from 59 yesterday to 53, signalling a brief flurry of buying in yesterday day trading before an overnight dip. Despite the Fed’s rate cuts and the rollout of the first spot XRP ETF , markets are cautious, potentially waiting for the SEC verdict on a raft of ETF applications due middle of next month, along with the rollout of comprehensive US crypto legislation. Over the last twelve months, XRP has skyrocketed 420%, much quicker growth than Bitcoin’s 87.5% and Ethereum’s 86% appreciation over the same period. Dogecoin ($DOGE): DeepSeek Predicts a Push Past $1 for the Original Meme Token First launched in 2013 as a parody cryptocurrency, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since evolved into a top-10 digital asset, with a market capitalization of about $41.3 billion within the $88.2 billion meme coin sector. Its staying power comes from its dedicated community and growing role as a payments option. DOGE often tracks Bitcoin’s moves, but thanks to its strong liquidity and fan base, it has managed to weather several market downturns. Now trading near $0.2738, Dogecoin has more than doubled in value over the past year, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. In the last two weeks alone, DOGE gained 27%, briefly pushing its RSI up to 75 before cooling back to 62 amid profit-taking and market dips. Chart watchers highlight recurring bullish falling wedge patterns from November through April, and again in July and August, hinting at potentially explosive further upside. DeepSeek’s conservative projection places DOGE at $1 to $2 by December. The upper range would spell a staggering 630% increase for current holders. Additionally, it would mean the “Doge Army” could finally reach its dream target of $1 per coin, a major psychological milestone given Doge’s ATH during the 2021 bull run was $0.7316. DeepSeek suggests a strong bull market could finally make that goal a reality. Adoption is also growing steadily: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, while payment platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin transfers. Pi Network ($PI): DeepSeek AI Tips Tap-to-Mine Coin for Explosive Growth Pi Network ($PI) has drawn attention for its mobile-based “tap-to-mine” model, where users earn tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily. Currently priced at about $0.3577, DeepSeek predicts an extremely bullish scenario of up to $10 per coin by year’s end, a meteoric 28× gain in a matter of months. While such a surge seems improbable given today’s market conditions, the project’s roadmap and technicals signal some small space for hope. Since its launch in February 2025, PI has been highly volatile, including a 171% spike in May. Its current RSI of 49 suggests a fairly valued token with potential for further upward moves. The development team continues to roll out incremental updates, with version 23 and a possible mainnet launch expected soon, which could inject new momentum into the project. Realistically, analysts argue that a retest of February’s $2.99 high would be a strong outcome. Even if the extreme bullish case doesn’t materialize, October is traditionally a bullish month for crypto and we could see the price climb up to its previous resistance level, around $1.25. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A High-Risk Meme Coin Alternative For those seeking speculative opportunities outside DeepSeek’s main picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) positions itself as a risk-heavy alternative to Dogecoin, marketing itself as the degen cousin of crypto’s original original meme coin. While Dogecoin has matured into a mainstream crypto asset, Maxi Doge is embracing volatility and community-driven culture. The presale has already brought in over $2.3 million within its first month. Built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, MAXI is focused on viral growth via Telegram and Discord engagement, trading competitions, and cross-project partnerships. Out of 150.24 billion tokens, about 25% are reserved for the Maxi Fund to drive marketing and collaborations. Staking is live, with current yields of 141% APY, though these returns are expected to fall as more users participate. The presale price is $0.000258, with the next price increase set in just under 36 hourws. Investors can purchase through the official Maxi Doge site, using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet .

51990298,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425767,1758321000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990298.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy 19 September – XRP, Shiba Inu, Pepe",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-19-september-xrp-shiba-inu-pepe/,"With the vast number of choices available, deciding which crypto is the best to buy right now is far from straightforward. Lingering concerns around inflation, US policy, and global tensions have kept market growth in check, although Bitcoin managed to hit a new all-time high of $124,128 just last month. Beyond Bitcoin, investor interest remains strong in both leading altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the last year, many tokens have hit new price benchmarks, signaling growing enthusiasm across the crypto sector. This renewed confidence has largely been driven by two pivotal policy changes in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive U.S. regulation focused on stablecoins. Second, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to modernize and clarify securities laws as they apply to digital assets. With sentiment gradually turning positive, it’s worth taking a closer look at how major altcoins like XRP, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are setting up for potential gains. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Titan is Best Blue Chip Crypto for 2025 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) surged to an all-time high of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act was signed, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40. Since then, XRP has cooled to around $3.03, about 17% below that peak. The token’s main strength lies in its ability to facilitate fast and low-cost international payments, offering a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. Its standing has been reinforced by endorsements from organizations such as the UN Capital Development Fund and even recognition from the White House. Ripple’s influence in policymaking was underscored earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse was invited to a high-profile presidential roundtable on cryptocurrency regulation. XRP’s momentum also received a significant boost in 2023 after a U.S. court ruled that its retail sales did not qualify as securities, effectively closing a five year conflict with the SEC while achieving a pivotal victory for the wider industry. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 418%, compared to Bitcoin’s 88% gain. Following its July rally, the token has managed to hold steady near the $3 mark, despite broader market volatility. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 53 after briefly hitting 59 yesterday. This reflects a brief sharp spike followed by a cooldown. The brief spike may have been the result of the Fed’s interest rate cuts this week and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF, but those headlines have not catalyzed a major XRP gold rush yet. Looking ahead, the SEC is set to decide on a raft of additional spot XRP ETFs in mid-October. That could propel the token above $4 within weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Meme Coin Giant With Expanding Real-World Use Cases Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the second-largest meme coin, commanding a market cap of nearly $7.8 billion. In the past 24 hours, SHIB’s price has dipped 2%, although it retained value better than the collective meme coin sector, which dropped 3%. Given that the wider $4.11 trillion crypto market also dipped 0.4% overnight, SHIB’s resilience, utility, and multibillion dollar market cap means it often has less volatility than a typical meme coin and behaves more like a blue chip crypto. It currently trades around $0.00001321. Technical charts point to further potential upside. Over the past year, SHIB has formed two bullish patterns: a descending wedge from November through March and a flag pattern since mid-May. Breaking through the key resistance at $0.000022 could trigger a run toward $0.00003 by late October. In a broader bull run, analysts see possible targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 by the end of the year. Unlike most meme tokens, SHIB has real-world utility, including enhanced privacy tools and Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 network that lowers fees and accelerates transactions. Pepe ($PEPE): Internet Meme Sensation Positioned for Breakout Introduced in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) rapidly climbed into the ranks of top meme coins by market cap, fueled by the popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic frog character. Its meteoric rise inspired numerous copycats, though none have replicated its success. With a market valuation above $4.6 billion, and even a brief feature as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X, PEPE has firmly secured its place as a meme coin heavyweight. Currently priced near $0.00001106, PEPE has grown 15% in the past fortnight, though it still sits 60.5% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 in late 2024. Chart analysts note the development of a falling wedge pattern, a setup often preceding a breakout. With its RSI around 53, PEPE remains in a neutral trading zone, suggesting balanced buy and sell pressure with room for upward movement. The meme coin sector as a whole dipped 3% overnight to a collective market cap of $88.9 billion. While PEPE dipped in line with it, it has gained 4% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Supporters believe favorable macro conditions and rising investor optimism could drive PEPE to fresh highs as the summer unfolds. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2 Makes for One of 2025’s Best Crypto Presales Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of the most talked-about presales of 2025, aiming to launch the first Bitcoin Layer 2 network that blends viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. Its mission is to enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster transactions, smart contracts, and community-driven decision-making. The presale has already raised around $16.9 million, with analysts projecting potential 10× or higher gains post-launch. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER delivers lightning-fast smart contracts while keeping transaction costs low. One of its standout innovations is the Canonical Bridge, which allows near-instant BTC transfers on its Layer 2 while powering dApps, meme tokens, and payments with minimal fees. A recent Coinsult audit found no security vulnerabilities, adding confidence among investors. The $HYPER token will support multiple roles, including staking, transaction processing, and governance. Early presale participants can earn staking rewards of up to 68% APY while also gaining voting rights on upgrades after the platform’s launch.

Everyday Benefits for Users Trust Wallet framed the update as a way of making every action count. Here’s what that means for users: Lower fees on swaps & buys Gas discounts when paying with TWT Loyalty rewards via Trust Alpha (Launchpool 2.0) Premium support & faster service Voting rights in governance decisions Every swap, buy, and transaction inside Trust Wallet now carries a clear benefit layer powered by TWT. Roadmap: From 2025 Into 2026 The litepaper also lays out a timeline of future rollouts: Q4 2025 → Everyday crypto finance, faster buys, simpler transfers 2026 → Deeper trading, earning, and ecosystem integrations At each stage, TWT is the growth fuel, embedded into every new feature. Market Outlook: More Than a Meme Pump The sharp 60% pump was sparked by CZ’s spotlight, but the fundamentals suggest TWT may be at the start of a structural re-rating. Utility expansion is clear. User base scale is unmatched in the wallet space. Tokenomics reset provides long-term sustainability. With a direct tie between user actions and token value, TWT shifts from being a passive governance coin into an active driver of the Trust Wallet ecosystem. Trust Wallet just reintroduced TWT to the market, this time with clear use cases and ecosystem-wide integration. The timing couldn’t be sharper: the token broke out of a six-month downtrend with CZ’s backing and a roadmap that stretches well into 2026. For users, it means cheaper fees, real rewards, and influence. For TWT, it could mean the start of a new growth cycle. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

51990504,https://cryptonews.com/?p=425803,1758321480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51990504.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 19 September – XRP, Solana, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-19-september-xrp-solana-cardano/,"The crypto price prediction for top altcoins like XRP , Solana , and Cardano is turning bullish again, following a short cooldown after the Fed’s 0.25% rate cut . While the total market cap dipped 1% over the past 24 hours and traders locked in profits from this week’s rally, this looks more like a setup for the next leg higher. Bitcoin and Ethereum only dropped 0.5% and 1%, respectively, which are minor moves that suggest consolidation rather than a reversal. With market conditions still favorable and most tokens bouncing from oversold levels, the stage is set for weekend breakouts. XRP, SOL, and ADA are now on many traders’ watchlists, with fresh capital likely to rotate into these names in the coming days. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Set to Surge Amid Ripple Growth and ETF Approvals XRP is trading at $3.01 today after consolidating around this level for several sessions. Even with today’s flat performance, XRP remains up 6.5% in the past 14 days and 420% higher than one year ago — signaling a strong macro uptrend. More importantly, technical indicators suggest that a massive breakout may be brewing . As shown in the chart, XRP is coiling beneath the critical resistance at $3.65 — the same zone that capped gains during August. If bulls manage to reclaim this level and flip it into support, analysts expect a quick surge toward $5 , with $10 as the year-end target if momentum continues. Both the RSI (42.44) and MACD show signs of neutral-to-bullish strength, leaving room for acceleration. Meanwhile, Ripple’s continued expansion across real-world finance, including new partnerships with BBVA and Franklin Templeton , is setting a strong fundamental backdrop. And with the first XRP ETF already approved and more ETF applications pending, institutional demand could explode in Q4. If approvals land and momentum holds, this XRP price prediction remains valid: $5 by October, $10 by December . Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Institutional Demand Will Push Altcoin to New ATHs This Year At $242, Solana is down by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, yet it holds onto an 18% gain in a fortnight and a 33% increase in a month. These are very healthy percentages, and now may still be a good time to buy SOL, before it rallies later in the year. Its momentum has been growing because of the appearance of Solana treasury companies in recent weeks, including the Galaxy Digital-backed Forward Industries , which has been buying over $1 billion in SOL. At the same time, Solana is also waiting on numerous ETF applications, and if the SEC does approve the corresponding funds, then the SOL price is likely to rise strongly. Source: TradingView Its indicators do suggest that the coin should correct a little in near term, and it may experience further losses over the weekend. That said, the medium- and long-term trajectory is clearly positive, and once the aforementioned ETF approvals do arrive, the SOL price could hit new heights. It may reach $ 350 in October, before climbing towards $500+ by the New Year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – Network Growth and Grayscale ETF Can Push ADA to New Highs ADA is trading at $0.9045 , up 9% in two weeks and continuing its steady uptrend. While Cardano only has one ETF application on file, it’s from Grayscale, and Bloomberg analysts believe it is highly likely to be approved. The ADA price could therefore receive its own boost in the next few weeks, while it will also benefit from Cardano’s ongoing growth as a layer-one network. It now has a total value locked in of $383 million , making it the 19th-biggest platform in crypto. Its position is likely to increase over time, with the Cardano ecosystem witnessing significant development , and with important upgrades still on the horizon. On the technical side, MACD and RSI both suggest renewed bullish momentum , with the RSI at 55 and climbing, leaving room for significant upside. The chart shows a clean breakout above the descending wedge and a strong support trendline forming. A reclaim of the $1.32 high could trigger a move to $3 , with $5 and $10 the next targets if macro conditions align. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine-to-Earn Token Raises $1.3 Million in Presale: Next 100x Coin? As strong as the coins above seem right now, the approach bull rally will also see other tokens perform well, including newer coins. In fact, some of the newest coins may outperform the market average by considerable margins, with presale tokens in particular having the potential to do well. One such token is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new Ethereum-based coin that has taken an original approach to staking. All in a hard days work. https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/MNflyozHp2 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 18, 2025 It has now raised $1.3 million in its sale, which will run for the next few weeks, before PEPENODE launches and lists on exchanges. PEPENODE’s unique draw is that it’s the market’s first mine-to-earn token, one which offers holders the chance to build virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to acquire more virtual nodes, holders can boost their staking yields. This dynamic is likely to incentivize greater accumulation of PEPENODE, which in turn should push its price up over time. And when combined with viral Pepe memes, PEPENODE has the ingredients needed to take the market by storm once it lists. Invests can buy it now at the PEPENODE website , where the coin is currently selling for $0.001066. This price will rise repeatedly until the sale ends, so newcomers should move quickly.

SOL Strategies Inc. has secured approval to join the Nasdaq Global Select Market , where it will begin trading on September 9, 2025 under the ticker STKE. By moving onto Nasdaq, the firm expects to tap a broader base of investors, especially institutions seeking direct exposure to companies tied to Solana. The added liquidity is also seen as a major benefit for existing shareholders. Shares will automatically convert from the OTCQB Venture Market, where the company previously traded as CYFRF, while its listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange (HODL) will remain intact. For Solana investors, the move represents a meaningful bridge between blockchain innovation and U.S. capital markets, an alignment that could unlock the next wave of growth. And while Solana builds credibility through institutional channels, cultural tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are quietly gaining momentum on the retail side. CEO on a Year-Long Push Chief executive Leah Wald described the Nasdaq approval as a validation of more than a year’s worth of preparation and persistence. In a social media post, she framed the milestone as proof that both the company and Solana’s ecosystem are gaining recognition among the world’s most prominent technology players. She added that the listing provides the foundation to scale validator growth and strengthen access to U.S. capital markets. One of the company’s top priorities is expanding validator partnerships and staking operations, which are essential for Solana’s performance and security. Analysts note the timing is deliberate. The debut coincides with Solana’s recent Alpenglow upgrade , designed to accelerate throughput and efficiency on the network. With Nasdaq capital behind it, SOL Strategies hopes to play a larger role in ensuring validator infrastructure keeps pace with rising demand. Why Nasdaq Matters for Solana Wall Street’s embrace of a Solana-linked firm is more than a symbolic win. It signals the mainstreaming of Solana’s ecosystem , with new opportunities for institutional money to flow into blockchain-backed businesses. Nasdaq listings carry a reputation for higher regulatory oversight, liquidity, and visibility, all of which can attract funds that were previously cautious about entering the crypto sector. For Solana, this represents a new form of legitimacy. Beyond its technical milestones, it now has a corporate vehicle in one of the world’s most influential financial arenas. As institutional capital hunts for exposure to scalable blockchain platforms, Solana’s Nasdaq presence could ignite fresh momentum in both price action and long-term adoption. While Solana makes inroads on Wall Street, a very different story is unfolding in the presale arena. MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the spotlight with 7,000% growth predictions, making it a standout even among top-tier presales. As institutions pile into Solana, retail traders are rushing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, betting that smaller caps will deliver the truly life-changing multiples. Unlike countless presales that fade after a brief hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been defined by scarcity-driven demand . Each round has sold out faster than the last, creating a sense of urgency across both whale investors and retail participants. What sets it apart is not just marketing, but an ability to turn cultural branding into measurable momentum. For many observers, the fact that MAGACOIN FINANCE is even being discussed alongside established giants underscores how powerful its narrative has become. Where Solana represents institutional validation, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents speculative ambition—an early-stage opportunity with exponential upside potential. Parallel Stories: Institutions vs. Retail The contrast between Solana’s Nasdaq listing and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale surge highlights the two sides of today’s crypto market. On one hand, institutional adoption is strengthening, with regulatory frameworks, ETFs, and stock listings guiding billions in capital toward large-scale infrastructure plays. On the other, retail investors are chasing asymmetric returns in presales, where small allocations can snowball into transformative gains. Neither path is inherently better, they simply appeal to different strategies. Institutional plays like Solana promise long-term growth and relative stability. Cultural tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE thrive on timing, scarcity, and community energy, delivering risk but also the chance for extraordinary upside. Together, they illustrate why crypto remains one of the most diverse, and unpredictable, asset classes. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out 7,000% ROI forecasts: Analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could rival some of crypto’s most explosive breakouts. Scarcity model: Rapid sellouts across presale rounds amplify urgency and buyer confidence. Retail magnet: Smaller investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as their chance to capture DOGE- or PEPE-style multiples. Cultural branding: Positioning that resonates beyond crypto-native circles ensures broader traction. These elements make MAGACOIN FINANCE more than just another speculative token—it’s becoming a case study in how early momentum and cultural resonance can combine to drive rapid growth. Conclusion Solana’s Nasdaq debut marks a pivotal moment, bringing Wall Street capital and institutional visibility to one of crypto’s fastest networks. It validates years of progress and strengthens the case for Solana as a top-tier ecosystem. Yet, as institutions prepare to stake their claims in SOL infrastructure, retail traders are embracing a very different opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its 7,000% growth predictions and scarcity-fueled momentum , is proving to be the cultural wildcard of 2025. For investors, the smartest play may not be choosing one over the other, but recognizing how institutional milestones and presale surges together shape the next bull market.

The latest acquisition brings Bitmine’s holdings to roughly 1.95 million ETH, valued at $8.66 billion, according to Arkham data. Blockchain transaction records show a series of large transfers carried out between Galaxy Digital and Bitmine in recent hours. TOM LEE IS BUYING EVEN MORE $ETH Tom Lee’s Bitmine just bought another $69M of ETH from Galaxy Digital. They now hold $8.66 BILLION of ETH. $BMNR is bullish on $ETH . pic.twitter.com/t9BWh9btPR — Arkham (@arkham) September 19, 2025 The settlements included 3,247 ETH ($14.55 million), 3,258 ETH ($14.6 million), 4,494 ETH ($20.06 million), and 4,428 ETH ($19.77 million), totaling 15,427 ETH, about $69 million, in under an hour. The structured timing suggests coordinated OTC settlements, which allow institutional buyers to accumulate large amounts without disrupting open market prices. Bitmine Crosses 2M ETH, Controls Nearly 2% of Ethereum’s Supply The purchase underlines Bitmine’s aggressive accumulation strategy. Data shows that Ethereum accounts for nearly the entirety of its $8.65 billion portfolio, positioning the firm as the largest corporate ETH treasury holder. Other tokens in its portfolio are negligible by comparison, including minor holdings of MakerDAO’s MKR and a handful of experimental tokens with only a few thousand dollars in value. Bitmine’s latest purchase follows a series of substantial buys over recent weeks. On September 11, the company received 46,255 ETH worth $201 million from a BitGo wallet across three addresses. A week earlier, on September 4, Bitmine acquired 80,325 ETH valued at $358 million from Galaxy Digital and FalconX. These acquisitions have lifted its total stash well above 2 million ETH in circulation, equivalent to about 1.8% of Ethereum’s entire supply. According to treasury reserve data, corporate and institutional entities now collectively hold about 4.99 million ETH worth $22.2 billion, representing 4.13% of the token’s circulating supply. Bitmine leads this group with 2.15 million ETH, valued at $9.59 billion at peak pricing, followed by SharpLink Gaming with 838,000 ETH ($3.74 billion) and The Ether Machine with 495,000 ETH ($2.2 billion). Source: SER The Ethereum Foundation, by comparison, holds about 225,000 ETH, while Coinbase’s treasury sits at 136,800 ETH. The scale of Bitmine’s holdings has drawn comparisons to Strategy’s long-standing bitcoin strategy under Michael Saylor, where large corporate accumulation became a cornerstone narrative for BTC’s institutional adoption. Bitmine appears to be positioning itself as Ethereum’s equivalent, building a multi-billion-dollar ETH balance sheet as a long-term treasury reserve. Ethereum itself has been trading under pressure despite the accumulation. At the time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $4,465, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours and 4.2% over the week. Ethereum Treasury Firms Expand Holdings Amid SPAC Deals and Buybacks The competition among Ethereum treasuries is heating up as corporate strategies evolve under market pressure. On September 17, The Ether Machine, an Ethereum-focused treasury firm, filed a draft registration statement with the SEC to go public via a merger with Nasdaq-listed SPAC Dynamix Corporation. @TheEtherMachine has filed a draft registration statement with the SEC as it moves forward with plans to go public through a merger. #Ethereum #ETH https://t.co/vq7CHuD3Y7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 17, 2025 The deal, first announced in July, is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder approval. The company has built a sizable position of 495,362 ETH after adding 150,000 ETH in August . Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming announced the repurchase of 1 million shares at an average price of $16.67, part of its ongoing buyback program. Since late August, the firm has repurchased nearly 1.94 million shares , citing undervaluation as the driver. SharpLink reported a net asset value of $3.86 billion, or $18.55 per share, and confirmed it carries no outstanding debt. Analysts say Ethereum is emerging as the key beneficiary of the digital asset treasury (DAT) boom. In a report this week, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, argued that ETH-focused treasuries are better positioned than their Bitcoin and Solana counterparts. Standard Chartered said Ethereum has benefited more than Bitcoin or Solana from digital asset treasury buying, citing stronger staking yields. #Ethereum #Bitcoin #treasuries https://t.co/p5yNkvvW87 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana generate staking yield, which supports higher valuations and long-term sustainability. Since June, Ethereum treasuries have accumulated about 3.1% of the token’s circulating supply. With valuations for many DATs under pressure, consolidation is expected, but Ethereum-focused firms appear to be gaining ground.

A staggering 7,441 BTC, valued at approximately $860 million, moved from the popular exchange Coinbase to an entirely new, unknown wallet. This monumental transaction, reported by Whale Alert, immediately captured the attention of investors and market analysts alike. Such large movements often signal important shifts in the market, prompting questions about the motives behind the transfer and its potential impact on Bitcoin’s future. What Exactly Happened in This Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer? On a recent day, a significant amount of Bitcoin left the Coinbase exchange. Specifically, 7,441 BTC was transferred out. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer is notable not just for its size but also for its destination: an entirely new wallet with no known history. This means the funds are no longer on a centralized exchange, moving into a private holding. The Source: Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. The Amount: 7,441 BTC, equivalent to roughly $860 million at the time of the transfer. The Destination: An unknown, newly created wallet address. The Reporter: Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions. These movements are crucial because they involve ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Their actions can often influence market sentiment and price dynamics. Why Do These Significant Bitcoin Whale Transfers Grab Attention? When a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer occurs, it naturally sparks curiosity and analysis. The primary reason is the potential market impact. A transfer of this magnitude can be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for Bitcoin’s price and stability. Investors closely monitor these movements for clues about future market direction. For example, if a whale moves BTC to an exchange, it might signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, moving BTC off an exchange to an unknown wallet often suggests long-term holding or an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, which could be seen as a bullish signal. Understanding the Implications of Such a Bitcoin Whale Transfer What does it mean when such a large sum of Bitcoin leaves a major exchange for an unknown destination? There are several possibilities, and understanding them helps in deciphering the potential impact of this Bitcoin whale transfer . Increased Security: Moving funds off an exchange to a private wallet, often referred to as ‘cold storage,’ is a common practice for enhanced security. This protects assets from potential exchange hacks or vulnerabilities. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might be intended for an OTC sale, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without affecting the open market price. This is common for institutional investors. Long-Term Holding: The whale might be consolidating holdings for long-term investment, indicating a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Institutional Accumulation: A large institution or fund could be accumulating Bitcoin quietly, moving it to secure custody. The lack of immediate clarity creates a sense of mystery, but the move itself is a powerful indicator of significant capital at play within the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Waters: What Should Investors Do? For individual investors, news of a Bitcoin whale transfer can be a source of anxiety or excitement. However, it is important to approach such events with a measured perspective. While these transfers can influence short-term market sentiment, they don’t always dictate long-term trends. Here are some actionable insights: Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Conduct Research: Understand the broader market context, not just isolated transactions. Look at overall market sentiment, regulatory news, and fundamental developments. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Short-term whale activity should not derail a well-thought-out strategy. Consider Diversification: A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden market shifts caused by large transactions. Ultimately, these events highlight the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market, underscoring the need for informed decision-making. The recent Bitcoin whale transfer of 7,441 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is a compelling reminder of the significant capital movements that characterize the crypto space. While the exact motives remain shrouded in mystery, such large transactions underscore the growing institutional interest and the ongoing quest for secure asset management. Whether this move signals a major sale, a strategic long-term hold, or an OTC deal, it undoubtedly reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a critical asset in the global financial landscape. As the crypto market continues to evolve, these whale movements will remain a key indicator for those looking to understand the underlying currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. The exact threshold varies, but it generally refers to holders of thousands of BTC. Why do Bitcoin whales move large amounts of BTC? Whales move large amounts of BTC for various reasons, including consolidating holdings, transferring to cold storage for security, facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) trades, rebalancing portfolios, or preparing for a large sale or purchase. Does this specific Bitcoin whale transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? While a single large transaction moving off an exchange usually suggests long-term holding or an OTC deal (which are generally not bearish), the sheer size can still trigger speculation and short-term volatility. The immediate impact is often on market sentiment rather than direct price action unless the funds are moved to an exchange for selling. How can I track Bitcoin whale transfers? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. Many crypto news outlets and analytics platforms also report on significant whale movements, providing insights into potential market implications. Is it safe for a whale to move such a large amount of Bitcoin? Yes, transferring Bitcoin to a secure, private wallet (cold storage) is often considered safer than keeping it on an exchange, as it reduces exposure to exchange-specific risks like hacks or regulatory freezes. However, the security of the funds then depends entirely on the whale’s private key management. We hope this deep dive into the recent Bitcoin whale transfer has provided valuable insights.

With Bitcoin trading at over $111,000 and Ethereum closer to $4,250, compared with that psychology, putting $100 to work may not seem like too much. However, smart allocation is not the possession of an entire coin; it is positioning early on in assets that have the potential to grow. Whether this be through exchange-traded funds based on the performance of bitcoin or investment into upcoming altcoins, even small amounts can add up to meaningful profits as well. The key lies in not being tempted by chasing after meme tokens and instead looking at things with proven or growing credibility. Alongside Bitcoin and its ETFs, newer players, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are proving that $100 can make a difference in the right hands. Bitcoin: The Foundation Allocation Despite volatility, Bitcoin has been the core of crypto investing. It makes up almost 60% of the total market value and is typically the first asset built up by institutions. Its track record is quite superior: for the last ten years, no other asset has equated its long-term growth. Buying $100 of Bitcoin directly on an exchange might only give you about 0.0009 BTC, but that’s a part of a proven store of value. More importantly, it gives you exposure to what many analysts think could reach $1m within five years. That kind of upside potential makes Bitcoin a logical place to start, regardless of the size of the investment. The Case for Bitcoin ETFs For those investors who are anxious about the idea of exchanges and wallets, Bitcoin ETFs have provided a simple, regulated way to gain market access. Products such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) trade under $100 a share. That means with just one bill, you can buy the exposure to the price performance of Bitcoin; you’re not concerned with private keys and custody. These ETFs track Bitcoin on a 1:1 basis, which means that once Bitcoin is up 100% in the course of a year, your ETF shares will be too. With expense ratios as low as 0.21%, they provide cost-effective and beginner-friendly access that’s easy to scale over time. Managing Allocation With Small Capital A $100 investment might seem insignificant in the scheme of a $10,000 portfolio, but it is a starting investment allocation of 1%. From there, you can scale up or down depending on how comfortable you are. Bitcoin ETFs make things particularly easy, as investors can refine their exposure as they increase their conviction. And while Bitcoin brings stability to the crypto space, there’s still importance in diversification. Smaller tokens and cultural projects provide the sort of upside that might not be present with Bitcoin on its own. That’s where early-stage opportunities enter the conversation. For those looking for asymmetric upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is really emerging as one of the more interesting new allocations. Contrary to speculation, meme coins that disappear after a hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum through scarcity, cultural branding, and community-driven growth. Its early presale rounds have been sold in a short period of time, showing demand far ahead of widespread exchange listings. Analysts cite forecasts of 44x , and this represents a rare opportunity where even a $100 entry turns into thousands if momentum stays on track. For investors who already hold Bitcoin or Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the type of high-risk, high-reward complement that completes a portfolio strategy. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Now Cultural identity: MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just a token; it’s building a narrative that resonates far beyond crypto-native circles. Explosive upside: With projections of up to 44× gains, it represents one of the cycle’s strongest opportunities. Community momentum: Its swelling presence on Telegram and X shows conviction that can carry through multiple market phases. These qualities put MAGACOIN FINANCE in a unique position compared to other new tokens. It’s not a replacement for Bitcoin; it’s a speculative complement that could magnify returns for those nimble enough to catch it early. Building Smarter With $100 The smartest move with $100 in crypto isn’t to spread it thin across dozens of low-quality coins, but to create a balance of foundation and opportunity. Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF is the tried and tested anchor. MAGACOIN FINANCE, being one of the newer projects with explosive growth potential, offers the speculative edge. Taken together, they form a dual approach: stability plus upside. Even if you’re investing on a small scale, this approach lets you experience both the predictability and the thrill of crypto investing. Conclusion With prices soaring, $100 may not be a lot in crypto, but used wisely, it can still cause exposure of significance. Bitcoin, either directly or through ETFs, is still the focal asset. Yet, investors seeking tremendous potential are increasingly looking to high-momentum powers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. With scarcity, cultural resonance, and forecasts of up to 44X gains , MAGACOIN FINANCE is the bold allocation that makes even a modest investment count. The wisest action in today’s context is to balance the old and new, to lay the foundation while keeping open the space for explosive growth.

This move would mark a pivotal shift for one of the world’s largest crypto asset managers, bringing billions of dollars worth of ETH into active network participation. In an X post, on-chain analyst CryptoGoos has brought to light a significant development in the institutional crypto space. Grayscale is reportedly preparing to stake its massive Ethereum holdings. Although not yet confirmed, such a move, which was flagged by on-chain data following a transfer of over 40,000 ETH, is a significant signal of Grayscale’s evolving strategy and a potential game-changer for the ETH market. Why The Grayscale Move Could Accelerate Mainstream Adoption According to the data, Grayscale’s alleged transfer of a large sum of ETH is consistent with preparatory steps for staking. The firm, which holds approximately 1.5 million ETH in its various trusts, is now positioning a portion of that vast holding to earn staking rewards. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Record 36 Million ETH, Driving Structural Supply Shock If this is indeed the case, it would be a historic moment. Grayscale would become the first US-based ETH ETF sponsor to offer staking in the market, a feature that has been a point of contention with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While reports suggest Grayscale is preparing to stake ETH, market analyst TheKingfisher has issued a significant warning based on the ETH GEX+ chart, which he states is flashing a strong negative signal. This analysis centers on a key options metric known as Gamma Exposure (GEX), an indicator that provides insight into how professional traders, or dealers, are positioned in the market. The dealers are short gamma at the current implied volatility (IV) of 61 and an index price of $4,593. This dynamic is where volatility is likely to be amplified. Instead of a market that moves slowly and predictably, the ETH GEX+ signal suggests that price swings could be sudden and extreme, catching most retail traders off guard with the speed of moves. However, smart money considers the development a rare opportunity to capitalize on aggressive dealer hedging. In the meantime, this environment demands tight risk management. The Gateway To Price Discovery Ethereum price is at a pivotal point, currently consolidating between the $4,000 support level and its previous all-time high. MilkRoadDaily has also revealed that the next crucial step for ETH is a weekly close above its all-time high, which would put the asset into a phase of price discovery, where history shows the biggest moves have happened. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For $10,000: Charts Flash Parabolic Rally Signals Drawing on this historical pattern, MilkRoadDaily suggests that in the previous market cycle, ETH cleared its old highs with a parabolic run, ripping an additional 240%. If this historical pattern were to repeat itself, a similar move from its current position could project a new price target of around $16,500.

51991086,585222,1758322851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51991086.jpeg,Michigan Advances Bill To Build Crypto Reserve – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/michigan-advances-bill-to-build-crypto-reserve-details/,"Michigan lawmakers moved a bill that would let the state hold crypto assets closer to a vote, advancing House Bill 4087 to a second reading in mid-September 2025. According to reports, the proposal would change the Michigan Management and Budget Act to create a strategic crypto reserve under the control of the state treasurer. Michigan Bill Allows Up To 10% Investment The measure would let the state treasurer place up to 10% of certain state funds into qualifying digital currencies. The funds named include the countercyclical budget and the economic stabilization fund. The bill does not list a single currency by name; rather it sets rules that a digital asset must meet to qualify. Those who back the bill say this gives the state a new tool to diversify holdings and hedge inflation risks. NEW: Michigan Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill has progressed for the first time since February. HB 4087 been placed on the House second reading calendar, and referred to the Committee on Govt. Operations. The bill would allow 10% of state funds to be invested. pic.twitter.com/vN7Irm7Fr3 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) September 18, 2025 Security And Custody Rules The text would impose strict custody and security standards before any purchase is made. Reports have disclosed requirements such as exclusive government control of private keys, the use of state-regulated or bank custodians, and the option to invest through registered investment companies or exchange-traded products. The bill also calls for technical safeguards: end-to-end encryption, no access via smartphones, geographically split secure data centers, multiparty sign-offs for transactions, and regular security audits. Supporters Point To Diversification Supporters argue the rules reduce the main risks. They say a careful, limited position could protect the state from dollar weakness while offering upside. Lawmakers who introduced the bill — Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson — first filed it in February 2025, and its movement after roughly seven months of little action surprised some observers. Proponents also note that a few other US states have considered or passed similar measures. Concerns From Critics And Trade Groups Not everyone is sold. The Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council has argued the bill fails to set a market-cap floor, which could allow the state to buy smaller, less liquid tokens that swing wildly in price. Critics worry that even with custody rules, crypto’s sharp ups and downs could leave public dollars exposed. Implementation questions remain too: who will manage key recovery, how audits will be handled, and how losses would be covered in a severe market drop. Political And Practical Risks Reports say the bill now sits with the Committee on Government Operations and could face close scrutiny in committee hearings. If passed, Michigan would join a small group of states that have moved to let public treasurers hold crypto.

With ADA currently priced at around $0.83 , traders are watching closely to see if renewed demand can fuel a breakout similar to its past rallies. Meanwhile, the broader market is eyeing Bitcoin and Ethereum as barometers of sentiment, but rotation flows suggest investors are also looking beyond the majors. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught attention not just for growth potential but also for the credibility that comes with its completed audits, setting it apart in a crowded field of presale tokens. ADA’s Road Toward $2 ADA’s recent uptick is being driven in part by large wallet holders increasing exposure. On-chain trackers show whale addresses accumulating steadily, a pattern that has often preceded bullish moves in previous cycles. If momentum continues, analysts argue that ADA could test $1.20–$1.50 in the near term, with $2 being the bigger psychological target for the community. Cardano’s ongoing development progress also underpins confidence. The network’s Hydra scaling solution is designed to expand throughput, while updates to its governance model make ADA one of the more actively evolving proof-of-stake blockchains. Combined with its strong developer ecosystem, Cardano remains a consistent long-term player. Still, the climb back to $2 will require more than whale accumulation. ADA must break resistance zones and attract new liquidity inflows, which could hinge on broader crypto market conditions. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to strengthen, ADA could benefit from capital rotation into high-cap altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Security Comes in First Place In contrast to established giants like Cardano, newer projects are under constant scrutiny to prove legitimacy. That’s where this emerging player has carved out an advantage – it has already undergone independent smart contract audits by respected firms before its full public launch. This is not a trivial step. Audits reduce risk of contract flaws, exploits, or rug-pull events, and they provide confidence for cautious investors. In a market where scams and vulnerabilities regularly wipe out millions, the assurance of a third-party check makes a real difference. Compared to ADA, which already enjoys credibility from years of operation, this newcomer demonstrates a proactive stance on transparency. And unlike many presales that delay security reviews until later, this project’s audits were completed early, giving investors a rare blend of growth potential and peace of mind. Market Rotation and Investor Flows Investor behavior often rotates between major caps like BTC and ETH, mid-cap altcoins like ADA, and riskier early-stage tokens. Right now, ADA’s whale accumulation highlights interest in assets with a mix of credibility and potential for price expansion. But presale opportunities are gaining traction too, as investors look to capture exponential returns not available in established coins. That’s why audited presales stand out. By reducing the risk factor, they offer exposure to upside while minimizing one of the biggest deterrents – trust. This has made MAGACOIN FINANCE particularly attractive in recent months, as traders diversify from ADA and other names. For many, the logic is simple: ADA may double, but a presale token with audits and traction could multiply far more if execution is strong. Risks on the Horizon For ADA, the main risks remain its slower development pace and stiff competition from faster, cheaper chains. While Cardano excels in community governance and stability, some traders argue that momentum-driven markets favor networks with more aggressive expansion. Regulatory scrutiny of staking tokens is another factor that could weigh on ADA’s growth in certain regions. For the new project, the risks center around delivery. Audits confirm security but cannot guarantee execution. Investors must watch roadmap milestones, community growth, and liquidity conditions after launch. Still, the presence of completed audits helps position it ahead of peers in terms of credibility. Conclusion Whales are fueling speculation that ADA could revisit $2 in the coming months, supported by development upgrades and a loyal community. But as capital rotates across the market, investors are also eyeing new opportunities. Projects that arrive with the reassurance of independent audits stand out, and that’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is being closely watched. In a cycle where trust and growth potential both matter, this balance could prove decisive in determining which names outperform.

Kraken Just Turned Up with Direct USD to XRP,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-set-for-20-run-kraken-just-turned-up-with-direct-usd-to-xrp/,"Chad Steingraber, a prominent figure in the crypto space, has drawn attention to an important market development involving XRP. In a recent post, he reported that Kraken had introduced direct USD-to-XRP trading and noted an inflow of $8.16 million, sharing graphics that illustrated the movement of funds across major exchanges. Steingraber, who frequently comments on digital asset activity, used the post to emphasize a notable increase in XRP trading volumes, which he believes could swiftly send XRP to $20 price level. Kraken just turned up with DIRECT USD to XRP!! $8.16Million just flooded in… https://t.co/gc9B8H6e0G pic.twitter.com/ZdR2U8oGQW — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) September 18, 2025 Chart Shows Heavy Inflows to Kraken The chart in Steingraber’s post displays a heatmap tracking XRP movement across exchanges. According to the data shown, Kraken recorded a net inflow of $8.16 million in XRP/USD trading, significantly larger than the figures from other exchanges on the chart. Binance followed with $2.02 million, while Coinbase, Bybit, and others saw smaller inflows. This visualization highlights the size of the inflows on Kraken compared with its competitors, and shows the high demand for XRP and Kraken’s direct trading pair. The figures are especially striking because they show direct USD-to-XRP movement on Kraken, an option that not all major exchanges support. By emphasizing the direct USD pair, Steingraber’s post drew attention to increasing liquidity and easier access for traders. Large net inflows on a single exchange can signal strong buying interest , especially when contrasted with lower activity elsewhere. Market Optimism and Price Expectations Alongside the inflow announcement, Steingraber previously expressed his outlook for XRP’s price. He wrote , “When XRP makes its first run to $20 soon, there’s gonna be a lot of hate and anger. Don’t worry, they’re just jealous.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This statement reflects confidence in XRP’s future performance and indicates his belief that the asset could reach a substantially higher price. While price predictions are speculative, Steingraber’s remark captures optimism among XRP supporters at a time of rising volumes. A Positive Signal for XRP Such high-volume inflows, particularly from a direct USD trading pair, can boost liquidity and trading depth. Increased liquidity generally benefits active traders and may reduce slippage on large orders. This environment can also help establish a more robust market for institutional participants who may prefer exchanges with higher liquidity and fiat currency options.

This bullish structure often signals an explosive breakout. Right now, SHIB is pressing against the upper boundary of this wedge. With market sentiment turning favorable and momentum building, a breakout appears imminent. Trading volumes have surged in recent days, consistently holding between $200 million and $300 million — a range that typically accompanies major trend reversals. Combined with this technical retest, SHIB looks poised to push above the $0.00001500 mark. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained in a steady uptrend and currently sits above 50, reinforcing the case for continued strength. A breakout above $0.000017 would likely confirm a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction , unlocking upside targets of $0.000035 and even $0.0001. That would represent a 680% surge for the second-largest meme coin. But while SHIB prepares for liftoff, early investors are turning their attention to Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a high-potential presale that’s already raised $2 million and could leave legacy meme coins in the dust once it hits major exchanges. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): The Meme Coin Going All-In With 1000x Leverage Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that fully embraces the ‘up only’ attitude that typically comes with crypto bull markets. This dog-themed token is what happens when a Shiba Inu takes too many Red Bulls for breakfast and stares for too long at price charts. Through the Maxi Fund, the project will allocate up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds on the most promising tokens. The size of these positions will be boosted by using 1000X leverage to reap the highest returns as the market keeps pumping. To join the $MAXI presale early, simply head to the Maxi Doge official website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto or use a bank card to invest.

This pivotal move, confirmed by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, marks a major step for the digital asset custodian. BitGo, a crucial player in securing digital assets for institutions, confidentially submitted its initial public offering (IPO) documents back in July. This development follows a successful August 2023 funding round where the company raised $100 million, achieving a robust valuation of $1.75 billion. For many, this moment highlights the growing maturity of the crypto industry, potentially bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset landscape. What Does the BitGo IPO Mean for the Crypto Ecosystem? An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is when a private company first offers its shares to the public. For BitGo, a company deeply embedded in the digital asset space, pursuing an IPO carries immense significance beyond just raising capital. It’s about legitimizing the crypto industry further in the eyes of mainstream investors and regulators. This move introduces a new level of transparency and scrutiny to a sector often perceived as opaque. Increased Legitimacy: A successful BitGo IPO could enhance the credibility of digital assets by demonstrating that crypto companies can meet stringent public market requirements. Regulatory Scrutiny: Going public means adhering to strict SEC regulations, which can set a precedent for other crypto firms considering similar paths. Mainstream Adoption: Publicly traded crypto companies make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to the digital asset market without directly holding cryptocurrencies. The influx of capital from an IPO can also fuel BitGo’s expansion, allowing it to innovate further in secure digital asset custody and other services. Navigating the Path to a BitGo IPO: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospect of a BitGo IPO is exciting, the journey to becoming a publicly traded company is complex, especially in the crypto sector. The regulatory environment in the U.S. remains uncertain for digital assets, requiring BitGo to navigate carefully and ensure full compliance with all SEC requirements. This process can be demanding for any company. However, significant opportunities also lie ahead. BitGo’s established position as a leading digital asset custodian gives it a unique advantage. Institutions increasingly seek secure, regulated solutions for holding cryptocurrencies, and BitGo is well-positioned to meet this demand. The IPO could provide the necessary capital to scale its operations, enhance technology, and expand its global reach, solidifying its role as a trusted partner for institutional investors. BitGo’s Journey: From Funding Rounds to an Impending IPO BitGo’s path to this milestone has been marked by strategic growth and substantial investment. The company’s ability to raise $100 million in August 2023, securing a $1.75 billion valuation, underscores investor confidence in its business model and the growing need for robust digital asset infrastructure. This funding round demonstrated the market’s recognition of BitGo’s critical role in providing secure, compliant solutions for institutional clients. BitGo offers a comprehensive suite of services, including: Digital Asset Custody: Securely storing cryptocurrencies for institutions. Trading Solutions: Facilitating institutional-grade crypto trading. Prime Brokerage Services: Offering integrated solutions for large-scale crypto investors. These services are vital for attracting traditional financial players to the digital asset market. The impending BitGo IPO highlights the maturation of the crypto industry, moving beyond speculative trading to embrace fundamental infrastructure and regulatory compliance. In conclusion, BitGo’s submission of its IPO filing to the SEC is a truly landmark event for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a significant stride towards greater institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. As BitGo prepares to make its debut on the public markets, it paves the way for a more integrated and mature financial ecosystem where digital assets play an increasingly vital role. This is not just an IPO; it’s a testament to the enduring potential and evolving legitimacy of the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is BitGo?

As traders look for the best altcoin to buy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention for its safety-first approach and ongoing audits, making it a standout choice in a shifting market. Bitcoin whales offload billions in September Bitcoin whales have been on a selling spree throughout September, moving billions of dollars’ worth of BTC across exchanges. According to on-chain data, wallets that had been dormant for nearly a decade have suddenly begun transferring large amounts, creating waves across the market. One whale alone sold more than $4 billion worth of Bitcoin for Ethereum last month, and has since resumed selling as Bitcoin touched $116,000 for the first time in weeks. Lookonchain tracked the whale depositing 1,176 BTC (worth $136 million) into trading platforms, which kicked off fresh selling. This activity follows a massive 115,000 BTC sell-off worth $12.7 billion, the largest since mid-2022. Analysts note that these moves have pressured Bitcoin’s price structure in the short term, keeping it below the $116,000 line despite several retests. For traders, the takeaway is clear: whale movements often signal where capital is rotating next — and many are now eyeing altcoins. Ethereum swap highlights sentiment shift The same whale that sold 35,991 BTC for Ethereum earlier this month offers an important clue to market behavior. By rotating out of Bitcoin into ETH, the whale essentially signaled that “smart money” is searching for better opportunities outside BTC. Even though the ETH/BTC ratio remains flat near 0.0401, Ethereum has gained nearly 6% over the past month. This shows that whales are not just reducing exposure to Bitcoin but are also diversifying their holdings. The scale of these swaps matters because it highlights how capital rotation works in crypto cycles. When whales reduce Bitcoin exposure, attention often turns to the best altcoins to buy during a dip, giving smaller projects the chance to shine. Bitcoin price struggles near $116,000 Bitcoin has been flatlining around the $116,000 mark after hitting a local peak above $124,000 in mid-August. It has since dropped around 7%, moving in a tight band between $110,000 and $116,000. This stagnant action comes even as on-chain metrics suggest long-term stability. Analysts point out that despite whale dumping, institutional buyers and ETF inflows are providing balance. Still, traders should be cautious, as heavy whale activity can continue to weigh on price action in the near term. For smaller players, this range-bound movement is frustrating — but it also sets the stage for capital to flow into altcoins that carry strong narratives and trust factors. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is on trader radars As Bitcoin whales trigger uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being noticed as one of the best altcoins to buy in this dip. Its focus on safety and security appeals to traders who want stability even in volatile times. Audited for safety — CertiK ongoing, HashEx completed Security-first design with anti-phishing protocols Active community presence driving adoption For traders watching capital rotate out of Bitcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a safer and cheaper way to get exposure to an altcoin backed by transparent practices. Positioning in this market With whales selling billions in Bitcoin, altcoins are set to attract fresh attention. Traders should prepare by diversifying into projects that emphasize security and transparency, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Timing matters, and waiting too long could mean missing the early entry advantage. Visit MAGACOIN FINANCE today to explore before the next move.

With the XRP and Solana ETFs under consideration, the institutions and retail traders alike are preparing for a pivotal moment. The regulators will signal if approval is near or if the delay is still the dominant theme. The outcomes of this will shape the next phase of the momentum. XRP and Solana will join Bitcoin and Ethereum in providing institutional-grade access to all investors around the world if green lights are afforded. If delays continue, frustration may lead to selling of assets across the board in the market with a focus on altcoins. Right now, investors are glued to the regulatory calendar, knowing October can make or break the quarter. At the moment all eyes are on ETFs, but some are starting to bring up MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next altcoin to watch. Solana’s ETF Push and Market Confidence Solana has been recovering after suffering outages and resilience queries over a period of time. The Ethereum network has managed to reestablish itself among the top-performing Layer-1 networks thanks to its renewed stability and regional NFT and gaming ecosystems. A Solana ETF would bring a wave of mainstream adoption for a blockchain that is often praised for its speed and scalability. The institutions are on board, but there are concerning regulatory ambiguities. The issue is whether regulators can be talked into giving the green light for ETF approvals to anything other than Bitcoin and Ethereum so soon. Solana could have its own moment of XRP like surge in October that could either make or break adoption. Recent analysis suggests MAGACOIN FINANCE could skyrocket 45×. It’s being compared with Solana and XRP. The very fact they’re comparing it to institutional favorites is telling a strong narrative that we think this presale could do the impossible. MAGACOIN FINANCE didn’t just rely on hype like other presales but achieved growth thanks to scarcity and quick sellouts in multiple rounds. As allocations continue to be taken up in fast succession, the sense of urgency builds and the signal of real demand emerges. It has a strong brand and cultural positioning that appeals to a more mainstream audience beyond the crypto-native. It’s no longer a question of if MAGACOIN FINANCE will do well but rather how great of a force with continued momentum. Those investors watching on the sideline as the XRP and Solana ETFs attempt to begin trading have a different story to buy into: an early entry, a cultural energy, and the likelihood of exponential returns without worrying about regulatory approval. That story is MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s ETF Battle for Legitimacy Regulatory challenges have made XRP a loser in the battle for market position on more than one occasion. The hope of institutional validation has renewed thanks to the optimism surrounding an ETF. People think that the XRP ETF will bring large amounts of liquidity from the money that it will release. But uncertainty lingers. Recent filings suggest the SEC still cautious, and we won’t have clarity for some time. This puts October into clear view. If approval occurs, true demand will likely be triggered and prevent XRP from making progress. In contrast, if this continues to hesitate, we could see XRP remain stagnant beneath key resistance. Currently, traders view October as an important moment for XRP to prove its legitimacy on Wall Street. The October Trade-Off The crypto market will face tests in October when XRP and Solana ETFs get important decisions. If it is approved, institutional adoption could ramp up. If it is delayed, investors will be upset. In this situation, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a presale token that is being compared to the giants and is currently getting predicted for 45× growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE proves that, for those who don’t want to wait on the regulators’ press release, sometimes the biggest stories are under the radar. As October rolls around, investors must decide: wait for the ETF clock or ride the wave already building in presales. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Explosive projections: Forecasts suggest 45× ROI , putting it in the conversation with some of crypto’s biggest breakouts. Scarcity-driven demand: Every presale round has sold out faster than the last, highlighting urgency and strong appetite. Cultural resonance: MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured attention as more than just a token, it’s becoming a movement. Comparisons to giants: Being discussed alongside Solana and XRP underscores its growing legitimacy in analyst circles. These factors show why MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out in a crowded field. While XRP and Solana battle regulators for ETF approval, MAGACOIN is accelerating through momentum, branding, and investor conviction. Conclusion In October, important decisions on XRP and Solana ETFs will test the crypto market. If it is approved, institutional adoption could ramp up. If it is delayed, investors will be upset. In this case, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a presale token compared to giants and is now predicted to achieve 45× growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that sometimes the biggest story is the one that most people are ignoring, for those who don’t want to wait on the regulators. With October around the corner, investors will have to choose. Wait for the ETF launch or get on board presales.

At around $3.05 , XRP has already attracted billions in whale accumulation and continues to benefit from its role in global payments. Avalanche (AVAX), trading near $37.20 , is also gaining recognition for its rapid throughput and growing ecosystem. But while both XRP and AVAX are respected names with bullish forecasts, many investors are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the project with the ability to outpace them both in raw upside. Why Analysts See a 470% Rally for XRP The optimism around XRP stems from whale accumulation and technical setups. With whales now holding over $2.1 billion worth of tokens, supply on exchanges is tightening. If XRP clears major resistance levels at $3.30–$3.50 , technical targets point toward $15–$16 in the longer term, equating to a potential 470% gain from current levels. Ripple’s progress in the payments sector also underpins this outlook. Partnerships with financial institutions and ongoing regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions are creating a stronger use case. However, XRP’s large market cap means that moves of this size require huge inflows, making rallies slower to materialize than in smaller-cap tokens. AVAX Gains Momentum Avalanche has built a strong reputation as one of the faster and more efficient Layer-1 blockchains. With AVAX priced around $37.20 , it continues to grow in DeFi, GameFi, and enterprise solutions. Its subnets model allows customized blockchains, which has attracted developers and institutions alike. Analysts believe that AVAX could climb toward $70–$100 in the next cycle if adoption accelerates. While that represents a significant gain, it still pales in comparison to what smaller-cap projects can deliver when they gain traction. Like XRP, Avalanche offers a strong foundation but less explosive upside due to its size. Where Bigger Gains Could Be Found This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Unlike XRP or AVAX, which need billions in liquidity to move multiples higher, MAGACOIN is at an early stage with room to grow dramatically. Analysts point to the possibility that MAGACOIN could outpace XRP’s projected 470% and AVAX’s 200% by delivering exponential gains as adoption spreads. The reasoning is simple: XRP and AVAX are established players with slower growth curves, while MAGACOIN has a smaller starting base and a presale community already demonstrating strong momentum. Early-stage entries historically provide the biggest returns, as seen with SHIB or DOGE in prior cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines that early entry point with a clear roadmap and transparent structure, reducing risks often seen in presale tokens. For investors, the choice is not necessarily between XRP, AVAX, and MAGACOIN—it’s about balance. But those chasing outsized multiples know that smaller-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN have the edge when it comes to raw upside potential. Comparing Risk and Reward Both XRP and AVAX remain solid long-term bets. XRP benefits from whale support and real-world adoption in payments, while AVAX has technical strengths and ecosystem growth. Their risks—regulatory hurdles for XRP and competitive pressure for AVAX—are notable but manageable. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s risk comes from being early-stage: execution, roadmap delivery, and market adoption are critical. But the reward side of the equation is significantly larger. While XRP may deliver a 4-5x and AVAX a 2-3x, MAGACOIN is positioned to potentially outpace them many times over if its launch trajectory follows through. Conclusion XRP’s potential 470% rally and AVAX’s growth to higher price targets keep them both strong choices in the current market. Yet, for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as the project with the potential to outpace both . In a market defined by risk and reward, XRP and AVAX offer relative stability, but MAGACOIN could be the one that turns small allocations into life-changing outcomes.

Recently, Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran delivered a significant statement, indicating his expectation for additional Fed rate cuts in the coming months. This news is a crucial development that could reshape market dynamics, influencing everything from lending rates to investment sentiment across various asset classes, including digital currencies. What Do Expected Fed Rate Cuts Mean for the Economy? Governor Miran’s remarks follow a previous move by the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points (bp). His current stance suggests a continued dovish approach, with plans to advocate for swift interest rate cuts among fellow policymakers. But what does this really signify? Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates typically make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can encourage spending and investment, thereby stimulating economic activity. Inflation Management: While rate hikes combat inflation, rate cuts can sometimes risk accelerating it. However, if the Fed believes inflation is under control or economic growth needs a boost, cuts become more appealing. Market Reaction: Financial markets often react positively to expected rate cuts, as they can lead to higher corporate profits and increased liquidity. Why is Miran Pushing for Further Interest Rate Cuts ? The Federal Reserve’s primary mandate involves maintaining maximum employment and stable prices. When economic indicators suggest a slowdown, or when inflation appears to be cooling, the Fed often considers adjusting its monetary policy. Governor Miran’s advocacy for more interest rate cuts likely stems from an assessment that the economy could benefit from further stimulus, or that existing inflationary pressures are sufficiently mitigated. His intention to persuade other policymakers highlights that such decisions are not unilateral. They involve careful consideration and consensus-building among the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who weigh various economic data points and forecasts. How Might These Fed Rate Cuts Impact Your Finances? The prospect of additional Fed rate cuts carries broad implications for everyday finances and investment portfolios. Understanding these potential shifts can help individuals and businesses make informed decisions. Borrowing Costs: Expect to see lower rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit card interest. This could be an opportune time for refinancing or taking on new debt for large purchases. Savings Returns: On the flip side, interest earned on savings accounts, CDs, and money market funds might decrease. Savers might need to explore alternative investment avenues for better returns. Stock Market: Generally, lower rates are favorable for stock markets as they reduce borrowing costs for companies and make equity investments more attractive compared to bonds. Cryptocurrency Market: Lower interest rates can increase liquidity in the broader financial system. This often translates to increased investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, as traditional fixed-income returns diminish. This potential shift underscores a period where vigilance and adaptability will be key for investors, especially those with exposure to volatile assets like digital currencies. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After Expected Fed Rate Cuts ? As Governor Miran pushes for more Fed rate cuts , market participants will be closely watching for subsequent announcements and economic data. Key indicators like inflation reports, employment figures, and GDP growth will continue to influence the Fed’s decisions. The coming months are set to be a dynamic period, where economic policy could significantly shape financial landscapes globally. Staying informed about these developments is crucial. The impact of these decisions can ripple through various sectors, from housing to technology, and certainly into the burgeoning world of digital assets. Prepare for potential shifts and consider how a lower interest rate environment might affect your financial strategies. In conclusion, Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran’s expectation for additional Fed rate cuts signals a potentially transformative period for the economy. His commitment to persuading other policymakers suggests a strong push towards further monetary easing. This bold outlook could provide a much-needed boost to economic activity, while also prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming months will reveal the extent of these changes and their long-term effects. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Fed rate cuts? Fed rate cuts refer to the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. This benchmark interest rate influences other interest rates throughout the economy, making borrowing cheaper and potentially stimulating economic growth. 2. How do interest rate cuts impact inflation? Lowering interest rates can make borrowing and spending more attractive, which can increase demand for goods and services. If demand outpaces supply, it can lead to higher prices, potentially accelerating inflation. However, the Fed considers many factors before making such decisions. 3. What does 25 bp mean? 25 bp stands for 25 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. So, a 25 bp rate cut means the interest rate was lowered by 0.25%. 4. How might Fed rate cuts affect the cryptocurrency market? Lower interest rates can make traditional, safer investments (like bonds) less attractive due to reduced returns. This often encourages investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up demand and prices in the crypto market. 5. Who is Steven Miran?

Way too much.” The post reprises his data-driven commentary from early 2024, when he argued that “#Bitcoin could reach $112K this year driven by ETF inflows, worst-case $55K.” That framework came conspicuously close: Bitcoin went on to register a 2024 high above $108,000, narrowly under his $112,000 projection. Why Bitcoin Price Could Top Above $208,000 The chart Ki published on September 18 visualizes three time series derived from CryptoQuant’s realized-cap methodology: the spot price of BTC (black), a model “ceiling_price” (red) and a model “floor_price” (green). As of 17 September 2025 (UTC), the panel annotated a spot marker at $116,453, a ceiling at $208,310 and a floor at $41,662, with the dashboard showing it was “last run” two hours prior. In other words, the model currently locates Bitcoin well above its inferred floor and still materially below the band it treats as an overvaluation zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds $117,500 On Retail Support While Whales Stay Quiet – Cause For Concern? The implication of Ki’s share is not a guarantee, but a statement that, given prevailing on-chain capital inflows and the realized-cap structure, the market has room—by this metric—to extend toward that $208,000 upper band. Realized cap values the network by summing each coin at the price it last moved on-chain rather than the current market price, a construction that tends to track investor cost basis over time. CryptoQuant’s dashboard projects dynamic “floor” and “ceiling” bands around spots that, historically, have framed multi-year expansions and contractions. Ki’s renewed bullishness ties those bands to what he describes as surging demand pressure visible in settlement flows and ETF-linked capital migration onto the network. The continuity with his February 2024 note is explicit: then he cited exchange-traded product inflows as the dominant driver of an advance toward six figures; now he points to “too much capital inflows onchain” while circulating a model that places the ceiling near $208,000. Related Reading: $1 Million Bitcoin Is Coming: Arthur Hayes Says Fed Just Pulled The Trigger It is noteworthy that Ki is not presenting an open-ended forecast but rather a model snapshot that updates with market structure. The same dashboard that prints a $208,310 ceiling today also marks the risk floor at $41,662, underscoring the spread of outcomes the realized-cap approach contemplates. His track record with the $112,000 “this year” guidance—followed by a print just above $108,000—will inevitably color how traders receive the new post. But the framing remains analytical: a data readout of where Bitcoin sits relative to its realized-value envelope after a year and a half defined by US spot ETF adoption and deepening institutional participation. For now, Ki’s message is simple and blunt—“I’m bullish on Bitcoin”—and anchored in the same on-chain lens he used 10 months ahead of the 2024 peak. Whether the market ultimately approaches the model’s $208,000 ceiling will depend on how those on-chain inflows evolve against macro liquidity, ETF and corporate treasury demand as well as miners’ supply behavior. What his chart makes clear is that, by CryptoQuant’s realized-cap bands, Bitcoin has not yet tested the top of its statistical range in this cycle. At press time, BTC traded at $116,173.

Grayscale has officially submitted a revised S-1 application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to transform its existing closed-end Dogecoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This development could mark a pivotal moment for Dogecoin, potentially opening doors to a wider range of investors. If approved, this Dogecoin ETF is slated to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GDOG, as reported by The Block. This action highlights the growing institutional interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Exactly is a Dogecoin ETF, and Why Does it Matter? An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities. These funds trade on stock exchanges just like regular stocks. A Dogecoin ETF would directly hold Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly buying and storing it themselves. This structure offers several key benefits: Accessibility: It simplifies investing in Dogecoin for traditional investors who might be hesitant about crypto exchanges or digital wallets. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like NYSE Arca provides a familiar and secure environment. Diversification: It allows for easier portfolio diversification within traditional investment accounts. Therefore, a Dogecoin ETF could significantly broaden the investment landscape for this popular meme coin. Grayscale’s Ambitious Journey: Paving the Way for a Dogecoin ETF Grayscale has a long history of pioneering crypto investment products. They are well-known for their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which have provided institutional and accredited investors with access to digital assets for years. Their persistent efforts have often pushed the boundaries of crypto integration into traditional finance. This revised S-1 application for a Dogecoin ETF demonstrates Grayscale’s continued commitment to expanding investment opportunities for a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Their experience in navigating the complex regulatory environment with the SEC positions them as a key player in this ongoing evolution. They are clearly leveraging their expertise to bring more digital assets into the mainstream. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: The SEC’s Stance on a Dogecoin ETF The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically approached cryptocurrency ETFs with caution, primarily due to concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a significant shift in their stance. The SEC will thoroughly review Grayscale’s application, considering factors such as market surveillance, liquidity, and the underlying asset’s resilience. Approving a Dogecoin ETF would signal a further maturation of the crypto market in the eyes of regulators. The outcome will depend on Grayscale’s ability to address these regulatory concerns effectively. Potential Impact: How Could a Dogecoin ETF Reshape DOGE’s Future? If the Dogecoin ETF receives approval, its impact on DOGE could be substantial. Such a product could: Increase Liquidity: Attract more capital, leading to higher trading volumes and potentially more stable prices. Boost Legitimacy: Elevate Dogecoin’s status from a ‘meme coin’ to a more credible, institutional-grade asset. Attract New Investors: Open the floodgates for traditional investors and institutions who prefer regulated investment vehicles. Moreover, the approval could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs, signaling a broader acceptance of diverse digital assets in the financial world. This would be a significant step for the entire crypto ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What Are the Next Steps for the Dogecoin ETF? The submission of a revised S-1 application is an important step, but it is part of a longer process. The SEC will now review the updated filing, which typically involves periods of public comment and further deliberation. There is no fixed timeline for approval, and the process can often extend over several months. Market participants will be closely watching for any announcements from the SEC. The potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF could undoubtedly spark considerable excitement and investment activity around DOGE. Conversely, a rejection could lead to temporary price volatility. Investors should stay informed about these regulatory developments. In conclusion, Grayscale’s revised application for a Dogecoin ETF represents a monumental effort to integrate Dogecoin further into the mainstream financial system. While the path to approval involves navigating complex regulatory hurdles, the potential benefits for Dogecoin’s liquidity, legitimacy, and investor accessibility are immense. This move underscores the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market and its increasing convergence with traditional finance. The crypto community eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, which could profoundly shape the future trajectory of Dogecoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Dogecoin ETF?

NYSE Arca has taken a bold step, submitting a revised proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to apply recently relaxed ETF listing standards to the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF , including its Mini version. This move could fundamentally reshape how investors access Ethereum through traditional financial markets. What’s Driving the Push for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? This pivotal action by NYSE Arca follows a crucial prior approval by the SEC. The regulatory body recently greenlit a rule change that automatically streamlines ETF listings for cryptocurrencies. Specifically, this applies to those digital assets that have traded as futures for over six months on a derivatives exchange licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This means such cryptocurrencies no longer require a separate, often lengthy, review process for their ETF applications. For the first time, this new, more efficient pathway is being directly applied to the eagerly anticipated Grayscale Ethereum ETFs . Unpacking the SEC’s Relaxed Rules: A Game Changer for Ethereum? The SEC’s decision to relax its ETF listing standards marks a significant shift in its approach to cryptocurrency-backed financial products. Previously, each ETF application underwent an extensive, individual review. This often led to delays and uncertainty for issuers. Now, the automatic greenlight for certain futures-backed cryptocurrencies removes a major hurdle. This change acknowledges the maturity and regulatory oversight already present in the CFTC-licensed futures markets. For Grayscale Ethereum ETFs , this could mean a much quicker journey to market, opening up new avenues for investors. This development is particularly exciting because it signifies a growing acceptance of crypto assets within traditional finance, albeit under specific conditions. It reflects a maturing regulatory landscape that seeks to balance innovation with investor protection. What Benefits Could Grayscale Ethereum ETFs Bring to Investors? The potential approval of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs under these new rules could unlock several key advantages for investors: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors, who might be hesitant to directly buy and store Ethereum, could gain exposure through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle like an ETF. Institutional Adoption: The streamlined process may encourage more institutional investors to allocate capital to Ethereum, potentially boosting its market stability and liquidity. Enhanced Market Transparency: ETFs trade on regulated exchanges, offering a layer of transparency and oversight that can build investor confidence. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Ethereum exposure through an ETF could offer new diversification opportunities for a balanced investment portfolio. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? While the relaxed rules offer a promising path, the journey for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs is not entirely without potential challenges. The SEC, despite its new framework, still maintains a level of discretion in its approval process. Here are some points to consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: Even with a more automatic process, the SEC will likely continue to scrutinize the underlying markets and the structure of the ETFs to ensure investor protection. Market Volatility: Ethereum, like other cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. This inherent characteristic will remain a consideration for both regulators and potential investors. Ongoing Dialogue: Issuers like Grayscale will need to maintain a constructive dialogue with regulators, addressing any concerns that may arise during the final stages of approval. This revised proposal is a testament to the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. It highlights a proactive approach by market participants like NYSE Arca to adapt to and leverage new regulatory frameworks, ultimately benefiting investors and the broader digital asset ecosystem. The move by NYSE Arca to apply these relaxed listing standards to Grayscale Ethereum ETFs is a landmark event. It signals a growing maturity in the crypto market and a willingness from traditional financial institutions to embrace digital assets. While final approval is still pending, this development undoubtedly brings us closer to a future where Ethereum is more seamlessly integrated into mainstream investment portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of NYSE Arca’s revised proposal for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs? A1: NYSE Arca is proposing to use recently relaxed SEC rules that streamline ETF listings for cryptocurrencies with established futures markets. This could significantly expedite the approval process for Grayscale Ethereum ETFs , making them available to investors sooner. Q2: How do the SEC’s relaxed ETF listing standards work? A2: The new rule allows for automatic approval of ETFs for cryptocurrencies that have traded as futures for over six months on a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange, bypassing a lengthy individual review. Q3: What are the potential benefits of Grayscale Ethereum ETFs for investors? A3: They could offer easier access to Ethereum for traditional investors, attract more institutional capital, provide enhanced market transparency, and offer new opportunities for portfolio diversification. Q4: Are Grayscale Ethereum ETFs guaranteed to be approved now? A4: While the relaxed rules provide a more direct pathway, final approval still rests with the SEC. The proposal is a significant step, but it is not an automatic guarantee of immediate listing. Q5: What is the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and its Mini version? A5: These are proposed exchange-traded funds from Grayscale designed to hold Ethereum, offering investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning it. The Mini version is typically designed for lower expense ratios or different market segments. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Understanding market sentiment is absolutely crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes into play. This powerful tool offers a fascinating snapshot of investor psychology, helping us gauge whether the market is leaning towards panic or euphoria. Recently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dipped slightly to 48, settling firmly in the neutral zone. But what does this mean for you and your crypto journey? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index acts like a psychological barometer for the cryptocurrency market. Developed by Alternative.me, it distills complex market dynamics into a single, easy-to-understand number. Its primary goal is to illustrate whether market participants are feeling overly fearful or excessively greedy. This index operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are panicking, often seen as a potential buying opportunity by contrarians. 25-49: Fear – General anxiety and uncertainty in the market. 50-74: Greed – Investors are getting excited and eager, sometimes leading to irrational exuberance. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is overheating, often a signal for potential corrections. Currently, with the index at 48, we find ourselves in a neutral position. This suggests a balance between fear and greed, indicating that the market isn’t showing strong directional sentiment from the crowd. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Unveiling the Metrics It’s important to understand that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated calculation based on several key factors. Each component contributes to the final score, offering a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of what goes into it: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. High volatility often signals a fearful market. Trading Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a negative market can indicate strong selling pressure, while high volumes during price surges can show strong buying interest. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzing sentiment around crypto-related hashtags and discussions on platforms like Twitter provides insights into public mood. Surveys (15%): While paused at times, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be flocking to Bitcoin as a perceived safe haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto bubble’ can reveal underlying fear or greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a holistic and dynamic representation of the market’s mood, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a powerful tool. Navigating Neutrality: What Does 48 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signify? A reading of 48, squarely in the neutral zone, presents an interesting scenario. It means that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the market narrative. Instead, there’s a delicate balance. This can be interpreted in several ways: Uncertainty: Investors might be hesitant, waiting for clearer signals before committing to major moves. Consolidation: Prices might be moving sideways, as buyers and sellers reach a temporary equilibrium. Precursor to a Move: Neutrality can often precede a significant market movement, either upwards or downwards, as the market gathers momentum for its next trend. For traders, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests a time for caution and observation. It’s less about making impulsive decisions and more about preparing for potential shifts. This is when careful analysis of other indicators becomes even more vital. Actionable Insights for Traders: Leveraging the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct buy or sell signal, it is an invaluable tool when integrated into a broader trading strategy. Think of it as an emotional compass for the market. Here are some actionable insights: Counter-Trading Opportunities: Some traders use extreme fear as a potential buying opportunity (when others are fearful, be greedy) and extreme greed as a potential selling opportunity (when others are greedy, be fearful). Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm your existing technical or fundamental analysis. If your charts suggest a breakout and the index is showing increasing greed, it might add conviction. Risk Management: During periods of extreme greed, it might be wise to take some profits or tighten stop-losses. Conversely, extreme fear could signal a good time to accumulate positions gradually. Understanding Market Psychology: The index helps you understand the collective mindset, preventing you from getting swept up in herd mentality. Always remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used in conjunction with other research and not as a standalone indicator. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48, resting in the neutral zone, offers a fascinating glimpse into the current state of crypto investor sentiment. It highlights a period of balance, perhaps even anticipation, rather than strong directional conviction. For any cryptocurrency enthusiast or trader, understanding and effectively utilizing this index can be a powerful addition to their toolkit, helping them navigate the complex emotional landscape of digital assets. Stay informed, stay analytical, and always trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from extreme fear to extreme greed, on a scale of 0 to 100. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment based on the latest data points. What does a ‘neutral’ reading like 48 mean for the market? A neutral reading suggests a balance between buying and selling pressures, indicating market uncertainty, consolidation, or a period of calm before a potential significant move. It’s not strongly bullish or bearish. Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict price movements? While it reflects market psychology, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a direct price predictor. It’s best used as a sentiment indicator to complement other technical and fundamental analysis, rather than as a standalone trading signal. Are there other sentiment indicators similar to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Yes, there are other sentiment indicators such as social media sentiment analysis tools, on-chain analytics focusing on investor behavior, and funding rates in perpetual futures markets, all of which provide different angles on market mood.

Under the notice, the Treasury said that although advance notice of proposed rulemaking was not normally necessary for implementing a law, it seeks public comment to refine and broaden its regulatory framework. The Treasury began a comment period in August and has set an Oct. 17 deadline for the public to provide input about any concerns or feedback it may have regarding possible illicit activity. The recent notice provides a 31-day window for feedback. “Treasury welcomes comments and views from a wide range of stakeholders on the [advance notice of proposed rulemaking],” the statement reads. The GENIUS Act was one of three cryptocurrency-related bills the House of Representatives advanced in July during Republicans’ “Crypto Week.” President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 18, joined by executives from major crypto firms including Gemini, Coinbase, Circle, and Kraken. Designed to regulate payment stablecoins in the US, the law is set to take effect either 18 months after enactment or 120 days following the release of final regulations from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve—placing implementation no earlier than late 2026. Congress advances market structure bill amid growing crypto oversight Meanwhile, i n one of its first legislative steps on crypto bills since passing the GENIUS Act in June, the US Senate is expected to vote on a digital asset market structure framework this month. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading American attorney and member of the Republican Party , has been pushing for market structure. She says the committee is expected to vote on the bill by the end of September, potentially being signed into law by 2026 . The market structure bill, tentatively titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, hopes to clarify US financial agencies’ roles in overseeing and enforcing digital asset laws.. Members of Congress, including Lummis, met with executives from crypto companies in three separate roundtable discussions this week to consider the market structure and Bitcoin BTC reserve bills. Kraken and Circle partnership expands stablecoin access and utility On related developments, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken recently partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to broaden access to and the utility of Circle’s USDC and EURC tokens. The collaboration will integrate Circle’s dollar- and euro-pegged stablecoins into Kraken’s platform, giving clients expanded ways to use USDC across existing applications and introducing support for EURC. “Stablecoins are the financial layer most aligned with crypto’s original architecture — permissionless, programmable, and global by default,” said Mark Greenberg, global head of Kraken’s consumer business. “Expanding support for Circle’s products isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about embedding new opportunities to benefit from Circle’s stablecoins into products our clients already use and trust.” Circle echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the role of stablecoins in shaping digital finance. “We’re focused on building the world’s largest, most widely used stablecoin network, and partnering with leading platforms like Kraken to drive new opportunities for onchain finance,” said Kash Razzaghi, Circle’s chief commercial officer. The companies said the partnership supports the “responsible growth of stablecoins” as a core component of the evolving online financial system. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

REX-Osprey has officially filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF , promising an intriguing new avenue for amplified exposure. What is a Leveraged DOGE ETF and Why Now? This isn’t just any ordinary investment product. A leveraged DOGE ETF is designed to provide magnified returns, aiming for 1.5 times the daily performance of its underlying Dogecoin ETF (DOJE). Decrypt recently reported on REX-Osprey’s ambitious application, highlighting the firm’s proactive approach in the crypto market. This filing comes on the heels of the impressive debut of their original DOJE ETF. The initial ETF recorded a remarkable $17 million in trading volume on its first day of listing on September 18th. This strong initial performance clearly signals a robust investor appetite for Dogecoin-related financial products. REX-Osprey’s decision to introduce a leveraged version underscores their confidence in this market demand. Consequently, it also reflects a growing sophistication within the crypto investment space, as firms explore more advanced instruments to cater to diverse investor strategies. Unpacking the Potential: Benefits of a Leveraged DOGE ETF For savvy investors and traders, a leveraged DOGE ETF offers several compelling benefits. The primary advantage is the potential for amplified gains. For instance, if Dogecoin’s price rises by 10% in a day, a 1.5x leveraged ETF theoretically aims to deliver a 15% return before fees and expenses. This product could particularly appeal to traders looking to capitalize on short-term price movements without the complexities of directly holding Dogecoin. It provides a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, making it easier for a broader range of investors to participate. Moreover, investing in such an ETF eliminates many common hurdles associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership, such as managing crypto wallets, dealing with various exchanges, and addressing security concerns. This enhanced accessibility can significantly lower the barrier to entry for many traditional finance participants. Navigating the Risks: What Investors Need to Know About This Leveraged DOGE ETF However, it is crucial to understand that leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify gains, it also amplifies losses. Therefore, a 10% drop in Dogecoin’s price could potentially lead to a 15% loss in the value of the leveraged DOGE ETF , before considering fees and rebalancing effects. These products are typically designed for short-term trading strategies and are generally not suitable for long-term holding. Daily rebalancing mechanisms, which are inherent to leveraged ETFs, can lead to performance decay over extended periods, especially in volatile markets. Investors must exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before committing capital. Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, a leveraged product becomes particularly high-risk. Understanding your personal risk tolerance and investment objectives is paramount before considering an investment in such a complex and potentially volatile instrument. The Regulatory Hurdle: SEC’s Stance on Leveraged DOGE ETF Approval The application for this leveraged DOGE ETF now rests with the U.S. SEC. Historically, the SEC has maintained a cautious stance on approving leveraged and inverse crypto products. Their primary concerns often revolve around potential market manipulation, extreme volatility, and ensuring robust investor protection measures are in place. The SEC’s decision on this filing will be a significant indicator of the regulatory body’s evolving perspective on complex crypto derivatives. The approval process for such novel financial instruments is often lengthy and subject to stringent review and public commentary periods. Nonetheless, REX-Osprey’s filing demonstrates continued institutional interest and confidence in bringing innovative crypto investment vehicles to market. This persistent effort actively pushes the boundaries of traditional finance and its intersection with digital assets. REX-Osprey’s pursuit of a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. While it offers an exciting opportunity for amplified returns and broader market access, it also comes with inherent risks that demand careful consideration and a clear understanding of market dynamics. As the SEC reviews this application, the entire industry watches closely, anticipating what this could mean for the future of crypto-backed financial products. This innovative step highlights the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios, paving the way for more sophisticated financial instruments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is a leveraged ETF? A leveraged ETF is an exchange-traded fund that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index or asset. For example, a 1.5x leveraged ETF aims to return 1.5 times the daily performance of its benchmark. 2. How is a 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF different from simply buying Dogecoin? Directly buying Dogecoin means your gains or losses mirror its price movement one-to-one. A 1.5x leveraged DOGE ETF aims to amplify those daily movements by 1.5 times, meaning larger potential gains but also larger potential losses. It also offers exposure through a traditional brokerage account, bypassing direct crypto ownership. 3. Who is REX-Osprey? REX-Osprey is an asset management firm that focuses on providing innovative investment products, particularly in the cryptocurrency space. They are the firm behind the original DOGE ETF (DOJE) and are now seeking to launch a leveraged version. 4. What are the main risks of investing in a leveraged DOGE ETF? The primary risks include amplified losses (you can lose more than your initial investment faster), performance decay over longer periods due to daily rebalancing, and the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. These products are generally considered high-risk and are best suited for short-term, active trading. 5. Has the SEC approved other leveraged crypto ETFs? As of now, the SEC has generally been hesitant to approve leveraged or inverse cryptocurrency ETFs due to concerns about market volatility, manipulation, and investor protection. This application for a leveraged DOGE ETF is significant because it represents a continued push by firms to bring such products to market.

51993527,585052,1758328225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51993527.jpeg,Police Confirms Largest Crypto Seizure In Canadian History,https://bitcoinist.com/police-largest-crypto-seizure-canadian-history/,"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has confirmed a record-breaking seizure of cryptocurrency linked to the centralized exchange TradeOgre, taking control of assets worth more than 56 million Canadian dollars—about 40 million US dollars—following a federal policing investigation in Quebec. The agency described the operation as “the largest cryptocurrency seizure in Canadian history,” and said it dismantled the platform’s Canadian infrastructure. The news was announced on September 18 from Montréal. Canadian Police Confirms $40 Million Crypto Seizure According to details released by Canadian media quoting the RCMP, investigators seized servers in Beauharnois in the Montérégie region, which supported TradeOgre’s operations. RCMP Sgt. Mathieu Lagarde said: “The servers that allowed this platform to conduct these transactions were located in Canada. So we seized these servers and then seized the crypto assets controlled by the exchange.” Authorities added that this marks the first time a cryptocurrency exchange has been dismantled by police in Canada. The yearlong probe was run by the RCMP Federal Policing – Eastern Region’s Money Laundering Investigative Team and began in June 2024 after a tip from Europol, according to the accounts of the investigation provided by authorities and reported by national outlets. The RCMP alleges TradeOgre failed to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business and did not identify its customers, conditions that investigators say allowed criminal organizations to conceal the origins of funds. Open-source blockchain intelligence platform Arkham said its tooling was used in the case. In a public post, Arkham wrote that “as per the RCMP’s website, Arkham was used as part of the investigation,” and in a research note the firm documented earlier on-chain indicators—specifically messages embedded in Bitcoin transactions —signaling that Canadian police had claimed ownership of funds. Arkham’s report also noted TradeOgre’s social and site activity had gone dark earlier this summer (X account inactive since May; website offline since July 30). The RCMP said it is now analyzing transaction data from the platform and that enforcement actions may follow: “The transaction data obtained from the platform will be analyzed and charges may follow. The investigation is ongoing.” Authorities emphasized that no arrests had been announced as of the release and encouraged anyone with relevant information to contact investigators. While the RCMP’s statement framed TradeOgre as an unregistered venue used to launder proceeds of crime, the seizure has already prompted a broader debate among some users who claim legitimate balances were swept up with illicit funds. What is clear, however, is that Canadian law enforcement has established a new high-water mark for domestic crypto enforcement and, for the first time, has taken down the Canadian infrastructure of a cryptocurrency exchange as part of a money-laundering investigation. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $4 trillion.",Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|crypto news|Crypto News Canada|RCMP|TradeOgre,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ARKM|EXCHANGE|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-20 00:30:25

FTX, once a leading cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, imploded in November 2022 amid revelations of multi-billion-dollar fraud. Concerning the third round of payment mode, creditors in groups of four will secure their share of the funds at the end of this month, with a distribution rate ranging from 78% to 120%. According to a press release from the Trust, which manages the assets and claims linked to FTX’s bankruptcy, this distribution rate is the percentage of their FTX holdings worth when the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Additionally, it marks the third phase of FTX’s recovery plan, which will take place via the crypto exchanges Bitgo and Kraken, along with Payoneer, a financial services company. This is not the first time the FTX Recovery Trust has made the distribution plan public. In 2024, the legal entity had initially shared it. FTX collapse was due to mismanagement of funds Under FTX’s operation, its users were allowed to purchase, sell, and make speculations about the future prices of widely adopted cryptocurrencies and tokens. This greatly attracted customers and increased the exchange’s user base . However, its CEO, Bankman-Fried, alongside his senior partners, used customers’ funds invested in the exchange to cover high-risk investments that Alameda Research, a hedge fund connected to the company, made without their consent. Consequently, this mismanagement of customers’ funds resulted in FTX’s bankruptcy, with billions of investor funds missing. To track down the missing funds, John J. Ray III, an American attorney and CEO specializing in recovering funds from failed corporations, was assigned to get them back. While working on this, the American attorney pointed out that the exchange’s bankruptcy was greater than that of Enron, an energy firm, in the early 2000s. FTX’s CEO was arrested with fraud charges Following his actions, Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and later charged with defrauding clients. When the charges were presented in court, he was legally jailed. This was made possible because prominent figures from Bankman-Fried’s close team decided to testify against him during the trial. Interestingly, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, who used to lead engineering at FTX, acknowledged that they committed crimes because Bankman-Fried had commanded them to do so. After the verdict was announced, a Lawyer and former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York weighed in on the situation. He commented that Sam Bankman-Fried’s financial fraud was one of the largest in the history of America. According to him, the CEO carried out this multi-million dollar scheme to position himself as the ruler of crypto. Meanwhile, to serve as a warning to any individual with intentions similar to those of Bankman-Fried, the relevant authorities sentenced the CEO to serve 25 years in prison in Southern California for fraud and other offenses. On related developments, Bankman-Fried’s dormant X account suddenly became active this week, mass-following other profiles after months of silence. The unexpected activity sparked speculation and fueled a rally in the FTT token, which briefly climbed above $1. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the renewed activity raised questions about whether the former FTX founder, currently serving time in prison, somehow signals continued interest in crypto, or even hints at an early release. However, there has been no official word regarding his release, and the FTX bankruptcy process is still moving forward, with the next creditor distribution scheduled for September 30. On-chain data suggests Bankman-Fried has little to no funds left for trading, with one of his meme wallets now holding just 0.67 SOL. Meanwhile, wallets associated with Alameda Research continue to receive allocations of SOL from earlier distributions, but those funds are being directed toward bankruptcy settlements rather than trading.

This new investment vehicle isn’t just another fund; it represents a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption in traditional finance. What is the Grayscale GDLC ETF and Why is it Important? Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), now converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), offers investors exposure to a basket of major cryptocurrencies. Unlike single-asset ETFs, the Grayscale GDLC ETF provides diversification across several prominent digital assets, aiming to mirror the performance of the broader crypto market. Its recent launch follows a crucial approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This regulatory nod is a testament to the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within established financial frameworks. It opens doors for a wider range of investors, including institutions, to access the crypto market through a regulated and familiar investment product. A Strong Start: Decoding the $22 Million Volume for Grayscale GDLC ETF On its very first day of trading, the Grayscale GDLC ETF recorded an impressive $22 million in volume. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that this figure is notably higher than the typical debut for an ETF. What does this strong initial performance tell us? High Investor Interest: The substantial volume indicates significant pent-up demand for a diversified, regulated crypto investment product. Market Confidence: It suggests growing confidence among investors regarding the stability and potential of large-cap cryptocurrencies. Institutional Engagement: While not exclusively institutional, such volumes often reflect participation from larger investment firms seeking compliant ways to enter the crypto space. This early success underscores a pivotal shift. Investors are increasingly looking for accessible and secure avenues to participate in the digital asset economy. Benefits and Challenges of Investing in the Grayscale GDLC ETF The introduction of the Grayscale GDLC ETF brings several advantages, but also highlights ongoing considerations in the crypto investment landscape. Key Benefits for Investors: Diversification: Investors gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of major cryptocurrencies without needing to manage individual assets. Accessibility: It allows investors to buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying the investment process. Regulatory Oversight: As an SEC-approved ETF, it operates under stringent regulatory guidelines, offering a layer of protection and transparency. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer good liquidity, allowing for easy entry and exit from positions. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While diversified, the underlying assets are still subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Fees: Like all ETFs, there are management fees associated with holding the fund. Limited Scope: The fund focuses on large-cap cryptocurrencies, meaning investors seeking exposure to smaller, emerging altcoins might need to look elsewhere. Understanding these aspects is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The Grayscale GDLC ETF offers a robust entry point for many, yet it’s important to align it with individual risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and Grayscale’s Pivotal Role? The successful launch of the Grayscale GDLC ETF is more than just an individual product’s triumph; it’s a significant indicator for the broader crypto ETF market. It demonstrates a clear appetite from investors and potentially paves the way for further approvals of similar diversified or single-asset crypto ETFs. Grayscale has been a pioneer in bringing crypto investment products to traditional markets. Their persistent efforts in navigating regulatory landscapes have been instrumental in bridging the gap between digital assets and mainstream finance. This latest conversion and strong debut solidify their position as a key player in shaping the future of crypto investment vehicles. The trend suggests a future where investing in cryptocurrencies becomes as straightforward and accessible as investing in stocks or bonds. This evolution could significantly accelerate institutional adoption and bring greater stability and maturity to the crypto market as a whole. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Digital Asset Investing The debut of the Grayscale GDLC ETF marks a momentous occasion for the cryptocurrency investment landscape. Its impressive trading volume on day one signals robust investor confidence and a growing demand for regulated, diversified crypto exposure.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial indicator from CoinMarketCap, has recently climbed to an impressive 76. This significant rise not only solidifies the ongoing Altcoin Season but also signals potentially massive opportunities for investors. When this index hits 75 or higher, it officially marks an “altcoin season,” indicating that a substantial portion of the crypto market is outperforming Bitcoin. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: How Does It Work? You might be wondering, what exactly does a score of 76 mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a sophisticated tool designed to give us a clear picture of market dynamics. It meticulously tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, carefully excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. This focused approach ensures we get a true sense of genuine market movement. The index declares an Altcoin Season when at least 75% of these top altcoins have surpassed Bitcoin’s performance over the preceding 90 days. A higher score, like our current 76, indicates an even stronger and more widespread outperformance by altcoins. Essentially, it tells us that a significant majority of the market is experiencing growth that outpaces the leading cryptocurrency. Why is This Altcoin Season So Significant for Your Portfolio? A strong Altcoin Season, especially with the index at 76, suggests a period ripe with potential. Historically, these periods have offered incredible opportunities for investors to see substantial gains from various alternative cryptocurrencies. It’s a time when capital often flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to accelerated price appreciation across a broad spectrum of projects. Diversification Potential: A thriving altcoin market encourages exploring beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially finding innovative projects with high growth ceilings. Increased Market Activity: Higher scores often correlate with increased trading volumes and renewed interest in the broader crypto ecosystem. Innovation Spotlight: Many altcoins represent groundbreaking technologies and solutions, and an Altcoin Season can bring these innovations into the spotlight, attracting more users and developers. This sustained momentum indicates a healthy appetite for risk among investors and a belief in the long-term viability of various blockchain projects. Therefore, understanding this trend is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Navigating the Thriving Altcoin Season: What Are Your Next Steps? With the Altcoin Season Index firmly in altseason territory, how can you best position yourself? Smart decision-making is key to capitalizing on these market conditions while managing risk effectively. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research: Before investing, delve deep into projects. Understand their whitepapers, teams, technology, and community support. Look for strong fundamentals rather than just hype. Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 1s, gaming) to mitigate risk. Set Clear Goals and Limits: Define your profit targets and stop-loss levels. The crypto market is volatile, and having a strategy helps protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep up with market news, project updates, and broader economic trends. Information is power in this fast-paced environment. Remember, while the potential for gains is exciting, the market can change rapidly. Prudent planning is always advisable. Understanding Potential Challenges During an Altcoin Season While the prospect of an Altcoin Season is exciting, it is also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges. The very nature of altcoin rallies can lead to increased volatility, which presents both opportunities and risks. Heightened Volatility: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can experience dramatic price swings. What goes up quickly can often come down just as fast. Risk of “Pump and Dump” Schemes: During periods of high excitement, some less scrupulous actors might try to inflate prices artificially, only to sell off their holdings, leaving others with losses. Market Corrections: No market moves in a straight line forever. Even during a strong Altcoin Season, corrections are natural and should be anticipated. Information Overload: The sheer volume of new projects and daily news can be overwhelming, making it difficult to distinguish genuine opportunities from fleeting trends. Therefore, a balanced approach, combining enthusiasm with caution, is essential to navigate these dynamic market conditions successfully. The Continued Rise of Altcoin Season: A Compelling Outlook The consistent climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 76 is a compelling signal for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a period where innovation and growth are not just confined to Bitcoin but are flourishing across a diverse range of alternative digital assets. This sustained performance by altcoins over Bitcoin suggests a maturing market with increasing investor confidence in the broader ecosystem. For those looking to explore the exciting frontiers of digital finance, this Altcoin Season presents a unique window. By staying informed, conducting diligent research, and adopting a strategic approach, investors can potentially unlock significant value. The journey through this altcoin-dominated landscape promises to be both dynamic and rewarding for those prepared to engage thoughtfully. Frequently Asked Questions About Altcoin Season Q: What is the Altcoin Season Index? A: The Altcoin Season Index, provided by CoinMarketCap, measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. A score of 75 or higher indicates an official altcoin season, meaning 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Q: How long does an Altcoin Season typically last? A: The duration of an Altcoin Season can vary significantly. Some periods might last for several weeks or even months, while others could be shorter. It depends on various market factors, including investor sentiment, Bitcoin’s performance, and broader economic conditions. Q: Should I invest in every altcoin during an Altcoin Season? A: No, it is not advisable to invest in every altcoin. While the overall market may be performing well, individual projects carry unique risks. Always conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and invest only what you can afford to lose. Q: What role does Bitcoin play during an Altcoin Season? A: Bitcoin often acts as a benchmark. During an Altcoin Season, capital typically flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin’s price movements can still significantly influence the broader crypto market, including altcoins. Q: Is an Altcoin Season guaranteed to make me money? A: No investment is guaranteed. While an Altcoin Season presents opportunities for significant gains, it also comes with increased volatility and risks. Strategic planning, risk management, and continuous learning are crucial for navigating these periods successfully. Found this analysis of the Altcoin Season insightful?

A significant development is now capturing attention: Enosys, a prominent Flare-based DeFi protocol, has officially launched a pioneering XRP stablecoin protocol. This move is set to unlock new avenues for XRP holders and reshape how stability is perceived within the DeFi space. Introducing the Groundbreaking XRP Stablecoin Protocol Enosys’s new protocol marks a pivotal moment for the XRP community and the broader DeFi landscape. CryptoBriefing initially reported this exciting launch, highlighting the core mechanism: the stablecoin is collateralized by XRP itself. This isn’t just another stablecoin; it’s a strategic integration designed to leverage XRP’s potential within a decentralized framework. For those unfamiliar, Flare is a high-performance blockchain network focused on bringing smart contract capabilities to various cryptocurrencies, including XRP, that do not natively support them. Enosys, built on this network, is now enabling users to mint a new stablecoin. This is achieved by depositing FXRP, which is the wrapped version of XRP on the Flare network. FXRP acts as the bridge, allowing XRP to participate in Flare’s DeFi ecosystem. This initiative showcases the power of interoperability, allowing an asset like XRP to gain new functionalities and integrate seamlessly into the burgeoning world of DeFi applications. It’s a testament to the growing demand for diverse collateral options beyond established assets like Ethereum or Bitcoin. How Does XRP Collateralization Work? Understanding the mechanics behind this XRP stablecoin is key to appreciating its value and security. The process is designed to be straightforward yet robust, ensuring user confidence and protocol stability: Acquiring FXRP: Before minting, users need to wrap their native XRP into FXRP on the Flare network. This process is typically facilitated through secure bridging mechanisms. Depositing FXRP as Collateral: Users then deposit their FXRP into the Enosys stablecoin protocol. This FXRP acts as the backing for the stablecoin they wish to mint. Minting the Stablecoin: Upon successful deposit, users can mint the Enosys stablecoin, which is pegged to a fiat currency (e.g., 1:1 with the US Dollar). To safeguard against market volatility, the value of the deposited FXRP collateral usually exceeds the value of the stablecoin minted (overcollateralization). This buffer helps absorb potential price drops in XRP. Utilizing the Stablecoin: The newly minted stablecoin can then be used across various DeFi applications on Flare, such as lending, borrowing, trading, or payments, all while maintaining exposure to their underlying XRP. Redemption Process: When users wish to retrieve their original FXRP, they simply repay the minted stablecoin plus any accrued fees. This burns the stablecoin and releases their FXRP collateral, completing the cycle. This mechanism provides a capital-efficient way for XRP holders to unlock liquidity from their assets without needing to sell them, offering flexibility and new strategic opportunities within DeFi. What Are the Benefits and Implications of This XRP Stablecoin? The launch of an XRP stablecoin protocol by Enosys brings several significant advantages and implications, not just for individual users but for the broader cryptocurrency market: Enhanced Liquidity and Utility for XRP: This protocol significantly boosts XRP’s utility. Holders can now use their XRP as productive collateral in DeFi, accessing stablecoin liquidity without divesting their core asset. This can lead to increased demand and new use cases for XRP. Stability in a Volatile Market: The stablecoin offers users a reliable medium of exchange, shielded from the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. This stability is crucial for payments, remittances, and long-term financial planning within the decentralized world, particularly for those looking to avoid frequent conversions to fiat. Broader DeFi Integration: This development firmly embeds XRP within the decentralized finance landscape. It opens doors for XRP to interact with a wider array of DeFi applications and protocols on the Flare network, fostering greater interoperability and innovation. Showcasing Flare’s Potential: The successful deployment of such a complex protocol highlights the robust capabilities of the Flare network as a platform for sophisticated DeFi solutions. This can attract more developers, projects, and users to its ecosystem, driving further growth. New Financial Primitives: By creating an XRP-backed stablecoin, Enosys is introducing a new financial primitive that can be composed with other DeFi protocols, leading to novel financial products and services. While the benefits are clear, it is important for users to understand the risks associated with collateralized debt positions, such as liquidation risk if the collateral value drops significantly. However, the foundational design aims to mitigate these risks through established DeFi best practices like overcollateralization and transparent oracle feeds for price data. Navigating the Future of Decentralized Finance with XRP The introduction of the Enosys XRP stablecoin protocol represents a forward-thinking step in the evolution of decentralized finance. It exemplifies how specific cryptocurrencies, often seen as payment-focused, can be integrated into sophisticated DeFi structures, offering both stability and utility. This protocol not only empowers XRP holders but also enriches the entire Flare ecosystem by adding a crucial financial primitive. This innovation aligns with the broader trend of expanding collateral options in DeFi, moving beyond just a few dominant assets. It signifies a maturation of the ecosystem, where more diverse assets can unlock their potential value in a decentralized, permissionless manner. As the DeFi space continues to mature, solutions like Enosys’s XRP-collateralized stablecoin will play a vital role in expanding accessibility and fostering greater financial inclusion. It’s a testament to the ongoing innovation that drives the crypto market forward, creating new possibilities for digital assets. Conclusion: A New Horizon for XRP in DeFi Enosys’s launch of an XRP-collateralized stablecoin protocol is more than just a new product; it’s a significant milestone for both XRP and the Flare network. By providing a secure and innovative way to leverage XRP’s value for stability and liquidity, Enosys is paving the way for enhanced utility and broader adoption within decentralized finance. This development underscores the dynamic potential of the crypto world to continuously innovate and create value for its users, marking a truly exciting chapter for the future of digital assets.
