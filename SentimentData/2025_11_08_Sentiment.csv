The political deadlock has halted progress on key legislative priorities, including the long-anticipated crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act . Prolonged Shutdown Risks 2% GDP Hit as Senate Prepares Crucial Vote The Senate is expected to vote this week on a Republican-backed proposal that would end the shutdown and fund several federal agencies through the rest of the fiscal year. The measure requires 60 votes to advance, and while Republican leaders have expressed cautious optimism, uncertainty remains over whether enough Democrats will support it. “My hopes and expectations are always that we’re going to have enough Democrats to actually proceed, but I don’t know, we’ll see,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters. The standoff, which began on October 1 after lawmakers failed to agree on a budget, stems from disagreements over healthcare subsidies tied to the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring tax credits that help about 24 million Americans afford insurance, while Republicans argue that those issues should be negotiated separately once the government reopens. US Government Shutdown So Far: 1. 42 million people face interruption of SNAP 2. 3.5 million people have seen airfare disruptions 3. 750,000 employees furloughed 4. 5,000 flights set to be cancelled per day 5. $15 billion in US GDP lost per week 6. $10 billion of SNAP… — Zarar Khan (@DrZarar01) November 7, 2025 With roughly 1.4 million federal workers affected, including 700,000 furloughed since early October, the shutdown’s economic and social toll is deepening. Federal workers have now missed multiple paychecks, and agencies from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to the USDA are cutting services. Trump – No Snap Benefits Until Government Re-Opens. pic.twitter.com/yu1DwYAFOE — Ryan (Emperador Maximiliano) (@EmpMaximiliano) November 4, 2025 A Rhode Island court on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the SNAP program after it had been reduced to partial payments. The administration has appealed the decision, arguing that funding decisions should await congressional action. Nearly 42 million Americans depend on the program, which costs more than $8 billion per month. Economists warn the prolonged shutdown could inflict lasting damage on the U.S. economy. Turns out this shutdown is incredibly costly, averaging ~15B per week. Unlike past shutdowns, 650K furloughed workers may not get back pay, food aid is cut, small businesses without their loans, and some economic damage could be permanent if it extends through the holidays. pic.twitter.com/OImZwWDXTV — Tahra Hoops (@TahraHoops) November 5, 2025 The Congressional Budget Office estimates the standoff could shave up to two percentage points off fourth-quarter GDP growth, draining between $10 billion and $30 billion weekly. Small businesses that rely on federal contracts and loans are running short on capital, and consumer spending is declining as millions of workers remain unpaid. How Long Can Crypto Wait While Washington Sleeps? The shutdown has also paralyzed Washington’s regulatory machinery. Agencies overseeing financial markets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are operating with skeleton crews. Reviews of pending applications, including multiple proposals for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have been suspended. Interesting: Because most SEC staff are currently furloughed due to the government shutdown, they will NOT be available to review or respond to Fails-to-Deliver (FTD) related queries or compliance ISSUES unless they are designated as EMERGENCY functions. pic.twitter.com/5cDqudANAs — Reese Politics (@ReesePolitics) November 3, 2025 The impasse has effectively frozen legislative momentum on digital assets. The bipartisan CLARITY Act, designed to define how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are regulated across federal agencies, had seen renewed activity in late October. Senators John Boozman and Cory Booker said their committees were working “daily ” to finalize their section of the bill and expected a vote before Thanksgiving. However, with the government shutdown entering its sixth week, that timeline is now in jeopardy. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that roughly 90% of the bill’s issues had already been resolved and that Thanksgiving had been floated as a possible target for completion . The market fallout has extended beyond Capitol Hill. The liquidity squeeze triggered by the shutdown, exacerbated by the U.S. Treasury General Account hoarding funds while agencies remain closed, has weighed heavily on risk assets. Bitcoin has retreated from recent highs , testing long-term support levels as investors navigate reduced market liquidity and uncertainty around fiscal policy. Meanwhile, prediction markets indicate growing skepticism about a quick resolution to the shutdown.

Related Reading: Cathie Wood Trims Her 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction To $1.2 Million – Here’s Why The Zcash price recently surged above $650 for the first time since 2018, with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. According to CoinGecko, daily trading volume has surpassed $1.88 billion, with strong liquidity across Binance, Hyperliquid, and Bybit. This momentum reflects a growing resurgence of interest in privacy-preserving technologies amid increasing concerns over financial surveillance. The Electric Coin Company’s (ECC) recent upgrades, including those under Project Tachyon, and the rising adoption of the Zashi wallet have revitalized investor confidence. Privacy Narrative and Technical Upgrades Drive Momentum The renewed enthusiasm around privacy coins mirrors a broader market shift. Zcash’s shielded transactions, powered by zk-SNARKs, now represent over 30% of its circulating supply, reducing liquid float and contributing to price stability. Its integration into DeFi ecosystems through tokenized versions on Solana and BNB Chain has also expanded ZEC’s reach, with over 16,000 wallets interacting with these assets. Prominent voices like Naval Ravikant and Arthur Hayes have championed Zcash’s role in the evolving privacy revolution, calling it “the missing piece for Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the Zcash Foundation maintains that the surge reflects genuine user demand rather than speculative hype. Futures data further supports this thesis, with balanced long-short ratios around 1.1, indicating sustained, organic buying interest rather than excessive leverage. ZEC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Can Zcash Price Hit $1,000 Next? Analysts Weigh In The current Zcash price rally has sparked debate over its next target. Technical charts indicate robust support between $500 and $520, while resistance is located near $580–$600. Analysts from CoinGlass and Galaxy Digital project a conservative range of $650 – $750 in the near term, with an optimistic scenario pushing toward $1,000 if momentum persists. The bullish thesis hinges on the strength of the privacy narrative, expanding institutional participation, and ZEC’s scarcity model, mirroring Bitcoin’s 21 million-coin cap. However, traders caution that overbought conditions and potential regulatory headwinds could trigger short-term pullbacks.

Transfers between the two nations, largely involving USDT stablecoins, have drawn scrutiny after Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit processed billions of won in suspicious transactions. Much of this capital reportedly flowed to Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian platform sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K. Experts say the spike underscores how stricter local enforcement in Korea has driven criminal syndicates offshore. “It’s extremely difficult to detect all suspicious transactions before they occur,” said Youchull Jung, a white-collar crime attorney at Lee & Ko. The transfers highlight how foreign jurisdictions like Cambodia and the Philippines have become new operational hubs for crypto-based scams. Seoul Weighs New Sanctions After U.S. Crackdown on North Korean Crypto Laundering The revelations come as South Korea reviews potential sanctions targeting North Korea’s cyber-financing networks. On November 7, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Ji-na confirmed that Seoul could “review sanctions as a measure if they are really needed,” emphasizing coordination with the United States to counter Pyongyang’s crypto theft operations. The U.S. Treasury recently sanctioned eight North Korean nationals and two entities, including the Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC) and Ryujong Credit Bank, for laundering stolen digital assets to fund weapons programs. Analysts, such as Tiger Research’s Ryan Yoon, note that while new measures may have a limited short-term impact, they signal intensified coordination between Seoul and Washington on curbing crypto-funded proliferation threats. Regulation Tightens as South Korea Leads in Compliance Reform South Korea’s crypto market, valued at over $84 billion, has become a test case for striking a balance between innovation and regulation. The 2024 Digital Asset Act and Travel Rule bolstered exchange oversight, but outdated foreign exchange laws have left cross-border crypto flows in a gray zone. Regulators now face the dual challenge of protecting investors while closing loopholes exploited by bad actors. Amid growing global scrutiny, Seoul’s stance could shape the future of crypto compliance across Asia. If South Korea tightens sanctions and AML controls further, analysts say it may catalyze a new era of coordinated digital finance enforcement, stretching from Washington to Phnom Penh, and turning the region’s crypto boom into a geopolitical battleground.

The move aligns with Meta’s AI strategy, focusing heavily on expanding data centers to fuel advanced AI development, including the pursuit of “superintelligence”, a dream of scientists in which AI systems surpass human-level reasoning. Meta’s three-year commitment Meta has increased its focus on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence, which is why it has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to build several large AI data centers while making plans for bigger outlays to meet the compute needs this super AI will no doubt require. The company has revealed plans to invest $1.5 billion in a data center in Texas, breaking ground on its 29th such facility globally, and also locked in a $27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund its Louisiana data center, its biggest project globally. In September, CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated the idea before U.S. President Donald Trump over a White House dinner when he claimed that Meta would invest “at least $600 billion” in the U.S. over the next several years. With its investments in the AI sector, Meta expects “notably larger” capital expenses next year. On the company’s recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because “it’s the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we’re prepared for the most optimistic cases.” However, Cryptopolitan has reported about the firm funneling a lot of funds into the AI sector as it struggles to outdo rivals like Alphabet and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, who are also developing huge data centers to power future AI models. Even Google has joined the fray as it has revealed plans to invest $15 billion on a data center project in southern India that will be the search giant’s largest AI hub in the world outside of the U.S. Meta’s deal with Blue Owl Capital Meta’s joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital is expected to fund and develop the social media company’s massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana . The deal states that the asset management firm will retain 80% of the joint venture, while Meta will own a 20% stake and oversee the construction and property management services of the data center, which is being built in Richland Parish, Louisiana. Blue Owl reportedly contributed about $7 billion in cash as part of the joint venture, and Meta got a one-time payout of $3 billion. With the partnership, Meta gets “the speed and flexibility” it needs to build the data center and support its “long-term AI ambitions,” the social media company said in a statement. Local utility Entergy informed CNBC in June that the new data center would require about twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day. The outfit will directly compete with the data centers OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank have come together to build under the Stargate joint venture, which has seen the three companies invest $500 billion.

Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, said in a post on X that long-term holders (LTHs), investors who hold Bitcoin for more than 155 days, have ramped up their selling in recent weeks, a common pattern during bull markets. “LTH take profits as prices reach new highs,” he wrote. But what stands out this time, according to Moreno, is the absence of strong demand to offset that selling. “What’s important to analyze each time is if there’s growing Bitcoin demand that can absorb the LTH selling at higher prices,” he added. The data shows that demand, which had been growing between July and September, turned negative in early October. “Since October, LTH selling has increased (nothing new here), but demand is contracting (red areas), unable to absorb LTH supply at higher prices,” Moreno said. Long-term Bitcoin holders into a low-demand market. Source: CryptoQuant Demand dries up as LTH selling rises In a chart shared by Moreno , Bitcoin’s short-term demand, measured by apparent demand metrics, has been trending in the red zone for roughly 30 days. This signals that fewer new buyers are entering the market, even as long-term investors take profits. The 1-year demand metric remains in positive territory, but the decline is becoming more visible. If the trend continues, Moreno noted, the 1-year demand growth could soon dip below zero. As of this week, both positive and negative apparent demand stand at roughly zero, while the 30-day long-term holder spending sits at around 790,000 BTC as of the time of writing. This means that, on balance, demand and supply are in a delicate standoff, with large volumes of Bitcoin being sold by experienced investors but insufficient fresh capital coming in to absorb the selling pressure. Bitcoin demand over the last 30 days. Source: CryptoQuant The data shared by Moreno on CryptoQuant showed that the two major sources of institutional demand, ETFs and Michael Saylor’s Strategy , are both showing weakness. ETF demand growth has dropped sharply into negative territory, while Strategy’s remains flat at zero. A different market from earlier rallies During January to February 2025 and again from November to December 2024, long-term holder selling coincided with rising demand, which is identified as “green areas” on the chart. Those periods led to record-breaking prices, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs. But this time, conditions appear less supportive, especially after the October 10 event that nearly brought the market to its knees; selling has picked up, but demand has failed to follow. What comes next for Bitcoin? Selling by long-term holders can signal a healthy profit-taking cycle that resets the market for the next leg up; however, the current market activity doesn’t agree with this thesis. Bitcoin prices have dropped by over 5% within the past seven days from about $110,000 to a bit above $103,000. For prices to climb, fresh demand, particularly from ETFs and institutional investors , will need to pick up. Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth remains positive on a yearly basis, which suggests that the structural demand for Bitcoin as an asset class remains intact. But if contraction continues and dips below zero, it could indicate the market is entering a cooling phase similar to mid-cycle consolidations seen in past bull markets.

Bitcoin has dropped as low as $100,500 today, while Ethereum has fallen to $3,293, which is a 26% drop in the past month. However, recent falls have much more to do with stock market jitters than cryptocurrency fundamentals, and most major tokens are now in such an oversold position that they should recover vigorously by the end of the year. Investors should also consider diversifying into new and presale tokens, with one high-momentum presale coin – PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – looking like it could go exponential once it launches. Top Crypto to Turn $100 into $10,000 – Don’t Miss This Potential 100x Setup As its name suggests, PEPENODE is another Pepe-themed meme token, although it doesn’t rely solely on the viral potential of Pepe-related memes and motifs. It also adds a unique selling point to the mix, with PEPENODE providing users with the ability to grow and run their own virtual mining rigs. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 In contrast to the expense of normal mining, which relies on expensive hardware and lots of electricity, the only thing PEPENODE’s mining requires is that users hold some PEPENODE. They can use the coin to buy more virtual mining nodes, with more nodes earning users greater rewards, which PEPENODE pays out in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. It’s as simple as that, while holders of PEPENODE can also stake the token for a regular staking income. Currently, PEPENODE’s annual yield stands at just over 600%, making the coin potentially very profitable. These features help to explain why the coin’s presale has really taken off since launching in September, and at the last count, PEPENODE has raised more than $2 million from excited investors. It will have a total supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with the coin running on the Ethereum blockchain. How to Buy PEPENODE Early: Presale Price at $0.0011363 and Rising Its presale will run for several more weeks, at which point PEPENODE will list. What’s exciting about this is that its launch may come just as the market begins to recover properly from its current slump. The arrival of altcoin ETFs in the next few weeks may provide the kind of market bullishness that will help propel PEPENODE higher, and which will drive demand for its original mining platform. Investors may therefore want to hurry now and buy PEPENODE in its presale, while it’s available at what may end up being a discount. They can do so by going to the official PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet. The coin is currently selling at $0.0011363, although this will rise every few days until the sale enters its final phase. If the timing is right, its listing on exchanges could coincide with a bull rally, with the combination of market-wide momentum and bullish fundamentals serving to push it higher. This is why it’s one of the top cryptos to buy right now, and could remain so for some time to come.

54147281,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88972,1762558203,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Is XRP a Good Buy? Projected Value of 5,000 XRP by 2035",https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-a-good-buy-projected-value-of-5000-xrp-by-2035/,"Investor interest in XRP has surged amid ongoing optimism about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Many community members are speculating on how modest holdings, such as 5,000 XRP, could generate substantial returns over the next decade. As of today, purchasing 5,000 XRP would require approximately $11,800, based on a market price of $2.36 per token. This represents a significant increase compared to last year, when the same amount of XRP cost roughly $2,500. This growth reflects the broader price gains XRP has experienced over the past 12 months. Although today’s price is elevated relative to last year, it remains lower than recent highs. In July, XRP traded at about $3.66, meaning 5,000 tokens would have cost close to $18,300. At the current price, the token is trading nearly 37% below that peak, presenting a potential entry point for investors who may have missed earlier gains. Analysts note that minor variations in purchase price are unlikely to significantly affect long-term outcomes if XRP appreciates substantially over the coming decade. Long-Term Projections for 5,000 XRP Estimating XRP’s future price remains inherently uncertain, but several industry forecasts suggest significant potential upside. Changelly predicts that XRP could reach $115 per token by December 2034. Under this projection, an investment of 5,000 XRP today would be valued at approximately $575,000 by then. A more conservative forecast from Telegaon sets XRP at around $87 per coin by 2035, which would place the value of 5,000 tokens at roughly $435,000. Even this moderate estimate represents a substantial return over ten years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some market commentators envision even more dramatic growth. For example, Matthew Brienen, COO of CryptoCharged, suggested that XRP could reach $1,000 per token by 2035. If this occurs, 5,000 XRP could be worth $5 million, offering investors a significant opportunity for wealth accumulation. Possibility of XRP Surpassing $1,000 While projections above $1,000 remain ambitious, exchanges such as Changelly anticipate that XRP might not reach those levels until closer to 2040, potentially trading as high as $2,138 per token. At that valuation, 5,000 XRP would exceed $10.6 million. Although precise price forecasts cannot be guaranteed, the prevailing sentiment among XRP supporters is that the token’s current market price underrepresents its long-term potential. Many investors see this as an opportunity to acquire XRP at a relatively favourable level in anticipation of significant future growth. The current cost of 5,000 XRP offers a tangible benchmark for investors considering long-term positions. Depending on market adoption, institutional involvement, and broader crypto trends, this holding could increase substantially by 2035. Even conservative projections suggest notable appreciation, reinforcing the view that XRP remains an asset of interest for long-term portfolios.

The altcoin has struggled with lapse adoption over the past year: Stablecoin supply remains at 30 million despite the GENIUS act, and its Total Value Locked (TVL) trails newer chains. Hoskinson attributes Mignight as the solution, citing it to be the “biggest launches in the crypto industry” six years in the making during a recent X Q&A .

He claims it has already attracted over 80 deals with many developers who have sidelined Cardano in the past, including Sundae Labs, Maestro, OpenZeppelin, and Fluid Tokens. Popular X analyst Ali Martinez added technical backing to the optimism, highlighting a critical support retest at $0.51, a level that has repeatedly marked local bottoms over the past year. $0.52 is a support level that has triggered strong rebounds for Cardano $ADA since November 2024. pic.twitter.com/8HdaiayxYO — Ali (@ali_charts) November 5, 2025 If this support once again holds as a launchpad, Martinez expects a retest of key resistance at $1.15, this year’s high, signaling the potential start of a new bull run. Cardano Price Analysis: $1.15 Could Just be the Start The historical year-long resistance noted by Martinez contributes to a wider descending triangle pattern, setting much grander targets.

The RSI has rebounded from the 30 oversold threshold, often a marker of local bottoms, while the MACD levels off in the early stages of a potential trend shift. Buy pressure is building.

This isn’t just random market movement – it’s a powerful signal that smart investors are watching closely. According to leading macroeconomics and crypto analyst Andreas Steno Larsen, this crypto rebound pattern reveals crucial information about where liquidity is flowing in global markets. What Does This Crypto Rebound Actually Mean? When cryptocurrencies recover before traditional stocks, it typically indicates that new money is entering the digital asset space first. This crypto rebound pattern suggests several important market dynamics: Investors see crypto as higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities Digital assets respond faster to changing market conditions Institutional money may be diversifying into crypto Market sentiment is shifting toward digital assets Why Does Liquidity Matter for Your Investments? Liquidity inflow represents the lifeblood of financial markets. When money moves into cryptocurrencies ahead of traditional stocks, it signals that investors perceive stronger growth potential in digital assets. This crypto rebound phenomenon isn’t just technical analysis – it reflects real capital allocation decisions being made by both retail and institutional investors. How Can You Spot Genuine Crypto Rebound Signals? Not every price increase represents meaningful liquidity inflow. True crypto rebound patterns show specific characteristics that distinguish them from ordinary market fluctuations. Look for sustained upward movement across multiple major cryptocurrencies, accompanied by increasing trading volumes and positive fundamental developments in the space. What Challenges Come With This Trend? While this crypto rebound pattern offers exciting opportunities, investors should remain aware of potential challenges: Higher volatility compared to traditional markets Regulatory uncertainties in some jurisdictions Need for thorough research before investing Importance of proper risk management strategies Actionable Insights for Smart Investors Understanding this crypto rebound pattern can help you make more informed investment decisions. Consider diversifying your portfolio to include both traditional and digital assets. Monitor liquidity indicators regularly, and remember that while crypto markets move quickly, sustainable growth requires patience and strategic thinking. The current market dynamics reveal a fascinating shift in how investors allocate capital. This crypto rebound ahead of traditional stocks demonstrates growing confidence in digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. As liquidity continues flowing into cryptocurrency markets, staying informed about these patterns becomes increasingly crucial for anyone interested in modern finance. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a crypto rebound? A crypto rebound occurs when cryptocurrency prices recover significantly after a downturn, often signaling renewed investor interest and capital inflow. Why does crypto rebound before stocks? Cryptocurrencies typically react faster to market changes due to their 24/7 trading nature and higher risk-reward profile that attracts capital during recovery periods. How reliable is this rebound signal? While not foolproof, consistent patterns of crypto rebounding ahead of stocks have historically indicated liquidity shifts, though always verify with other market indicators. Should I invest based on this signal alone? No, this should be one of many factors in your investment decision-making process, combined with fundamental analysis and risk assessment. How long do these rebound periods typically last? Rebound durations vary widely, from several weeks to months, depending on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Which cryptocurrencies show the strongest rebound patterns? Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead rebound movements, followed by other established altcoins with strong fundamentals. Found this analysis helpful?

The Fear and Greed Index hovered around 21, suggesting risk appetite remains thin despite new activity in sectors linked to AI, storage, and infrastructure. Filecoin, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET, and Near Protocol each gained sharply, offering a narrow but telling view of where investors are concentrating during an uncertain phase of the cycle. Filecoin Extends Rally on Ecosystem and AI Ties Filecoin rose about 69% in 24 hours to around $2.34 , lifting its market capitalization above $1.66 billion. The move follows a series of ecosystem upgrades and rising expectations ahead of developer events later this month. The network recently introduced a gas fee cut of about 50%, which coincided with an increase in new deals and overall utilization. The chain’s positioning in decentralized storage has become increasingly tied to AI and DePIN discussions. The combination of lower costs and real data workloads has helped traders view Filecoin as a platform that could anchor decentralized compute growth. Market data also show deeper order books and rising open interest, an early indication that trading participation is extending beyond short-term speculation. . @FilFoundation and GSR Foundation support a cohort of projects that apply decentralized storage for public good. The new infographic outlines how this collaboration funds work in science, art, and human rights through verifiable data infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/ir4COLsnoP — Filecoin (@Filecoin) November 6, 2025 FET Gains From Renewed AI Momentum Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET traded near $0.32 after a 49% rise in 24 hours. The token, which links decentralized AI compute and automation services, continues to act as a liquid expression of AI enthusiasm within crypto. FET Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The alliance’s integration of multiple machine learning projects under one token remains a key draw for traders who seek AI exposure without relying on equity markets. The current flow resembles previous cycles of AI enthusiasm but now aligns more closely with infrastructure-backed narratives such as Filecoin’s. The shared theme of data, compute, and protocol-level utility has kept both assets near the top of watchlists heading into the weekend. Near Protocol Tracks Onchain Activity Near Protocol advanced about 26% to $2.5 , continuing a steady climb that began earlier in the week. On-chain data show consistent user activity and growth in wallet counts, while recent reports have pointed to higher transaction throughput and continued integration of application-layer projects. Traders have grouped NEAR alongside other large layer-one chains that demonstrate concrete network demand even during weak sentiment. Its inclusion in conversations around AI-compatible infrastructure has added to speculative interest, helping maintain liquidity in key trading pairs. Altcoin Season in Fear The Altcoin Season Index remains around 26, well below levels associated with wide participation. Despite that, targeted rallies in tokens such as Filecoin, FET, and Near suggest that capital is rotating selectively toward networks with real economic use cases and active development. The following weeks in November will test whether enthusiasm for decentralized compute and AI-linked assets can expand beyond a few leaders or remain confined to isolated bursts of trading momentum. If current liquidity holds while volatility eases into the weekend, these sectors may continue to attract attention even while most of the market stays risk-averse.

This comes as educational programs, such as My First Bitcoin, have become a crucial bridge for citizens unfamiliar with cryptocurrency around the world. The association is now announcing that it will transition from providing in-classroom support locally in El Salvador to supporting teachers and programs internationally. The Founder, John Dennehy, said the move shows where they are heading in the long term. “Our ambition was always to change the world, but we had to start with a single student, then a single city, then a single nation,” Dennehy said. “Now we are ready to raise the potential impact from 6 million people to 8 billion.” My First Bitcoin was founded as an independent nonprofit in 2021, during El Salvador’s early adoption of Bitcoin. It provided free, beginner-friendly classes for students, community groups, and adults. The program eventually created a formalized “Bitcoin Diploma” and trained local instructors to teach the classes. At the time of the announcement, the organization had taught more than 27,000 students in person, with the majority being public school youth. Partnership dissolves as El Salvador changes its Bitcoin policy Through the program’s partnership with the Ministry of Education, Bitcoin education will become available throughout the country in public schools. My First Bitcoin College sent out its curriculum to schools in 2024, following the publication of its diploma-style syllabus, which was developed in collaboration with the Ministry in 2023. They ultimately flamed out in April 2025. The government provided no specific reason for halting the initiative, but Arnold Hubach, Director of Communication at My First Bitcoin, stated that no new program will be introduced. The announcement marked another in a series of policy reversals on Bitcoin in El Salvador, which followed financial discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion IMF bailout in December 2024, which pledged to wind down Bitcoin projects and halt the government’s regulatory purchases of BTC. In January 2025, legislators revised the nation’s Bitcoin law, allowing businesses to opt in or out of accepting Bitcoin. Later in mid-2025 , the IMF reported that El Salvador had not purchased any new Bitcoin since the financing deal was signed — although an official website for the Bitcoin Office still advertises its ongoing purchases. The government’s reported Bitcoin treasury currently stands at approximately 6,374 BTC, which is valued at $654.8 million, according to current prices and public data on the Bitcoin Office website. A chapter closes, but the work goes on It’s on-the-ground time in El Salvador may be over, but My First Bitcoin says its mission remains the same. The organization aims to advise teachers and activists in other countries who wish to introduce Bitcoin education into schools, community centres, and informal learning environments. The group’s curriculum has already been implemented or piloted in Argentina, Costa Rica, Colombia, and other locations in Africa and Europe. Through the new pivot, My First Bitcoin aims to create an online learning network worldwide, rather than being a single centre. While My First Bitcoin may no longer run classes on Salvadoran soil, its mission is now more ambitious than ever: to teach billions of people worldwide how to navigate the world of Bitcoin safely and responsibly, starting with teachers and students who will carry the knowledge forward in their communities.

This move could open doors for mainstream investors to access XRP through regulated channels, simplifying the investment process. If approved, it would represent a significant step forward in bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency markets. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader ecosystem. What Is an XRP Spot ETF and Why Does It Matter? An XRP spot ETF allows investors to buy shares that directly track the price of XRP, making it easier to gain exposure without holding the actual cryptocurrency. This structure reduces the complexities of wallets and private keys, appealing to those who prefer familiar investment vehicles. Moreover, it enhances liquidity and could stabilize XRP’s market value by attracting institutional capital. Therefore, the 21Shares proposal could democratize access to XRP, fostering wider adoption. How Does the 21Shares XRP Spot ETF Filing Process Work? 21Shares filed a Form 8-A with the SEC, triggering a 20-day review period where regulators assess its compliance and risks. This step is crucial because it involves scrutiny under U.S. securities laws, which have been a hurdle for similar crypto products. Success here could set a precedent for other digital assets, encouraging more filings. However, challenges remain, such as regulatory uncertainty and market volatility, which could delay approval. What Are the Key Benefits of an XRP Spot ETF? Investors stand to gain several advantages from this development. For instance: Accessibility : Enables easy investment through traditional brokerage accounts. Security : Reduces risks associated with self-custody of digital assets. Transparency : Offers regulated pricing and reporting, building trust. Additionally, an XRP spot ETF could boost XRP’s legitimacy, potentially increasing its value over time. This aligns with growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. What Challenges Could This XRP Spot ETF Face? Despite the optimism, obstacles like SEC skepticism and legal disputes around XRP’s classification might slow progress. The regulatory landscape is evolving, and past rejections of crypto ETFs highlight the need for clear guidelines. Moreover, market sentiment can shift quickly, affecting timing and success. Nevertheless, 21Shares’ expertise in crypto ETPs positions them well to navigate these hurdles. How Might This Impact the Future of Crypto Investing? If approved, the XRP spot ETF could inspire similar products for other cryptocurrencies, accelerating mainstream adoption. It signals a maturation of the market, where digital assets integrate seamlessly with traditional finance. For investors, this means more choices and potentially lower barriers to entry. Ultimately, it paves the way for a more inclusive financial system. In summary, 21Shares’ XRP spot ETF filing is a pivotal moment that could reshape how we invest in cryptocurrencies. By combining innovation with regulatory compliance, it offers a promising path forward. Stay informed as this story develops—it might just be the breakthrough the crypto world needs.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed an explosive Filecoin price surge that left traders stunned. Overnight, FIL skyrocketed nearly 80%, climbing to nearly $4 on major exchanges and creating waves across the crypto space. What Triggered This Massive Filecoin Price Surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the Filecoin price surge began with a sharp rally that pushed FIL to $3.973 on Binance’s FIL/USDT trading pair. This remarkable movement occurred around 6:00 p.m. UTC, showcasing how quickly cryptocurrency markets can transform. The token has since settled around $3.3, still representing massive gains from the previous day’s trading levels. Several factors likely contributed to this impressive Filecoin price surge: Growing adoption of decentralized storage solutions Increased institutional interest in Web3 infrastructure projects Technical breakout from previous resistance levels Positive market sentiment toward utility tokens Why Does This Filecoin Price Surge Matter? This substantial Filecoin price surge represents more than just numbers on a chart. It signals renewed confidence in decentralized storage networks and their real-world applications. Filecoin’s core technology enables users to store data securely across a distributed network, creating a marketplace for digital storage that challenges traditional cloud services. The timing of this Filecoin price surge coincides with increasing concerns about data privacy and centralized control. As more users seek alternatives to conventional cloud storage, Filecoin’s value proposition becomes increasingly relevant. This rally demonstrates that investors recognize the long-term potential of decentralized infrastructure projects. What Can We Learn From This Filecoin Price Movement? This dramatic Filecoin price surge teaches us several important lessons about cryptocurrency investing. First, utility tokens with real-world applications can experience sudden growth spurts when market conditions align. Second, the decentralized storage sector continues to gain traction among both retail and institutional investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that such rapid price movements often include corrections. The Filecoin price surge saw some retracement from its peak, which is typical in volatile crypto markets. Smart investors use these opportunities to assess their positions and make informed decisions. What’s Next After This Filecoin Price Surge? Looking forward, the sustainability of this Filecoin price surge will depend on several factors. Continued adoption of the Filecoin network, partnerships with major companies, and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment will all play roles in determining whether these gains hold. The Filecoin price surge also highlights the importance of monitoring fundamental metrics beyond just price. Network usage, storage capacity, and developer activity provide better indicators of long-term value than short-term price movements alone. Conclusion: Understanding the Filecoin Phenomenon The remarkable Filecoin price surge demonstrates the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets and the growing importance of decentralized storage solutions. While short-term volatility is expected, the underlying technology continues to evolve and attract users worldwide. This event serves as a powerful reminder that innovation in blockchain technology extends far beyond financial applications to include practical solutions for everyday digital needs. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the Filecoin price surge? The Filecoin price surge likely resulted from combined factors including growing adoption of decentralized storage, positive market sentiment toward utility tokens, and technical breakout patterns. How high did FIL price reach during the surge? FIL reached $3.973 on Binance’s FIL/USDT trading pair during the peak of the price surge before settling around $3.3. Is Filecoin a good investment after this price surge? While the Filecoin price surge shows strong momentum, all cryptocurrency investments carry risk. Research the technology, market position, and your risk tolerance before investing. What is Filecoin used for? Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that allows users to store data securely across a distributed system, creating a marketplace for digital storage. Can the Filecoin price surge continue? Future price movements depend on multiple factors including adoption rates, market conditions, and technological developments within the Filecoin ecosystem. Where can I track Filecoin price movements? You can monitor FIL prices on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and through market tracking platforms like Bitcoin World.

His remarks highlight a recurring behavioral pattern in cryptocurrency markets, where investors often overreact to price corrections despite long-term gains. Historical Performance Context Currently, XRP is trading at approximately $2.36 , down over 10% in the last 7 days, during a challenging phase for the broader cryptocurrency market. The token’s market capitalization has declined to $132.87 billion, representing a drop of more than $82 billion from its July peak of $216.69 billion. Despite this recent downward trend , XRP has appreciated by 346% since November 2024, indicating significant gains over the past year. Diep Sanh emphasized that market participants frequently overlook such long-term progress during temporary pullbacks. Historically, XRP has experienced extended periods of volatility. After reaching $3.31 in January 2018, the token fell below $1 and remained mostly between $0.30 and $0.70 for nearly seven years. Brief spikes, such as $1.96 in April 2021, were followed by subsequent declines, illustrating the cyclical nature of investor sentiment. By 2070, you guys will be shitting your pants when XRP drops from $1,200 to $1,000 — BD (@DiepSanh) November 6, 2025 Investor Reactions in Extreme Scenarios In his commentary, Sanh projected that around the year 2070, XRP could reach $1,200 and later correct to $1,000. Although this would represent a 44,743% increase from the current price, he anticipates that investors would likely overreact, treating the decline as a loss rather than a milestone of long-term growth. Sanh’s point underlines a key aspect of investor psychology: even when holding a position with massive overall gains, market participants often focus on short-term losses. This behavior, according to Sanh, mirrors the patterns observed during previous XRP cycles, where investors panicked at temporary declines despite multi-year growth. Current Market Downturn The ongoing correction has reignited similar concerns. Following the November 2024 rally that pushed XRP above $3.40, the token now trades primarily between $2 and $3. Investors who purchased during the post-rally peak may currently face unrealized losses, which have contributed to heightened anxiety in the community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts view the current dip as a potential opportunity to accumulate XRP at lower prices. Some suggest that those unable to acquire XRP below $2 may soon have another chance, arguing that the ongoing correction could serve as a period of consolidation before the next potential rally. Overall, Sanh’s commentary emphasizes the importance of understanding market psychology alongside price movements. Even in a scenario where XRP achieves extraordinary long-term valuations, short-term volatility may still trigger strong emotional reactions among investors. For current and prospective XRP holders, the lesson is clear: historical trends show that temporary declines are common, and a long-term perspective is essential to navigate periods of volatility while maintaining confidence in the asset’s growth potential.

54149511,623508,1762560056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54149511.jpeg,Bitcoin Looks Overextended As Ethereum Shows Early Signs Of Accumulation – Capital Shift?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-overextended-ethereum-shows-accumulation/,"Bitcoin is once again testing critical support levels after briefly losing the $100,000 mark on Tuesday, raising questions about whether the market is entering the late stages of the current cycle. Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin continues to appear overheated, while Ethereum seems to be sending a different, more resilient signal. The overall market tone has become increasingly complex. On one side, Bitcoin’s relentless rally over recent months has many traders believing the bull run is nearing its end. Across social media and trading communities, the sentiment is clear: “The bull run is almost over.” and “There won’t be another alt season.” This growing skepticism reflects widespread caution among investors who fear that BTC’s parabolic advance could soon lead to exhaustion. However, beneath the surface, Ethereum’s quiet strength and on-chain activity hint at possible capital rotation or hidden accumulation — signaling that the cycle may not be entirely over. The divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies highlights a shifting market structure , where traders must now navigate increased volatility, fading euphoria, and mixed technical signals. Diverging Signals Between Bitcoin And Ethereum Fund Premiums According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Woominkyu, a subtle yet notable divergence has emerged between Bitcoin and Ethereum fund premiums — a dynamic that could reveal the next market rotation. The data shows that the Ethereum Fund Market Premium has been rising quietly, even as ETH’s price struggles around the $3,300 level. This indicates growing institutional interest in Ethereum despite its weaker spot performance. In contrast, Bitcoin’s fund premium has remained flat, showing little change even after weeks of strong price movement. This behavior suggests that while BTC continues to dominate retail and media attention, institutional demand has not accelerated in tandem — a potential sign of market fatigue or strategic capital repositioning. This divergence is not clearly bullish or bearish. It might represent early accumulation in Ethereum funds, signaling an upcoming rotation into altcoins, or simply temporary imbalances in demand between major crypto instruments. What’s evident, however, is that market sentiment and institutional behavior are no longer aligned. Bitcoin’s momentum is driving the narrative, but Ethereum’s quiet accumulation under the surface could be the first hint of shifting capital flows — setting the stage for a more complex and potentially surprising next phase in the market cycle. ETH/BTC Tests Multi-Year Support Amid Persistent Weakness The ETH/BTC pair continues to display structural weakness, currently trading around 0.0327 BTC, after failing to maintain its brief recovery attempt toward 0.04 BTC. The weekly chart shows Ethereum struggling to regain strength against Bitcoin, suggesting that the capital rotation remains heavily tilted toward BTC dominance. Since mid-2022, ETH/BTC has been in a persistent downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows — a clear sign of relative underperformance. The pair’s latest rejection near the 100-week moving average further reinforces this bearish structure. For Ethereum to regain momentum, a sustained move above the 0.037–0.038 BTC zone would be crucial, as this region aligns with both technical resistance and previous breakdown levels. However, there are early signs of potential stabilization. Volume patterns show accumulation near the 0.03 BTC zone, which coincides with the 2021 pre-bull run consolidation range — historically, a strong demand area. If Bitcoin consolidates around $100K and market sentiment improves, Ethereum could stage a rebound in this pair, possibly signaling the beginning of a slow capital rotation back into altcoins. For now, though, BTC dominance remains firm, and ETH’s relative weakness underscores the cautious mood across the broader crypto market.

Bulls are attempting to defend key support zones, but so far, momentum remains weak and upside recovery efforts have failed to gain traction. Despite this, no clear sign of a deeper breakdown has emerged, suggesting that the market could still be in a consolidation phase rather than entering a new bearish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Aggressively: 394K ETH Worth $1.37B In Just 3 Days In the midst of this volatility, Sharplink Gaming — notably one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to adopt a treasury strategy centered around Ethereum — has made significant on-chain moves during the recent downturn. This activity comes at a time when market sentiment has turned fearful and liquidity across exchanges has thinned, hinting that institutional actors may be positioning strategically amid the chaos. While the broader market remains on edge following Bitcoin’s dip below $100K, Ethereum’s network fundamentals and corporate adoption trends continue to attract long-term attention. Sharplink’s recent actions underscore the growing institutional role in ETH markets — and may signal that some players see opportunity where others see risk. Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Moves Signal Strategic Positioning According to data from Arkham shared by Lookonchain, a wallet linked to Sharplink Gaming made a significant move during the latest market correction. The wallet redeemed 5,284 ETH, valued at roughly $17.52 million, and subsequently deposited 4,364 ETH ($14.47 million) into OKX just four hours ago. The company’s total Ethereum holdings have risen to 859,395 ETH, now worth approximately $3.58 billion at current market prices. This makes Sharplink one of the most prominent institutional ETH holders, reinforcing its conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value despite short-term volatility. The move sparked debate among analysts, as the OKX deposit could imply either profit-taking or liquidity repositioning, depending on the company’s broader risk management strategy. However, given Sharplink’s consistent Ethereum accumulation and public alignment with blockchain-based initiatives, the transaction may instead represent active portfolio rebalancing during market stress — a sign of confidence rather than retreat. As Ethereum struggles to stabilize above $3,300, institutional moves like these highlight that smart money remains engaged, potentially setting the foundation for a stronger recovery once market sentiment improves and macro conditions stabilize.

The daily chart shows ETH attempting to stabilize above its 200-day moving average (red line) — a historically significant support zone that has served as a reversal area in previous market cycles. However, the broader structure remains fragile. Ethereum continues to trade below both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating that short- and mid-term momentum remains bearish. Bulls must reclaim the $3,400–$3,500 zone to confirm a stronger recovery, as this area represents both a psychological level and the point where the 50-day MA could act as dynamic resistance.

This development marks a turning point for Bitcoin education globally, affecting thousands of students and signaling new directions for cryptocurrency adoption. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Education in El Salvador? The partnership termination means the immediate suspension of educational programs that had successfully reached approximately 27,000 Salvadoran students. This Bitcoin education program represented one of the most ambitious national cryptocurrency literacy efforts worldwide. The initiative concluded in April 2024, leaving many wondering about the future of cryptocurrency education in the region. Before the partnership ended, the program achieved remarkable success in teaching students about: Bitcoin fundamentals and blockchain technology Digital wallet management and security Practical cryptocurrency applications Financial literacy through digital assets How Will the Global Bitcoin Education Rebrand Work? Following the partnership conclusion, My First Bitcoin announced plans to rebrand as a global Bitcoin education initiative. This strategic move indicates a shift from country-specific programs to worldwide cryptocurrency education. The rebranding represents an exciting evolution in Bitcoin education methodology and reach. The global approach offers several advantages: Broader audience reach across multiple countries Diverse educational content adaptation Increased accessibility through digital platforms Standardized Bitcoin education curriculum What’s Happening with El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy? While the educational partnership ended, El Salvador continues making headlines with its Bitcoin adoption strategy. The government claims to have purchased one Bitcoin daily since November 18, 2022, accumulating over 900 BTC. However, recent reports from the International Monetary Fund present conflicting information. The IMF’s report on its loan agreement with El Salvador indicates the country hasn’t purchased any Bitcoin since December 2023. This contradiction raises questions about: Transparency in national Bitcoin acquisitions Economic impact of cryptocurrency investments Future Bitcoin adoption strategies International financial oversight Why Does Quality Bitcoin Education Matter? Effective Bitcoin education serves as the foundation for responsible cryptocurrency adoption. The My First Bitcoin initiative demonstrated how structured educational programs can: Build financial literacy from early stages Promote safe cryptocurrency practices Encourage technological understanding Support economic innovation The global rebrand of this Bitcoin education program suggests continued commitment to these principles, just through different implementation methods. This evolution in Bitcoin education delivery could potentially reach even more students worldwide. What Can We Learn From This Transition? The partnership conclusion between My First Bitcoin and El Salvador offers valuable insights for cryptocurrency education initiatives. It highlights the importance of adaptable educational models and the need for sustainable Bitcoin education frameworks. The transition to a global approach may actually strengthen long-term Bitcoin education efforts by diversifying delivery methods and audience reach. Key takeaways include: Partnership models require careful planning Global approaches offer scalability benefits Continuous adaptation is crucial in crypto education Multiple delivery methods enhance accessibility Frequently Asked Questions Why did My First Bitcoin end its partnership with El Salvador? The specific reasons haven’t been publicly detailed, but the initiative is transitioning to a global Bitcoin education model rather than country-specific programs. How many students were affected by this change? Approximately 27,000 Salvadoran students who had been participating in the Bitcoin education program were affected by the suspension. When did the partnership officially end? The educational partnership concluded in April 2024, according to available reports. What happens to El Salvador’s Bitcoin education now? While My First Bitcoin programs are suspended, other initiatives or government programs might continue Bitcoin education efforts in the country. How will the global rebrand affect Bitcoin education? The rebrand aims to make Bitcoin education accessible worldwide through digital platforms and adapted content for different regions. Is El Salvador still buying Bitcoin daily? While the government claims continuous purchases, IMF reports suggest no Bitcoin acquisitions since December 2023, creating uncertainty about current practices.

According to Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer, the answer might surprise you. As gold’s impressive rally shows signs of slowing, Bitcoin appears ready to seize the opportunity and potentially deliver superior returns to investors seeking alternative assets. Why Bitcoin Could Outperform Gold Now Jurrien Timmer recently shared his compelling analysis on social media platform X, presenting a fascinating perspective on these two popular alternative assets. He suggests that gold and Bitcoin aren’t necessarily competitors but rather teammates playing different positions. However, the current market dynamics might position Bitcoin to outperform gold in the near term. The key insight comes from examining Sharpe ratios, which measure risk-adjusted returns. Timmer observed that these ratios for Bitcoin and gold have been moving in opposite directions recently. This divergence signals that Bitcoin could outperform gold as it evolves into a more mature asset class. What Makes Bitcoin Positioned to Outperform? Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s potential to outperform gold during gold price corrections: Growing institutional acceptance as a legitimate asset class Improved market infrastructure and regulatory clarity Digital native characteristics appealing to younger investors Scarcity value with predictable supply schedule As Bitcoin continues its maturation process, these attributes strengthen its case to potentially outperform gold during specific market conditions. The digital asset’s correlation with technology adoption and its appeal to digital-first investors create unique advantages that traditional gold cannot match. The Team Player Dynamic: Bitcoin and Gold Together Timmer’s ‘same team’ analogy provides crucial context. Rather than viewing Bitcoin and gold as direct competitors, investors should consider how they complement each other in a diversified portfolio. While both serve as alternative assets and potential inflation hedges, they attract different investor demographics and respond to different market catalysts. However, when gold experiences price corrections, Bitcoin’s digital nature and growth potential might enable it to outperform gold. This doesn’t mean gold becomes irrelevant, but rather that Bitcoin could capture more attention and capital during specific market phases. What This Means for Your Investment Strategy For investors considering whether Bitcoin could outperform gold in their portfolios, several actionable insights emerge: Diversification matters – Both assets have roles to play Monitor Sharpe ratios for timing decisions Consider maturity timeline for investment horizon Watch institutional flows as validation signals The possibility that Bitcoin could outperform gold represents a significant shift in how investors view digital versus traditional alternative assets. As institutional players like Fidelity provide this type of analysis, it adds credibility to Bitcoin’s investment case. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin’s Evolution Continues As Bitcoin continues evolving from speculative digital token to established asset class, its potential to outperform gold becomes more plausible. The key factors to watch include: Regulatory developments and clarity Institutional adoption rates Market infrastructure improvements Global macroeconomic conditions These elements will determine whether Bitcoin can consistently outperform gold or if the relationship remains situational and timing-dependent. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Sharpe ratio and why does it matter? The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns, helping investors understand how much return they’re getting for each unit of risk taken. Higher ratios indicate better risk-adjusted performance. Does this mean I should sell my gold and buy Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Both assets can play important roles in a diversified portfolio. The analysis suggests Bitcoin might outperform during specific market conditions, but gold remains a valuable diversifier. How mature is Bitcoin as an asset class compared to gold? Bitcoin is still maturing but has made significant progress. Gold has centuries of history, while Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance has grown dramatically in recent years. What risks should I consider with Bitcoin investments? Bitcoin carries volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, technological risks, and market liquidity concerns that differ from gold’s risk profile. Can both Bitcoin and gold perform well simultaneously? Absolutely. Both can thrive in environments of monetary uncertainty, inflation concerns, or geopolitical instability, though they may respond to different catalysts. How reliable are predictions about Bitcoin outperforming gold? Like all market predictions, they involve uncertainty. However, analysis from established institutions like Fidelity carries weight due to their research resources and market experience. Found this analysis insightful?

For anyone hunting the best cryptos to buy now , the story begins with established names like LINK and TRX gaining real-world heft and ends with an under-the-radar presale ready to gang up on the scene. Now the spotlight shifts to MOBU crypto, which is staging its presale in full force, offering early-bird access to those who feel like they missed previous moonshots. With Stage 6 live at a rock-bottom price, it’s time to decide whether to join the charging bull or stay on the sidelines watching. MOBU Crypto: The Best Crypto to Buy Now, Standing Out Among the Crowds MOBU crypto is quickly emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy now , fueled by excitement and solid fundamentals. Its MOBU crypto presale is live in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with a projected listing price of $0.00616, signaling a potential 7,244% ROI. With over $550K raised and 1,900+ holders already onboard, the project is turning serious heads across the crypto scene. The tokenomics keep things bullish: a fixed supply, 2% reflections, 2% auto-liquidity, and 1% burn model ensure long-term sustainability. Staking opens at Stage 10 with rewards up to 95% APY. For example, a $300 investment could turn into roughly $22,000 at listing, while $1,000 might climb to about $73,000, showing how early entries can make all the difference. Each presale stage increases the price by 27.40%, making this a first-come, first-served rush. For anyone who missed past moonshots, MOBU crypto offers that long-awaited second chance, standing tall among the best cryptos to buy now with real momentum, utility, and a bull-ready community.

Monthly leaderboards reward top referrers with juicy USDC prizes, making every invite worth the hustle. With over 8 billion $MOBU fueling this initiative, every connection strengthens the ecosystem. MoonBull’s growth isn’t just organic; it’s community-powered and financially electrifying. Chainlink News: LINK Trades at $15.03 as Institutional Demand Grows Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $15.03, up 0.78% in the last 24 hours, as its ecosystem sees growing adoption across DeFi and real-world asset platforms. The network powers over $95 billion in secured value across 700 oracle networks, with major institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Euroclear integrating LINK for tokenized asset solutions. LINK’s market capitalization is $10.48 billion, with a circulating supply of 696.8 million tokens, highlighting its strong presence in blockchain infrastructure and data validation. TRON Price Today: TRX Trades at $0.286 as DeFi and Content Ecosystem Expands TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.286, down 0.17% over the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $27.08 billion. The blockchain continues to expand its ecosystem, supporting over 2.6 million daily users, $4.8 billion in total value locked (TVL), and a 65% share of global retail USDT transfers under $1K. Key developments like the GreatVoyage v4.8.1 mainnet upgrade enhance ARM and JDK 17 support, improve EVM compatibility, and further TRON’s smart contract and DeFi adoption. Final Words Chainlink and TRON both bring serious credentials, infrastructure, adoption, and resilience, but if the objective is to find the best cryptos to buy now with explosive upside then MOBU crypto brings a very different flavour. Chainlink delivers stability and TRON scale, both of which are valuable for portfolios, but their upside is likely more muted than that of early-stage presale plays.

The cryptocurrency’s unexpected downturn has left many investors scratching their heads. However, the real story behind this Bitcoin price weakness might surprise you. Contrary to popular belief, the selling pressure isn’t coming from where most people think. What’s Really Causing Bitcoin Price Weakness? Recent analysis reveals a startling truth about Bitcoin’s market movements. According to Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas, the recent Bitcoin price weakness has minimal connection to ETF outflows. Instead, the real pressure comes from within the crypto community itself. This internal selling represents a significant shift in market dynamics that every investor should understand. The ETF Outflow Myth Debunked Many investors assumed that ETF redemptions were driving the market downturn. However, the numbers tell a different story. During the recent correction period: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded less than $1 billion in net outflows This represents only about 0.5% of total assets under management Baby boomer investors in these ETFs proved to be serious holders This data clearly shows that the Bitcoin price weakness cannot be attributed to ETF investors abandoning ship. Internal Selling: The Real Culprit Behind Bitcoin’s Decline Balchunas perfectly captured the situation by comparing it to a classic horror movie trope: ‘the call is coming from inside the house.’ The real selling pressure originates from established crypto participants rather than new institutional investors. This internal dynamic explains much of the recent Bitcoin price weakness that has concerned market observers. Long-Term Holders Take Profits Supporting evidence from CryptoQuant reveals staggering numbers. During the recent correction: Long-term holders sold approximately 405,000 BTC This represents over $41.3 billion in value These were holders who maintained positions for over 155 days This massive internal selling directly contributed to the Bitcoin price weakness we’ve observed. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Understanding the true source of Bitcoin price weakness provides valuable insights for strategic planning. The market dynamics suggest that traditional crypto participants are taking profits rather than new investors fleeing. This distinction matters because it indicates underlying strength in institutional adoption while highlighting natural market cycles. Navigating Future Market Movements Recognizing the patterns behind Bitcoin price weakness helps investors make informed decisions. The current situation demonstrates that even during corrections, institutional interest remains relatively stable. Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to play a significant role in price discovery through their strategic selling decisions. The recent Bitcoin price weakness tells a fascinating story about market maturity. Rather than signaling fundamental problems, the internal selling indicates natural profit-taking by experienced holders. This understanding should provide confidence to investors concerned about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. The market’s ability to absorb such significant internal selling while maintaining relative stability speaks volumes about Bitcoin’s growing resilience. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is causing Bitcoin’s recent price decline? The primary cause appears to be profit-taking by long-term holders rather than ETF outflows or institutional selling. How much Bitcoin did long-term holders sell? Data shows approximately 405,000 BTC worth over $41.3 billion was sold by holders who had maintained positions for more than 155 days. Are Bitcoin ETFs seeing significant outflows? No, ETF outflows accounted for less than $1 billion, representing only about 0.5% of total assets under management. Who are the main sellers in the current market? The selling pressure comes primarily from within the established crypto community, specifically long-term Bitcoin holders taking profits. Should investors be concerned about this selling pattern? This appears to be normal profit-taking behavior rather than panic selling, indicating healthy market dynamics. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s future price? The ability to absorb significant internal selling while maintaining relative stability suggests underlying market strength. Found this analysis of Bitcoin price weakness insightful?

The arrest of this crypto scammer reveals how sophisticated digital fraud operations can infiltrate mainstream politics and devastate unsuspecting victims. How Did This Crypto Scammer Operate? Romillo Castillo, operating under the alias ‘Cryptospain,’ allegedly built a complex multi-level marketing scheme that promised incredible returns. The crypto scammer presented himself as the head of an investment fund specializing in cryptocurrencies and luxury goods. However, authorities discovered there was no legitimate business behind the operation. The scheme targeted approximately 3,000 investors who collectively lost $300 million. This case demonstrates why due diligence is crucial when considering cryptocurrency investments. The sophisticated crypto scammer used several tactics to appear legitimate: Professional-looking websites and marketing materials Promises of exclusive investment opportunities Multi-level referral bonuses to expand the victim pool False documentation and fabricated success stories What Makes This Crypto Scammer Case Different? The investigation took an unexpected turn when police discovered potential political connections. Authorities suspect the crypto scammer funneled illicit investor funds to far-right politicians in Spain. This development has expanded the investigation to include Luis Pérez Fernández, a leader of a Spanish far-right political party. Police evidence suggests Fernández allegedly received campaign funds from Castillo’s fraudulent operation. This political dimension adds complexity to an already troubling case of cryptocurrency fraud. The involvement of political figures raises serious questions about oversight and accountability in campaign financing. What Can Investors Learn From This Crypto Scammer? This case serves as a powerful reminder about the importance of verifying investment opportunities. The arrested crypto scammer exploited common vulnerabilities that all investors should recognize: Too-good-to-be-true returns – Always question unrealistic profit promises Lack of transparency – Legitimate investments provide clear documentation Pressure to recruit – Beware of multi-level marketing structures Political connections – Don’t assume legitimacy based on associations How Are Authorities Responding to Crypto Scammer Threats? Spanish police have demonstrated increased vigilance against cryptocurrency fraud. The successful identification and arrest of this crypto scammer shows law enforcement’s growing capability to track digital financial crimes. However, the case also highlights the challenges authorities face when fraud crosses into political territory. The expanded investigation into political connections suggests authorities are taking a comprehensive approach. This sends a strong message that cryptocurrency fraud won’t be tolerated, regardless of where the money flows. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? Cases like this crypto scammer arrest inevitably fuel discussions about cryptocurrency regulation. While the technology offers innovation and opportunity, it also creates new avenues for fraud. The $300 million loss in this case underscores the need for: Better investor education about cryptocurrency risks Stronger verification processes for investment platforms Enhanced international cooperation among regulators Clearer guidelines for political campaign financing The arrest of this sophisticated crypto scammer serves as both a warning and a victory. It demonstrates that authorities can successfully investigate complex digital fraud while reminding investors that vigilance remains essential in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions How many people were affected by this crypto scam? Approximately 3,000 investors lost money in this scheme, with total losses estimated at $300 million. What was the scammer’s alias? Romillo Castillo operated under the alias ‘Cryptospain’ to appear more credible to potential investors. Were there any legitimate business activities? Authorities found no evidence of any actual business operations behind the investment fund. What political connections were uncovered? The investigation revealed potential ties to far-right politicians, specifically Luis Pérez Fernández, who allegedly received campaign funds from the scam. How can I avoid similar crypto scams? Always verify investment opportunities, research company backgrounds, be skeptical of unrealistic returns, and avoid pressure to recruit others. What happens to the investigation now? The probe has expanded to include political connections, and authorities continue to trace the flow of funds to recover investor money.

Evernorth recently made headlines for its significant acquisition of large allocations of XRP. However, the timing may not have been any more opportune, or less, according to fresh analysis by on-chain data provider CryptoQuant . Evernorth and DATs Feel the Heat as Crypto Losses Mount Just weeks after building up its position in XRP, Evernorth now has around $78 million in unrealized losses. The drop demonstrates how sensitive DATs are to price fluctuations — not only in Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also in other tokens that might move with less liquidity and more volatility. Evernorth is not alone. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), widely regarded as the first prominent corporate Bitcoin treasury model, have declined by more than 26% over the last month as the price of Bitcoin has retreated. Shares of Strategy are now down by more than 50% from their all-time high, according to market data. Despite all that pressure, Strategy is still in relatively good shape. A report from BitcoinTreasuries indicates that the firm has an estimated average cost of around $74,000 per BTC for its reserves, implying that it still maintains a significant amount of paper profit on its Bitcoin holdings. NET. More worrisome are the companies whose primary holdings reside in other major cryptocurrencies. BitMine, which holds more corporate Ethereum than any other company in the world, now has a nearly $2.1 billion loss on its unrealized Ether reserves. The firm now holds almost 3.4 million ETH, with over 565,000 being acquired in the last month alone, suggesting that accumulation persisted even as market momentum diminished. Left watching the sector are analysts who see companies closely linked to the crypto market performance — and valuations for such companies becoming more strongly correlated — as providing less of a cushion for companies without diversified revenue models when prices tumble. A recent report highlighted that retail investors have collectively lost approximately $17 billion as a direct result of investing in companies that adopted the DATs model. Also, the premium these companies used to command over their net asset value of crypto holdings had vanished almost entirely at the time of analysis, signalling a significant change in sentiment. The engineering risk associated with relying on crypto price appreciation is becoming increasingly front and centre for both equity investors and analysts. Market researchers and venture analysts are comparing the DAT’s resurgence to the late 1990s dot-com bubble. In each case, a wave of companies emerged surrounding a revolutionary new technology. Long-held beliefs and innovation fueled others. Fast wealth-creating opportunities and speculative froth from investors propelled others. Companies like Breed Capital believe that Bitcoin-centric treasuries may be better off looking ahead. Bitcoin’s liquidity, institutional involvement, and relatively stable regulatory environment mean it is less at risk of abrupt market deterioration than tokens with shallower order books. DATs industry faces critical pressure The situation playing out at Evernorth is likely to add to the already heightened scrutiny surrounding DATs firms — especially those whose business strategies are more dependent on token prices surging than stable operational revenue. Investors are now focusing on whether these businesses have the ability to generate sustainable cash flow, whether their treasury policies insulate against downside risk, and whether they have meaningful diversification (real or anticipated) and liquidity in place. These are the very issues that will decide which firms remain on the side of this market storm and which ones could be on the street, needing a “restructuring”.

In a groundbreaking speech that sent ripples through financial markets, Miran revealed how trillions in stablecoin demand could fundamentally alter how the Fed manages our economy. Why Is Stablecoin Growth Becoming the Fed’s Top Priority? Steven Miran, a key Federal Reserve official with close ties to former President Trump, delivered a stunning prediction on July 7th. He stated that stablecoin usage could reach an astonishing $1 trillion to $3 trillion within the next decade. This massive stablecoin growth represents what he called the “elephant in the room” for central bankers worldwide. The Fed now recognizes that this rapid stablecoin growth isn’t just a niche trend – it’s a fundamental shift in how people use and store value. As more individuals and institutions adopt stablecoins, the implications for traditional monetary policy become increasingly significant. How Will Stablecoin Demand Strengthen the US Dollar? Here’s where the story gets fascinating. Miran explained that increasing stablecoin adoption creates a powerful domino effect: Every stablecoin is typically backed by US dollar reserves Growing stablecoin demand means growing dollar demand This increased demand naturally strengthens the dollar’s value The Fed must then adjust monetary policy accordingly This stablecoin growth essentially creates a new channel for global dollar demand that didn’t exist a decade ago. As more people worldwide use dollar-pegged stablecoins, they’re indirectly supporting the greenback’s dominance. What Monetary Policy Changes Can We Expect? The Federal Reserve now faces a crucial decision point. Miran confirmed that monetary policy will “adapt to stablecoin growth” based on the magnitude of its impact. This means we could see: Adjustments to interest rate decisions Modified reserve requirements for banks New regulatory frameworks for digital assets Enhanced monitoring of stablecoin market movements The speed of stablecoin growth will determine how quickly these changes unfold. If adoption accelerates faster than expected, the Fed might need to act more decisively. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Everyday Users? This official recognition of stablecoin growth marks a pivotal moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Fed’s acknowledgment signals that: Stablecoins are becoming systemically important Regulatory clarity is likely coming soon Traditional finance and crypto are converging faster than expected Your stablecoin holdings could indirectly influence national policy For everyday users, this means greater legitimacy and potentially more stability in the stablecoin market as regulatory oversight increases. The Bottom Line: A Financial Revolution in Motion The Federal Reserve’s awakening to stablecoin growth represents a watershed moment for both traditional finance and the crypto world. We’re witnessing the beginning of a coordinated response to digital currency innovation that could shape economic policy for decades. As stablecoin growth continues its upward trajectory, expect more central banks worldwide to follow the Fed’s lead in adapting their approaches. The financial landscape is changing before our eyes, and those who understand these shifts will be best positioned for the future. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Fed Governor Miran say about stablecoins? Steven Miran stated that stablecoins could become a $1-3 trillion market within ten years and that the Fed’s monetary policy will adapt to this growing demand, potentially strengthening the US dollar in the process. How could stablecoin growth affect the average person? Increased stablecoin adoption could lead to more efficient cross-border payments, better access to digital financial services, and potentially influence interest rates and dollar strength through Fed policy adjustments. Will this lead to more stablecoin regulation? Yes, the Fed’s recognition of stablecoin growth as systemically important almost certainly means increased regulatory oversight and clearer frameworks are coming soon. Can stablecoin demand really strengthen the US dollar? Yes, because most stablecoins are backed by US dollar reserves, increased demand for stablecoins directly increases demand for dollars, which typically strengthens the currency’s value. How quickly might these policy changes happen? The timing depends on the speed of stablecoin adoption, but the Fed has indicated it will monitor the situation closely and adjust policy as needed based on the magnitude of impact. Should I change my investment strategy because of this? While we can’t provide financial advice, understanding these macroeconomic trends can help you make more informed decisions about both traditional and digital asset investments.

During these eight days, the stock declined by 8.6%, resulting in a loss of approximately $350 billion in market value. Amid the stock pressure, Microsoft Corp. recently inked a deal worth about $9.7 billion to acquire artificial intelligence computing capacity from IREN Ltd ., making the Australian company its largest customer. The five-year agreement grants Microsoft access to Nvidia Corp.’s systems in Texas, which are built for AI workloads, and includes a 20% prepayment, IREN said in a statement on Monday. Sydney-based IREN has agreed to purchase the necessary advanced chips, known as graphics processing units, and related equipment for $5.8 billion from Dell Technologies Inc. Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals with data centre operators like IREN and CoreWeave Inc. over the past few months in an effort to secure as much computing capacity as possible to compete in the race to build and power AI systems. Just days ago, the Redmond, Washington-based firm said it’s still struggling to secure enough capacity to fulfil all of the demand for its cloud services. Microsoft encounters significant challenges at this time due to AI weaknesses Microsoft’s stock has declined since it revealed its quarterly earnings in late October. While the report includes a few positive strengths, such as growth in its Azure cloud computing business coming in better than analysts expected, Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the money companies invest in building AI infrastructure. Sources noted that Microsoft’s investment move accounted for about $34.9 billion in capital expenditures in the quarter. Moreover, the company hinted that spending would rise again in its current fiscal quarter. Regarding Microsoft’s decline in stock, analysts noted that this decline indicates a shift in sentiment towards AI companies, which had significantly enhanced the market earlier in the year. Meanwhile, both the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index declined 4% this week, marking their largest percentage drop in a week since April. Contrastingly, Apple Inc., which has not invested as heavily in AI, encountered an increase in its stock, rising by as much as 0.9% on Friday. Despite AI weaknesses, this achievement has positioned the tech company as a safe choice. Apple remains unaffected in a recent large selloff Reports dated November 6 this year noted that a recent large selloff affected several top-performing AI stocks such as Palantir Technologies Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Interestingly, only Apple remained unaffected . While other tech firms encountered declines, the iPhone maker faced a slight increase. The Nasdaq 100 Index, on the other hand, decreased by 1.6%. This situation was similar to an earlier trading period, when Apple experienced a slight increase despite the overall index declining by around 2.1%. In the meantime, it is worth noting that Apple’s stock has escalated, surpassing the 5% mark in the past month, while the tech-focused index barely changed, surging by less than 0.5%. Concerning Apple’s remarkable performance, analysts commented that this accomplishment marks a return to the firm’s usual stability. To achieve this stability, the tech firm has adopted a mechanism to generate cash and secure a strong financial position, which has enabled it to withstand market challenges . However, Apple reportedly fell behind other companies for much of this year because investors shifted their focus towards AI profits. Still, the tech giant revived after sharing a positive outlook earlier, which counteracted findings that demonstrated poor performance in China. According to recent reports, the iPhone maker earned approximately $27.5 billion in net income last quarter, with total revenue reaching $102.5 billion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are slowing down but the new projects with lower-cost tokens are where many perceive the biggest opportunity. One of the recently added to the list of entrants is a cryptocurrency that analysts are paying more attention to due to its strategic plan, increasing support, and actual use, so it may prove the most advantageous cryptocurrency to invest in currently prior to its official release. Presale Momentum One of the most active presales in DeFi is scheduled in 2025, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At this point, more than 17,750 holders spread around the world have been building a community that the project has already raised over $18.45 million. A total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens has been preallocated with some (1.82 billion) of the preprepared packs being allocated to the presale, which provides members of the early group on an even and open playing field to purchase their packs. The presale began in early 2025 with an initial cost of only $0.01, followed by the sale of multiple phases, and currently the token is valued at $0.035 in Phase 6, which is an increase of 250% over its original price. After the presale, the price of MUTM on launch will be $0.06. Going by the figures provided by the team, Phase 6 is already over 83% committed, and the pick-up is gaining more pace every week. The platform also implements a 24-hour leaderboard, and the highest addict that puts in during the day wins $500 worth of MUTM tokens, which motivates participants to work around the clock. The team also recently introduced a new payment option enabling investors to buy MUTM with a card and no purchase limits, which has won a few of the larger holders and increased presale growth. Long-Term DeFi Development The essence of it is that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing system with efficiency, transparency, and security in its top priority. This system will enable users to put their digital assets in loan to earn yield or more capital will be borrowed by them using their collateral as the guarantor of the loan all done automatically through smart contracts that will automate each transaction and make them need fewer intermediaries. The major part of this ecosystem is the mtToken, which is a yield-generating token that users earn by investing assets in the protocol. These tokens come with automated accruing interests as the lending pursuits increase, allowing users passive income. The other significant aspect in the model developed by Mutuum Finance is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. The revenue of protocols of lending fees is used in purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market and redistributed for those who invest mtTokens in a safety module. The independent security validation has also contributed to the high technical focus of Mutuum Finance. The protocol underwent a CertiK audit receiving a 90/100 Token Scan score, which is a good performance that builds investor confidence. Together with a bug bounty program of 50,000 dollars, it represents an indication that the project is moving towards the next stage of launching a product with a very high level of preparation. Stablecoin and Oracles In a case that goes beyond the launch, Mutuum Finance has already assured the launch of a USD-pegged stablecoin that would serve as a major component of their long-term expansion strategy. This stablecoin will be pegged on the borrowing activity in the platform. Such a system establishes a workable feedback loop, and lending volume matches in token demand. Chainlink oracles would also be used to give correct and real-time prices of all available assets in the project. In order to eliminate price manipulation and accurate liquidation events during times when borrowers are below expected collateral standards, oracles are essential. According to analysts, this is a perfect mix of proper pricing and robust liquidity management that places Mutuum Finance in the list of the most technically viable next DeFi crypto product. A number of market researchers have given optimistic views as to the future value of MUTM, basing on its plan to become a stablecoin, audited codebase, and token utility. Referring to local demand and ecosystem development, analysts predict possible 8x to 20x growth at its current presale price after the platform is launched, and listings start to take place. Growing Whale Interest The Mutuum Finance team has stated that the version 1 release of the protocol is planned to occur in the Q4 of 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet. This early release will be with the core functionality of the system Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot which will allow it to prove the functionality of real lending prior to its mainnet launch. The investor hype has been increasing at a high rate towards this milestone. Activities of whales have been witnessed especially within the past few weeks when several purchases of half a dozen figures have been registered within 24 hours. This is an indication that institutional and early strategic investors take the project seriously with Phase 6 approaching completion. Mutuum Finance is coming into the DeFi market when investors are seeking greater transparency and actual usefulness. Lending model, mtToken rewards and revenue-backed tokenomics form the model which has the potential to scale beyond hype cycles. As the presale is nearing the end stages and V1 release is coming, MUTM is becoming increasingly dissociated with hypothetical tokens that have little potential in the long term. Finally, as the major coins are driven into the background, there is potential that this new crypto is ultimately quietly positioning itself to have one of the best price performances of 2026.

Related Reading: Is A Ripple IPO Coming? Garlinghouse Shares New Insights Despite short-term weakness, analysts remain divided, with institutional forecasts ranging from $120,000 to $170,000 for 2025. Macro Pressure Keeps Bitcoin in Tight Range Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $100,900, down 2.01% in the last 24 hours, extending its 8.2% weekly decline. The broader crypto market capitalization slipped to $3.37 trillion as Ethereum fell below $3,400 and altcoins posted mixed results. Analysts attribute the muted action to tight liquidity and risk-off sentiment, with BTC trapped between key support at $100,500 and resistance at $102,500. According to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, maintaining levels above $100,500 keeps sentiment “constructive,” but a breakout above $102,500 is needed to target $104,000–$105,000. Whale activity, however, suggests accumulation. Wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC added nearly 30,000 BTC last week, signaling growing confidence among large holders. Diverging Institutional Bitcoin Forecasts Add to Uncertainty Institutional analysts remain split on Bitcoin’s next move. JPMorgan values BTC at $170,000, comparing its risk-adjusted volatility to gold, while Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor forecast a $150,000 year-end target driven by ETF inflows and institutional rotation. In contrast, Galaxy Digital cut its 2025 forecast to $120,000 after whales sold 400,000 BTC in October, warning that Bitcoin’s “maturity era” may lead to slower but steadier growth. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has trimmed her 2030 price target from $1.5 million to $1.2 million, citing stablecoin adoption in emerging markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where citizens are increasingly using USDT to hedge against inflation. Market Sentiment and Corporate Impact Market sentiment remains fragile, with RSI readings below 40 suggesting an oversold phase. Veteran analyst Tom Lee believes current macro challenges could “turn into opportunities,” predicting a turnaround once U.S. inflation eases. Adding to the mix, Block Inc., led by Jack Dorsey, reported $1.97 billion in Bitcoin-related revenue for Q3 2025, nearly one-third of its total earnings, despite a broader earnings miss that sent shares down over 10%.

Ray Dalio Warns Of ‘Stimulus Into A Bubble’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/most-dangerous-bitcoin-boom-ray-dalio/,"Ray Dalio has fired a shot across the macro bow, arguing that the Federal Reserve’s latest balance-sheet guidance risks “stimulating into a bubble” rather than stabilizing a weakening economy—an inversion of the classic post-crisis QE playbook with potentially seismic implications for hard assets, including Bitcoin. In a post titled “Stimulating Into a Bubble,” Dalio frames the Fed’s pivot—ending quantitative tightening and signaling that reserves will need to start growing again—as the next milestone in the late stage of the Big Debt Cycle. “Did you see that the Fed’s announcement that it will stop QT and begin QE?” he wrote, cautioning that, even if described as a technical maneuver, it is “an easing move… to track the progression of the Big Debt Cycle.” If balance-sheet expansion coincides with rate cuts and persistent fiscal deficits, Dalio warns, markets will be staring at a “classic monetary and fiscal interaction of the Fed and the Treasury to monetize government debt.” He adds that, in such a setup—high equity prices, tight credit spreads, low unemployment, above-target inflation, and an AI-led mania—“it will look to me like the Fed is stimulating into a bubble.” Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Just Bottom? Trader Says The Low Must Form Now The policy context for Dalio’s warning is not imaginary. After months of tightening liquidity and ebbing bank reserves, the Fed has announced it will end balance-sheet runoff (QT). Chair Jerome Powell underscored that, within the ample-reserves framework, the central bank will at some point have to add reserves again: “At a certain point, you’ll want reserves to start gradually growing to keep up with the size of the banking system and the size of the economy. So we’ll be adding reserves at a certain point,” he said at his October 29 press conference. Officials and many sell-side desks have emphasized that reserve management need not equal a return to crisis-era QE. The practical similarity: if the Fed is again a steady net buyer of Treasuries to maintain “ample” reserves as deficits persist, the market experience can rhyme with QE even without the label. While Dalio spars Bitcoin from his post, the mechanics are familiar to Bitcoin investors. He argues that when central banks buy bonds and push real yields down, “what happens next depends on where the liquidity goes.” If it remains in financial assets, “multiples expand, risk spreads compress, and gold rises,” producing “financial asset inflation.” Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 If it seeps into goods and services, inflation rises and real returns can erode. Crucially for cross-asset allocation, Dalio frames relative returns explicitly: with gold yielding 0% and, say, a 10-year Treasury yielding ~4%, gold outperforms if its price appreciation is expected to exceed that rate, especially as inflation expectations rise and the currency’s purchasing power falls. In that environment, “the more money and credit central banks are making, the higher I expect the inflation rate to be, and the less I like bonds relative to gold.” What This Means For Bitcoin Commentators immediately translated those mechanics for Bitcoin. “Fed resumes QE → more liquidity → real interest rates fall,” wrote Coin Bureau CEO Nick Puckrin. “Falling real rates → bonds & cash become unattractive → money chases risk and hard assets… Inflation risk rises → investors hedge with gold, commodities, and digital stores of value.” He highlighted Dalio’s own language—“gold rises so there is financial asset inflation,” and QE “pushes real yields down and pushes P/E multiples up”—before concluding: “Bitcoin thrives in precisely that environment… it’s digital gold on steroids.” Millionaire investor Thomas Kralow sharpened the timing risk embedded in Dalio’s framework: this would not be “stimulus into a depression” but “stimulus into a mania.” In his words, liquidity would “flood already overheated markets… stocks melt up, gold rips, and crypto… goes vertical,” with the usual risk-on sequence across the crypto complex. His caveat mirrors Dalio’s late-cycle caution: a liquidity melt-up now, then—on a longer horizon—re-acceleration in inflation, a forced policy reversal, and a violent bubble pop. For Bitcoin, the near-term transmission is straightforward. Lower real yields and expanding liquidity historically coincide with stronger performance of long-duration, high-beta, and scarcity narratives; similar to 1999-style melt-ups and late-cycle surges in hard assets, including gold—and, by extension, BTC as a “digital gold” proxy. But the medium-to-long-term tension is unresolved: if the same easing stokes renewed inflation pressure, the exit—the point at which policy must tighten into the bubble—becomes the regime break Dalio is flagging. Dalio’s bottom line is not a trading signal but a regime warning. “Whether this becomes a full and classic stimulative QE (with big net purchases) remains to be seen,” he writes. If the Fed is indeed easing into a bubble, Bitcoin may benefit on the way up—but that path, by Dalio’s own schema, ends with impact. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $99,717.

Blockchain analytics firm Santiment has issued a crucial warning that could impact every cryptocurrency investor’s portfolio. The alarming pattern of whales selling BTC while retail investors enthusiastically buy the dip represents a significant Bitcoin market risk that demands immediate attention. What Exactly is This Bitcoin Market Risk Signal? Santiment’s latest analysis reveals a concerning divergence in investor behavior. Since October 12th, whales holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have sold approximately 32,500 BTC. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets have been actively accumulating during price dips. This creates a substantial Bitcoin market risk because historical data shows BTC prices tend to follow whale direction rather than retail sentiment. Why Should You Care About This Market Warning? Understanding this Bitcoin market risk is essential for making informed investment decisions. The current situation presents several critical factors: Whales control significant portions of Bitcoin supply Their movements historically precede major price trends Retail investors often enter at market turning points The divergence indicates potential volatility ahead How Does This Bitcoin Market Risk Impact Your Strategy? This developing Bitcoin market risk requires careful consideration in your investment approach. While retail buying shows confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, the simultaneous whale selling suggests experienced investors see short-term challenges. Therefore, you might want to: Review your risk management strategies Consider dollar-cost averaging instead of large lump sums Monitor additional market indicators beyond whale movements Prepare for potential increased volatility What Historical Patterns Tell Us About This Bitcoin Market Risk Santiment’s research demonstrates that similar divergences between whale and retail behavior have preceded significant market movements. The current Bitcoin market risk pattern mirrors historical instances where retail enthusiasm contrasted with whale caution, often leading to price corrections. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results in this dynamic Bitcoin market risk environment. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Risk Landscape Facing this Bitcoin market risk doesn’t mean you should panic sell. Instead, use this information to make more informed decisions. The key is understanding that whale activity represents just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. You should also monitor: Overall market sentiment indicators Regulatory developments Macroeconomic factors affecting cryptocurrencies Technical analysis patterns This Bitcoin market risk warning from Santiment serves as a crucial reminder that successful cryptocurrency investing requires watching multiple indicators. While whale movements provide valuable insights, they work best when combined with other analysis methods. The current divergence between large and small investors highlights the importance of comprehensive market understanding in navigating Bitcoin’s volatile landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What defines a Bitcoin whale? Bitcoin whales typically hold between 10 and 10,000 BTC, representing investors with substantial market influence due to their large holdings. How reliable are whale movements as indicators? While historically significant, whale movements should be considered alongside other indicators since they represent just one aspect of market dynamics. Should retail investors stop buying when whales sell? Not necessarily. Many successful investors use dollar-cost averaging strategies regardless of whale activity, focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term movements. How often does Santiment update these analyses? Santiment provides regular market updates, but significant warnings like this typically accompany notable pattern changes or emerging risks. Can retail investors counteract whale selling pressure? While individual retail investors have limited impact, collective retail buying can sometimes provide support during whale selling periods. What other indicators should I watch alongside whale activity? Important complementary indicators include trading volume, fear and greed index, regulatory news, and broader market trends.

As the crypto market navigates sharp swings, investors are torn between proven giants and disruptive presales that promise astronomical gains. Ripple ($XRP), a mainstay in digital payments, continues to shape global liquidity networks. Yet deep within Ethereum’s core, a cinematic powerhouse named BullZilla ($BZIL) is emerging, a token designed to fuse storytelling, staking, and scarcity into one evolving ecosystem. In today’s unpredictable meme coin market, fundamentals and fun must coexist. Ripple’s established partnerships make it a reliable player, while BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine and live Roar Burn Mechanism set the stage for what could be one of the most explosive launches in 2025. Let’s dive into both worlds and uncover why traders are calling BullZilla the top crypto presale to buy this week. Ripple ($XRP): The Veteran Still Commanding the Crypto Arena Ripple remains a cornerstone of blockchain’s institutional adoption wave. Priced at $2.31 with a market cap of $139.63 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $5.86 billion, XRP remains a titan in the payment sector. Over the last 24 hours, XRP saw a 4.55% increase, though the 7-day performance dipped 9.95%, and the 1-month trend dropped 22.28%. Despite volatility, XRP has skyrocketed 333.67% in the past year, and from its all-time low of $0.002802 to its ATH of $3.84 (2018), it’s up an astounding 39,242%. Analysts expect Ripple’s price to hover between $3.20–$3.50 over the next 6–12 months as adoption accelerates through partnerships and CBDC integrations. However, Ripple’s momentum feels like a disciplined gallop compared to BullZilla’s untamed roar. Without deflationary mechanics or high-yield staking, Ripple offers stability over speculation, ideal for cautious investors, but less thrilling for those chasing explosive upside. In a market filled with barks and howls, Ripple remains the steady guard dog of crypto finance, but BullZilla may soon become the apex predator in meme token evolution. Frequently Asked Questions About Ripple What is Ripple’s current market performance? Ripple trades at $2.31 with a $139.63B market cap and $5.86B daily volume. Despite short-term dips, it’s up 333.67% annually and 39,242% from its all-time low, reflecting strong institutional adoption momentum. What is Ripple’s 2025 price prediction? Analysts forecast $3.20–$3.50 over the next 6–12 months, driven by global partnerships and CBDC integrations. Ripple’s steady growth positions it as a reliable asset for investors who favor consistency over the volatility of speculative meme coins. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Roaring Presale Reshaping the Meme Coin Era The BullZilla presale has introduced a new breed of tokenomics. Currently at Stage 9C (Phase 3) and priced at $0.00023239, the project has already raised over $1 million, with 3,500+ holders and more than 31 billion tokens sold. The beast’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. At this level, early buyers face a 2168.34% ROI from Stage 9C to the listing price of $0.00527, while the earliest believers enjoy returns exceeding 3941.56%. Each stage operates on a simple yet effective rule: the price climbs with every $100K raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This dynamic fuels FOMO and ensures continuous growth. Meanwhile, the Roar Burn Mechanism visibly burns a portion of supply at every chapter’s end, intensifying scarcity. With a 70% APY staking pool in the HODL Furnace and 10% referral rewards, BullZilla’s ecosystem keeps community engagement and token value roaring in sync. The Investor’s Blueprint: How a Small Bet Can Turn Gigantic For those seeking the top crypto presale to buy this week, BullZilla’s mathematics are impossible to ignore. A $1,000 investment today earns around 4.303 million $BZIL tokens, potentially worth $22,676 at listing. Scale that up, a $5,000 entry could yield 21.51 million tokens, translating to over $113,000 if the launch target holds. This isn’t blind speculation, it’s structured growth. BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine keeps token velocity consistent, while the Roarblood Vault provides long-term sustainability through its referral-driven community design. Fueled by Ethereum’s security and scalability, the project combines meme culture with hard-coded economic precision. BullZilla isn’t just a presale; it’s an evolving narrative of belief and burn. Frequently Asked Questions About Bullzilla Presale How does the BullZilla presale work? BullZilla’s presale price automatically increases every $100K raised or every 48 hours, ensuring consistent upward growth. Early investors gain access to lower entry prices, more substantial returns, and dynamic momentum-driven opportunities within its evolving ecosystem. What makes BullZilla different from other meme coins? BullZilla stands apart with narrative-based chapters, deflationary Roar Burns, 70% APY staking, and 10% referral bonuses. Each presale stage drives scarcity, amplifies engagement, and forges a community united by conviction rather than short-term hype. How much can investors earn from BullZilla staking? BullZilla’s HODL Furnace offers 70% APY, rewarding conviction over speculation. Holders who lock tokens earn consistent passive income while reinforcing network stability and strengthening long-term ecosystem value through sustainable yield mechanics and loyalty-based participation. Conclusion Based on our research and the latest market trends, both Ripple and BullZilla present distinct yet powerful opportunities for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape. BullZilla is named as the top crypto presale to buy this week . Ripple stands as a veteran of trust, driving institutional-grade liquidity and cross-border solutions with proven stability. Meanwhile, BullZilla represents the new-age contender—an ecosystem built around scarcity, lore, and gamified mechanics that transform holding into participation. Ripple’s foundation in real-world finance ensures reliability, while BullZilla’s presale innovation fuels energy, belief, and exponential upside for early believers entering before major adoption. Yet the difference lies in velocity and investor appetite. BullZilla’s progressive price increases, 70% APY staking furnace, and live Roar Burn deflationary system make it a standout among modern meme-driven ecosystems. Its cinematic lore chapters, automated price escalations, and community-fueled referrals create continuous momentum that rewards conviction over hesitation. As the presale edges closer to its next 2.87% surge, entry points tighten rapidly. Ripple may dominate institutional charts, but BullZilla’s roar is poised to dominate every headline in 2025.

The perfect storm hitting the mining industry right now threatens to wipe out operations that once thrived during bull markets. Recent reports reveal that rising Bitcoin mining costs combined with falling prices are creating an unprecedented survival challenge for miners worldwide. Why Are Bitcoin Mining Costs Becoming Unsustainable? The core problem lies in the hash price collapse. This crucial metric measures expected daily revenue per petahash per second (PH/s). It recently crashed to around $42 from July’s $62 per PH/s. This steady decline means miners earn significantly less for the same computational power they contribute to the network. Several factors drive these escalating Bitcoin mining costs: Soaring electricity expenses worldwide Increasing equipment maintenance and replacement costs Intensifying network competition requiring more powerful rigs Regulatory pressures adding compliance expenses How Are Miners Responding to These Challenges? The mining industry isn’t sitting idle. Many operations face tough choices as Bitcoin mining costs outpace potential rewards. TheMinerMag reports that continued hash price drops force some miners to consider complete shutdowns. This creates a domino effect throughout the equipment supply chain. Some manufacturers like Bitdeer now prioritize self-mining over hardware sales due to collapsing demand. Meanwhile, numerous Bitcoin miners pivot toward alternative revenue streams. The most popular shift involves transitioning to: AI computing services High-performance computing data centers Cloud computing infrastructure Alternative cryptocurrency mining What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future Security? Here’s the concerning part: if Bitcoin mining costs remain high while profitability declines, network security could suffer. Miners secure the blockchain through computational work, earning Bitcoin rewards. If too many miners shut down, the network’s hash rate could drop, potentially making it vulnerable to attacks. However, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment provides a built-in safety mechanism. Every 2016 blocks (approximately two weeks), the network automatically recalibrates mining difficulty based on participating hash power. This ensures block times remain consistent even as miners join or leave the network. Can Innovation Solve the Bitcoin Mining Costs Crisis? Absolutely. The industry already develops creative solutions to address rising Bitcoin mining costs. Renewable energy integration represents one promising approach. Solar and wind power can significantly reduce electricity expenses, which typically constitute 60-70% of operational costs. Other innovations include: More energy-efficient ASIC miners Heat recycling from mining operations Strategic location near cheap energy sources Modular mining facilities for easier scaling What Should Investors and Enthusiasts Watch? Monitoring hash price trends provides crucial insights into mining health. When Bitcoin mining costs exceed potential rewards for extended periods, industry consolidation typically follows. Smaller operations get acquired or close, while well-capitalized companies survive and potentially thrive during recovery periods. Additionally, watch for: Public mining companies’ quarterly reports Network difficulty adjustment trends Equipment manufacturer announcements Energy price developments in key mining regions Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Mining Crossroads The current Bitcoin mining costs crisis represents both danger and opportunity. While struggling miners face existential threats, efficient operations may emerge stronger. The industry’s pivot toward AI and alternative computing suggests resilience and adaptability. Ultimately, market forces will separate sustainable operations from those unable to manage rising Bitcoin mining costs effectively. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is hash price in Bitcoin mining? Hash price represents the expected daily revenue miners earn per petahash per second of computing power. It’s a crucial profitability metric that combines Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. How do rising energy costs affect Bitcoin mining? Electricity typically constitutes 60-70% of operational expenses. When energy prices increase, Bitcoin mining costs rise significantly, squeezing profit margins especially when cryptocurrency prices decline. Why are miners switching to AI computing? AI and high-performance computing offer more stable revenue streams compared to Bitcoin mining’s volatility. This diversification helps miners survive periods of high Bitcoin mining costs and low profitability. Can Bitcoin mining become profitable again? Yes, through several potential developments: Bitcoin price recovery, more energy-efficient technology, cheaper renewable energy integration, or network difficulty adjustments that reduce competition. What happens if too many miners shut down? Bitcoin’s network automatically adjusts mining difficulty downward, making it easier for remaining miners to earn rewards. This built-in mechanism helps maintain network security during miner exodus periods. How can small-scale miners survive high costs? Strategies include joining mining pools, accessing cheaper energy sources, using more efficient equipment, and potentially diversifying into other computing services alongside Bitcoin mining.

While Bitcoin and major altcoins grab headlines, investors are increasingly looking for projects with tangible, income-generating utility. In this landscape, one presale is making significant noise by bridging blockchain technology with the stability of the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. RentStac (RNS) is a project that’s rapidly gaining traction for its clear and powerful value proposition. Instead of relying on hype or complex DeFi mechanics, RentStac offers fractional ownership of rental properties, a market historically out of reach for the average investor. With its presale crossing the half-million-dollar mark and a limited-time bonus offer creating a sense of urgency, many are viewing it as a foundational project in the RWA sector. Why RentStac is Making Headlines Unlike many new tokens that offer speculative promise, RentStac’s model is anchored in physical, cash-flow-positive assets. This provides a layer of stability and inherent value that sets it apart from more volatile cryptocurrencies. The platform’s approach is both innovative and straightforward. RentStac acquires income-generating properties and places them into a legally sound structure known as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The ownership of this entity is then tokenized into RNS tokens. This means that an RNS token isn’t just a digital currency; it’s a verifiable share of a real estate portfolio. This structure allows investors to enjoy the financial benefits of property ownership, like rental income and appreciation, without the complexities of direct management. Presale Details You Can’t Ignore The impressive early performance of the RentStac presale highlights strong market confidence in its model. Total Funds Raised: $561,242 as of November 7, 2025 Current Token Price: $0.025 during its initial phase Accepted Payment Methods: ETH, USDT, USDC The main catalyst driving this momentum is an exceptional 100% Double Allocation Bonus. For a limited period, any investment made in the presale is matched with an equal number of free tokens. This offer effectively doubles an investor’s potential return from the outset. Consider the impact of this bonus. An investment of just $100 at the current price of $0.025 would secure 4,000 RNS tokens. With the bonus, that allocation instantly becomes 8,000 RNS. If the token’s price climbs to $1 after its public launch, that initial $100 investment could grow to be worth $8,000. It is this type of asymmetrical upside that defines successful early-stage crypto investments. This “double up” opportunity is strictly tied to the current presale phase and will not be repeate d. The Future of Tokenized Real Estate RentStac’s appeal is further strengthened by its “dual-yield” ecosystem, which is designed to deliver value to both passive holders and active participants. First, all token holders benefit from a system of automated buybacks. A portion of the rental income generated by the property portfolio is used to purchase RNS tokens from the open market. This action creates consistent demand and reduces the circulating supply, supporting the token’s long-term value. Second, for investors seeking more direct returns, RNS tokens can be staked in pools that are linked to specific properties. Participants in these pools earn a share of the monthly rental income, which is distributed in USDC. This provides a stable, predictable income stream that is insulated from the broader crypto market’s price swings. The project is also building on a strong foundation of security. Its smart contracts have already received a high security score of 92.48% from an audit by SolidityScan, and a more comprehensive audit by the well-respected firm CertiK is currently in progress. As the digital asset space matures, projects that offer clear utility and connect to real-world economic activity are positioned for sustainable growth. RentStac is a leading example of this trend. Its combination of a proven asset class, an innovative tokenization model, and a powerful, time-sensitive presale bonus makes it a compelling opportunity for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio beyond traditional cryptocurrencies.

The MVRV metric now reflects a valuation reset similar to the conditions that preceded major rebound phases in prior cycles. Why The Reset Reinforces Bitcoin Value Proposition The crypto bearish performance echoes through the Bitcoin community as the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio dips into the critical 1.8 to 2.0 range, a zone significant for past cycle corrections where BTC found its footing before initiating a recovery. An ambassador and market expert, BitBull, has revealed on X that for those unfamiliar with its significance, the MVRV ratio compares BTC’s current market value to its realized value, which is what investors actually paid for their coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Flatline: Bull Score Crashes To 0 – What This Means For The Market However, when this ratio dips near 2, it signals that a majority of holders are hovering around their cost basis. At this point, there’s no greed left in the system, just conviction. Historically, this 1.8 to 2.0 MVRV range has coincided with major market bottoms in June 2021, November 2022, and April 2025, when the market felt broken, but BTC was quietly resetting. With the MVRV ratio currently re-entering this same critical zone, combined with the massive liquidations observed recently and a palpable sense of panic across the market, the pattern feels eerily familiar. Every time sentiment turns into hopelessness, on-chain data would show a different story of exhaustion, not collapse. BitBull personally views this phase as one of compression, not capitulation, indicating short-term pain but a long-term opportunity. The same market dynamics cycle that previously punished excessive leverage is now washing out the remaining weak hands. BitBull concluded that if history rhymes, this will be the part of the story where the bottom gets written, not the top. Why Liquidity Matters More Than Interest Rates Liquidity has been a crucial component of the Bitcoin market. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that if there is one macro factor that drives BTC and the broader crypto market, it’s the amount of global liquidity within the financial system, not interest rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Grabs: Institutions Target Low-Volume Zones To Move BTC Price This correlation is clear from comparing the global liquidity index with BTC’s price movements over the years. Daan has recently observed a shift where global liquidity has stopped expanding and begun to trend downwards again. However, this change has put a halt to BTS’s upward momentum, combined with the anticipated profit-taking behavior observed during the 4-year market cycle. “Once global liquidity starts expanding at a rapid pace, the market environment for crypto will become significantly more supportive than it is currently,” the expert noted.

54151110,623611,1762567259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54151110.jpeg,Bitcoin Structure Is Changing: What Rising CDD Says About This Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-structure-changing-what-rising-cdd-says/,"Bitcoin is struggling to hold the $100K level, with bulls unable to reclaim momentum as fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The price continues to trade near critical support, and despite strong on-chain fundamentals, sentiment remains fragile. According to top analyst Darkfost, the market is undergoing a profound transformation — one that’s making many traditional on-chain indicators less reliable. “With time, we can clearly see that the structure and dynamics of the market are evolving,” he notes. While retail behavior and exchange flows once defined market cycles, the growing influence of institutions, ETFs, and long-term investors has changed the rhythm of Bitcoin’s price action. Still, some metrics remain vital, and one of the most insightful, according to Darkfost, is Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) — a measure of long-term holder activity. “It’s one of the indicators I follow the most because long-term holders are still driving this market,” he says. Currently, between 75% and 80% of all Bitcoin supply is held by long-term holders, signaling that the majority of investors remain strong-handed despite volatility. This consolidation among patient holders may ultimately set the stage for the next major trend once short-term fear fades. Long-Term Holders Drive Market Dynamics Through Rising CDD According to Darkfost, the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric remains one of the most valuable tools for understanding Bitcoin’s market structure. It provides a clear visualization of long-term holder (LTH) activity and the potential selling pressure they exert. Essentially, CDD measures how long coins have been held before being moved — and when older coins start circulating again, it’s often a sign that distribution is underway. Currently, the 30-day moving average of CDD is steadily rising, having doubled since early summer. Interestingly, this metric declined before Bitcoin’s last all-time high, helping fuel that rally, but it has continued to climb since — reflecting growing LTH activity. On an annual scale, CDD levels have already surpassed the 2021 cycle and are approaching those from 2017, marking one of the most active long-term holder phases in Bitcoin’s history. This trend signals a massive transfer of supply between market participants. Despite this, Bitcoin remains above $100,000, showing that today’s market is more liquid, resilient, and institutionally driven than in previous cycles. LTHs now have the ability to distribute significant volumes without crashing prices, demonstrating how far Bitcoin’s maturity and market depth have evolved over time. Bitcoin Battles to Hold $100K Support Bitcoin is currently trading near $100,767, struggling to maintain stability after a volatile week marked by aggressive selling pressure. The daily chart reveals that BTC has once again tested the $100K psychological support, a key level that bulls must defend to prevent further downside momentum. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains below its 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, signaling that short- and mid-term momentum continues to favor the bears. The 200-day moving average (red) — now positioned slightly above $106K — is acting as dynamic resistance, reinforcing the broader correction phase that began in late October. If Bitcoin manages to close above $103K–$104K, it could signal a short-term recovery toward $108K–$110K. Conversely, a decisive break below $100K could trigger a sharper correction toward $95K, potentially testing the market’s resilience as sentiment continues to waver between fear and cautious optimism.

In a letter, OpenAI’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, Chris Lehane, requested that the existing 35% tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing be expanded to include AI data centres, server production, and essential electrical grid components. The move underscores OpenAI’s attempts to cut costs in building infrastructure for advanced artificial intelligence. Lehane argues that a broader tax credit would reduce the effective cost of capital, decrease risk in early-stage investments, and unleash private financing that could accelerate the development of AI infrastructure in the U.S.. The company also contended that enabling the sanctions to continue in force would be a step toward ensuring the existence of a domestic supply chain for critical materials and components, such as special steel, transformers, and other electrical equipment needed in high-capacity data centres. This push comes as OpenAI recently agreed to purchase $38 billion worth of capacity from Amazon Web Services. Amazon noted in a press release that OpenAI will utilize hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) in the United States to run workloads on AWS infrastructure, with plans to increase capacity in the coming years. Amazon stated that the rapid advancement of AI technology has created an unprecedented demand for computing power. According to Amazon, the deal’s initial phase will utilize existing AWS data centres, and it will subsequently expand its OpenAI infrastructure. Administration says no to federal AI backstop OpenAI’s request comes as attention to the costs and funding of AI infrastructure has been increasing. The company has already committed to investing $1.4 trillion in data centres and chips to develop even more advanced AI systems. Its investment plans have baffled some in the industry, as OpenAI has employed inventive financing mechanisms to support this expansion. This week, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar sparked controversy by suggesting that perhaps the U.S. government has a role to play in supporting financing for AI infrastructure. OpenAI promptly stated that it is not seeking a federal bailout, saying Friar was mistaken. The administration has been unequivocal in not supporting a direct financial backstop for AI companies. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks has publicly stated that there is no Federal bailout for AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman assured that the company is seeking measures to bolster the U.S. AI and semiconductor sector, not loans or guarantees for its own operations. A robust U.S. supply chain from the manufacturer of semiconductors and transformers to raw steel would benefit all industry customers and other industries that depend on those elements, and it should be a national security interest,” Altman said. OpenAI urges Washington to back AI infrastructure The letter also suggested that manufacturers in the AI sector may soon receive broader government support through grants, loans, or cost-sharing arrangements. Such a boost would be designed to guard against market distortion from international competition, including that of China, and reduce lead times in areas such as infrastructure. In a separate white paper published in September, the company also noted that loan guarantees would enable AI firms to purchase U.S.-made chips in volume without worry, adding more depth to domestic chip demand while driving down costs for AI developers. The Chips Act, which originally aimed at chip fabrication, has delivered only a small portion of its funds so far. OpenAI’s plan aligns with a Trump administration goal of enhancing U.S. competitiveness in AI by promoting domestic investment in infrastructure deemed essential. It could also help accelerate the deployment of AI data centers and other infrastructure, making it more likely that the U.S. can remain a winner in AI technology by building out AI ecosystems for manufacturing in America.” Although the administration has not publicly responded to OpenAI’s letter, the submission serves as an example of how AI companies are entering a new phase of influencing U.S. industry and technology policy. OpenAI’s proposal for a wider tax credit reflects its view that public policy could help facilitate the rapid deployment of AI while preserving the nation’s manufacturing capabilities.

Solana just pulled $9.7 million in ETF inflows within 24 hours, hinting at surging institutional interest, while Tron’s chart shows a double-bottom breakout that has analysts flipping bullish. These signals are fueling optimism across major altcoins heading into year-end. Meanwhile, MoonBull ($MOBU) is taking over the presale spotlight with a model that blends high staking rewards and scarcity-driven growth. As traditional assets steady and altcoins bounce, MoonBull’s mix of real utility, transparent tokenomics, and strong community engagement makes it the most exciting candidate for explosive returns in 2025. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Top 100x Crypto to Buy MoonBull isn’t just another presale; it’s a staking powerhouse. The project offers a fixed 95% APY return, starting from the 20h stage of the presale, allowing holders to earn daily rewards without rigid staking conditions. Tokens can be staked directly from the dashboard, with rewards supported by a 14.6 billion $MOBU pool dedicated to long-term sustainability. This system ensures every investor, from small participants to large whales, can grow their holdings consistently. By removing high entry barriers and maintaining flexibility, MoonBull aligns with its mission to deliver accessible passive income. The staking pool strengthens token stability while rewarding commitment, positioning MoonBull as the top 100x crypto to buy for investors seeking both growth and reliability. MoonBull Presale Momentum: Stage 6 and Rising MoonBull’s presale is now in its 6th stage, priced at $0.00008388 with over $550,000 raised and 1,900+ holders onboard. The current ROI sits above 7,244%, and early entrants from Stage 5 have already enjoyed 235% returns. With an upcoming 27.4% price surge expected in the next phase, investors still have time to secure positions before the next jump. The presale’s structured pricing ensures predictable gains, giving both early and mid-stage participants strong upside potential. This stage represents a sweet spot, late enough to confirm legitimacy but early enough to capture significant returns as liquidity and staking rewards scale after launch. Solana (SOL): ETF Inflows of $9.7M Spark $200 Price Ambition Solana continues its remarkable comeback, pulling $9.7 million in ETF inflows in just 24 hours, according to AMBCrypto. Institutional investors are piling in, driving optimism that Solana could revisit the $200 level before year-end. Analysts credit its strong on-chain performance and its ability to handle over 80 million daily transactions, making it one of the most scalable networks in crypto. The ETF traction shows Solana’s evolution from a retail-driven coin to an institutional favorite. Its expanding developer base and dominance in DeFi and NFTs are key factors behind the bullish sentiment. If the inflows continue at this rate, Solana could reclaim its 2021 highs faster than expected. Tron (TRX): Technical Rebound from Double Bottom Ignites Bullish Momentum Tron is quietly mounting a comeback. A new analysis by 99Bitcoins highlights that TRX has completed a double-bottom pattern, a technical indicator that often precedes a sharp trend reversal. Trading volume has increased significantly, and Tron’s consistent growth in stablecoin transactions exceeding $24 billion daily underlines its position as a cornerstone of blockchain-based finance. The Tron DAO’s focus on cross-border payments and recent integrations, including Dynamic’s wallet SDK, continue to attract developers. This shift suggests TRX could build steady momentum in Q4, making it one of the more reliable altcoins heading into 2025. Conclusion: As Solana’s ETF inflows accelerate and Tron regains bullish footing, the broader crypto market looks ready for its next leg up. These moves show that institutional interest and network fundamentals still drive long-term performance. Yet among these rallies, MoonBull offers what the giants cannot: massive early-stage potential and accessible compounding rewards. With 95% APY staking, a growing holder base, and a presale model that rewards loyalty, MoonBull combines the best of both worlds: innovation and income. For investors eyeing the 100x crypto to buy before 2025, MoonBull’s momentum, transparency, and ecosystem growth make it one of the most promising projects in today’s market cycle.

The end of the US government shutdown is about to create powerful liquidity tailwinds that could transform your investment portfolio. According to expert analysis from Glassnode co-founders, we’re standing at the edge of a significant market shift that benefits risk assets across the board. What Are Liquidity Tailwinds and Why Do They Matter? Liquidity tailwinds represent the powerful market forces that push investments forward. Think of them as favorable winds filling the sails of your investment ship. When liquidity increases, more money flows into markets, creating upward momentum for assets like stocks, cryptocurrencies, and high-yield bonds. The recent government shutdown created the opposite effect – liquidity headwinds. The Treasury General Account accumulated funds above its target, essentially draining money from the system. This temporary situation hurt risk assets, but the reversal promises to be dramatic. How Does the Shutdown End Create These Liquidity Tailwinds? When government spending resumes, something remarkable happens. The Treasury releases accumulated funds from the TGA back into the financial system. This creates immediate liquidity tailwinds that benefit risk assets in several ways: Increased money supply in circulation Improved market confidence and investor sentiment Enhanced borrowing and lending activity Stronger demand for higher-risk investments Negentropic, the analysis platform by Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, explains this creates perfect conditions for market recovery. What Additional Factors Boost These Liquidity Tailwinds? The shutdown resolution isn’t the only factor creating favorable conditions. Several other elements combine to strengthen these liquidity tailwinds: Quantitative tightening ends in December – reducing market pressure Potential interest rate cuts – making borrowing cheaper Federal Reserve balance sheet expansion – injecting more liquidity Together, these factors create a powerful combination of liquidity tailwinds that could drive significant market gains. The transition from headwinds to tailwinds happens quickly, catching many investors by surprise. How Can Investors Ride These Liquidity Tailwinds? Understanding liquidity tailwinds gives you a strategic advantage. Here’s how to position your portfolio: Monitor Treasury General Account levels for early signals Watch for Federal Reserve policy announcements Diversify across multiple risk asset categories Maintain some cash for quick deployment opportunities The current situation represents a rare opportunity where multiple liquidity factors align simultaneously. These liquidity tailwinds could drive the next major market rally. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? The emergence of strong liquidity tailwinds signals a potential turning point for risk assets.

The Binance founder’s recent statements challenge everything we thought we knew about presidential pardons in the cryptocurrency space. This explosive development comes at a critical time for the entire digital asset industry. What Really Happened Between Changpeng Zhao and Eric Trump? Changpeng Zhao recently sat down with Fox News to clarify the details of his encounter with Eric Trump. The meeting occurred at a high-profile Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi, but according to Zhao, the conversation never touched on presidential pardons or World Liberty Financial. This direct denial addresses mounting speculation about backdoor deals in the crypto industry. The Binance founder emphasized that claims linking their meeting to WLFI and his subsequent pardon are completely baseless. He stated clearly that no negotiations occurred and no business relationship exists with WLFI. This straightforward account contradicts circulating rumors that suggested otherwise. Why Does This Changpeng Zhao Denial Matter? The timing of Zhao’s statement is crucial. It comes just weeks after President Donald Trump granted Changpeng Zhao a presidential pardon, sparking intense lobbying allegations. The crypto community has been buzzing with theories about what really transpired behind the scenes. Key points from Zhao’s denial include: No pardon discussions occurred during the meeting No business relationship exists with World Liberty Financial The encounter was brief and casual Claims of deal-making are completely unfounded How Has the White House Responded? President Trump himself added another layer to this developing story when he stated he doesn’t know who Changpeng Zhao is and has never met him. This creates an intriguing contrast with the pardon decision. The administration framed the pardon as a strategic move to maintain American competitiveness in the cryptocurrency sector. The White House issued an official statement confirming that the pardon underwent thorough review procedures. This suggests that despite the unusual circumstances, proper channels were followed in the decision-making process concerning Changpeng Zhao. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? This situation highlights the complex relationship between cryptocurrency leaders and government authorities. The case of Changpeng Zhao demonstrates how quickly misinformation can spread in the fast-moving crypto space. It also shows the importance of transparency when high-profile figures in digital assets interact with political families. The crypto industry faces increased scrutiny regarding: Political connections and influence Regulatory clarity Public perception of industry leaders Government oversight of digital assets Final Verdict: Separating Fact from Fiction The Changpeng Zhao case serves as a powerful reminder that in cryptocurrency, appearances can be deceiving. While the meeting with Eric Trump raised eyebrows, the lack of evidence supporting pardon discussions suggests we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. The industry continues to navigate uncharted waters where business, politics, and innovation intersect. As the dust settles, one thing remains clear: transparency and factual reporting are more important than ever in the crypto space. The Changpeng Zhao situation demonstrates why we must verify claims before accepting them as truth in this rapidly evolving industry. Frequently Asked Questions What did Changpeng Zhao say about meeting Eric Trump? Changpeng Zhao confirmed meeting Eric Trump at a Bitcoin conference but denied discussing any pardon or business deals. Why was Changpeng Zhao pardoned? President Trump stated the pardon was to keep the US crypto industry competitive, though he claimed not to know Zhao personally. What is World Liberty Financial? WLFI is a company that Zhao specifically mentioned having no business relationship with in his denial. Where did the meeting occur? The encounter took place at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi according to Zhao’s statements. Has the White House commented on this situation? Yes, the White House confirmed the pardon underwent thorough review and provided an official statement. What does this mean for crypto regulation? This case highlights the ongoing challenges in crypto regulation and political relationships within the industry.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase Premium Gap Has Been Red Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, investors on Coinbase keep selling Bitcoin. The indicator of relevance here is the “Coinbase Premium Gap,” which measures the difference between the BTC price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). Related Reading: Bitcoin At Increased Risk Of Falling To $88,500 Support, Glassnode Warns When the value of this metric is positive, it means the asset is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend suggests the users of the former are applying a higher buying pressure (or lower selling pressure) than those of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies Binance users are the ones participating in a higher amount of accumulation as they have pushed the asset to a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows how the Coinbase Premium Gap has fluctuated over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has stayed mostly in the negative zone during the past week, implying users on Coinbase have been participating in selling. The metric briefly turned neutral-green as the cryptocurrency witnessed a surge back above $104,000, but since then, the indicator’s value has again plummeted, and with it, the BTC price has erased its recovery. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin has often reacted to movements in the Coinbase Premium Gap in a similar manner, showcasing how Coinbase users have been a driving force in the market. The exchange is mainly used by American investors, especially large institutional entities like the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so the Coinbase Premium Gap essentially reflects how the US-based whales differ in behavior from Binance’s global traffic. Since the indicator has been red recently, it would appear that the American institutions have been distributing the cryptocurrency. Considering the pattern over the last couple of years, it’s possible that BTC’s recovery might depend on whether a bullish sentiment can return among this cohort. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Line That Has Triggered Strong Rebounds Since Nov 2024 In some other news, a movement of old tokens has just been spotted on the Bitcoin blockchain, as Maartunn has highlighted in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that a stack of over 13,000 BTC that has been dormant for between 3 and 5 years has become involved in a transaction, a potential sign that a HODLer may be gearing up for selling. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $100,200, down almost 9% over the last week.

54152256,623813,1762570818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54152256.jpeg,Bitcoin Boom Reward: Spain’s Science Institute To Liquidate Decade-Old BTC Holdings,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-reward-spains-science-institute-to-liquidate-decade-old-btc-holdings/,"A public research center in Tenerife is preparing to sell a stash of Bitcoin it bought more than a decade ago — a holding that has grown from a modest experiment into a multi-million dollar pot. Reports say the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER), tied to the Tenerife Island Council, purchased 97 BTC in 2012 for about €10,000. The coins are now worth over $10 million at current prices. Preparing To Liquidate A Long-Held Holding ITER did not buy the Bitcoin as a bet on prices. According to local reporting, the purchase was part of a project to study blockchain and related systems. Now, after years of rising values, council officials are in talks with a regulated Spanish financial institution to move the assets into cash in line with Bank of Spain and CNMV rules. The sale process faces hurdles. Banks and brokers often demand detailed compliance paperwork for big crypto transactions. That means the operation will be carried out through official channels rather than on a retail exchange. Some sources note ITER has been trying for years to sort legal and administrative steps around the holdings. Funds Pledged To Research Projects Based on reports, the money raised from the sale will be used to fund new research at the institute. ITER plans to put the proceeds toward projects including quantum technology and other scientific work that it says will benefit the island and regional development. Officials have framed the plan as a way to turn an old experiment into a public resource for research. How Big Is The Gain? The numbers are stark. Buying 97 Bitcoin for roughly €10,000 in 2012 and selling them now at market levels would mean a return measured in the thousands of percent. Exact figures will depend on the final sale price and exchange rates used on the day the coins move. Tax and legal costs could also affect the net amount the institute receives. What Officials Have Said Council members and ITER representatives have given short statements to local press about the plan, noting that the original purpose was research rather than investment. Reports indicate officials are coordinating with legal and financial advisers to make sure the disposal meets Spanish rules around public funds and asset sales. The aim is to avoid any misstep that might delay the cashing-out.

This incredible strategy has generated a staggering $5.65 million in unrealized profits, showcasing the power of strategic position building in volatile markets. What Exactly Are Pyramiding ZEC Longs? Pyramiding ZEC longs involves continuously using unrealized profits to open additional long positions. Think of it as building upward – each successful trade becomes the foundation for the next. This approach requires careful risk management and market timing, but when executed correctly, it can amplify gains significantly. The trader in question started their pyramiding ZEC longs position five days ago at an average entry price of $410. Through strategic reinvestment of profits, they’ve built their position to an impressive 55,000 ZEC tokens. The current average entry price now stands at $513.5, demonstrating how pyramiding can lower risk while increasing exposure. How Does Pyramiding Create Such Massive Returns? The magic of pyramiding ZEC longs lies in its compounding effect. Instead of taking profits, the trader reinvests them into larger positions. This approach works exceptionally well during sustained bull runs like ZEC’s current rally. Compounding gains – Profits generate more profits Increased exposure – Position size grows with success Risk management – Only profits are at risk in new positions Market momentum – Works best during strong uptrends What Are the Risks of Pyramiding Strategies? While pyramiding ZEC longs can create extraordinary returns, it’s crucial to understand the risks. The current liquidation price sits at $500.8, meaning a significant price drop could wipe out all gains. This highlights why proper risk management is essential when employing pyramiding techniques. ZEC’s impressive performance provides context for this success story. The cryptocurrency has surged over 270% in the past month alone, currently trading at $619.27 with an 11% daily gain. Such strong momentum creates ideal conditions for successful pyramiding ZEC longs strategies. Key Takeaways for Aspiring Traders This case study demonstrates several important lessons about pyramiding ZEC longs. First, timing matters – entering during a strong uptrend increases success probability. Second, position sizing requires careful calculation to avoid overexposure. Finally, having a clear exit strategy prevents emotional decision-making during market volatility. The $5.65 million unrealized profit from pyramiding ZEC longs serves as both inspiration and caution. While the potential rewards are substantial, the risks demand respect and careful planning. Frequently Asked Questions What is pyramiding in cryptocurrency trading? Pyramiding involves using unrealized profits from existing positions to open additional positions in the same direction, effectively compounding exposure during favorable market moves. How risky is pyramiding ZEC longs? Pyramiding carries significant risk since it increases exposure and lowers the average entry price closer to current market prices. A sharp reversal can quickly erase profits. What makes ZEC suitable for pyramiding strategies? ZEC’s recent strong momentum and sustained rally create ideal conditions for pyramiding, though any volatile cryptocurrency with clear trends can work. How do I start pyramiding positions? Begin with a solid entry strategy, determine position size increments, set strict risk management rules, and always have a clear exit plan before entering trades. What’s the difference between pyramiding and averaging down? Pyramiding adds to winning positions using profits, while averaging down adds to losing positions to reduce average cost – completely different risk profiles. Can beginners try pyramiding strategies? While possible, beginners should master basic risk management first and start with small positions to understand the dynamics before attempting pyramiding.

What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Reversal? The recent data reveals a concerning pattern for Bitcoin ETFs enthusiasts. After breaking a six-day outflow streak with temporary inflows, the market has taken an unexpected turn. Major financial institutions saw significant withdrawals that contributed to this substantial net outflow figure. Let’s examine the breakdown from major players: BlackRock’s IBIT: $127.17 million outflow Fidelity’s FBTC: $256.66 million outflow Ark Invest’s ARKB: $144.24 million outflow Bitwise’s BITB: $10.68 million outflow Grayscale’s GBTC: $15.44 million outflow Why Are Investors Pulling Money from Bitcoin ETFs?

When we see such significant movements in Bitcoin ETFs, it typically indicates changing risk appetite among major market participants. How Does This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Market?

Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly holding digital assets. Why do Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? Outflows occur when investors sell more shares than they buy, often due to market volatility, profit-taking, or changing risk appetite. How do outflows affect Bitcoin prices? Significant outflows can create selling pressure, potentially leading to price declines as fund managers may need to sell Bitcoin to meet redemption requests.

Fidelity’s FBTC saw the largest outflow at $256.66 million, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB at $144.24 million. Can Bitcoin ETFs recover from such outflows?

Market veterans often view such outflows as potential buying opportunities when they believe the underlying asset remains strong. The key is to analyze whether the outflow reflects temporary market sentiment or fundamental concerns about Ethereum’s value proposition. What’s Next for US Spot ETH ETFs? The future trajectory of US spot ETH ETFs will depend on several factors. Market participants will be closely watching for: Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency Ethereum network upgrades and performance Broader macroeconomic conditions Institutional adoption trends While the current outflow from US spot ETH ETFs might seem concerning, it’s important to maintain perspective. The cryptocurrency market has always been volatile, and smart investors know that short-term movements don’t always predict long-term outcomes. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the recent US spot ETH ETFs outflow? The $48.1 million outflow was primarily driven by large withdrawals from Fidelity’s FETH ($72.23 million) and Grayscale’s ETH fund ($11.42 million), despite BlackRock’s ETHA attracting $32.96 million in inflows. How often do US spot ETH ETFs experience outflows? Outflows are common in volatile markets. This particular outflow occurred after breaking a seven-day losing streak, showing how quickly sentiment can change in cryptocurrency markets. Should I be worried about investing in US spot ETH ETFs? While outflows can indicate short-term concerns, they don’t necessarily reflect long-term value. Many investors view such periods as potential entry points, but always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance. How do US spot ETH ETFs differ from other crypto investments? US spot ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum without the technical complexities of direct ownership. They’re particularly attractive to institutional investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles. Can US spot ETH ETFs outflows predict Ethereum price movements? While there’s often correlation, outflows don’t always directly cause price declines. Many factors influence Ethereum’s price, including network activity, developer interest, and broader market conditions. What’s the long-term outlook for US spot ETH ETFs? Most analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of US spot ETH ETFs as cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow among both retail and institutional investors.

This decision came after a dragged-out overnight brawl between First Brands’ lawyers and a room full of pissed-off creditors. The loan keeps the company running for now, but it came with a ton of strings attached and even more people watching their backs. The whole fight started because more than 80 hedge funds and money managers offered to throw cash at First Brands, but only if they got paid first, on not just the new debt, but on $3.3 billion they were already owed. A bunch of creditors weren’t having it. They called the terms greedy and one-sided. Still, without that cash, the company was toast. So, like it or not, Judge Christopher Lopez said the deal was going through. Creditors protest, judge shrugs, deal moves forward The hearing on Thursday was packed, with close to 100 lawyers and advisers squeezed into that Houston courtroom, fighting over who gets what. People were hopping between side rooms and hallways, trying to get something on paper. Leading the charge for First Brands was Weil Gotshal & Manges, the law firm tasked with keeping the company from collapsing. And collapse was a real threat. Without the loan, they said, the company would be forced into a messy fire sale that wouldn’t cover much of anything. Creditors backing the deal said this was the only real option. But the committee of unsecured creditors wasn’t buying it. Their advisers warned the loan could carry an interest rate as high as 74%, which they described as totally outrageous. But again, Christopher said, “There are no better terms out there.” He admitted he didn’t love that the lenders would get top priority for both the new and old debt, but said this was an ugly case all around. “This is anything but a common case,” he added. Buried in the loan terms is another protection; if the money runs short, First Brands agreed to guarantee $200 million for admin expenses. That includes employee wages, building leases, and advisers’ pay. No one in the room wanted to be the one left hanging if this whole thing spiraled further down. Founder gets hit with lawsuit while court eyes more hearings While all that was happening in court, First Brands’ new management hit its founder, Patrick James, with a fresh lawsuit. They claim Patrick stripped the company of billions, draining it dry before everything blew up. He denies it, obviously. But the lawsuit is now one of the biggest bets left on the table. If they win, it could bring real money back into the estate. And yes, there’s already a formula in place for who gets what if they manage to claw back anything from Patrick or anyone tied to him. Now the court has more coming.On Monday, lawyers will meet again to decide whether Patrick can be stopped from selling off his assets while the case against him plays out. Then later this month, the judge will hear arguments on whether to bring in an independent examiner to dig into all the shady stuff that went down at First Brands before it filed for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, with lawyers and consultants billing like crazy, Christopher called it “an expensive room” and told both sides to work faster before the fees eat what’s left. Estimates say professional fees alone could hit hundreds of millions of dollars before this thing wraps, according to the Financial Times.

Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, & Sumitomo Mitsui To Jointly Issue Stablecoins As announced in a press release by MUFG bank, its banking group, along with two other major financial institutions, has just received approval from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a stablecoins proof-of-concept. According to the press release, the banks’ project will involve joint stablecoin issuance and advanced cross-border payments, with both set to receive support from the FSA. Digital asset platform Progmat, founded by Mitsubishi UFJ, will provide the infrastructure and technological support for the proof-of-concept. “The three banks considering joint issuance will define requirements and establish evaluation criteria to build a concrete structure,” said MUFG. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that has its price pegged to a fiat currency. Currently, the most popular assets of this type are tied to the US dollar (USD). The three big banks are expected to issue a stablecoin backed by the Japanese yen (JPY). Last month, Japanese startup JPYC launched the nation’s first yen-based stablecoin, as reported by Bitcoinist . The token, called “JPYC,” is backed by domestic deposits and Japanese government bonds. For now, the company is offering 0% fees on issuance and redemption of JPYC to promote adoption. MUFG’s press release noted that blockchain-based payments and use of tokenized deposits and stablecoins are being explored both domestically and overseas. So this proof-of-concept from the banks will serve as a testing ground to accumulate practical knowledge related to joint stablecoin issuance. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong approved its legislature on these fiat-tied tokens earlier this year, and big names like Standard Chartered in its joint venture are on the waiting list for an issuer license. The first batch of approvals was earlier expected to drop next year, but a recent Financial Times report has revealed that mainland regulators have urged applicants to pause their plans, due to concerns about the growth of currencies controlled by the private sector. Over in Europe, a consortium of big banks has come together to launch a euro stablecoin in the second half of 2026. Initially, the consortium included nine European banks, but later a tenth financial institution in the American Citigroup joined the effort. The euro-pegged token, which aims to be fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), seeks to provide a real alternative to the USD-heavy stablecoin market. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has been facing bearish pressure recently, which has taken its price to the $100,000 level, down over 8% on the weekly timeframe. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin saw a recovery surge above $104,000. This rally interestingly occurred alongside notable stablecoin exchange inflows, as pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . It’s possible that investors made these deposits to convert their stables for BTC and other volatile assets, but considering the latest price trend, the buying pressure didn’t last.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Japan|Japan Megabanks|Japan Stablecoin|stablecoin|Yen Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-08 04:00:08

At the moment, XRP trades at $2.16, down 12% in the last seven days as the wider crypto market struggles. Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Over 21,000 New Wallets Appear In 48 Hours Investor Reactions Vs. Reality Based on reports, the drop has stirred panic even though XRP is up over 300% since November last year. That sharp gain is easy to miss when prices fall. History shows how emotionally charged this market can be: XRP hit a $3.31 high in January 2018, then sank below $1 and spent six years between $0.3 and $0.7, with a brief rise to $1.95 in April 2021. The coin later rallied above that zone during November 2024, touching $3.40 before facing resistance. By 2070, you guys will be shitting your pants when XRP drops from $1,200 to $1,000 — BD (@DiepSanh) November 6, 2025 Market Numbers & Sentiment Today’s numbers put the recent mood in context. Reports show XRP reached a market cap peak of $215 billion in July but has since given up more than $82 billion, leaving a market cap near $131 billion at press time. Technical indicators and short-term forecasts point to continued pressure: one prediction expects XRP to fall 0.73% to reach $2.19 by December 7, 2025. The altcoin’s Fear & Greed Index reads 24, labeled “Extreme Fear”, and XRP recorded 15/30 green days with 6% price volatility over the last 30 days. Traders see the data and react quickly. Some call this a chance to buy; others see it as a warning sign. Will Future Holders Poop Their Pants? Diep Sanh’s quip — that people will be pooping their pants when a $1,200-to-$1,000 move happens in about 45 years — is meant to point out a behavioral pattern, not to set a real price target for 2070. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Potential 50% Crash—But Analysts Say The Fear Is Overblown Still, the numbers he used are eye-catching: a $1,000 valuation from today’s $2.23 would represent a 44,740% gain. That kind of math flips the usual perspective. What looks like a crash from the peak would actually be an extraordinary profit relative to present levels. Certain analysts contend that the latest pullback could prolong and offer yet another opportunity to accrue XRP below $2 for those who missed the previous rally. Conversely, some warn that those who bought after the surge in November 2024 may currently be sitting on losses. Based on reports, the outlook remains speculative and tied tightly to trader sentiment rather than any single fundamental shift. Markets move, people react, and the debate over whether this drop is a buying moment or the start of a deeper slide is still up in the air.

The figures referenced include $95 billion in payment volume through Ripple Payments and a market capitalization of about $1 billion for RLUSD . The summary further noted that Ripple has completed six acquisitions within slightly more than two years and has repurchased 25% of its outstanding shares. The commentary also stated that Ripple Prime , the company’s institutional-focused financial services division, has recorded three times the growth in its activity. Additionally, Ripple is said to hold 75 regulatory licenses across multiple jurisdictions, signaling continued emphasis on compliance and regulated market participation. These data points were presented to demonstrate commercial expansion, regulatory positioning, and institutional integration. Role of XRP and RLUSD in the Stated Framework Pumpius described a functional framework in which Ripple provides the payments and settlement infrastructure, XRP serves as a bridging mechanism to enable cross-border value movement, and RLUSD acts as the system’s stabilizing component. The commentary characterized these elements as coordinated within a developing financial network that connects traditional financial channels with digital settlement rails.

The involvement of well-established financial firms was presented as evidence of broader institutional willingness to participate in this shift. The commentary also suggested that the integrations, acquisitions, and compliance measures are being executed to support this transition and align with traditional financial system standards.

Institutional ETF outflows have increased recently, but not at panic levels; overall, institutional and company holdings remain relatively stable. Network fundamentals remain healthy, with Ethereum capturing the majority of new stablecoin flows and maintaining robust transactional activity, despite a recent decline in new users. I see ETH as a long-term accumulation opportunity at a 30% discount from ATH, though short-term downside risk remains amid macro and network headwinds. Price Action & Momentum Ethereum (ETH-USD) went on a bull run from its low on April 9, 2025 ($1,390), to an all-time high on August 24, 2025 ($4,950). Two and a half months later (today), the price of Ethereum has fallen back from that high, down 32%, to reach an intermediate zone marked at $3,400. In this article, I will review what institutional players are doing (ETF flows and balance sheet reserves) and how the Ethereum chain is responding and has responded (stablecoin uptake per chain, activity, and new vs. recurring users). Using these metrics, I will assess whether the long-term bullish thesis remains intact while also discussing the short-term risks. Trading View Institutional Activity Soso Value ETH Strategic Reserve The first thing we're going to do here is look at what institutional investors are doing with Ethereum ETFs, as well as companies that have allocated part of their treasury to ETH to earn staking yield. In the two images above, we can see the overall net inflows and outflows in the different ETH ETFs and by companies holding Ether on balance sheets and by the ETFs. At first glance, it seems that both exchange-traded funds and companies have not materially reduced their holdings. We can see in the second image a slight slowdown in the accumulation of Ethereum (the blue lines (ETFs) and green lines (companies)) show a slight decrease in their slope at a visual level, going from 12,959,000 ETH in August to a current level of 12,745,000 ETH (a decrease of more than 200,000 ETH). We can confirm this by looking at the first chart (ETF flows), This represents the capital inflows and outflows from the pool of existing ETFs for Ethereum. Currently, and since ATH, we have seen episodes of net capital outflows, generally lasting no more than three days. These episodes of outflows (August, September, and October of this year) have averaged $250 million in daily sales. This pattern broke on October 28, when we started to see a new episode of net capital outflows, but this time more sustained, as it continues to this day (6 days). We will see if it is a simple adjustment of positions, since the outgoing amounts are not typical of mass liquidations, or on the contrary, if ETFs are positioning themselves ahead of another leg lower. Network Perspectives Next we will go on to assess metrics that describe the state of the Ethereum network. Whether there are obvious features of capital turnover or shortage of fresh liquidity. Artemis In this graph we can see the volume of stablecoins flowing between the different blockchains of the entire cryptographic ecosystem. As is clear, there is an upward trend in the last year for the whole sector. This is because stablecoins (issued against cash or short-term US Treasury securities) are on the rise. This issuance indirectly finances the U.S. Treasury, as stablecoin issuers buy short-term Treasuries to back new tokens. Once we understand this, we return to the image above to see which network the new stablecoins are going to. As shown in the image, it is the Ethereum network that dominates the market in this regard, with a clear trend of increasing dominance over the last year (the blue bars represent a higher percentage in recent times: currently, its dominance share stands at 56%). This means that of the new percentage of stablecoins issued, the Ethereum network currently captures 56% of the new amount, which provides long-term stability, constant activity, and a network effect. All of this tells us that in the stablecoins aspect, the Ethereum network is in good health right now. Artemis The next step is to see the transactions made by users within the Ethereum network to confirm whether the comments in the stablecoins section are confirmed with this data. In this case, we show the historical evolution of the number of transactions broken down by activity in the network. As we can observe, the local minima of the series coincide with episodes of local minima of price (April 2025), and the local maxima with local maxima of price (August 2025). This is because the activity index is closely related to the price of this type of asset (the 90-day correlation coefficient is 0.68, which explains this relationship), since the greater the activity on the network, the greater the turnover of assets there will be, the greater the gas consumed in this case, which can make ETH net supply disinflationary/deflationary under its issuance-and-burn mechanism (EIP-1559), for how it is built. Broadly speaking, we see that transactional activity has declined over the last two months (the weekly average of transactions in the first two weeks of August was 740,000 transactions per week, which, compared to the current average of 560,000 transactions per week, gives us a 25% decline in transactional activity), with a sustained decline in transactions in the “Uniswap” category (red bars: 30,000 transactions on average during August compared to 8,000 currently, a decline of more than 60%). This has been able to influence the price of the asset in a negative way, since the decentralized exchange platform Uniswap is one of the main entry channels to the asset analyzed. On the transactional front, the network is also in good health. Artemis Third, and to conclude the current perspectives of the network, we analyze the evolution of new users who transact within the network compared to recurrent active users, all at a daily frequency. In the last year, recurrent transactionality dominates, leaving new users in second place as punctual actors. In this case, it is useful to study the directionality of the trend and the points where new users increase, since they coincide with moments of high prices (August). Currently, new users have been gradually falling since August, suggesting little new demand, which, added to the partial sales of ETFs in recent weeks and the decrease in burning due to lower transactionality, has put downward pressure on the asset price. The decline has occurred from a total average user level of 4.2 million wallets in the first two weeks of August to a current average level of 3 million wallets transacting with each other within the network. User growth has also slowed, from 1.1 million new users in August to 800,000 new users today, representing a decline of more than 20% in the current growth of new users (wallets) transacting with the network. My Personal View ETH has fallen 32% from its ATH, which can be explained by lower network usage (less gas means less burning and higher asset issuance) and several days of ETF outflows, which do not necessarily represent forced sales or massive liquidation levels. Ethereum continues to attract liquidity in stablecoins, and recurring users are sustaining on-chain activity. In addition, the 90-day price-activity correlation (0.68) suggests that if usage rebounds, the price should follow suit. That is why I maintain a long-term Buy rating, entering slowly and only accelerating if we see inflows into ETFs for several days in a row, burning above issuance, and a rebound in new users trading; if ETF outflows persist or adoption falls, it is better to wait. Looking at the broader macroeconomic factors that influence all risk assets, especially those with higher market beta (Ethereum), I believe we are still in a bullish cycle, as employment continues to grow (42,000 jobs have been created in the US according to ADP), inflation is stable for the moment (3.0% according to the latest official data), and it appears that the Fed's balance sheet policies will soon be relaxed due to the end of QT and the current pressure of the SOFR rate against the IORB (SOFR > IORB at the time of writing). That is why I think this downward movement may be temporary rather than structural. Thank you for reading. EXTRA Readers have two options for acquiring the asset. The first is to go to a centralized exchange, register, and buy the amount of Ethereum they want. The problem with this is that it directly or indirectly incurs the risk of self-custody. If the exchange suffers a hacker attack or the user loses their keys (if it is self-custody in a cold wallet), it will be difficult to recover those assets owned by the user. The second option is to use vehicles such as ETHE or ETHA, which are index funds that replicate the performance of the asset without the user needing to physically own it, freeing them from the risk of self-custody, as the exchange-traded funds themselves subcontract physical custodians to do so.",ETHA|ETHE|ETH-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-08 04:12:00

With Ethereum rallying on renewed whale demand and Polkadot holding key support levels amid ecosystem growth, the established layer-1 plays are proving their staying power. At the same time, MoonBull is stepping up as a presale project that combines innovative mechanics with early-stage entry. Each of these cryptos offers a distinct value proposition: Ethereum for infrastructure dominance, Polkadot for interoperability and multi-chain ambition, and MoonBull for high-reward presale dynamics. As crypto markets gear up for the next leg, investors are looking beyond simple speculation. Ethereum’s latest on-chain signals show institutional accumulation and bullish sentiment, while Polkadot’s development activity remains robust despite price consolidation. Against this backdrop, MoonBull’s tokenomics, liquidity mechanics, and presale stage create an interesting counter-balance, offering access to upside potential before broader market recognition catches up. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Bull’s Engine – Liquidity, Scarcity & Rewards MoonBull’s tokenomics are built around what it calls its “Bull’s Engine.” Every time $MOBU is sold, 2% of the transaction goes into liquidity (helping reduce slippage and stabilize market moves), 2% is distributed among all holders as passive income (reflections), and 1% is permanently burned (enhancing supply scarcity). These mechanisms operate in tandem to strengthen the ecosystem: deepening liquidity, rewarding holders, and reducing token supply, so that each remaining token carries more inherent value over time. After launch, these dynamics will continue reinforcing each other. Liquidity injections support smoother trading, reflections give passive yields to holders, and the steady burn reduces supply. Together, they align MoonBull’s economy with long-term growth rather than short-term hype. Why Is MoonBull the Top crypto to buy? MoonBull’s presale is currently in Stage 6, with the token priced at $0.00008388. To date, it has raised over $550K, and has counted more than 1,800 holders. The projected ROI from the current stage to a listed price of $0.00616 is about 7,244%, while earlier participants (1- 5 stage) are already showing an ROI of approximately 235.52%. The next stage is expected to introduce a price increase of roughly 27.40%, making this a meaningful entry window before public trading opens. What sets this presale apart is not just timing, but the structure behind it. By giving transparent mechanics, a defined reward system, and liquidity-friendly tokenomics, MoonBull offers an early-stage entry that appeals not only to speculators but also to investors seeking measurable upside, making it a top crypto to buy . Ethereum (ETH): Whale Demand and Renewed Bullish Momentum Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength. According to a recent analysis, traders have pivoted to “extreme bullish” after whale investors began accumulating Ethereum again, especially during recent deleveraging episodes. On-chain data suggests large withdrawals, such as a roughly $70 million ETH withdrawal by a major entity, indicate institutional interest entering the market. With this backdrop, Ethereum remains one of the most credible crypto investments. Its infrastructure, developer ecosystem, staking mechanics, and institutional positioning offer both stability and upside potential—although the explosive gains of early presales may be less likely. Polkadot (DOT): Ecosystem Growth Amid Key Support Test Polkadot is trading around $2.60 and is currently hovering near a key support zone: roughly $2.50–$2.60 according to technical analysis. While price momentum is modest, the underlying network activity remains strong. Polkadot continues to attract developers, and cross-chain transfers remain active, reinforcing its long-term thesis. For investors eyeing the opportunity to invest in crypto, Polkadot offers a balance of infrastructure exposure and speculative upside. Price may be consolidating now—but the fundamentals of multi-chain interoperability and ecosystem expansion are very much intact. Conclusion Ethereum, Polkadot, and MoonBull represent three very different pathways to crypto growth in 2025. Ethereum provides institutional-grade infrastructure and ecosystem dominance; Polkadot offers multi-chain potential and developer depth; MoonBull brings early-stage upside with a structured presale and innovative tokenomics. If the goal is to identify the top crypto to buy in 2025, a diversified approach could make sense. Ethereum is the foundation, Polkadot is the growth engine, and MoonBull is the wildcard, but one with quantifiable mechanics. For those willing to ride the next 100x wave, MoonBull could be your bullish move.

The report argues that Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” is solidifying, particularly as liquidity tightens across traditional markets. As Bitcoin trades around $100,980, investors are eyeing the best crypto to buy now, those positioned to outperform as capital begins to rotate back into altcoins. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Institutional Flows Are Back After months of sideways movement, Bitcoin is back in focus. The world’s largest cryptocurrency recently faced severe declines and is currently trading at $100,980, as ETF volumes spiked 28% week-on-week. Citing growing use in corporate treasuries and digital asset funds, JP Morgan analysts predict that increased institutional involvement could push Bitcoin toward $150,000-$170,000 by mid-2026. According to the survey, investors looking for greater profits are diversifying into Layer 1 ecosystems, DeFi tokens, and cross-chain ventures with genuine utility, even though Bitcoin’s foundations are still solid. This renewed market optimism has triggered fresh inflows into tokens like Hyperliquid and Remittix (RTX) , two fast-growing projects now appearing on analysts’ watchlists. Hyperliquid: Fast, Scalable, and Built for Traders Hyperliquid (HYPE) has emerged as one of the more promising trading-focused networks of 2025. Built for speed and decentralisation, it provides high-performance infrastructure for derivatives, spot trading, and liquidity management. The token is trading around $40.68, and analysts expect it to test $65–$70 in Q1 2026 if volume growth continues. According to on-chain data, Hyperliquid’s TVL has surpassed $1.2 billion and its transaction count has doubled over the past two months. As a result, it is among the leading altcoins in the expanding decentralized exchange market, competing with well-known firms like dYdX and Injective. In a market dominated by speculative, meme-based tokens, HYPE stands out as a high-growth cryptocurrency with robust liquidity and actual trade usage. Remittix: The PayFi Token Turning Heads While Hyperliquid focuses on trading efficiency, Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention for real-world payments. Built as a cross-chain DeFi project, Remittix enables users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries with low gas fees and instant fiat conversion. The Remittix wallet beta is live, supporting over 100 cryptocurrencies. The project has already raised over $28 million, attracted 40,000+ holders, and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank. Analysts refer to it as a “next-gen PayFi token,” offering both DeFi functionality and everyday usability, a rare combination in today’s market. With its strong fundamentals and working ecosystem, Remittix (RTX) is being positioned as one of the best crypto investments for 2025, particularly as demand for real-world payment solutions continues to grow. Bitcoin Leads, But Altcoins Could Outperform JP Morgan’s bullish Bitcoin price target has given the market renewed confidence, but the most significant upside could lie in altcoins with real traction. Hyperliquid and Remittix represent two sides of that opportunity, trading infrastructure and payments innovation, both critical areas for the next phase of blockchain adoption. As capital rotation begins, investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should keep an eye on these projects that blend proven growth with practical use, where 2025’s biggest winners are likely to emerge.

This money has been stuck in Europe since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and has also since then been lined up as a blunt financial weapon, but not technically being seized. The European Commission’s plan is to let EU states use up to 185 billion euros, without stepping into full confiscation mode. That’s most of the 210 billion euros held across Europe. The U.S. source, who asked not to be named, said plainly, “Washington absolutely supports the EU and the steps they’re taking right now to be in a position to make use of those assets as a tool.” That support comes even as legal and political risks keep slowing the EU’s next steps. The assets are mostly parked in Belgium, and Belgian officials have been holding up the proposal. Germany links Belgian drone sightings to Moscow threat On the same day that Trump announced his support for the EU’s plans, Germany pointed a sharp finger at Russia over a string of drone sightings that were reportedly spotted over airports and military sites in Belgium, could be a warning shot from the Kremlin. The message? Don’t mess with those frozen assets. Moscow, of course, denied it had anything to do with the drones but still promised a “painful response” if the assets are touched. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, the West has locked down roughly $300 billion in sovereign Russian wealth, mostly held by central banks and state institutions. The latest EU proposal would be one of the biggest moves yet to actually use that frozen pile. But this is no smash-and-grab. The funds would be tapped carefully, avoiding full seizure that could trigger lawsuits or retaliation. Just last month, Cryptopolitan reported that the Trump administration slapped penalties on Rosneft and Lukoil, the two largest oil giants in Russia. That added to a huge pile of sanctions already aimed at choking Moscow’s economy. The White House is still watching to see how this plays out. But the U.S. official added, “There are more things we could do to try to up the pressure.” Trump hints at Hungary energy sanctions relief during Orban visit Meanwhile, as Trump met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House on Friday, the two leaders talked energy, trade, and, of course, the Russia–Ukraine war. During that meeting, Orban asked for a pass on U.S. sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas. Trump’s answer? He’s open to it. “We’re looking at it, because it’s very difficult for him to get the oil and gas from other areas. They don’t have the advantage of having a sea,” Trump told reporters. This was Orban’s first White House visit since Trump returned to office. He’s under pressure back home, and across Europe, for his cozy relationship with Putin. But Trump didn’t hold back on backing him, blasting Europe’s “hypocrisy” for still buying Russian energy while talking tough. He even gave Orban another endorsement for his re-election, saying the Hungarian leader had done a “fantastic job”. Orban, never one to hide his feelings, took shots at Joe Biden, praised Trump, and called this a new “golden era” in US–Hungary ties. “During the Democrat administration, everything was ruined,” he said. “After your leaving president, everything was basically broke, ruined, canceled.” He also hinted that Hungary may boost its purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas and nuclear fuel, which could help sweeten any exemption deal on Russia-related sanctions. Orban already visited Mar-a-Lago twice last year, showing just how tight he’s become with Trump’s circle. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Its decline came alongside the rest of the crypto market, with BTC dipping below $100,000 and ETH erasing all YTD gains. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT and Perplexity about their take on what’s to follow in the week ahead for PI, whether this volatility will continue, and whether it can hold the $0.20 support line. ChatGPT’s Predictions OpenAI’s chatbot solution outlined a few different scenarios for the week ahead. In the first, which it called “range first, then a squeeze,” it envisioned a mildly stable price movement around the current $0.21 level, with an upper boundary of $0.25. “Thesis: After a full retrace, PI typically chops in a value range before attempting a rebound. If buyers defend $0.20–$0.21, a reflex pop toward $0.24–$0.26 is likely.” Its second case is based on big news and updates coming from the Pi Network Core Team, such as the recent launch of Pi Node’s version 0.5.4. If there are such developments that could propel investors back to the PI scene, then the asset can bounce to $0.30 and beyond. However, if the team remains quiet and the overall market conditions do not improve, then the PI token might drop below $0.20 and test the ATLs of around $0.17. “Most probable weekly path: Stabilization above $0.20 and range trade $0.22–$0.26, with a 30–35% chance of a breakout attempt toward $0.30–$0.32 if sentiment improves. Highest realistic print this week (absent big news): ~$0.32. Downside risk guardrail: A firm break below $0.20 opens $0.18 (stop-hunt) before mean-reversion,” ChatGPT concluded. Perplexity’s Views ChatGPT’s rival provided a lot more volatile price predictions for the week(s) ahead. Its bear case envisions PI remaining sideways on November 8 but dropping hard in the following days to new all-time low levels. “-9.99% on Nov 9, -17.36% on Nov 10, falling to about 23% lower by Nov 12, 2025.” It concluded its bearish scenario with a prediction of a sustained price drop to under $0.15 by early December. However, it also outlined some highly bullish forecasts in case the Core Team indeed drops some big announcements and partnerships, and the overall market conditions improve dramatically over the next few weeks. In them, Perplexity set a massive target of $0.60 as early as this month, which would represent a 200% surge from current levels. Nevertheless, it admitted that both of these cases are quite extreme and are less likely to take place. Perplexity’s most probable scenario sees PI entering a longer consolidation period at around $0.20, influenced by “market volatility and subdued sentiment.” The post What’s Next for PI This Week? 2 AIs With Shocking Pi Network Price Calls appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-08 04:38:12

MSTY's dividends have been sharply reduced recently, reflecting falling net asset value. Despite MSTY's high current yield, further dividend cuts are likely if NAV continues to drop. Given these risks, MSTY is not a compelling investment at this time. Article Thesis Cryptocurrencies have recently hit a rough patch, which has impacted crypto-centric stocks such as Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ), too. While touted as a safer way to get MSTR exposure, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) has been hit very hard as well. Even worse, dividends have been cut drastically from where they were just a couple of months ago -- with net asset value falling, dividends could decline further going forward, which is why I think that MSTY is not a very compelling investment, despite an arguably very high current yield. Past Coverage I have written about the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF here on Seeking Alpha once, in July . Back then, I argued that MSTY was an avoid due to considerable downside risk and that its dividend yield, while very high, was not a reason to buy, including due to the fact that there was significant dividend cut risk. With more than three months having passed since then, it is time to take another look at MSTY -- has the thesis played out so far, and what's relevant for MSTY going forward? If you're interested in an overview of MSTY, I welcome you to check out the article from last summer I linked above. MSTY's Recent Performance MSTY offers a very high dividend yield and uses MSTR as the underlying for its covered call option strategy. But that does not mean that MSTY has a way better return outlook -- the high dividend yield comes at a cost. MSTY can only achieve this high dividend yield by selling covered calls aggressively, which sacrifices the upside potential in the underlying stock. This means that during bull runs, MSTY has a high chance of underperforming MSTR, as we have seen in the past. In the last couple of months, when MSTR did pull back, MSTY pulled back as well -- in fact, its price dropped even more than that of MSTR, as MSTY's covered call option strategy prevented it from benefiting from temporary upward moves in MSTR, as the following chart shows: Data by YCharts Over the last three months, Strategy saw its shares drop by around 40%, while MSTY dropped by around 50%. On a total return basis, the performance was better for both, but still extremely bad -- both picks would have generated a loss of more than 30%, with dividends already being accounted for. In retrospect, a ""Sell"" rating would have worked even better when I covered MSTY in the summer, but I'm still happy with my conclusion from July that MSTY was a risky pick that investors should avoid. With MSTR and MSTY performing more or less the same on a total return basis, as the dividend payments from MSTY were mostly offset by MSTY's more pronounced share price crash, I also continue to believe that MSTY should not be seen as a lower-risk way of investing in MSTR: Downside risk is relatively comparable, despite MSTY's dividend payments that were not able to prevent massive losses on a total return basis. MSTY's Bitcoin Exposure While the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is branded as an income investment and is seen as that by many investors, it still remains a bet on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), or, more precisely, on a fast-growing Bitcoin price. After all, MSTY's underlying -- Strategy Inc -- is a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. While that has worked out well for MSTR investors during past Bitcoin bull runs, it introduces major risks for MSTR and MSTY investors. MSTR issues debt and shares to buy Bitcoin, and MSTR also trades at a considerable premium compared to the per-share value of its Bitcoin holdings. While that can still make MSTR attractive for someone who believes that the price of Bitcoin will rise tremendously in the future -- such as ARK Invest with its $1.2 million price target -- it also means that MSTR is a quite risky play if Bitcoin doesn't rise as much as expected. More recently, the price of Bitcoin has actually fallen, which naturally is even worse for MSTR, and, of course, for MSTY: Data by YCharts Bitcoin has dropped almost 20% in the last couple of weeks, relative to the previous high, meaning Bitcoin is almost in a bear market today. Due to MSTR being a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, MSTR has dropped way more than Bitcoin -- MSTR trades at less than half its 52-week high today. The price of Bitcoin has always been volatile, and I don't know where it will trade in the future -- but I see that momentum currently is weak and that enthusiasm seemingly has faded in recent weeks. This could result in further downside potential for Bitcoin's price, which would likely result in an even larger hit to MSTR's share price due to Strategy Inc.'s use of leverage. If MSTR falls, MSTY will fall as well, as we have seen earlier. Considering how badly both MSTR and MSTY have performed in recent months, despite Bitcoin still being down less than 20% from its recent high, I don't want to know how far MSTR and MSTY would fall in case we see an even bigger drawdown in the price of Bitcoin -- in the past, Bitcoin has fallen by 50%, 60%, 70%, or even more from time to time. I'm not a Bitcoin bear, and it is possible that Bitcoin will stabilize here or start climbing again -- but it is also possible that Bitcoin falls a lot further, and that could be devastating for both MSTR and MSTY due to MSTR's usage of leverage. Declining Dividends: You Were Warned Some bulls have, in the past, argued that MSTY wasn't very risky -- due to its very high yield, investors would get back their principal in a short period of time, and then any fall in its share price wouldn't be much of a problem. I think the key counterargument to that is that this only works if MSTY keeps its dividend stable, which it has not done in the past. In summer, when I argued MSTY should be avoided, its monthly dividend stood at $1.18, or around $14.20 per year. Since then, MSTY has moved to weekly dividends instead of monthly dividends -- nice for those wanting very regular cash flow, but it doesn't mean higher overall dividends. The most recently announced weekly payout was $0.169, or around $8.80 per year. That is around 40% less than in summer, when I last covered MSTY -- dividends have fallen off a cliff in a rather short period of time. If MSTY were to continue on this trajectory of reducing its payout by roughly 10% per month, the dividend could be way lower than it is today in the not-too-distant future. This isn't set in stone -- if Bitcoin were to rally, MSTR would climb, MSTY's net asset value would stabilize, and MSTY could be able to maintain the current payout. But history shows that this is not very likely -- ever since MSTY began trading, its NAV has been trending down, and so has its dividend. The payout once was north of $4 per month, or more than $1 per week -- relative to that, the payout has dropped by more than 80%. MSTY: I Think It Remains An Avoid During past bull runs, MSTY has underperformed MSTR, and its dividend didn't really help during the recent bear market -- both MSTR and MSTY performed very badly on a total return basis. This is with Bitcoin still just 20% below its recent high -- if Bitcoin were to fall further, MSTR and MSTY would continue to drop. MSTY is a serial dividend cutter, and I thus believe that it is unlikely that the current dividend will be maintained in the long run. The current dividend yield of roughly 100% looks enticing, but it has been a yield trap in the past, and I think there is a significant risk of that holding true for the future, too. I continue to think that investors are better off staying away from MSTY -- if they want Bitcoin exposure, a direct investment in Bitcoin seems like a better idea.",MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-08 04:40:28

According to reporting from Bloomberg , Steve said that a situation like that would likey require the Federal Reserve to adjust its own policy stance to avoid slowing the economy by mistake. Steve said the surge of stablecoins is drawing heavy demand toward U.S. Treasury bills and other highly liquid dollar instruments, especially from buyers outside the United States, which then adds to the supply of loanable money in the economy. When the supply of lendable funds increases, the neutral rate (the level of interest that supports steady growth without overheating or dragging activity) can drift downward. Steve said that if the neutral rate is plunging, then the Federal Reserve must respond by lowering its policy rate, otherwise it risks tightening conditions unintentionally. He described the situation plainly, saying “Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers.” He added that the buildup of stablecoins is already influencing markets and will keep doing so as adoption grows. Stablecoin growth pressures interest benchmarks Steve referred to existing research to say that expanding stablecoin usage could lower the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate by around 0.4 percentage point. That figure aligns with the pattern of his policy views during his tenure. Since joining the Fed, Steve has repeatedly argued for deeper and faster rate cuts, saying the commonly assumed neutral rate is too high. He has said that holding rates above the true neutral level risks slowing down the economy more than intended. Until now, Steve had based most of his arguments on inflation trends and conditions in the broader economy. But the rise of stablecoins introduces a new long-term factor. By increasing the supply of money available for lending, he said, it naturally exerts downward pressure on the neutral rate for years ahead. “Even relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down the neutral rate,” Steve said. He continued, “If neutral is lower, policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy.” Steve warned that refusing to respond to this shift would be “contractionary.” He is set to leave the Federal Reserve in January, when the term he is currently filling is scheduled to end. Crypto market erases yearly gains as volatility hits Bitcoin Steve’s policy remarks come as the total market value of all cryptocurrencies (which reached nearly $4.4 trillion on October 6) saw a 20% decline that has wiped out nearly all the gains recorded earlier this year. The crash began after the sudden liquidation of roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions, which shook confidence among traders and left the market struggling for direction. Few market participants are currently betting on a strong rebound, per data from CryptoQuant. This downturn stands out because this year had been marked by stronger recognition of crypto from regulators, major banks and institutional investors. President Donald Trump’s push to position the United States as the central hub of global crypto activity earlier contributed to rising enthusiasm. Bitcoin at one point surged by 35% this year. But now the total crypto market value sits below where it was when Trump entered office. Bitcoin has fallen 9% so far this week alone, putting it on track for its worst weekly result since March. It also fell below its 200-day moving average, a level widely monitored by traders since the 2022 bear market. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading just under $100,000. Losses have been even heavier among altcoins, which are smaller and more volatile. They have underperformed across the board this year.

Central Bank Governor Timur Suleimenov announced the initiative during an interview with Bloomberg in London, stating that the fund would focus on investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and shares of companies involved in the sector, rather than holding digital assets directly. State-Run Crypto Asset Fund During the interview , Suleimenov expressed confidence that the fund would be operational by the end of the year or early January. He emphasized that the investment strategy would be cautious, steering clear of direct crypto exposure. Kazakhstan’s Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, Berik Sholpankulov, further clarified the government’s strategy, revealing that they are considering using some of the National Fund’s assets, as well as gold and foreign exchange reserves, for investments linked to crypto assets. Sholpankulov noted that any such investment activities would be managed exclusively through a state-run digital asset fund, which is currently under discussion. The National Bank’s Deputy Chairman detailed that confiscated cryptocurrency assets would be allocated to this state digital asset fund , where they will serve as a strategic reserve for the government. Additionally, he mentioned a proposal from the Ministry of Digital Development to allow state-owned mining companies to provide energy to private mining operations in exchange for payment in virtual currencies. According to the National Bank, the assets of the National Fund increased by $990 million in September compared to August, reaching a total of $62.7 billion. Concurrently, gold and foreign exchange reserves also saw a rise, with gold reserves growing to $39.7 billion, despite a decline in foreign exchange assets. Kazakhstan Eyes Regulated Digital Asset Landscape This initiative comes on the heels of the National Bank’s approval of a concept to create a national reserve of crypto assets, which will be managed through a new subsidiary focused on alternative investments. The government is also exploring the establishment of licensed crypto banks and a national cryptocurrency exchange to foster a regulated environment for digital asset trading in Kazakhstan. Over the past few months, authorities have cracked down on illicit cryptocurrency exchanges, shutting down 130 operations suspected of laundering criminal proceeds. This crackdown has led to the seizure of crypto assets worth approximately $16.7 million. However, Sholpankulov noted that around $15 billion in cryptocurrency has reportedly exited the country due to regulatory gaps surrounding digital assets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $100,820, marking a notable 9% decline over the past week. This puts the leading cryptocurrency 20% below its all-time high of $126,000, which was reached in early October of this year.

Reversal Setup Forms Beneath Heavy Resistance,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polkadot-dot/polkadot-2-85-breakout-ahead/,"Polkadot’s price action is beginning to hint at a possible shift in momentum, with a reversal setup forming just below the critical $2.85 level. The bulls are gradually building pressure, eyeing a breakout that could confirm a change in trend. Still, the presence of strong resistance overhead means the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether DOT can break free or face another rejection. DOT’s Downtrend Shows Signs Of Exhaustion As Buyers Eye A Short-Term Recovery Giving a follow-up on the expected path of DOT in the 4-hour timeframe, Elliott Waves Academy revealed that the series of declines through the sub-waves of the recent impulsive move may be nearing its end. This suggests that the current downward trend is exhausting itself, at least in the short term, with a potential recovery ahead. Related Reading: Polkadot Recovery Stalls As Bearish Pressure Returns With $3.5 In Sight Elliott Waves Academy observes that a diagonal pattern appears to be forming, which is outlining the intricate details of wave (1)/(A). This diagonal formation is key to the analysis, as it typically signals the termination of a prior trend and precedes a reversal. The analyst points to a confirmed break above the upper boundary of this diagonal pattern. Such a break would officially open the path for an upward recovery toward the zone between $3.3423 and $3.36538. On the other hand, the $2.2848 level is deemed crucial for maintaining the immediate recovery outlook. Elliott Waves Academy warned that if this critical $2.2848 level is broken, further significant downside is expected through an extension of the existing bearish waves. Polkadot Remains Trapped Beneath Major HTF Resistance Levels Crypto_Jobs shared on X that the long-term chart for Polkadot remains largely stagnant and constrained beneath major high-timeframe (HTF) resistance zones at $3.200 and $3.780. The analyst cautioned traders to remain conservative with any swing (long) setups while the price trades below these critical resistance barriers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap—Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Examining the current price action, Crypto_Jobs described market conditions as neutral, with Polkadot fluctuating within a tight range between $2.500 and $2.700. The sideways movement reflects a lack of clear direction, as both bulls and bears struggle for dominance. Despite this period of indecision, the chart showcases an emerging pattern that could soon dictate the next significant move. The crypto analyst noted the possible formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a neckline around the $2.700–$2.850 to $3.00 zone. A confirmed breakout above this neckline could signal renewed bullish momentum, potentially leading to a 5–10% price surge.

Reeves is expected to target pension contribution tax perks in the Budget, limiting reliefs for both employers and employees to help boost Treasury revenues by £2 billion ($2.6 billion) per year. However, there are concerns that the policy will unfairly penalise those who responsibly save for retirement and could also harm company pension plans. Reeves will not limit tax-free pension lump sum withdrawals Reeves had told the Office for Budget Responsibility she intends to hike income tax when she delivers the Budget on 26 November. According to reports, Reeves is contemplating a 2p income tax alongside a 2p national insurance cut, breaking from Labour’s manifesto commitment. Insiders say Reeves has opted against reducing tax-free pension lump sum withdrawals amid concerns that it would hurt pensioners. Retirees will still be able to take up to 25% of their pension—capped at £268,275—tax-free. However, she is turning her attention to salary sacrifice schemes in an effort to address the £30 billion funding gap . This week, the deputy Labour leader, Lucy Powell, warned that if the Chancellor breaks the party’s income tax pledge, it could undermine voters’ confidence. However, some economists argue that the combination of policy reversals, increased debt, and slow economic growth leaves Reeves little choice but to raise taxes or abandon her flagship borrowing targets. So far, officials see trimming pension tax reliefs as one of the easiest ways to boost revenue. Salary sacrifice currently allows workers to funnel any amount into their pensions before national insurance is charged, with contributions taken from pay before tax is deducted. Reeves is expected to limit this to £2,000 a year in the upcoming Budget. Any pension contributions exceeding £2,000 ($2681) would incur national insurance at 8% on salaries below £50,000 (approximately $ 65,795) and 2% on income above that threshold. Workers who use salary sacrifice to invest more than £2,000 in their pensions will feel the impact, even though 15% of their salary is suggested for retirement savings. For a basic-rate earner on £50,270, saving 6% of pay would increase national insurance by £80 annually, while saving £5,000 (10%) would add £240 ($315). Experts caution that many workers would face a double blow, since employers would also forfeit tax relief on pension contributions. Currently, employers receive full relief from the 15% national insurance on salary-sacrifice pension contributions. Reeves plans to limit this, which would increase the cost for a £50,270 employee saving 10% of pay by £450 ($592) a year. Companies may reduce their pension benefits to employees Steve Webb, a partner at pension consultants LCP, is opposed to tightening tax relief. He commented: “Salary sacrifice schemes have been around for a long time and are a way of encouraging employers to offer good workplace pensions. Introducing a cap would increase national insurance bills, mostly for employers and hit the very firms who are doing the right thing.” He cautioned that a cap could create fears that pension benefits are on the chopping block, potentially paving the way for eventual removal of pension perks, at a time when greater pension engagement is necessary. The Society of Pension Professionals’ tax group chair, Steve Hitchiner, said that the changes would likely push firms to make their pension schemes less generous to offset higher taxes. He explained that the reform would make salary sacrifice pensions more expensive for employers, due to the 15% national insurance payable on employee contributions. Similar to Webb, he also noted that employers may pass the additional expense to staff in the form of lower pension contributions or smaller raises. Some businesses have also given their opinions on the matter. One company said it would be left explaining to staff why their payslips will vary despite their previous stable earnings, while another accused the government of attempting to raise money “through the back door.” Some firms even suggested that, if the impact is significant, they may end their salary sacrifice programs.

Melker referenced comments by Tillman of Arch Public, who discussed why his view on XRP’s role in cross-border payments shifted after the emergence of stablecoins. The remarks were followed by contrasting responses from members of the digital asset community, who argued that XRP’s function remains distinct and broader in scope. Tillman at @tryarchpublic says he was a big $XRP believer until stablecoins changed everything. @TEXASOL61 pic.twitter.com/u6NT4kuzvQ — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 5, 2025 Tillman’s Position on Stablecoins and Settlement In the clip highlighted by Melker, Tillman explained that he once supported XRP due to its intended use in cross-border payments. However, he stated that the introduction of stablecoins changed his assessment of the space. He argued that, in his view, the value of a settlement asset depends on its ability to maintain parity with the asset being settled against. According to him, anything without par value was less efficient as a settlement layer compared to assets designed to remain pegged, such as stablecoins. He pointed to stablecoins as better aligned for settlement due to this parity, suggesting that their structure reduced the need for assets like XRP in payment flow scenarios. Community Responses Emphasize Cost and Structural Role Some users challenge the premise that stablecoins inherently serve as a superior settlement mechanism. Commenter Joshua D. Larkin noted that stablecoins do not operate on a single native ledger, meaning they are issued across multiple chains with varying transaction costs. He pointed out that some networks hosting stablecoins have higher fees than the XRP Ledger, raising questions about efficiency when measured through speed and cost. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter, RLFRS, emphasized that stablecoins are typically payment instruments issued by private companies or institutions. He argued that XRP’s role is broader than stablecoin payment, suggesting that XRP acts as liquidity to bridge multiple types of assets, including tokenized commodities and financial instruments, not just fiat currency pairs. He highlighted pathfinding on the XRP Ledger, describing how it is designed to locate optimal liquidity routes to facilitate conversion between diverse tokenized assets . In this perspective, stablecoins may function as transactional tools, but XRP is positioned as the mechanism that enables different asset classes to connect efficiently. Melker’s post underscored a clear division in how digital asset participants interpret the utility and future of XRP, compared to stablecoins. While Tillman framed stablecoins as a replacement for XRP in cross-border settlement, others maintained that XRP’s utility extends into liquidity and asset-bridging functions not addressed by stablecoins alone. The discussion reflects ongoing reassessment of digital asset roles as tokenization and settlement infrastructure continue to develop.

Experts Back 3 Altcoins Exploding Against The Downtrend,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-the-ripple-xrp-price-down-today-experts-back-3-altcoins-exploding-against-the-downtrend/,"Ripple’s XRP has come under renewed selling pressure, mirroring the cautious sentiment across major altcoins. Traders are rotating capitals into tokens with stronger momentum or clear fundamentals, which is why the price has gone down in the short term. Despite the dip, experts believe that while some assets pause, others—like ZEC, ICP, and Remittix—are breaking higher. Remittix (RTX) , a fast-rising PayFi project, has drawn attention for maintaining growth during broader weakness, emphasizing how investor capital is now flowing toward utility-based ecosystems rather than speculative price action. XRP Price Faces Mild Pressure As Rotation Continues The XRP price stands at $2.20, with a market capitalization of $131.11 billion and a trading volume of $5.31 billion, down 7.25% over the last day. This token, which had been strong of late, appears to undergo profit-taking now as cash flow shifts to newer projects that have been performing well of late. XRP still maintains one of the deepest liquidity pools in the altcoin market, which has been helping to cushion larger downside moves. Not all altcoins are moving slowly, however. Zcash is up 18.3% in 24 hours, selling at $683.06 and boosting its market capitalization to $10.53 billion. The trading volume of the token increased 42.24%. Internet Computer is also up 10.61% to $7.791, which gives it a market cap of $3.99 billion. The network is getting busier again, and investors are interested in blockchain platforms that are useful. Its daily volume hit $1.41 billion. Utility-Led Projects Like Remittix Defy Market Pressure While XRP consolidates, Remittix continues to build momentum in the crypto payments space. Priced at $0.1166 per token, the Remittix DeFi project has raised over $28 million through private funding, with more than 684 million tokens distributed. Its mission is to create a seamless crypto-to-fiat bridge that allows users to send crypto directly to traditional bank accounts across 30+ countries—making it one of the few upcoming crypto projects solving real-world problems. Remittix recently expanded its Beta Wallet testing to more iOS holders, inviting the top 10 weekly purchasers to join the next testing phase. This structured rollout allows for real community feedback while preparing the platform for mass adoption. The project’s credibility has also been boosted after becoming fully verified by CertiK, where it is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens for its security and transparency. The Advancements Pushing Remittix Into the Spotlight: Global Reach: Seamless crypto bank transfers across more than 30 countries. CertiK Verified: Ranked #1 for pre-launch credibility and building trust. $28 million Secured: Raised via private funding from early backers. Community Expansion: Ongoing beta wallet testing and referral incentives. Future Listings: BitMart and LBank confirmed as upcoming centralized exchanges. Market Takeaway — Building Through The Downtrend XRP’s decline highlights how investors are rebalancing toward tokens with tangible applications. ZEC and ICP’s rallies show that liquidity remains in motion, just more selective. Yet the bigger signal is the consistent attention on Remittix, where transparent funding, verified security, and expanding utility are shaping it into one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025. As traders look beyond speculation, projects proving real use—like Remittix—are setting the new direction for the next DeFi growth cycle.

According to recent analysis, if BTC rockets to $250,000 within three months, it might signal an impending market collapse rather than sustained growth. This surprising Bitcoin price prediction challenges conventional thinking about cryptocurrency rallies. What Exactly is a Blow-Off Top in Bitcoin Trading? A blow-off top represents one of the most dangerous patterns in any market. It occurs when prices skyrocket rapidly, creating extreme euphoria among investors. However, this excitement often precedes a sharp and painful decline. The current Bitcoin price prediction analysis suggests we might be approaching such conditions. Macroeconomic analyst Mel Mattison describes the current market phase as healthy adjustment. He warns that an overheated rally could disrupt this stability. His cautious approach to Bitcoin price prediction emphasizes sustainable growth over explosive gains. Why Would Rapid Growth Signal Trouble? Healthy markets typically show steady, measured growth. When assets climb too quickly, they often lack fundamental support. Consider these warning signs: Unsustainable momentum – Prices detach from real value FOMO buying – Investors chase gains fearfully Weak hands entering – Inexperienced traders dominate Leverage buildup – Excessive borrowing amplifies risk This Bitcoin price prediction scenario suggests that rapid appreciation might indicate market overheating rather than genuine strength. What’s the Realistic Bitcoin Price Prediction? Mattison offers a more measured outlook for Bitcoin’s trajectory. He suggests BTC could reach $150,000 by approximately February next year. This represents substantial growth while avoiding dangerous speculation levels. His Bitcoin price prediction focuses on cyclical patterns rather than hype-driven surges. The analyst emphasizes that current market conditions reflect healthy adjustment. This phase allows for organic growth without excessive speculation. Therefore, investors should view gradual appreciation as more sustainable than explosive rallies. How Should Investors Approach This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding market cycles proves crucial for cryptocurrency success. While dramatic gains attract attention, they often carry hidden risks. This Bitcoin price prediction serves as a reminder that sustainable growth typically outperforms short-term spikes. Consider these protective strategies: Dollar-cost average – Regular investments smooth volatility Set realistic targets – Avoid chasing unrealistic gains Monitor market sentiment – Extreme optimism often signals tops Maintain perspective – Remember long-term fundamentals The Bottom Line: Sustainable Growth Over Speculative Spikes This thought-provoking Bitcoin price prediction reminds us that not all growth signals positive development. Sometimes, the most exciting rallies precede the most painful corrections. By understanding market dynamics, investors can navigate volatility more effectively. The key insight remains clear: sustainable, measured appreciation typically creates more wealth than explosive, unsustainable spikes. This Bitcoin price prediction encourages disciplined investing over emotional trading. Frequently Asked Questions What is a blow-off top in cryptocurrency markets? A blow-off top occurs when prices surge dramatically within a short period, followed by a rapid collapse. It typically marks the end of a bullish trend and signals impending bearish conditions. Why would reaching $250,000 be bearish for Bitcoin? Such rapid appreciation would likely stem from speculative frenzy rather than organic growth. This creates unsustainable conditions where prices detach from fundamental value, setting the stage for correction. What timeframe does this Bitcoin price prediction cover? The analysis specifically addresses a three-month window for the potential $250,000 scenario. The more realistic prediction of $150,000 targets February of next year. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions generally? While analysts use various methodologies, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile. Predictions should inform strategy rather than dictate it, with diversification being crucial. What indicators suggest market overheating? Key warning signs include extreme leverage, dominance by retail investors, detachment from fundamental metrics, and widespread euphoria in media coverage. How can investors protect against blow-off top scenarios? Maintaining balanced portfolios, avoiding excessive leverage, taking partial profits during rallies, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term hype.

Bitcoin Options Open Interest Has Already Bounced Back From Oct Expiry In a new thread on X, analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the Bitcoin options market. This segment of derivatives trading involves traders betting on future price moves through contracts giving the right (but not the obligation) to sell or buy the cryptocurrency at a set price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Erases Recovery As Coinbase Users Relentlessly Sell Earlier, perpetual futures was the main derivatives trading pathway that investors in the sector used, but recently, demand for options has grown enough to challenge the futures market. One way to gauge interest in options is through the Open Interest, an indicator that measures the total amount of contracts related to the market that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin options Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin options Open Interest reached a new record on October 31st. Shortly after, however, the metric saw a plunge due to the contract expiry. Options contracts come with an “expiry” date, on which the contract get either exercised or automatically closed out. A large amount of these expiries coincided on October 31st, which is why the indicator saw a flush. Interestingly, the options Open Interest has been quick to bounce back since then, with its value already halfway back to the ATH. Thus, it would appear demand for options is still alive and well. From the chart, it’s apparent that a similar pattern was also witnessed after the previous major expiry, when the metric gradually recovered and explored new records. “The options market open interest looks set to keep printing new ATHs, expiry after expiry,” explained the analytics firm.

As for whether investors are opening bearish or bullish trades with these moves, data suggests bearish bets, or “puts,” initially rose during the plunge, but then bullish bets, or “calls,” saw a surge as price rebounded. Once again, however, puts have seen a rise, indicating investors don’t trust a bottom has appeared yet. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced its recent recovery as its price is back at $100,900.

Based on reports , the firm changed its filing to remove a delaying amendment, which starts a clock that could make the registration effective automatically after a set window. Automatic Effectiveness Could Trigger Launch The filing change relies on a mechanism allowed under Section 8(a) of the US Securities Act. Reports say that removing the delaying language starts a 20 calendar-day countdown. If the US Securities and Exchange Commission does not act during that period, the registration could become effective around November 26, 2025. That is why several outlets have used that specific date when describing the move. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitwise has taken out the “delaying amendment” from its S-1 filing. Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention. pic.twitter.com/y8jyxbYKXQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2025 Custody And Structure Details Provided According to the prospectus excerpts cited in multiple reports, the fund would hold actual Dogecoin — not futures contracts. Custody arrangements listed include Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC for DOGE and BNY Mellon for cash holdings. The ETF’s net asset value would be tied to the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, the filing shows. Reports also indicate the product is expected to list on NYSE Arca, though a final ticker symbol and fee schedule have not been published. Regulatory Roadblocks Remain Even with the 20-day clock ticking, approval is not guaranteed. The SEC can step in during that window to delay or require further disclosures, and officials have done so in other cases. Market participants also note that an effective registration is only one step. Exchange listing mechanics, market-maker arrangements and custodial confirmations can affect when shares actually begin trading. As a result, an effective date and a trading launch date may differ. Market Context And What It Could Mean A spot ETF for Dogecoin would be a continuation of a wave of spot crypto products that have sought to gain access to mainstream distribution. Reports indicate the move signifies heightened institutional demand to expand regulated access to altcoins in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, the filing itself warns of usual risks: token price swings, liquidity concerns and competition from other funds. No specific expense ratio or seed capital figures were disclosed in the filings cited by the press. Public statements from the SEC , formal confirmation of the effective date on regulatory filings, and notices from NYSE Arca are expected to outline the next steps. Details such as the ETF’s ticker symbol, expense ratio, and participation from market makers are likely to surface as the launch process continues.

The focal point was a direct message from Garlinghouse regarding institutional alignment, upcoming developments, and the continued role of XRP within Ripple’s broader strategy. The video emphasized ongoing industry shifts, the pace of acquisitions, the importance of ecosystem development, and potential effects of increased institutional market access. XRP price will follow.. UP! pic.twitter.com/O2iInZcjFV — RIZ.. (@RizXRP) November 5, 2025 Institutional Participation as a Central Theme Garlinghouse began by expressing confidence in Ripple’s recent strategic investment partnerships with Fortress and Citadel Securities. He described these firms as major financial players and referenced their involvement as meaningful validation. According to Garlinghouse, their alignment sends a clear signal to the financial sector, including institutions that have yet to engage with digital assets. He stated that more than half of financial institutions in the United States currently have no crypto exposure, but he does not believe that will remain the case in the coming year. He framed this trajectory as favorable not only for Ripple but also for companies operating across the broader digital asset ecosystem. His comments positioned institutional adoption as accelerating rather than speculative.

He described XRP as “the heart and soul” of what the company is building, stating that Ripple’s goal is to promote trust, utility, and liquidity for XRP. He noted that the acquisitions undertaken by the firm—regardless of whether their relevance appears immediately clear to the public—are tied to long-term strategic planning. Garlinghouse acknowledged industry-wide challenges related to the dominance of speculative trading over practical application. However, he stated that increased regulatory clarity and global investment are paving the way for broader utility development. He cited growth across the XRP ecosystem , including projects independent of Ripple, attributing this to the blockchain’s efficiency, speed, and scalability. Outlook on a Potential Spot XRP ETF The interview also addressed claims that a spot XRP exchange-traded fund may launch soon. Garlinghouse said that while he is not ready to confirm timing, he views the introduction of such a product as beneficial. He noted that ETFs simplify access for investors who may not wish to use exchanges and pointed to the market impact observed following the launch of ETH-based ETFs earlier in the year. According to Garlinghouse, increased access and institutional trust would likely contribute to growth in the XRP market over time.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Plummet But These Coins Can’t Stop Pumping,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-the-doge-days-over-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-plummet-but-these-coins-cant-stop-pumping/,"The fast-changing market that once declared Dogecoin and Shiba Inu meme coins kings is shifting rapidly. Traders who built their portfolios on social hype are rotating toward projects showcasing stronger fundamentals and real-world value. With investor interest broadening further away from speculation, tokens such as Near Protocol, Filecoin, and even the up-and-coming Remittix (RTX), now priced at $0.1166 per token, head the list because of their clear use cases and fast-growing ecosystems. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Still Moving — But Momentum Weakens Dogecoin changes hands at $0.1648, up 2.64% over the last 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $25 billion, supported by $2.13 billion in daily trading volume, representing a 20.61% increase. While the short-term sentiment looks positive, analysts believe that there is limited upside unless a new DOGE ETF or mainstream catalyst revives broader demand. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000059265, up 4% from yesterday. It has a market capitalization of $5.45 billion and a trading volume of $171.45 million, which represents a 20.07% increase; this suggests steady activity within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. However, similar to Dogecoin, SHIB’s price action relies heavily on community engagement rather than technological advancements-a fact long-term investors keep in mind. Near Protocol and Filecoin Lead the Pump Away from the meme-coin crowd, Near Protocol has surged 19.15% to $2.36, with a market capitalization of $3.02 billion and a 228.81% increase in trading volume to $808.57 million. It is among the top DeFi projects for smart-contract adoption in 2025, due to its scalability factor and an architecture that is very friendly to developers. Filecoin (FIL) has delivered the strongest performance, soaring 64.21% to $2.30. The project’s $1.62 billion market cap and massive $2 billion daily volume — a 1,017.71% increase — highlight renewed trust in decentralized storage networks. Many view FIL’s rally as a signal that capital is shifting from hype-driven coins into projects offering genuine infrastructure benefits. Remittix Emerges as a Utility-Driven Contender As liquidity shifts toward tokens with practical use cases, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a standout. The project has already raised over $28 million in private funding, selling more than 684.3 million tokens. Built as a cross-chain DeFi project, Remittix connects cryptocurrency directly to traditional banking through its PayFi solution, enabling transfers to bank accounts in over 30 countries. Key Highlights of Remittix CertiK Verified — ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet Wallet Beta now open for iOS users $250,000 Giveaway rewarding early community members Upcoming listings confirmed for BitMart and LBANK Designed for low gas fees and global crypto-to-fiat payment A Market Turning Toward Real-World Value The rise of Filecoin and Near Protocol, alongside the stability of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, indicates a market in transition. Investors appear less focused on memes and more on crypto with real utility — a space where Remittix continues to grow rapidly. As confidence builds in audited, secure, and utility-driven projects, RTX may soon join the ranks of the next big altcoins in 2025, reshaping decentralized finance.

The cryptocurrency market just experienced one of the most significant crypto futures liquidations events this year, with a staggering $330 million wiped out in just 24 hours. This massive wave of forced closures has sent shockwaves through the trading community and highlights the extreme volatility that characterizes digital asset markets. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Crypto futures liquidations occur when traders’ positions are forcibly closed because they can no longer meet margin requirements. Think of it as the market’s safety mechanism that kicks in when prices move dramatically against your position. When these crypto futures liquidations happen on such a massive scale, they often accelerate price movements and create cascading effects throughout the market. Breaking Down the $330M Liquidation Carnage The numbers tell a compelling story of market turmoil. Bitcoin led the destruction with $140 million in liquidations, while Ethereum followed closely with $130 million. Surprisingly, ZEC accounted for $60.62 million, showing that even smaller cryptocurrencies weren’t spared from the bloodbath. Key liquidation statistics: Bitcoin: $140 million (57.99% long positions) Ethereum: $130 million (60.41% short positions) ZEC: $60.62 million (70.5% short positions) Why Did This Massive Liquidation Event Occur? Several factors typically trigger such widespread crypto futures liquidations . Market volatility remains the primary culprit, but leverage plays a crucial role. Many traders use excessive leverage, meaning even small price movements can trigger margin calls. When multiple large positions get liquidated simultaneously, it creates a domino effect that amplifies the selling pressure. How Can Traders Protect Themselves From Future Liquidations? Surviving these turbulent periods requires smart risk management. First, always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Second, avoid over-leveraging your positions – sometimes less is more. Third, maintain adequate margin levels to withstand normal market fluctuations. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid all crypto futures liquidations but to ensure they don’t wipe out your entire portfolio. What Do These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations Signal for the Market? Large-scale crypto futures liquidations often indicate market extremes. They can signal potential trend reversals or the climax of a particular move. However, they also create opportunities for savvy traders who understand market dynamics. The key is to recognize that such events are part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and plan accordingly. Key Takeaways From the $330M Liquidation Event This event serves as a powerful reminder about market risks. The mixed nature of positions liquidated – with Bitcoin seeing mostly long liquidations while Ethereum and ZEC experienced predominantly short liquidations – shows that both bullish and bearish traders suffered significant losses. This underscores the importance of proper position sizing and risk management regardless of your market outlook. The recent crypto futures liquidations totaling $330 million highlight the inherent volatility and risks in cryptocurrency trading. While such events can be painful for affected traders, they also serve as valuable learning opportunities. By understanding what triggers these liquidations and implementing proper risk management strategies, traders can navigate future market turbulence more effectively. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidations? Crypto futures liquidations occur when traders cannot meet margin requirements due to adverse price movements, forcing exchanges to close their positions automatically. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use proper risk management including stop-loss orders, reasonable leverage levels, and adequate margin maintenance to protect your positions. Do liquidations affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, large-scale liquidations can create cascading effects that accelerate price movements in the direction of the prevailing trend. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall sharply, while short liquidations occur when prices rise rapidly against bearish positions. Are liquidation events common in crypto markets? Yes, given the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets, liquidation events occur regularly, though the scale varies significantly. Which cryptocurrencies experience the most liquidations? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically see the highest liquidation volumes due to their large market capitalizations and high trading volumes.

Clarke in Manhattan declared a mistrial in the case of two brothers with ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, were charged with fraud for a 12-second Ethereum blockchain transaction that generated $25 million. On Friday, Clarke stated that the $25 million heist exploited the integrity of the ETH blockchain. The Manhattan judge sent jurors home after the jury could not agree on whether to condemn or acquit the two brothers on accusations of carrying out a first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. MIT brothers accused of manipulating ETH blockchain transactions The fraud was first announced on May 15, 2025, by Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. According to a release by the U.S. Department of Justice, both brothers studied computer science at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they acquired the abilities necessary for their trading method. James graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics with a focus on Computer Science and Aerospace Engineering. His brother Anton received a bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering in 2024. Two years later, James earned his master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics. At the beginning of the brothers’ fraud trial last week, defense attorneys and federal prosecutors presented radically contrasting depictions of the MIT brothers. Defense attorneys raised a question for a Manhattan jury. Are the brothers cunning con artists who tricked other traders’ bots into purchasing useless “shitcoins” for a multimillion-dollar score, or are they intelligent “nerds” with amusing online personas and a “wildly successful” cryptocurrency trading strategy? On October 15, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Nees, in his opening remarks, charged the brothers with using a “high-speed bait-and-switch.” Nees accused them of using the high-speed bait-and-switch tactic to trick trading bots into falling into a trap and emptying the accounts of other cryptocurrency traders. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the court filings revealed that the brothers allegedly plotted for months to change and tamper with the procedures used to verify transactions for inclusion on the ETH blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain is a public ledger that tracks every cryptocurrency transaction. The prosecutors added that the brothers managed to verify transactions by exploiting a flaw in the MEV-boost software code. Software code is used by the majority of the ETH network’s “validators,” who are responsible for verifying the legitimacy of new transactions before they are added to the blockchain. “Then the brothers planted a trade that looked like one thing from the outside, but ‍was secretly something else. Then, just as the defendants planned, the victims took the bait.” -Ryan T. Nees, Assistant U.S. Attorney. Katherine Trefz, James Peraire-Bueno’s attorney at Williams & Connolly, countered that the brothers’ trading method was not only innovative but also legal. Trefz added that the trade was consistent with the principles at play in this very competitive trading environment. MIT brothers’ crypto startup faces legal battle Trefz described in her opening remarks at their trial on Wednesday that the brothers as “true nerds.” Trefz claimed that the two brothers began trading cryptocurrencies on the ETH network in early 2021. She added that James used $200 worth of spare computer parts to construct their first ETH node in his apartment close to MIT. “What drew them to this trading environment was its competitive and innovative aspects.” -Katherine A. Trefz, Partner at Williams & Connolly LLP. On Friday, a former employee testified that the brothers eventually established 18 Decimals, a bitcoin trading company. Prosecutors said it employed at least two people. Anton’s defense attorney, William Fick, claimed in his opening statement that the brothers profited greatly using the BTC trading company while other traders suffered huge losses. According to Fick, the brothers fought “predatory” trading bots that use “sandwich attacks” to benefit by trapping another trader’s move between their own in an effort to remedy the wrongs of the cryptocurrency industry.

54158237,623978,1762585228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54158237.jpeg,Ancient Bitcoin Holders Stir: $52 Billion In Old Coins Revived This Year,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-stir-52-billion-old-coins-revived-this-year/,"On-chain data shows a humongous amount of old Bitcoin saw revival in 2025. Here’s how the year stacks up against previous ones. 5+ Year Old Bitcoin Revived Supply Broke $52 Billion This Year As explained by on-chain analyst Checkmate in a new post on X, 2025 has seen a large amount of old tokens come back to life. Coins are considered to be “old” when they are dormant (that is, not involved in any transaction on the blockchain) for at least 5 years. There are different bands these old tokens can be further divided into. The youngest band is the 5 to 7 years range, containing buyers from the last two BTC cycles who are resolute enough to still not have sold their coins. The middle band corresponds to an age of 7 to 10 years old. At this range, there is a real chance that coins entering the cohort are doing so by becoming lost, rather than through “ HODLing .” Finally, there is the 10+ years band, reflecting the truly ancient BTC supply. In 2025 so far, the three cohorts have made movements worth (from youngest to oldest): $22.7 billion, $16.2 billion, and $13.3 billion. In total, over $52 billion in old supply broke dormancy this year. Below is the chart shared by Checkmate that shows how previous years compared. As is visible in the graph, 2024 was the only year that surpassed this year in terms of total 5+ years old revived supply, although 2025 isn’t over yet so it may well surpass it by the end of December. Interestingly, an old supply band that 2025 has already overtaken 2024 in this metric is the 10 years+ cohort. This means that this year Bitcoin saw the most amount of ancient supply come alive. The analyst has noted that $9.5 billion of these tokens have come from a single holder with 80,000 BTC. In some other news, a large amount of liquidations have hit the cryptocurrency derivatives market as a result of the volatility that Bitcoin and others have gone through. As data from CoinGlass shows, $686 million in liquidations have taken place over the last 24 hours. Long contracts have outweighed short ones in liquidations in this period, as a result of volatility being to a net downside. More specifically, the bullish flush has amounted to $363 million, while the bearish one to $318 million. Short liquidations have still been of a significant amount since down isn’t the only way the market has gone. Bitcoin initially fell below $100,000, before recovering back to the current level. In terms of the individual assets, BTC-related contracts contributed the most toward the squeeze with $231 million in liquidations, while Ethereum came second at $165 million. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $101,500, down nearly 8% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|Ancient Bitcoin Whales|bitcoin|bitcoin whales|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-08 07:00:28

Larsen took to X late Friday to celebrate the partnership, writing, “Proud to be an investor in Yellow as they integrate with the XRPL EVM sidechain!” On Monday, Yellow Network stated through its official X account it had successfully integrated with the XRPL EVM Sidechain. The next-generation decentralized clearing network for digital assets is looking to improve the scalability, transparency, and interoperability of digital markets. XRPL’s EVM-compatible sidechain could help strengthen Yellow Network’s clearing infrastructure and improve the liquidity and traceability of tokenized real-world assets. The DeFi platform’s proprietary layer-3 clearing network, Yellow Clearnet, provides liquidity between trading venues through decentralization, and could now branch to other networks beyond its modular Yellow SDK with the XRPL EVM integration. Chris Larsen nursed Yellow Network to success Yellow Network secured $10 million in seed funding in 2024, led by Larsen himself, who has been a leading voice in blockchain adoption since co-founding Ripple Labs. Other notable backers include Consensys, GSR, NxGen, MV Global, Gate Labs, ZBS Capital, Moonrock Capital, Math, Cobo, NOIA Capital, and LD Capital. In a statement accompanying the announcement, Larsen said he was proud to support Yellow Network as it “tackles liquidity fragmentation in crypto trading and sets new standards for the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem.” The Ripple Labs co-founder also mentioned Yellow’s technology “is essential for new players entering the space,” because it delivers “fast trade execution and capital efficiency.” “Having Chris Larsen’s support is an incredible validation of our efforts. His contribution to Ripple and online finance transformed how the world perceives and utilizes blockchain technology. His involvement gives us the confidence to push forward and reshape how digital asset markets function,” Yellow Network CEO Louis Bellet. In August, Yellow Network announced the completion of its YELLOW token sale on Republic, which raised over $1 million from accredited investors. The oversubscribed sale was one of the first Web3 infrastructure token offerings conducted under Regulation D, the said “new standard for compliant, institution-grade tokenization” in the United States. Chris Larsen’s fortune rises to $15 billion Chris Larsen is among the world’s wealthiest individuals, recently breaking into the global top-200 richest people, according to Bloomberg. Just days before Larsen’s celebratory post, investors affiliated with Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities injected $500 million into Ripple, valuing the company at $40 billion. Cryptopolitan reported on Thursday that Larsen’s net worth stands at a whopping $15.3 billion, owing to his 18% stake in Ripple and 2.7 billion XRP tokens worth roughly $6.3 billion. His portfolio also includes $1.8 billion in real estate and assorted investments, all confirmed directly to Bloomberg. Born in San Francisco and raised in Cupertino, the 64-year-old entrepreneur’s career began decades before crypto existed. After earning degrees in accounting and business administration from San Francisco State University in 1984, he worked as an auditor at Chevron before completing an MBA at Stanford University. Ripple adds Palisade to list of acquisitions On Monday, the same day Yellow network unveiled the XRPL EVM integration, developer Ripple announced its acquisition of Palisade, a digital wallet provider and custody firm. The RLUSD issuer and cross-border payments platform is tapping Palaside to improve digital asset custody capabilities for crypto-native firms, fintech startups, and corporations involved in the blockchain. “Secure digital asset custody unlocks the crypto economy and is the foundation that every blockchain-powered business stands on,” said Monica Long, Ripple’s President, in a statement. “That’s why it’s central to Ripple’s product strategy.” Long reiterated that corporations are now “poised to drive the next massive wave of crypto adoption,” noting that “major banks have gone from observing to actively building in crypto,” adding that institutions now need “trusted, licensed partners with out-of-the-box capabilities.” Palisade’s wallet-as-a-service (WaaS) technology supports multi-party computation (MPC) and multi-blockchain functionality, and will be integrated into Ripple Custody and Ripple Payments.

Related Reading: Cathie Wood Trims Her 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction To $1.2 Million – Here’s Why Solana ETF Era To ‘Reshape’ Price Trajectory On Friday, crypto exchange Bybit discussed the potential impact of the recently launched Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) and Grayscale Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) on the altcoin’s long-term narrative and performance. In its Crypto Insights Report, the exchange noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US, marking a key milestone that could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” The report highlighted that SOL’s performance will likely benefit from the global expansion of SOL-focused products. Notably, Hong Kong also approved and launched the first Solana Spot ETF by China Asset Management in late October. Meanwhile, Brazil and Canada also host Solana ETFs, which create “a multi-jurisdictional framework that enhances global liquidity and price discovery.” Nonetheless, the crypto exchange considers that the most significant impact is “the narrative shift they catalyze,” as the cryptocurrency “is no longer just a high-beta altcoin favored by retail traders — it’s now a regulated, yield-bearing asset with institutional access and global distribution.” This rebranding aligns with Solana’s technical evolution, as its role in powering tokenized treasuries, real-world assets and permissioned stablecoin issuance makes it a foundational layer for the next generation of financial infrastructure. The exchange argued that Solana may transition from a speculative asset to providing a strategic allocation in diversified portfolios as macro conditions stabilize and ETF inflows build. SOL ‘On The Cusp Of Multi-Quarter Rally’ According to Farside Investors’ data, the SOL-based investment products have recorded over $300 million in inflows since launching last week, signaling strong institutional demand for the Solana ETFs. However, the altcoin’s price retraced around 8% during the ETF’s first trading week. Additionally, SOL’s price has fallen nearly 20% on the weekly timeframe, reaching a four-month low of $144 earlier this week. Despite the short-term volatility, Bybit affirmed that the ETF listings “represent a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” dramatically expanding SOL’s investor base. The report emphasized that the subdued response echoes the “sell-the-news” dynamic seen in BTC and ETH’s ETF approvals. Both cryptocurrencies experienced short-term corrections after their respective spot ETF launches before recovering on sustained inflows. “Solana may be following a similar pattern, with early profit-taking and whale rotation — such as Jump Crypto’s large on-chain transfer — temporarily suppressing upside momentum,” Bybit affirmed. Related Reading: Web3 Verifiable Settlement Protocol To Bring ‘Internet-Speed’ Payments With New Upgrade The report pointed out Bitwise’s estimate that every $1 billion in ETF inflows could lead to a 30%-50% increase in SOL’s market capitalization. As a result, if inflows reach $2-3 billion in the next year, the cryptocurrency could revisit its all-time high (ATH) levels, and even rally toward $300–$350. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange concluded.

XRP Price Correction Isn’t Done Yet,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-the-market-got-ahead-of-itself-xrp-price-correction-isnt-done-yet/,"Crypto trader and analyst CasiTrades has provided a detailed update on XRP’s near-term price structure, emphasizing that the recent upward reaction in the market does not imply that the corrective phase has concluded. The move higher following news of the Mastercard partnership led to a brief test of the upper boundary of the projected subwave structure, with the price reaching approximately $2.41. However, this level did not hold, and the rejection that followed reinforced the analysis that the correction remains in progress. CasiTrades notes that although the price temporarily reached the highest reasonable extension for subwave four, the candle closes did not break below the previous Wave 1 low. This detail is key in maintaining the broader Elliott Wave count that has been guiding the ongoing correction. Holding that boundary keeps the corrective roadmap viable and mirrors the expectation shared in earlier commentary. The Market Got Ahead of Itself… XRP’s Correction Isn’t Done Yet! The market got a little too excited over the Mastercard partnership news… We saw XRP push right into the extremes of where subwave 4 could go, briefly wicking up to $2.41, but that move was short-lived.… pic.twitter.com/hAvk4ueQpT — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) November 6, 2025 Expected Retest Toward $2.05 Support Zone According to the update, the decline associated with Wave 3 bottoming near $2.05 requires further confirmation. CasiTrades expects the price to return to that region to complete subwave five of Wave 3. The next anticipated move would involve price reaching back toward the $2.36 area in a larger Wave 4 retracement once the subwave five leg finds support. After that retracement, one more downward push in a final Wave 5 is anticipated, setting up an environment where a double-bottom pattern could form near the same support zone. The primary scenario being tracked suggests that the macro 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level around $2.05 is likely to represent the final low of the correction. An alternative scenario in which price retraces deeper toward the 0.618 Fibonacci level remains possible but currently appears less probable based on the evolving subwave structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 RSI Structure Supports the Wave Count In addition to price action, CasiTrades highlights the relative strength index as a supporting factor in the analysis. A clear bearish divergence formed at the recent local high, suggesting weakening momentum. The RSI pattern appears positioned for a retest of its lower trendline, which would align with price revisiting the $2.05 level. This confluence strengthens the expectation that the corrective move is not yet complete and still requires a return to key support. CasiTrades reiterates that nothing in the current trend structure invalidates the corrective framework previously discussed. The brief move higher reflected market reaction to a news event rather than a structural breakout. With the Wave 3 low still requiring further testing, the correction is expected to continue before a more sustained trend shift occurs.

According to the data, there is no expectation of a strong bottom reversal in the options market, neither in the near term nor in the medium-long term. According to Glassnode's analysis, there are no signs of accumulation, particularly in medium- and long-term call options with a strike price of $120,000. On the contrary, even brief market rallies are being exploited by investors to sell these call options. This suggests weak long-term optimism. One of the most striking parts of the report is the sharp shift in the put-call balance in short-term (1 week–1 month) options to the sell side. Glassnode notes that short-term put options dominate by approximately 11-12%, suggesting that short-term expectations are where market fears are most acute. Related News: Watch Out: Fake Cryptocurrency App Detected on Google Play When we look at the premium movement of short-term put options with a $100,000 strike price, the picture becomes even clearer: In just three days, the net premium paid on these options skyrocketed from near-negative levels to over $7 million, suggesting investors were aggressively buying short-term protection. While the sharp correction after Bitcoin hit its all-time high (ATH) on October 31 wiped out many open positions, half of that was rebuilt within a week, according to Glassnode data. Option open interest data is hitting new records as expiration dates approach. Moreover, after Bitcoin fell below $107,000, options volume rose sharply and remained high, suggesting intense repositioning in the market. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin slipped under $100,000, hitting its lowest level in six months, and traders are now anxiously watching the chart like it’s a crime scene. As of press time, the OG crypto is 20% below its all-time high of $126,000, according to data from CoinGecko, after a major liquidation event on October 10 triggered additional downside pressure as leveraged crypto positions were forced out, as was reported by Cryptopolitan. Bitcoin first plunged under $117,000, then pushed through the $112,000 level. After those breaks, the price failed to regain either support region. The inability to reclaim those points has been viewed as a sign of weakening market confidence. Bear market sings are deepening after new buyers backed away Markus Thielen, founder and CEO of 10X Research in Singapore, said on Friday that the price action indicates that the market has shifted into a bear phase. “We haven’t really reclaimed this level since then, and I think that’s a sign we are, unfortunately, in a bear market,” Markus said. His company had already predicted last month that the OG crypto could fall to $100,000, and now expects the market may still be “a few weeks away” from reaching a bottom. Markus added, “I think there’s this brief risk where we could correct quite a bit more.” 10X Research pointed out that the marginal buyer is no longer active. The investors who entered when prices were climbing have either exited or are no longer willing to commit funds. Fund managers with large share exposure through exchange-traded products may also be forced to reduce their holdings as underlying asset prices fall. The US dollar has found fresh strength, which may place more pressure on crypto . Markus said, “There’s this air pocket below $93,000, and there is not much support. It could be that there is going to be some liquidation that brings us to potentially the $70,000 level.” Markus also added that early adopters have often sold near peak points in past cycles before re-entering later once the market stabilizes. Liquidity factors and shifting investor behavior Some analysts say there are possible drivers that could help lift the price. These include the potential for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December, as well as speculation regarding upcoming changes at the central bank when Jerome Powell’s term expires in May. There is also discussion around the expected reopening of the US government, which could send more liquidity into markets. Sean Farrell, head of crypto at Fundstrat, said in a video that the shutdown has been “stifling liquidity conditions” and increasing concern about broader economic momentum. JPMorgan said in a note that the deleveraging event that pushed the coin down in October may now be behind the market. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director at JPMorgan, said that a recent rise in gold volatility has made Bitcoin relatively more appealing to some investors, which he believes could lead to “significant upside” over the next 6–12 months, with a possible move as high as $170,000. Yet selling remains visible. Farrell said that whales have been sending large amounts of coins from private wallets to exchanges over recent weeks, “hammering price.” Engel reiterated that net sales from long-term holders have gone beyond 1 million coins since June. He also noted that retail buying has been weaker than previous cycles and that ETF inflows have slowed. Engel said that while there may be support above $95,000, there are not many near-term catalysts. He added, “‘Uptober’ failed to materialize for the first time since 2018, which was followed by a 37% decline in November 2018.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|10x Research|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-08 07:15:29

On-chain numbers show DeFi use falling and fewer wallets staying active, which is now shaping every serious Cardano price prediction. While some traders still hope for a sharp ADA rebound, many long-term holders are quietly rotating into Remittix (RTX) , what many now call “XRP 2.0.” This DeFi project is being watched as a top crypto under $1, with a real payment utility that Cardano has not yet delivered at scale. Cardano Price Prediction: What The DeFi And Address Drop Really Means Source: @ali_charts on X Any honest Cardano price prediction has to start with the data. ADA trades around $0.535 . The wallets that hold between 100,000 and 1 million ADA have sold over 4 million tokens in one week. If ADA falls below $0.51, $0.43-$0.36 are next. However, passing $0.60 could push it toward $0.70 and higher. The on-chain picture supports this careful view. Data shows that daily active addresses have dropped from 32,115 to 24,280. Fewer active wallets usually mean lower demand and less excitement. Some analysts say that holding $0.52 has been important, as this level has sparked rebounds before. If buyers protect that zone, the next Cardano price prediction points to a possible push toward $0.74–$0.85, and maybe even a retest of $1.00. But that scenario needs stronger volume and fresh DeFi usage, which are not visible yet. Remittix “XRP 2.0”: Why ADA Holders Are Calling RTX Their Next Big Bet Remittix is built around a simple idea: send money across borders in seconds using crypto, then land it straight into real bank accounts. So far, Remittix has raised over $28 million through the sale of more than 684 million RTX tokens at $0.1166 each. Listings on BitMart and LBank are confirmed, and another major exchange reveal is coming soon. Security is a key reason some ADA holders are moving across. The project has passed a full audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. On top of that, Remittix runs a 15% USDT referral program, and investors need to secure their 50% token bonus before the $30 million mega announcement. Here’s why investors and analysts call Remittix “XRP 2.0”: Remittix supports instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. The wallet and coming web app are built to handle 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Smart contracts are audited and the team is fully verified. $250,000 community giveaway campaign fueling viral growth and engagement. Ranked #1 on CertiK’s Pre-Launch leaderboard for verified projects. Is “XRP 2.0” A Smarter Play Than Waiting On ADA? Cardano still has a loyal community, and any future spike in DeFi activity could lift both engagement and the next Cardano price prediction range. But right now, the numbers show falling DeFi use, lower address counts, and whales selling into the market. For holders who still care about Cardano price prediction but also want exposure to real payment growth, combining ADA with Remittix looks like a smart move.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) field is redefining the attention of investors as a new generation of projects disrupts the prominence of the already influential market actors such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is recommended to be one of the projects that draw increasingly rising attention, a DeFi crypto protocol that some observers reckon could be alongside the leading cryptocurrencies in 2026. A Growing Presale With Strong Momentum In 2025, one of the most anticipated events has been the presale of Mutuum Finance due to the steady development and publicly accessible mechanics. The token started trading at $0.01 at Phase 1 and it is currently trading at $0.035 at Phase 6 with a 250% growth to early participants. The official launch price according to team lines is pegged at $0.06 and this is approximately a 100% token appreciation to people entering the current phase. The project numbers are impressive, as far as fundraising is concerned. To date over $18.5 million has been raised and the number of holders (since this year started with a presale) has topped 17,850. Each phase is run on a fixed price and fixed supply model whereby when demand increases, the price is automatically adjusted to increase after a phase is sold out. The present stage, Phase 6 is already more than 83% allocated, so it can be assumed that investors are interested in the project as it approaches the next milestone that is its development. Creating a DeFi Utility-led Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized and borrowing and lending protocol that is built with transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in the long run. The system enables people to lend digital assets and generate passive revenue or borrow money on the funds, which are managed by smart contracts which provide fairness and reliability. In the heart of this system lie the mtTokens which are yield-bearing assets which are deposits in the platform. Whenever a user lends crypto to the protocol, they would be rewarded with mtTokens that would earn interest automatically as the borrowers use the existing liquidity. This model also allows users to generate yield on a fully automated basis but give them on-chain control over their assets. The other important component of the design is the buy-and-distribute mechanism, one of the elements that links the success of the project to the demand of the tokens. The revenue of the protocol is used to acquire MUTM tokens in the open market and such tokens are re-supplied to the end user who stakes the mtTokens in the safety module. This forms an endless cycle of customer incentive and make-up that brings interests within the platform and its community into off-set. Stablecoin and Oracles Plans As per the roadmap of the project, Mutuum Finance will also launch a USD-pegged stablecoin based on the lending action of the platform. The interest earned by the borrowers in this model will go to a treasury, which will be able to keep the growth long run. To ensure the right pricing and reliability of the liquidation process, the team will be using the strength of oracle networks like Chainlink, as well as fallback or aggregated sources of data. This will guarantee that the values of assets are correct in all market environments – which is a key to a protocol that is based on loans and collateral control. These plans, according to some analysts, have the potential to take MUTM to 600-800% growth in the next 12-18 months in case the plans are implemented successfully. There is also positive news early in the investor sentiment that point to increased confidence that Mutuum Finance will follow the early growth pattern that can be followed with the launch of projects such as Aave and Solana. The Way to V1 and Why It Matters Mutuum Finance has already affirmed that its V1 platform will be turned on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025, a milestone that will move the phase of development into live testing. The launch will consist of the Liquidity Pool, mtToken system, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot with the initial support of ETH and USDT as the lending and collateral assets. The imminent testnet release is generating excitement within the project community and in particular since Phase 6 of the presale nears completion. Investors with higher contributions of more than $100,000 in individual investment have been on the move in recent weeks and this is an indication of a high level of institutional confidence before the next stage.

The company’s revenue also took a hit, sliding 3.8% to just $972,900, with legal expenses alone hitting $20.3 million in just one quarter, as crazy as that sounds. Trump Media’s stock TMTG plunged by more than 3% in after-hours trading on Friday, though the earnings report was released before the bell. This comes as no shock for a company that went public in March 2024 through a SPAC merger, and has since become a political meme stock with zero clarity on its real user base. No data on daily or monthly users. Nothing. Just vibes and volatility. Trump Media piles into bitcoin as losses mount Somewhere between July 1 and July 21, Trump Media invested exactly $2 billion into Bitcoin and related securities, according to the earnings report , which also said that the company bought in when bitcoin was around $118,000. Fast forward to Friday and Bitcoin had sunk all the way to $103,000 amid intense market-wide selloff. On top of that, Trump Media’s Cronos (CRO) holdings, which was acquired through an August venture with Crypto.com and a blank-check company, have also dropped significantly since the quarter ended on September 30. That August deal was supposed to kick off a treasury-style crypto strategy. But instead of building revenue from its platform, Trump Media is now leaning heavily on crypto speculation. The company’s original business, Truth Social, has effectively become an afterthought, as the earnings report gave no new growth numbers, no engagement stats, and no visibility whatsoever into how much traffic Donald Trump actually brings to the table. Still, Donald owns a massive 114,750,000 shares of Trump Media through his revocable trust, putting him squarely in the driver’s seat of a company that’s burning millions while betting on crypto. He even posted on Truth Social in September that the SEC should drop quarterly reporting altogether, saying: “This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” Trump’s crypto-fueled net worth hits $7.3 billion Meanwhile, president Trump’s personal net worth has been on fire ever since his return to the White House, with combined gains from Trump Media and crypto pushing his wealth to $7.3 billion, according to Forbes. Forbes estimates $6.6 billion of his fortune is tied directly to crypto and Trump Media equity, and has helped him land at #201 on this year’s Forbes 400, his highest position ever. Devin Nunes, the company’s CEO and a former Republican congressman, received a $5.9 million stock award in August. That stock will vest over three years. The payout came just after the company posted a $20 million loss in Q2, adding to the cash burn concerns. Questions about conflicts of interest have been flying ever since Donald got back into the Oval Office, especially with crypto now tangled into his business empire. But Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, dismissed those concerns completely. She told Forbes: “The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read. Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” Get seen where it counts.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $101,988.01 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors. What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Investors? The recent Bitcoin price movement below $102,000 represents a key psychological barrier being broken. This development signals potential short-term bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. However, experienced traders understand that market corrections are normal in volatile assets like Bitcoin. Several factors could be influencing this Bitcoin price decline: Market sentiment shifts Technical resistance levels Broader economic conditions Regulatory developments How Significant is This Bitcoin Price Movement? The current Bitcoin price of $101,988.01 represents more than just numbers on a screen. This level serves as an important technical indicator that many traders watch closely. When the Bitcoin price breaches such significant round numbers, it often triggers automated trading responses and can influence market psychology. Historical data shows that Bitcoin price movements often follow patterns of consolidation followed by breakouts or breakdowns. The current situation may represent either a temporary correction or the beginning of a larger trend shift. What Should You Do About the Falling Bitcoin Price? Facing a declining Bitcoin price requires careful strategy rather than panic. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk Setting stop-loss orders to protect investments Researching fundamentals beyond price alone Diversifying your portfolio across different assets Remember that the Bitcoin price has historically recovered from much larger drops. The current movement, while significant, represents normal market behavior for this volatile asset class. Looking Beyond the Current Bitcoin Price Dip While the immediate Bitcoin price action appears negative, long-term investors often view such dips as potential buying opportunities. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged despite short-term price fluctuations. Market analysts suggest watching for these key indicators: Trading volume patterns Support and resistance levels Institutional investor activity Market sentiment indicators Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Price Volatility The Bitcoin price dropping below $102,000 serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. While concerning in the short term, this movement represents the natural ebb and flow of digital asset markets. Smart investors use such opportunities to reassess their strategies and make informed decisions based on both technical analysis and fundamental research. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $102,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely resulted from a combination of technical factors, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions affecting cryptocurrency markets. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some investors view price dips as buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but technical analysts watch key support levels around $100,000 and $98,000 as potential areas of interest. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk management strategy rather than reacting to short-term price movements alone. How often does Bitcoin experience such price drops? Bitcoin has historically experienced regular price corrections throughout its history, with volatility being a characteristic feature of cryptocurrency markets. What indicators should I watch during Bitcoin price volatility? Key indicators include trading volume, moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and market sentiment across social media and news platforms. Found this analysis helpful?

One of those people was Wang Peizhi, a 34-year-old employee responsible for transforming smartphone retail stores into spaces capable of displaying full-size sedans. Months before he collapsed in a grocery store while shopping with his young son, he had been staying up through the night preparing Xiaomi’s flagship showroom for the debut of the SU7 sedan. This story is based on internal documents, WeChat messages, and interviews shared with Bloomberg News. Retail overhaul drives extreme workloads Wang had worked at Xiaomi during the years when co-founder Lei Jun announced that Xiaomi would become the first major tech company to enter car manufacturing. Lei called it his “last entrepreneurial project.” The plan required not only building a car, but also reworking Xiaomi’s nationwide retail network, so stores originally designed for phones and laptops had to be converted into auto showrooms. During the pandemic, Xiaomi cut roughly half of the staff responsible for this transformation, so around 10 people were left to carry out the work. By early 2024, the workload had surged, and Wang was allegedly responsible for at least 267 store renovations in the first eight months of the year. Wang also took on some of the company’s most high-profile projects, including a store near Tiananmen Square, while still handling smaller locations, reviewing site layouts, checked supplier progress, handled renovation issues, and coordinated opening schedules. Bloomberg’s report claimed that Wang pushed himself because he did not want to leave tasks undone, and also said there were simply not enough workers left to share the load. Wang earned about 600,000 yuan ($84,000) per year, including stock options, his widow Luna Liu said. But she said he lived under constant pressure created by tight timelines and demands from upper management. Many people in China’s tech industry have allegedly described similar work expectations. Long hours, including the practice known as “996” (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week) continue across many major companies, according to Bloomberg. SU7 launch accelerates demands Two months before Xiaomi introduced the SU7, Wang’s workload intensified. He sent messages from early morning through late night, sometimes around 2:30 a.m., asking about installation of mirrors or requesting suppliers to finish jobs faster. Liu said he once told her he felt like a spinning top, working the roles of “seven or eight people.” She said that although he came home each day, she sometimes felt she had not actually seen him in days. After the Lunar New Year, Wang was deeply involved in getting the Beijing flagship store operational. Documents show him sharing hundreds of photos and messages with colleagues about lighting systems, floor reinforcement, charging poles, and display adjustments. When company president Lu Weibing announced on social media that he would visit the store the next morning, Wang wrote, “Tomorrow decides everything.” The SU7 was priced at around 215,900 yuan, lower than models like the BYD Han L and the Tesla Model 3, and the design resembled the Porsche Taycan at a fraction of the price. After launch in March, Xiaomi’s stock price saw a 200% rally in Hong Kong, and the company set a delivery goal of 350,000 units for 2025. By comparison, BYD sold about 4.3 million EVs and hybrids last year, and Tesla sold roughly 1.8 million vehicles worldwide, so Xiaomi is actually still far from catching up. In August, Wang traveled to stores in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Tianjin. Only two coworkers were assigned to assist him across these responsibilities. On August 22, he felt weak and went to the hospital for tests. While there, he still received messages from multiple store teams asking for updates. A manager in Shenyang responded to Wang saying he was sick by texting, “Xiaomi’s employees are all warriors,” along with a crying emoji. Later that day, while at a grocery store with his son, his heart stopped. He was taken to intensive care. Less than three days later, he died. His death certificate listed acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. Liu said he had no known medical problems and maintained an active lifestyle, including regular running and weekend hikes. Liu told the company she believed overwork caused his death. Local authorities ruled it was not considered work-related under national rules that require the death to occur within 48 hours of treatment for a work injury. The company later offered a hardship payment of 50,000 yuan, though Liu said none of it was paid. She also said some of Wang’s stock options were rescinded. One of Wang’s last messages to a contractor read: “What I signed up for was a life or death commitment. Don’t leave me hanging.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Ripple’s two-day Swell event, held from November 4 to 5, had initially given markets a taste of optimism as the company revealed several “positive” developments. The Manhattan venue-hosted event featured the announcement of a $500 million funding round led by Citadel Securities and Fortress Investment Group, Cryptopolitan reported . Much to the dismay of XRP bulls, market participants “bought the rumors, and sold the news,” causing the asset to drop to around $2.19 by early Tuesday trading. XRP has since regained some ground and shot back up to $2.30, but is facing rejections at the $2.40 level despite the Swell event’s purported success. XRP sentiment flips bearish after Swell announcements, with low impact The pullback extended its month-long slide, adding to a four-year streak of XRP posting negative returns between the Swell conference and year-end. TradingView chart analysis shows that XRP may be entering a new bearish phase after failing to sustain a price surge beyond $2.5 for over a week. The token has been trading within a “Channel Up” formation that began after the March 2020 COVID-19 market crash, but that momentum is clearly waning. Analyst TradingShot believes a breakdown below the one-week 50-day moving average is a sign that the bullish cycle that began in July, taking XRP to a 4-year high of $3.50, is ending. XRP/USD chart analysis. Source: TradingView. Last month’s market-wide flash crash briefly sent XRP down to test its one-week 100-day moving average, before a quick recovery helped stabilize prices. Yet the failure to reclaim the $2.5 price level has revived comparisons to the 2021 post-peak correction that followed XRP’s last major rally. At that time, XRP had also completed a run above $3.5 before turning lower, much similar to the technical setup seen in recent months. The token has already filled the 2.5 Fibonacci extension level with its July 14 multi-year high, the exact pricing level where the April 2021 cycle topped. When XRP closed a week below $1 in November 2021, it started a sustained bearish period that took traders months to turn bullish. The similarities between the current relative strength index (RSI) readings and those recorded then is evidence that the token may be preparing for another leg lower. Weekend price breakout fails to hold, traders still ‘selling the news’ XRP briefly staged a breakout late Friday that made bulls excited for the weekend, hoping more positive price steps will ensue before another dreaded November business week commences. On Saturday, XRP rose 3.6% to reach $2.31, pushing above the previous psychological resistance level at $2.28, against the backdrop of ETF submission amendments from Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. Heavy trading volume flashed on CoinGecko of about 165 million XRP , an 86% jump above the daily average. The surge suggested that larger players were once again active, fueling hopes of a sustained rally. XRP consolidated between $2.32 and $2.35, a narrow $0.19 range, gaining traction after clearing resistance levels at $2.22 and $2.28 in a single high-volume move around 16:00 UTC Friday. Market depth data from exchanges showed buyers repeatedly defending the $2.309–$2.310 price levels, absorbing short-term sell pressure and keeping the order books balanced. But the strength faded quickly as macro sentiment and post-event profit-taking took over. XRP’s ability to hold above $2.30 will determine if the fourth largest coin by market cap continues rallying, or falls apart and away back to $2.1 Despite the bearish undertones, traders are keeping watch of the progress on the proposed Canary XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). If the fund’s registration advances automatically under Section 8(a) of the Securities Act, XRP will become the next top 10 ranking market cap crypto with a US-listed spot product.

In a recent interview with Bloomberg at the company’s Swell conference in New York, Ripple President Monica Long stated, “We do not have an IPO timeline. No plan, no timeline.” Her comments highlight the company’s present priorities, which include expanding its payments business, launching dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, often known as stablecoins, and forming new alliances, rather than pursuing an initial public offering. IPO Aspirations Remain On Hold These remarks come shortly after Ripple successfully closed a $500 million funding round earlier this week, achieving a valuation of $40 billion. This funding round was led by notable investors such as Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities, along with contributions from Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace. Related Reading: Samourai Wallet Co-Founder Sentenced To 5 Years In Prison For Money Laundering The substantial backing indicates that Ripple is not under financial pressure to seek public capital at this time. Long emphasized that the company remains “very well capitalized,” allowing it to fund “organic growth” and pursue acquisitions or partnerships without needing to turn to the public markets. This decision positions Ripple differently from its peers, including stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), Bullish (BLSH), and Gemini (GEMI), all of which have recently gone public in the US as part of a broader wave of digital asset listings. For holders of XRP, Ripple’s choice to delay an initial public offering presents mixed implications. On one hand, the lack of a near-term public listing might postpone hopes for a liquidity event that could enhance XRP’s market visibility. Conversely, the recent funding round and a reportedly doubled customer base quarter-over-quarter bolster confidence in Ripple’s growth trajectory and its stablecoin payment strategy. Institutional Confidence In Ripple Analysts suggest that the $500 million raise at a $40 billion valuation reflects strong institutional confidence in Ripple’s long-term prospects. Coupled with the increasing on-chain adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for stablecoin and cross-border payments, this funding could help stabilize XRP’s price and pave the way for future rallies, especially if Ripple continues to expand its presence in the enterprise sector.

Long noted that clearer regulations in the US and internationally have “opened up the market,” leading to a surge in adoption. Currently, XRP is trading within its short-term range, which formed following continuous corrections between $2 and $2.60. The altcoin is currently trading at $2.32 and has seen a 4.7% recovery in the past 24 hours, with a clear resistance wall at $2.69.

The organization shared significant changes to its mission’s approach as part of its strategy for global transition. From El Salvador To The World Non-profit organization My First Bitcoin has announced its official transition from offering local BTC education and support to providing tools and resources to educators worldwide. MFB, also known as Mi Primer Bitcoin, was founded in El Salvador in 2021 and focuses on independent BTC education with various programs. In early 2022, the organization launched its BTC Diploma program to facilitate education on multiple Bitcoin-related topics, including fiat money, BTC’s history, and the challenges of the flagship crypto’s different facets. The program has reportedly reached over 27,000 students over the past few years, most of whom are located in El Salvador. Meanwhile, the 2023 workbook has been translated into 23 languages and independently taught from South America to Asia. Now, MFB revealed that it seeks to continue its project with a global approach. The organization shared that it is retiring its local name, Mi Primer Bitcoin, and officially rebranding to the English version. Additionally, the team has reportedly been restructured with new roles and directors added. As part of the shift, the organization will also close its physical office in El Salvador and move to a fully remote, globally distributed structure. “Our ambition was always to change the world, but we had to start with a single student, then a single city, then a single nation and now we are ready to raise the potential impact from 6 million people to 8 billion,” MFB’s founder, John Dennehy, stated. My First Bitcoin’s New Focus Despite the shift, MFB affirmed that it will stay grounded in its mission. Dennehy noted the significant scale jump of the organization’s mission, adding that they will be “focusing on empowering educators and projects everywhere, rather than trying to do it ourselves.” The new focus seeks to teach the teachers, “creating the tools, systems, and guidance for everyone that wants to start their own Bitcoin education initiatives: circular economies, meetups and community builders.” According to the announcement, the team will transition into a “more facilitating role,” doubling down on “building and improving new and existing curricula for all audiences.” MFB shared that it is stepping back from its weekly and monthly meetups in El Salvador, which will now be owned and run by a collective of local projects. Moreover, the organization unveiled that its Public School Program in El Salvador had ended. In 2023, the non-profit started collaborating with El Salvador’s Ministry of Education to promote adoption and financial empowerment locally, aiming to introduce the BTC diploma curriculum to the country’s public educational system in 2024. Lastly, the organization will make the expansion of its Independent Bitcoin Educators Node Network a focal point of the new approach. The Node Network was launched in 2023, aiming to provide a space for people to join MFB’s mission. The self-governing network spans over 70 projects from 38 countries. “We want to help others get started and be successful in their own communities, then link everyone together to create a global movement,” MFB’s founder concluded.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Diploma|Bitcoin Education|Bitcoin Educators Node network|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT|El Salvador|John Dennehy|MFB|Mi Primer Bitcoin|My First Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-08 08:00:16

Incredible speech @BGarlinghouse It’s true, @Ripple has cornered the market with the full backing of regulators, financial institutions, and private banks.

Ripple Swell has become a major hub for global financial giants. Garlinghouse noted that SWIFT’s decision had unintended consequences. “I think very quickly, SWIFT regretted their decision because they created more of a monster by pushing us out.” The moment he suggested marked a turning point for Ripple as the company continued to challenge the boundaries of traditional finance. Many notable developments took place during the 2025 event, including a major announcement of a partnership between Ripple and MasterCard to bring RLUSD credit card settlements to the XRP Ledger . A New Era for Crypto and Blockchain Nine years later, Garlinghouse emphasized, the company’s circumstances have changed dramatically. “The world looks profoundly different,” he said. He highlighted how Ripple has grown from a small disruptive force into a company integrated with major players across the financial ecosystem.

Garlinghouse closed his remarks by acknowledging how the perception of digital assets has shifted. “Crypto and blockchain have moved from being taboo words to being part of the fabric of society,” he said. The statement reflects how both Ripple and the digital asset industry have matured from speculative beginnings to recognized components of modern financial infrastructure. Ripple is also much closer to becoming a bank with its national trust bank charter application currently under review by the OCC. Aljarrah sees the company’s achievements as part of a larger movement toward institutional integration of blockchain-based solutions, and Ripple now operates on a level once reserved for established financial powerhouses.

According to authorities, the woman was convinced by the scammer to transfer her life savings into their cryptocurrency wallet under the false promises of starting a life together. Even though she had not met or identified the person at the other end of the line, the Singapore woman was ready to begin a new life with her lover abroad. She had withdrawn her two children from school and packed up her belongings, ready to make the trip to meet this ‘lover.’ However, a day before she was scheduled to travel, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Lee Hua Sheng from the Anti-Scam Command’s (ASC) Crypto Tracing Team (CTT) suspected that she might have been a victim of a scam , asking her to confirm at their office. Singapore single mother loses $120K to romance crypto scammer According to the ASC, the bank had alerted them about the suspicious withdrawals, which prompted ASP Lee to contact the woman. Upon being contacted, the woman claimed that her ‘lover’ had been ignoring her messages. Recounting the incident, the woman claimed that she met the individual as they had only been communicating through WhatsApp messages and voice calls for the past year, but she had never seen his face. ASP Lee, who spent more than three hours speaking to the Singapore woman, mentioned that she did not realize that she had avoided a worse fate. “If she had gone ahead and flown to a foreign country, she would have been stranded with her two young children, with no money,” he said. He then contacted the woman’s family and urged them to show her support. “She’s in a better state now, trying to recover from this episode and move on with her life,” he added. ASP Lee claimed that he carried out a blockchain analysis and traced the funds. He noted that after the funds left her wallet, it was laundered through a series of scams linked to addresses. “Presenting the findings to her was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. The moment the harsh truth hit her, the scammer’s silence and avoidance suddenly made sense (to her), and she burst into tears,” he said. CCT vows to put in more effort to stop scammers The CCT is only eight months old, having gotten the approval to begin operations in March as the government sought to address the rising threat of scam proceeds moving into digital assets like Bitcoin. Singapore lost about $1.1 billion to scammers in 2024, with almost a quarter of the entire figure involving digital assets. The body claimed that one victim lost as much as $125 million in digital assets in a scam that was enabled by malware. ASP Desmond Chia, the officer-in-charge of the CTT, noted that the team was formed because of the rise in crypto adoption. “Globally, people are more attuned to cryptocurrency, and it’s a trend which scammers have also noticed,” he said. He added that digital assets have provided an efficient way for scammers to launder funds without the need to go through banks. In the first half of 2025, more than $81.6 million in cryptocurrencies has been lost to scams, with Bitcoin and Ethereum topping the stats. ASP Lee claimed that criminals are now exploiting victims’ lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies. He mentioned that residents of Singapore have witnessed several cases where some people claim to want to help them invest in digital assets or guide them to invest in the assets, only to disappear after racking up funds from numerous participants. He also claimed that officers in the CCT are trained and charged to stop crypto scams in real-time, tracing wallet movement, and freezing wallets to effect recovery.

ABTC price seesawed between $4.08 and $4.65, recording a 2.20% gain to settle at $4.64 as of publication. The Bitcoin miner announced that its current BTC holdings were acquired through its strategic at-market purchases and mining activities. It explained that the Bitcoin held in its reserve includes BTC held in custody or pledged for miner purchases under the BITMAIN agreement. The company also emphasized that it will continue to provide periodic SPS (Satoshi Per Share) updates as part of its commitment to transparency. The SPS metric provides investors with visibility into the BTC they own indirectly through their equity in the company. Eric Trump claims that ABTC uses a dual strategy Eric Trump, co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, disclosed that the company will continue to rapidly and cost-effectively expand its BTC holdings through a dual strategy. He explained that the strategy will integrate scaled BTC mining operations with disciplined at-market BTC purchases. The president’s son also emphasized that his company is committed to building momentum with its BTC reserve, which currently stands at 4,004 BTC. He also pointed out that the company’s SPS is at 432, representing a 3.35% surge in just 12 days. ABTC’s BTC reserve grew from 3,865 BTC on October 24 to 3,960 BTC on November 3, before adding another 44 BTC to reach its current total. The company explained in a recent U.S. SEC filing that all its BTC purchases are primarily funded through proceeds generated under the American Bitcoin at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. Pursuant to this arrangement, ABTC issued 11,017,341 shares of Class A common stock for gross proceeds of about $90 million. For this, it incurred issuance costs of roughly $2 million between September 3 and September 30. The company further issued 5,523,058 shares of Class A common stock, valued at approximately $33.9 million, with an issuance cost of $0.1 million, between October 1 and November 3. ABTC also disclosed that it mined 563 BTC and bought 2,451 BTC during the three months ended September 30. It also mined 871 BTC and purchased 2,451 BTC during the nine months ended September 30. As of September 30, Bitcoin holdings included 2,385 BTC pledged or otherwise collateralized and 258 BTC purchased by ABTC between October 1 and November 3. Meanwhile, as of November 3, BTC held includes 2,776 BTC pledged or otherwise collateralized. Simply Wall St analysts assess ABTC’s valuation Simply Wall St analysts assessed ABTC’s valuation following the recent share price pullback. They found that the company’s stock had fallen by 5% over the past five days, 12% in the past week, and 33% over the past month. Value-focused investors have expressed concern about the persistent decline in the market. The analysts also claim that ABTC’s share price has declined significantly over the year, with recent pullbacks worsening the company’s existing challenges. They added that the ongoing volatility is pushing many of the cautious investors to the sidelines. However, they noted that ABTC’s share price momentum appeared more promising earlier. Meanwhile, the analysts questioned whether the recent sell-off means ABTC is trading at a bargain or if the market has already priced in future prospects. They also wondered if this could be a genuine buying opportunity or simply a case of fair value at work.

Here’s What The Experts Think,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/drops-end-of-a-bull-market-or-biggest-eth-bear-trap-ever-heres-what-the-experts-think/,"The surge of interest in new DeFi projects and the hunt for the best crypto to buy now are under threat as the Ethereum price tumbles. Ethereum price has dropped sharply this week. Early buyers are already braced for regret or ready to strike. With whales quietly accumulating Bitcoin and altcoins, but sentiment towards Ethereum wavering. Investors are looking for the next big altcoin in 2025 while watching ETH closely. One under-the-radar high growth crypto project is gaining traction as a potential hedge. Ethereum Price Downturn: Is Bull Momentum Dead? Ethereum price is currently trading around $3,233 after a week-long dive of approximately 12%. Is this the end of an era or a setup for something bigger? ETH breaking below key support at $3,500 and dipping to $3,058 signals serious trouble. Analysts flagged the breakdown of long liquidation levels. This might indicate a bull market giving way to a deeper correction. On the flip side, some argue this sharp correction might be a classic bear trap. With short positions sitting above $4,000 and major support zones in the $2,800–$3,000 area, a violent rebound could be setting up. ETH still sits at the core of the largest smart-contract ecosystem, and the “Ethereum price” metric is still dominating media headlines and investor sentiment. Remittix (RTX): The Undervalued PayFi Project on the Radar In this climate of uncertainty around ETH and SOL, one undervalued crypto project stands out as a low-gas-fee crypto network with real world utility. Remittix is positioning itself as a cross-chain DeFi project bridging blockchain to traditional bank rails. It has already raised $28 million in private funding, demonstrating strong demand for its PayFi solution. The platform aims to let crypto holders convert assets directly to fiat in bank accounts across 30+ countries, supporting 40+ tokens and 30+ fiat currencies. Compared to Ethereum and Solana, Remittix goes beyond speculation and aims real-world payments use-case, which top analysts are calling “XRP 2.0” for payments infrastructure. Why Remittix is gaining traction Global Reach: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real-World Utility: Crypto-to-fiat fallback built for actual payments Security First: Audited and ranked highly in pre-launch security assessments Mobile Wallet Coming: Designed for mainstream and business users Strong Funding: $28 million raised privately, showing serious investor interest Compared to Ethereum, which is grappling with dominance pressure and layer-2 alternatives, Remittix offers a fresh narrative. It may lack the vast ecosystem of ETH today but offers a real-world solution and could appeal to investors looking for the next high-growth crypto under $1.

This expansion shows just how massive Nvidia’s appetite for wafers has become, as the company builds everything from GPUs and CPUs to networking gear and switches that power today’s AI systems. At an event in Hsinchu, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company is facing “very strong demand” for its Blackwell line, adding that Nvidia’s growth is tightly tied to TSMC’s support. “TSMC is doing a very good job supporting us on wafers,” Jensen said, during what has now become his fourth trip to Taiwan this year. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei confirmed that Jensen had “asked for wafers,” though he declined to share the exact number. Jensen credited TSMC’s production capacity as being central to Nvidia’s success in the AI race. AI growth drives heavy wafer demand Nvidia’s rise has been extraordinary. In October, the company hit a $5 trillion market value, becoming the first chipmaker in history to reach that milestone. Wei even called Jensen the “five-trillion-dollar man.” But rapid growth also brings supply pressure. When asked about possible memory shortages, Jensen said demand across the AI industry remains intense and that there will be “shortages of different things.” He pointed to SK Hynix, Samsung, and Micron as key memory suppliers that have ramped up production to support Nvidia’s growing hardware lineup. “We have three very, very good memory makers… they have scaled up tremendous capacity to support us,” Jensen said. He also confirmed Nvidia had received the most advanced chip samples from all three suppliers. On memory pricing, Jensen was clear: “It’s for them to decide how to run their business.” That statement came shortly after SK Hynix said it had sold out all its chip production for next year and was planning a big investment increase amid what it called an extended chip “super cycle” powered by AI demand. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics said it was in “close discussion” with Nvidia to supply its upcoming HBM4 high-bandwidth memory. Jensen also addressed the question of Blackwell chip exports to China, saying there were “no active discussions” about sales there, due to U.S. restrictions. Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the sale of high-end AI chips to China remains blocked, on grounds that the technology could benefit China’s military and AI sector. TSMC boosts investments amid AI-fueled demand Bolstered by strong AI-related orders, Wei said TSMC has raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, up from its previous expectation of about 30%. The company also lifted its annual spending floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion, compared to the earlier $38 billion. Analyst William Li of Counterpoint Research noted that the company’s strong results were fueled by 3 nm traction and high utilization at 4 nm and 5 nm, driven by orders from AI GPU and HPC clients, as well as premium smartphone platforms. Wei also mentioned that TSMC is watching U.S. tariff developments closely as Taiwan negotiates for a lower “reciprocal” rate with Washington. Although the U.S. is weighing new semiconductor duties, TSMC is expected to receive partial exemptions. “We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments,” Wei said, noting that the company will continue to plan around those risks. The company has also been investing heavily in U.S. facilities, a move that could help limit exposure to tariffs in the long run. So far, TSMC’s shares in Taiwan have risen more than 38% this year, reflecting strong investor confidence as the world’s top contract chipmaker continues expanding its footprint to meet the world’s hunger for AI hardware.

The 54-year-old trader dealing in building materials in Sola lodged an official complaint with the city cybercrime police after discovering he had been swindled out of his funds. According to the Indian trader, the criminals promised him, alongside other investors, high returns through an investment program that was backed by digital assets. However, he claimed that the website was a fake and the crypto investment did not exist. These kinds of scams have been up this year across India, with bad actors taking advantage of lax crypto regulations and the ignorance of the majority of the population to scam them out of their hard-earned money. Indian trader loses funds to fake investment scammers In the FIR that he submitted to the police, the Indian trader mentioned that the criminals targeted him on Facebook. He claimed they sent him a friend request, using the profile of a woman who identified herself as Aradhya Thakur on April 6. After he accepted the request, the pair started chatting and things soon became serious between them that they moved their conversation to WhatsApp. It was after they moved their conversation to WhatsApp that she struck. The Indian trader mentioned that the woman claimed to work for a company involved in dollar-based investments, persuading him to invest in the scheme. The trader claimed that the website she urged him to look into was similar to that of a reputable crypto trading platform, CoinEx, so he didn’t have any doubts about the investment. In addition, he claimed they promised great returns. “She told me I would get 10% profit on my investment and helped me open an account on the site,” he said. He claimed that she initially sent Rs 9,900 ($112) into his account as profit, a ploy that he now sees as a move to win his confidence and make him invest more. The trader then claimed that he subsequently made a series of transactions between April 24 and May 8 into various bank accounts shared by the woman and her customer care representatives. The Indian trader claimed he transferred a total of Rs. 31 lakh in multiple transactions. Police begin investigation into the case The trader mentioned that his profile on the website showed his exact balance at the time, a move that further boosted his confidence in the scheme. However, problems started to arise after he tried to withdraw some of his funds, and he was asked to invest more before making any withdrawal. The complainant claimed that after a series of trials without success, he went online to check public perception of the investment, and discovered that he had been using a cloned version of the official CoinEx platform. The trader mentioned that he saw a message that specifically mentioned that the platform was not the “CoinEx official channel.” Upon realizing that he had been scammed , he contacted the cybercrime helpline and was later asked to come in to file an official complaint, attaching bank statements and transaction proofs. Indian police claimed that investigations have started, and they are trying to trace the accused and other operators behind the fraudulent investment website. The cybercrime police mentioned that the case was registered under criminal conspiracy, cheating, and breach of trust under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, along with the charges of the Information Technology Act against an unknown accused. Meanwhile, there have been calls across India urging the government to set up regulations and frameworks that will guide the crypto industry. They are also championing for better measures in place to protect against criminals in the industry.

The announcement was made late Friday, although the publicly listed crypto company insisted that inclusion on its roadmap does not guarantee listing. “This is not an exhaustive list of all assets which we have decided to list,” the company wrote in an accompanying statement. “Trading for assets will only be launched once there is market-making support and sufficient technical infrastructure in place. We will announce the launch of trading on X once these conditions are met.” Aster gains Coinbase recognition after weeks of Binance trading Aster is a decentralized exchange for both perpetual and spot trading, with MEV-free execution on its Simple Mode, and additional features like hidden orders, grid trading, and stock perpetuals for the pro traders. The DEX operates on several blockchain networks, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum. According to data from aggregator DeFiLlama, Aster has processed more than $12.9 billion in cumulative trading volume since inception. Over the past 30 days, the platform registered $5.46 billion in total volume and $325.6 million within the last 24 hours. Its perpetual futures side is attracting the most liquidity from the whole network, with $73.3 billion traded in the past week and $10.8 billion in the most recent 24-hour period. The Aster token was promoted by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who disclosed last Sunday that he had personally purchased the token. In a post on X, CZ said he used his own money to buy $2 million worth of Aster on Binance, telling his followers he is “not a trader” but a “long-term holder.” “I am sure ASTER will surprise many in the coming days. Remember it is trading at more than 50% discount from the recent ATH. ASTER is the only coin CZ bought with his own money besides BTC BNB. There is a hint there,” reckoned one crypto trader on X, adamant the token’s price will rise again in the coming weeks. CZ’s disclosure caused Aster’s price to surge by nearly 35%, climbing from $0.91 to a peak of $1.26 before settling near $1.22 by Tuesday. Cryptopolitan reported that its market capitalization jumped from about $1.8 billion to more than $2.5 billion, while daily trading volume expanded from $224 million to above $2 billion. The DEX token has since shed most of the profits it counted in the “CZ-rally,” dropping below the $1 price range on Wednesday, before retracing its steps back to $1.04 by Saturday. At the time of this reporting, Aster was 6% above its weekly lows, but down 56.7% below its all-time high price of $2.42, reached during its first week of trading. Over the past two months, the Binance founder has referenced the project on several occasions, beginning with a congratulatory post on September 17 celebrating its launch. “Well done. Good start. Keep building,” he wrote at the time. At the risk of stating the obvious: Aster’s per-trade fees are lower (cheaper for users). Lower fees, higher volume. https://t.co/3wbjR2Q5Oh — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) September 29, 2025 He followed up on September 29 with another post comparing Aster’s fee structure to that of its competitors, saying the exchange had “lower fees, higher volume,” which appeared to be a jab at leverage trading DEX Hyperliquid. Listing prospects after Coinbase review While Coinbase has yet to specify a date for Aster’s official listing, the inclusion process precedes an extensive evaluation phase of legal reviews, technical audits, and liquidity assessments. Coinbase’s roadmap updates tend to influence market sentiment, as traders interpret a token’s mention in Coinbase roadmap updates “a guaranteed” listing. But the company has repeatedly stressed that roadmap inclusion is not confirmation of approval. When Coinbase announced support for Celo in September 2020, the token’s price jumped by roughly 32% from about $3.44 to $4.55 within two hours. Moreover, after the exchange confirmed it would list FLOKI, the token’s volume jumped nearly 100%, and the price rose approximately 15% in the following 24 hours. “If we haven’t yet listed a popular asset, it is likely due to various reasons including compliance or integration requirements,” Coinbase said in its statement.

54161275,https://finbold.com/?p=257021,1762592649,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,New Quantum Doomsday Clock sets date when Bitcoin’s encryption will be cracked,https://finbold.com/new-quantum-doomsday-clock-sets-date-when-bitcoins-encryption-will-be-cracked/,"A new online tool, the Quantum Doomsday Clock is predicting that quantum computers will be capable of cracking Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) private keys in about two years. Specifically, the tool has set March 8, 2028, as the critical date to watch. As of November 8, 2025, the clock shows a countdown of 2 years and 4 months remaining until a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) can execute Shor’s algorithm to break ECDSA secp256k1, the elliptic curve standard securing Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies. Quantum Doomsday Clock The project was developed by Dr. Richard Carback, a cryptography researcher and co-founder of the xx network, and Colton Dillion, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, under Postquant Labs and Hadamard Gate Inc. According to the model, approximately 1,673 logical qubits would be sufficient to derive Bitcoin private keys from exposed public keys within a practical timeframe, based on recent academic papers and public quantum hardware roadmaps from IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Google, and others. If realized, this would make Bitcoin addresses that have ever spent funds, revealing public keys, including legacy P2PK and reused P2PKH addresses, instantly vulnerable. Unspent Taproot (bc1p…) and segregated witness addresses would remain secure longer since only their hashes are public. Experts view on cracking Bitcoin code While some experts view the 2028 timeline as aggressive, major institutions including NIST and the Global Risk Institute place a credible quantum threat window between 2028 and 2035. On the other hand, Google researcher Craig Gidney’s 2025 paper suggests that breaking RSA-2048 could require 20 times fewer resources than previously believed, compressing timelines to 2030–2035. Naoris Protocol CEO David Carvalho also warns of potential risks within five years, by 2030. Meanwhile, the Global Risk Institute’s 2024 report, surveying 32 experts, suggested the threat may be closer than previously thought, estimating a 50% chance within 15 years (by 2039) but rising rapidly through the 2030s. On the conservative side, Blockstream CEO Adam Back argued there’s no serious threat for at least two decades, though he acknowledged, as reported by Finbold, that future breakthroughs could force holders to migrate coins to quantum-resistant addresses. Overall, concerns continue to grow amid major quantum computing advances. For instance, IBM plans to debut the world’s first fault-tolerant quantum computer, dubbed Quantum Starling, by 2029, following Google’s 105-qubit Willow chip milestone.

The defendant, Aleksei Olegovich Volkov, also known as “chubaka.kor, faces a maximum penalty of up to 53 years in prison if he is found guilty. According to court records, the Russian acted as the initial access broker for the Yanluowang ransomware group while being a resident in Russia from July 2021 to November 2022. Prosecutors accused Volkov and several unnamed co-conspirators of attacking seven United States businesses during that period, adding that at least two of the United States businesses paid a combined $1.5 million in ransoms. In the court records, prosecutors claimed that victims of the ransomware group included an engineering firm and a bank. They claimed that executives of these firms received harassing phone calls after their networks were hit with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The Yanluowang ransomware group was fingered for the operation, with the prosecutors noting that they stole data belonging to the firms and encrypted it to extort money. Russian national pleads guilty to multiple ransomware activities The court filings for Volkov’s case did not exactly name Cisco, but the enterprise networking and security vendor said it was impacted by an attack that it attributed to Yanluowang ransomware in May 2022. During its investigation, Cisco realized that the credentials of one of its employees were compromised after an attacker gained control of a personal Google account where credentials saved in the victim’s browser were being synchronized. Cisco claimed that the attacker then carried out a series of sophisticated voice phishing attacks under the guise of trusted organizations, attempting to convince the victim to accept multi-factor authentication push notifications initiated by the attacker. After succeeding, the attacker then got access to the VPN in the context of the targeted user. In its report, Cisco claimed that the attack had links to an initial access broker with ties to several ransomware groups, including UNC2447, Lapsus$, and Yanluowang. Prosecutors claimed that the Russian was charged with identifying targets, exploiting vulnerabilities in their systems, and sharing access with co-conspirators for a flat fee or a percentage of the ransom payments made by the victims. Some of the Russian’s victims were unable to function properly without access to some of the data stolen and had to partially halt their operations or shut down permanently in the wake of the attacks, causing hindrance to users. Volkov awaits sentencing amid agreement to pay $9.2 million Prosecutors also claimed the group got $24 million from all seven ransomware victims. The FBI also traced cryptocurrency transactions related to the payments to accounts that were maintained by the Russian and another co-conspirator, CC-1, who they claimed resided in Indianapolis at the time. The FBI was able to confirm Volkov’s identity using blockchain analysis. They were also able to uncover multiple accounts used for communication within the group. In their communication, the group talked about ransomware attacks, payments, and splitting proceeds from their criminal activities. In the unsealed indictment, the Russian was arrested in January 2024 in Rome, where he had been living, and was later extradited to the United States and remains in custody in Indiana. Volkov previously filed an intention to plead guilty in April and agreed to have his case moved to Indiana. The Russian pleaded guilty to six charges, including unlawful transfer of a means of identification, trafficking in access information, access device fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The plea agreement will also see Volkov pay a combined restitution of about $9.2 million to the seven victims.

Recent Dogecoin news shows that the DOGE-1 mission is finally happening. As a result, excitement is building fast in the market. Many traders believe this could be the spark that sends Dogecoin price soaring toward $1. But while Musk’s plans fuel the headlines, real-world crypto projects like Remittix (RTX) are quietly taking off — proving not every moonshot needs a rocket. Dogecoin Price Prediction Eyes The Sky With DOGE-1 Mission Update The Dogecoin price is once again climbing into the spotlight after Elon Musk confirmed that the DOGE-1 lunar mission will launch in late 2025. It’s set to be the first-ever space mission fully funded by cryptocurrency — and that’s huge. The news has reignited optimism that the DOGE price could still make a run toward the $1 mark. According to analysts, Musk’s renewed involvement could again become the rocket fuel for a fresh Dogecoin price prediction rally. Still, the DOGE price today sits around $0.164, fighting to hold its ground. The charts show clear resistance, and big holders remain cautious. On-chain data suggests that some whales are taking profits ahead of the hype. Analysts have listed out two conditions for a Dogecoin breakout to hold. DOGE must reclaim $0.185, and secondly, it must close above its 20-day EMA. If it does, targets around $0.50, and maybe even $1, could come back into play. Real Adoption Takes Off As Remittix Gains Global Traction While Dogecoin price prediction circles around Elon Musk’s upcoming lunar mission, another project is reaching for its own kind of “moon”, one built on real-world impact.

It has lost some traction since then, but still remains above $0.18 as of press time. However, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that the next crucial resistance stands at $0.20, where over 11 million tokens were accumulated. 11.12 billion Dogecoin $DOGE were accumulated around the $0.20 level. This now represents a major area of resistance. pic.twitter.com/nMfksq6z0S — Ali (@ali_charts) November 8, 2025 These accumulation levels are important as investors who had built up positions there could be more inclined to sell under certain conditions. For instance, if the underlying asset had spent some time below them and it finally returns, then they might be opened to cash out at breakeven. Dogecoin’s latest rally came after Bitwise updated its ETF filing, triggering a 20-day automatic effectiveness period by removing the delaying amendment from its S-1 registration. This mimics other crypto ETF applications, such as SOL and XRP, and increases the chances for a launch after these 20 days if the SEC fails to object. Interestingly, Bitwise had a rather intriguing response when asked about comments for the updated DOGE filing, as reported by journalist Eleanor Terrett. NEW: Asked @BitwiseInvest for comment on the updated $DOGE filing. Their official response? “Woof, woof.” Happy Friday! https://t.co/Mu3EQYfatz — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 7, 2025 Perhaps influenced by these positive developments on the ETF front, Dogecoin traders using Binance began to increase their long positions, likely anticipating price rallies if such financial products indeed see the light of day soon.

The company warned that AI-generated videos of its longtime CEO are circulating on YouTube, showing him making statements he never actually said. Respondingly, Buffett, one of the world’s greatest investors, recently made clear his intentions to reach out to those responsible for creating or watching these AI-generated videos of him. He addressed that there is only one Oracle of Omaha. Notably, the “Oracle of Omaha” is a popular nickname for Warren Buffett. AI impersonators have been increasingly focusing on Buffett, popularly known as the “Oracle of Omaha.” His company, however, noted that while the visuals may be convincing, the audio is typically generic and obviously fake. Buffett said fake clips are spreading out of control In a release, “It’s Not Me,” the company singled out a video titled “Warren Buffett: The #1 Investment Tip For Everyone Over 50 (MUST WATCH),” in which an AI-generated voice dispenses investment advice . The company noted that those unfamiliar with Buffett may believe the video to be real. It added, “Mr Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus.” Over the last few months, AI impersonations of public figures have increased. In May, the FBI even reported that criminals had used AI-generated voice calls and texts to pretend to be senior officials, trying to access government employees’ accounts. Additionally, according to a JPMorgan report in July, an individual was led into transferring funds after thinking he was talking with higher-ups via video call; the “leaders” were actually AI-created deepfakes. Buffett has been outspoken before about his frustration with AI impersonators. Weeks before the 2024 election, he warned that his name was being misused in fake endorsements and fraudulent investment pitches. He generally stayed out of politics, having previously supported President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He’s set to step down as Berkshire CEO at the end of the year, and vice chairman Greg Abel will succeed him. Voice cloning advances fast Last year, more than $16.6 billion in losses were attributed to cyber threats and fraud, representing a 33% increase from the previous year. The Identity Theft Resource Centre also flagged a 148% surge in impersonation scams, with criminals now using fake sites, AI bots, and cloned voices to trick victims. Voice cloning has become unnervingly good, McAfee says. Cybercriminals can record just three seconds of audio and reproduce an identical voice in seconds. The majority of respondents in the survey cited by the report, roughly 70%, found it increasingly difficult to distinguish genuine voices from forgeries on the internet. Deloitte also wrote in its report that online cheating websites and tools used by fraudsters are now readily available on the dark web. Furthermore, Advance Direct Scotland also estimates that an AI fraud scam could take less than two minutes to establish. Today, the fraudster’s favorite haunt is the financial sector. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a notice to U.S. banks in November 2024 regarding the rise in synthetic identity fraud. In its report, Deloitte also predicts that fraud losses will reach $40 billion by 2027, up from the $12.3 billion lost in 2023.

There is one project that is starting to stand out of the noise as Q4 2025 approaches a project that many are forecasting could be one of the most promising breakout coins of the year, a DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an ecosystem developer that creates a decentralized lending and borrowing system that aims to make DeFi more effective and transparent. The project combines two mutually supplementary systems, namely, Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets to manage the liquidity flow and the risk management of various types of assets. In its P2C market, assets are deposited by the user on smart contract-driven liquidity pools. Lenders who offer, e.g. ETH or USDT, are given back in forms of the mtTokens. These tokens are used as evidence of deposit and they automatically generate yield when loans are issued off the pool. To take an example, when a user deposits $ 1,000 worth of ETH into a pool with an 8% APY, the mtTokens are the deposited amount plus the earned interest with time. On the borrowing side, the P2P market provides individual user to individual user customized lending. The borrowers have options of variable and stable interest rates based on their requirements and the risk is contained with the use of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation limits. Smaller assets like ETH may have LTVs of a greater amount (70-75%), whereas volatile tokens are limited to more conservative amounts. In case the collateral of a borrower starts to value below a predetermined price, an automatic liquidation system kicks off to safeguard lenders. This two-structure design not only maximizes capital efficiency, but also provides the end-users with increased flexibility in customizing the risk and yield selections – an element that most would argue is a decisive move towards greater decentralization of lending markets. Momentum and Transparency of Allocation This has been among the most consistent performances of 2025 of the project in terms of presale. The token began at $0.01 in Phase 1 and is currently $0.035 in Phase 6 which is a 250% increase in value to early adopters. Each presale phase is based on a fixed-pricing and fixed-allocating strategy so that a phase does not advance until the last phase sells out. Mutuum Finance has raised over $18.4 million so far and has more than 17,850 holders all over the globe. Of the 4 billion total number of tokens supplied, 45.5% or approximately 1.82 billion tokens are to be reserved for presale. The aim of this allocation system was to make sure that there is extensive community involvement as opposed to having the ownership concentrated. One of the most notable aspects is the 24 hour leader board of the project in which the highest contributor of the day has to be rewarded with MUTM tokens valued at $500. Such a system encourages participation and provides a transparent system that forms constant anticipation regarding the presale. Future V1 Launch and Approved Security Among the most expected steps on the roadmap of the project is the launch of the V1 protocol. The release will be the first version of the decentralized lending/borrowing platform developed by Mutuum and will be live on Q4 2025 on the Sepolia testnet. It has core elements such as the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot to make risk management automation possible. Another important subject on which Mutuum Finance has earned a great reputation is security. The project has already been CertiK audited with an impressive 90/100TokenScan score – which is a strong indicator of the reliability of smart-contracts and the management of risk. In addition to that, the team has a $50,000 bug bounty program to motivate disclosing possible code vulnerabilities ethically prior to the mainnet launch. The developments have made MUTM one of the most promising cryptocurrencies to watch out for by 2026 according to some analysts. It is often remarked how the protocol progresses into protocols out of testnet phase and into presale will turn it into functionality, which is a crucial element that tends to lead to additional investor confidence waves. Utility-Driven Tokenomics The buy-and-distribute mechanism of Mutuum Finance provides that some of the platform fee should be spent acquiring MUTM tokens in the open market. The purchased tokens are subsequently redistributed to the participants that place their mtTokens in the safety module. This cycle does not only facilitate recurrent buy pressure but also reward those who contribute towards the protocol security. This is what made this model unique to tokens because the value of the token is not only based on the activity of the platform. The increased lending and borrowing activity contributes to a higher revenue stream that sustains tokens buyback and staking rewards, which will continue to stabilize even in the long term. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Growth The roadmap of the development of Mutuum Finance also involves the intention to release the USD-pegged stablecoin and the implementation of Layer 2, two aspects that analysts can assume can bring the project to another level in scale and interoperability. The stablecoin will be completely on-demand minted and burned supported by platform liquidity and collateral. At the same time, the Layer-2 expansion will help to reduce transaction costs, enhance scalability, and potentially expand Mutuum Finance products to other networks. Such a move would make it more welcomed by both retail users and institutions, making the platform potentially one of the leading competitors in DeFi crypto. According to commentators on the market, as these features are combined, MUTM could have a multi-hundred-percent growth window when the testnet goes online. This has been estimated to experience an upside of up to 500-800% in case the market is good because it has low entry price and it has good fundamentals. When most of the established cryptocurrencies have moved laterally during this year, one of the few DeFi projects that are experiencing actual traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It has acquired both early retail investors and strategic capital through audited security, a working roadmap, an active presale, and tokenomics that are geared towards long-term growth. With the crypto industry already on the verge of another growth wave, yield-generating mechanics, increasing liquidity, and an easily accessible presale model make MUTM one of the most successful cryptocurrencies to watch in Q4 2025.

This is highlighted by crypto analyst MMBTtrader, who explained that the Ethereum price crash could be coming to an end. This is evidenced by a number of formations on the Ethereum price chart that suggest where the next lift-off might begin. Ethereum Price Is Testing The Next Major Support In an analysis shared on the TradingView website, the crypto analyst explained that the Ethereum price is now testing the next crucial technical level. The importance of this level comes with a 50% retracement of the Fibonacci sequence. Thus, it means that the Ethereum price is seeing major support at this level. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Is Important If Wave 5 Corrects To $94,000 This support lies just above the $3,200 level, which the Ethereum price had managed to maintain through the market crash. This puts the critical level at the 0.5 Fibonacci support, which currently serves as the next make-or-break level for the cryptocurrency. If the Ethereum price is able to bounce off from here, then it could trigger the next wave of recoveries for the cryptocurrency. Not only that, it would be the signal that the bottom is finally in and the crash is over. The analyst further explains that this could lead to “a high-probability setup for a resumption of the primary bullish trend.” Such a breakout would lead to a rather strong bullish move for the digital asset, and the target from here would be a brand new all-time high. The first target from here would be $5,500 as bulls push the price higher. “This target is derived from the magnitude of the prior uptrend and represents a key resistance zone on the higher timeframes,” the analyst explained. The Bearish Side Of The Coin The 0.5 Fibonacci level, as explained above, is a make-or-break level. This means that whichever direction the Ethereum price takes after hitting this level could determine where the cryptocurrency is headed next. With the bullish side already explored, there is still the possibility that Ethereum fails to establish support and a bottom. Related Reading: BlackRock Exec Drops Trillion-Dollar Revelation At Ripple Swell, But Is XRP Ready? In the event of the Ethereum price actually breaking below this crucial level, then it would confirm the bearish pressure that has plagued the market. The analyst highlights on the chart that if the support breaks, then Ethereum could dump further below $3,000, with the major support lying just above $2,400. Such a decline would mean an over 30% crash for Ethereum, on top of the already struggling price. Therefore, it is imperative that bulls hold above $3,200 to prevent further decline.

Despite these short-term fluctuations and ETH’s overall monthly decline, analysts remain optimistic about the asset’s long-term prospects. Ali Martinez, for example, noted that the largest altcoin can indeed break past $5,000 and skyrocket to the next major milestone of $10,000. To do so, though, it might need to plunge once again and clear out the weak hands.

Data from FarSide shows that seven out of the last eight trading days have been deep in the red. In fact, the only green day was November 6, and it saw very modest net inflows of just $12.5 million. In contrast, $219.4 million was pulled out on November 4, preceded by another $135.7 million on Monday. Overall, the net outflows for the week stand at $507.7 million. What’s particularly worrying about this trend is that BlackRock’s ETF, which is the largest of the bunch, has seen the lion’s share of net outflows. They started on October 30 with $118 million taken out, followed by $38.6 million on October 31, $81.7 million on November 3, $111.1 million on November 4, and a whopping $146.6 million on November 5. Nevertheless, ETHA investors changed their tune on November 6 with a modest $8 million in net inflows, followed by a more impressive $34.4 million on Friday. Fidelity’s FETH ended the business week with a substantial net outflow of $72.2 million, which only intensified the withdrawals from the previous days.

If approved, the Zurich and New York-based financial firm would become the first US asset manager to launch a leveraged ETF tracking a DeFi protocol’s perpetual market performance. Spot XRP ETF filing spree in ‘dark November’ Much like 21Shares, several companies have made changes to their previous S-1 filings within the last 2 weeks to cut short the approval process of the SEC. Franklin Templeton recently listed its XRP ETF on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website under the ticker XRPZ. Cryptopolitan reported the listing early Friday, though the move is preparatory and does not indicate SEC approval or active trading. Grayscale Investments also adjusted its XRP ETF filings last week, while Bitwise submitted an 8(a) filing with the SEC for a spot Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF on Friday. The filing comes after the SEC delayed Bitwise’s application in June, following a separate postponement of Grayscale’s DOGE Trust filing. Bitwise’s S-1 and 19b-4 forms revealed DOGE is the primary asset for the fund, with its Net Asset Value (NAV) calculated based on the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price. Bitwise has experience successfully launching crypto ETFs, including its staking Solana product, which has attracted over $500 million in assets. According to Balchunas, the Dogecoin ETF could begin trading within the next 20 days if the SEC allows the automatic approval process to run its course. The SEC introduced general listing standards in mid-September for spot crypto ETFs, cutting review periods from 240 days to just 75 days. The regulatory adjustments have come under the watch of new chair Paul Atkins, who is part of the changes the US President Donald Trump’s administration touted to front it pro-crypto policies. The US financial watchdog under former chair Gary Gensler had only greenlighted spot crypto ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but asset managers are now using much favorable conditions and laws to extend their offerings to tokens like Solana, XRP, and assets from the derivatives trading platform Hyperliquid. XRP is currently trading at $2.32 on Bitstamp, climbing 4.2% in the last 24 hours, although it has lost over 7% of its value over the week, according to early Saturday updates from CoinGecko.

Recent on-chain analytics reveal a clear divergence between speculative trading tokens and long-term accumulation when searching for the best crypto to buy. At the present time, three assets stand out as the best altcoins to buy now — Digitap ($TAP) , Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Celestia (TIA) — each attracting consistent large wallet inflows. For investors seeking exposure to upcoming crypto presale opportunities and early-stage alpha, these names reflect where institutional and whale money is moving. Digitap ($TAP) : World’s First Omni Bank With Global Accessibility. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Institutional-Grade DeFi Liquidity Celestia (TIA): Modular Blockchain Scalability Gains. 1. Digitat: World’s First Omni Bank With Global Accessibility Digitap has become one of the most-watched crypto presale projects. The omni bank’s ability to integrate CeFi and DeFi in one dashboard is drawing early comparisons to PayPal’s early disruption of traditional finance, with a full suite of financial services including payments, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Due to this utility, Digitap has seen $1.4M in whale investment across 104M sold coins, in just two months. The $TAP price is currently $0.0297, an 80% discount from its $0.14 launch price. Whales are already leveraging this price to build low-cost exposure ahead of launch. Moreover, 50% of Digitap’s platform profits are allocated to token burns and staking rewards, a model appealing to institutional participants focused on long-term yield. A zero-KYC model ensures that the product is globally accessible, and the app is already available on iOS and Android. With capital flowing into smart-finance infrastructure, Digitap’s delivery places it among the best crypto to buy now, particularly for investors seeking to hedge against speculative volatility with real-use adoption. The fact that the product is already live, downloadable from Google and Apple stores, is partially why smart money is reallocating capital to this fintech disruptor. 2. Ondo Finance: Institutional-Grade DeFi Liquidity While newer tokens dominate the retail spotlight, whales have steadily accumulated Ondo Finance throughout Q4. The protocol tokenizes traditional financial assets — such as U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds — on the blockchain, giving investors DeFi access to real-world yields. This bridge between regulated finance and Web3 liquidity explains why fund addresses have increased their Ondo exposure, as it has an institutional focus. The growth in Ondo’s on-chain activity correlates directly with rising stablecoin inflows, suggesting a rotation toward yield-backed assets rather than speculative coins. Ondo’s focus on security, compliance, and transparent income streams differentiates it from typical altcoins to buy during bullish phases. Instead, it fits within the emerging DeFi 2.0 narrative, where real-world assets become the dominant driver of long-term growth. For investors looking at whale data, Ondo’s accumulation trend aligns with strategic capital behavior focusing on yield, regulated access, and efficiency. 3. Celestia: Modular Blockchain Scalability Gains Celestia continues to attract attention as a modular blockchain network solving scalability limits faced by legacy L1s. On-chain analysis shows that several large wallets linked to VC funds and early Ethereum participants have been accumulating. This accumulation coincides with Celestia’s expansion and integration into multiple rollup frameworks for large-scale app development. Celestia’s modular architecture allows developers to launch independent blockchains without relying on a single layer — a paradigm shift that could mirror Ethereum’s DeFi boom in 2020. Institutional wallets appear to be positioning ahead of anticipated mainnet upgrades and new protocols that could expand TIA’s utility. As one of the best altcoins to buy now, Celestia bridges infrastructure innovation with whale-backed momentum. The combination of strong developer activity, increasing on-chain liquidity, and VC accumulation suggests continued price resilience as the market rotates toward utility tokens. Why Whales Are Moving Early The current rotation marks the transition from risk aversion to selective buys, with whales favoring projects demonstrating utility and yield. Across metrics, Digitap, Ondo Finance, and Celestia reflect unique propositions that align with the new investment logic — revenue-based tokenomics, market integrations, and modular scaling. Digitap’s model remains particularly strong among altcoins to buy, as it integrates DeFi and CeFi through one unified, globally accessible superapp. Its crypto presale still offers early entry before secondary market demand. Meanwhile, Ondo’s real-world yields and Celestia’s modular design provide stability for institutional investors. For investors tracking on-chain flows, these tokens stand at the convergence of liquidity migration and technological progress, the same indicators that have historically preceded large market expansions. $TAP: The Best Altcoin To Buy Today? Whales have been pivoting to Digitap , Ondo, and Celestia for various reasons. But the best crypto to buy today is undoubtedly $TAP. It aims to disrupt a trillion-dollar payment industry as a live omni bank with a full suite of services, a delivered application, and a Visa-compatible card. Its early stage status means it has a far higher chance of securing a 100x return than other contenders, as the best altcoin to buy today. This can be observed based on whale inflows, which seek out utility coins with strong fundamentals. Smart money is investing in fintech crypto presales like Digitap, and the data doesn't lie.

Here, we delve into the characteristics and future potential of these top contenders. The Leading Altcoins Backed by Whale Investments The current market dynamics point towards three altcoins that are heavily favored by institutional and large private investors based on recent on-chain data: Digitap ($TAP), Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Celestia (TIA). These cryptocurrencies are not just benefiting from random spikes in interest but are seeing sustained inflows from these large wallets. 1. Digitap: Revolutionizing Banking Accessibility Worldwide Digitap stands out as a groundbreaking omni-bank poised to disrupt traditional banking systems by seamlessly integrating centralized and decentralized financial services. This new-age financial platform has garnered a staggering $1.4 million from whale investments, underscoring its appeal to savvy investors. The platform's utility spans comprehensive financial services, much like what PayPal offered in its early days. This extensive utility is complemented by the platform's strategic tokenomics, with 50% of its profits directed towards token burns and staking rewards, enhancing its attractiveness to long-term investors. Digital's product has already launched and is accessible globally, reflecting its potential for widespread adoption and substantial returns on investment. 2. Ondo Finance: Bridging DeFi and Traditional Assets Ondo Finance has made a name for itself in the DeFi space by providing liquidity solutions that bridge conventional financial markets with decentralized finance, offering access to real-world yields through blockchain technology. This innovative approach has led to a significant whale-driven accumulation of ONDO tokens, especially as the protocol focuses on tokenizing safe assets like U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds. 3. Celestia: Pioneering Modular Blockchain Solutions Celestia is gaining traction as a modular blockchain that promises to solve scalability issues that have long plagued legacy blockchain architectures. The involvement of high-profile venture capital funds and early Ethereum backers further corroborates its robust future potential. This altcoin's approach to independent blockchain deployment without the need for foundational layers offers a scalable solution that is attractive for developing extensive, decentralized applications. Strategic Insights Behind Whale Movements Understanding why whales are gravitating towards these particular altcoins sheds light on broader market trends. These investments are not just about capitalizing on short-term gains but are targeted towards projects with durable utilities, robust market strategies, and substantial growth potential. Each of these platforms, from Digitap's innovative banking solutions to Celestia's scalable blockchain infrastructure, presents a unique value proposition that aligns with the strategic investment behaviors of large-scale investors. Conclusion For those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, considering where the smart money is headed could be a prudent strategy. Digitap, Ondo, and Celestia offer compelling reasons for their favored status among whales, highlighting their potential for significant impact and returns in the cryptocurrency markets.

54162572,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88996,1762596027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple (XRP) vs. New Crypto Token: Which Is the Best Crypto to Hold Through 2026?,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-vs-new-crypto-token-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-hold/,"Every crypto market cycle sees older giants challenged by new entrants promising stronger fundamentals and higher growth potential. Ripple (XRP) has long been one of the most recognized names in the industry, but after years of slow progress and limited upside, some investors are turning their attention to new decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Analysts suggest this shift reflects growing demand for utility-driven projects that could deliver both yield and scalability, traits often missing in legacy tokens. Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is currently trading near $2.20, with a market cap of roughly $121 billion, keeping it among the top ten cryptocurrencies globally. The token’s primary function remains tied to cross-border payments, where Ripple Labs aims to offer faster and cheaper settlement solutions for financial institutions. However, XRP’s price performance has been underwhelming compared to its peak years. Despite brief rallies during bullish phases, the token has repeatedly struggled to sustain momentum. Key resistance levels are observed near $2.50 and $2.70, with short-term supports forming around $2.05. Analysts note that XRP’s large supply, more than 100 billion tokens, makes it difficult to produce large percentage gains without massive inflows of capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While XRP faces structural challenges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a newer approach to crypto finance. The project is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform built around transparency, efficiency, and sustainability. Users will be able to lend digital assets to earn passive income or borrow against their holdings without giving up ownership, all governed by automated smart contracts. Mutuum Finance’s ecosystem features its own liquidity pools, with participants receiving mtTokens, ERC-20 interest-bearing tokens that automatically accrue yield as borrowers use the liquidity. The platform also incorporates a buy-and-distribute model, where a share of protocol fees is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, and those purchased tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. The MUTM presale has been one of 2025’s standout events. The token started at $0.01 in Phase 1 and has now reached $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a nearly 300% increase. Over 17,850 holders have joined so far, and the project has raised $18.5 million, with 800 million tokens sold. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 1.82 billion (45.5%) are reserved for presale, a structure that prioritizes community participation and transparency. XRP vs. MUTM When it comes to long-term price growth, the contrast between XRP and MUTM is becoming increasingly clear. Analysts believe XRP may have already achieved most of its major upside potential during previous cycles. With its large supply and mature market position, expectations for 2026 are modest. Many analysts see XRP’s price remaining between $2.50 and $3.20, representing minimal upside from current levels. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is still in its early stages, giving it far more room to grow. At its current price of $0.035, even moderate adoption of its DeFi lending model could result in major appreciation. Some market commentators project that once the V1 launch goes live and mainnet follows in 2026, the token could move toward $0.25 to $0.30, representing a potential 7x to 8x increase from current prices. In a bullish market scenario, projections show an even stronger upside extending into the $1–$2 range by 2028. What makes these forecasts realistic, according to analysts, is Mutuum Finance’s clear use case, token buybacks tied to lending activity, and a transparent economic structure, unlike XRP, whose future growth depends heavily on institutional partnerships. Strength Through Security and Engagement Mutuum Finance has placed a heavy emphasis on security from the start. The project recently completed a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 TokenScan score — a strong sign of reliability in the DeFi sector. The team also operates a $50,000 bug bounty program to identify and resolve potential vulnerabilities before the mainnet rollout. Another standout feature is Mutuum’s 24-hour leaderboard, a system that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This approach encourages constant participation and transparency, keeping investor engagement high throughout the presale period. In addition, on-chain data has shown increasing whale allocations, large individual purchases of MUTM tokens during recent weeks. This trend often signals growing institutional or high-net-worth investor confidence ahead of major milestones like the V1 protocol launch. The Path Ahead While Ripple’s position in the global payments space is secure, its limited upside and slow growth make it less appealing for investors seeking higher returns. Its reliance on external partnerships and regulatory progress has kept the token from achieving major breakthroughs despite years of development. By comparison, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the market with developing utility, transparency, and growth potential all aligned. Its V1 launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 will introduce live lending and borrowing functions using ETH and USDT as initial assets. From there, the project plans to expand support to additional tokens and integrate new revenue features, including its planned stablecoin and Layer-2 scaling, aimed at improving liquidity and lowering transaction costs. If the roadmap continues as planned, many analysts believe MUTM could evolve into one of the potential best cryptocurrencies to invest in for 2026, as it combines early-stage accessibility with strong fundamentals and audited smart-contract security.

This possible bear cycle follows more than five years of trading within a long-term upward channel that began after the March 9, 2020 COVID flash crash, according to insights from TradingShot shared in a TradingView post on November 7. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analyst highlighted key technical indicators confirming this shift. Notably, XRP recently broke below the 50-week moving average (MA), a critical support line that has historically marked trend continuation or reversal points. Last month’s flash crash briefly touched the 100-week moving average before recovering, mirroring price behavior observed in previous bear cycles. At the same time, XRP’s July 14, 2025 all-time high coincided with the 2.5 Fibonacci extension level, matching the previous cycle’s peak from April 2021. Similar weekly RSI patterns and the recent 1W MA50 breach strongly suggest a bearish phase is underway. Historical precedent indicates that such patterns often lead to sharp downward moves. XRP next price levels to watch Now, according to TradingShot , XRP could target the $0.90 level, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous bear cycle and the 1M MA100. A potential entry point for long positions may emerge when the weekly RSI approaches oversold territory below 30, signaling a possible bottom. Bearish sentiment is further supported by whale transactions signaling possible large-scale selling. On-chain data tracked by Whale Alert indicates that over the past 24 hours, more than 190 million XRP, worth roughly $448 million, moved between Gemini and unknown wallets. Such large transfers often signal potential market activity, fueling speculation that XRP’s price could see short-term volatility as traders react to institutional positioning. This bearish sentiment comes even as Ripple continues to make notable deals . In this case, Ripple has announced a $500 million strategic investment at a $40 billion valuation, backed by top institutional investors including Citadel, Fortress, and Pantera Capital. The funding follows a record year and a $1 billion tender offer, with Ripple also repurchasing over 25% of its shares. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.31, up over 4% in the past 24 hours, though it has plunged over 7% in the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP’s current price remains well below both the 50-day SMA ($2.65) and 200-day SMA ($2.65), confirming strong bearish momentum. The token is in a clear downtrend, having lost support from these key moving averages. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 43.51 is neutral, neither oversold nor overbought, indicating no immediate exhaustion in selling pressure but also no strong bullish reversal signal yet.

54163842,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89010,1762599531,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Software Engineer: Core Purpose of XRP Ledger In Institutional Settlement,https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-core-purpose-of-xrp-ledger-in-institutional-settlement/,"A recent post by Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a respected software engineer and crypto expert, has prompted renewed focus on the purpose of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Many assume the network was designed for routine consumer transactions, but Van Code’s detailed explanation indicates a different picture that aligns closely with Ripple’s institutional goals . In his post, he noted that people often believe XRPL is meant “so you can pay for a coffee and the transaction pops up on XRPL.” He explained that this perception misses the core function of the ledger. Rather than facilitating hundreds of small purchases each day, XRPL was created for fast, low-cost movement of funds between banks, payment providers, and large financial institutions. Torpedo of truth: Many people assume the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is built so you can pay for a coffee and the transaction pops up on XRPL. That’s not the primary mission. XRPL was engineered for high-speed, low-cost settlement and liquidity flows between financial… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) November 6, 2025 Institutional Efficiency Over Retail Transactions Van Code emphasized that XRPL’s architecture was “engineered for high-speed, low-cost settlement and liquidity flows between financial institutions.” This statement highlights why the network stands out in an industry that often focuses on consumer-level adoption. Its infrastructure supports the volume and velocity necessary for cross-border transactions , rather than the minute processing of everyday retail payments. To illustrate the concept, Van Code used a hypothetical scenario involving U.S. travelers spending around $18,000 in Japan through card transactions. Instead of recording each of the 200 small purchases individually on the ledger, he described a system where financial institutions handle those internally and later perform one or a few XRPL transactions to balance the day’s liquidity. This approach demonstrates the practical application of XRP as a settlement layer rather than a payment processor for each transaction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How This Supports XRP’s Role in Global Finance Van Code’s example captures the appeal of XRP in global settlement. The ability to process a high-value transaction on-chain within seconds and at minimal cost gives financial entities a reliable tool for managing liquidity and foreign exchange conversions. In his explanation, he noted that such settlements might involve converting “USD holdings into a USD-backed stable-coin (e.g., RLUSD) on XRPL, maybe then into XRP and/or into a Japanese-yen stable-token.” This chain of conversion highlights XRP’s utility as a bridge asset , enabling efficient movement between different currencies and stable-value tokens. Positioning for Real-World Adoption Van Code concluded that XRPL’s “real strength” lies in “moving big chunks of value quickly and efficiently between institutions.” His remarks help clarify the network’s direction and address misconceptions about its scope. While retail use cases remain possible, the ecosystem’s growth trajectory continues to favor institutional-grade operations.

The debate began when Tradeship University founder Cameron Scrubs urged followers to sell all their other crypto assets and buy XRP.

He reignited that vision this week, telling investors to sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash, and Dogecoin — essentially, “sell everything” — and move into XRP. The statement quickly went viral, drawing reactions from multiple crypto communities. X user Caspian responded, saying it wasn’t meant literally. He added that the point was to align belief with action — if investors truly see value in XRP, they should act with conviction. “Own your stack, protect it, and stay ready,” he wrote.

Buy XRP. — vibhu (@vibhu) November 7, 2025 ‘Sell Your House, Bed, Kids, And Buy XRP’ Vibhu Norby joined the thread with satire. He joked, “Sell your house, bed, kids, cardboard box, clothes, and buy XRP,” making it clear he was mocking the hype rather than endorsing it. Another user, Slorg, claimed he had already gone all in and asked what step to take next. Norby replied that the next move was to wait for major firms like BlackRock and Mastercard to tokenize trillions in assets, potentially sending XRP to $1,000. Despite the humor, the exchange highlighted the community’s real optimism about institutional involvement and the possibility of massive price growth. Ripple Funding And Institutional Moves Ripple added fuel to the discussion by announcing a $500 million funding round at its Swell 2025 event. Investors included Galaxy Digital, Fortress, Brevan Howard, and Pantera Capital. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the investment confirmed faith in a business “built on the foundation of XRP.” Reports also showed Ripple partnered with Mastercard to use RLUSD on XRPL for fiat settlement, while Ripple Prime is integrating XRP for institutional transfers. These developments gave long-term holders more reason to stay confident in XRP. Holding XRP is the hardest part because conviction gets tested in every wave of volatility. But when you understand the fundamentals, the liquidity infrastructure @Ripple is building and how $XRP underpins the next phase of global settlement, patience becomes your leverage. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 5, 2025 Holding XRP Challenges Investor Conviction Meanwhile, Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, acknowledges that it is a constant emotional struggle holding XRP. He explains how investor patience is tested in every market cycle, and the challenge of remaining dedicated to your investment when the price moves materially can be one of the hardest things to do as an XRP holder.

For some of them, the “sell your house” comments are simply an exaggeration, but it showcases the passion and belief of the XRP community, which has planned and endorsed their position, and has continued to show the strength of their will no matter how volatile XRP price action has remained.

But amid such turbulence, a unique case is emerging: the token XRP appears to be charting its own path —one less anchored in frenzy and more grounded in utility and network integrity. Research-Backed Bubble Analysis Noted crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted academic findings that place XRP in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum when it comes to bubble formation. SMQKE cited studies showing that Bitcoin and Ethereum displayed classic signs of speculative bubbles under rational-bubble models, while XRP did not. For example, in a 2018 study, researchers observed significant bubble behavior in Bitcoin and Ethereum but found none in XRP. Further analysis using the ARDL model found that macroeconomic developments significantly impacted Bitcoin’s value but had a negligible effect on XRP’s price trajectory. XRP SHOWS NO SIGNS OF A VALUE BUBBLE AS RIPPLE TECHNOLOGY OUTSHINES BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM Documented. pic.twitter.com/hYt6hM5SuM — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 7, 2025 Utility vs. Speculation: The Fundamental Difference A key reason for XRP’s differing profile lies in its use case . The token is embedded in the Ripple Labs ecosystem and used as a bridge currency for cross-border settlement and institutional corridors. This utility orientation reduces reliance on speculative narrative. By contrast, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been driven in large part by narratives of store-of-value or decentralized finance speculation, which often amplify bubble risk. The existence of multiple empirical papers on speculative herding and price explosivity in crypto supports this view. Implications for Investors and Markets For market participants, this distinction matters. If a token like XRP is less subject to speculative excess, then its upside may be less volatile—but possibly more sustainable. That said, the absence of detected bubbles does not mean there is no risk. All crypto assets remain exposed to regulatory shocks, protocol risks, and macro contagion.

In June 2025, XRP’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio rose to 280, then dropped below 110. This suggests the token’s price was temporarily disconnected from its actual usage. Still, when valuations align with usage instead of hype, the probability of a speculative blow-off event appears lower. To simplify, XRP’s value behaves differently from many other major cryptocurrencies, according to SMQKE’s analysis and other research. The token shows fewer of the red flags associated with speculative bubbles, likely because its value is more closely tied to utility and network architecture. For crypto analysts and investors who prioritize structural strength over fear of missing out, that difference is significant.

XRP has spent the past few weeks consolidating in a tight range, building trader confidence and signaling stability. With rising institutional interest, this steady accumulation sets the stage for a potential breakout, echoing patterns that have historically preceded major crypto rallies. VOGs identifies $3.50 as a key target for XRP, suggesting that a breakout above this level could signal a new upward trend. Notably, XRP is trading around $2.31, drawing keen attention from both retail and institutional investors. With momentum building, a push toward $3.50 may be just around the corner. Nasdaq CEO Highlights Blockchain’s Potential to Unlock Trapped Capital At the recent Ripple Swell conference, Nasdaq CEO Diana delivered a compelling message about the transformative power of blockchain in modern finance. “Trillions in capital are trapped, blockchain can set it free,” she stated , drawing attention to inefficiencies in the current financial system. Diana emphasized that the existing financial plumbing, the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that moves money globally, is slow, fragmented, and laden with intermediaries. From cross-border transactions to corporate treasury operations, the process is often bogged down by delays, fees, and a lack of transparency. According to her, this results in enormous amounts of capital effectively “locked up,” unable to flow freely to areas where it could generate economic value. “The challenge isn’t a lack of capital,” Diana explained, “it’s how that capital moves through the system. There’s just so much trapped, waiting to be utilized more efficiently.” She argued that by leveraging blockchain technology, financial institutions could streamline these processes, reduce intermediaries, and increase liquidity. Blockchain’s inherent features, decentralization, transparency, and real-time settlement, allow for more direct movement of assets across borders and institutions. This could potentially unlock trillions of dollars currently tied up in slow or opaque processes. For businesses and investors, the implications are significant: faster payments, lower costs, and more efficient capital allocation could drive growth and innovation across industries. Diana also highlighted Ripple’s role in pioneering blockchain solutions for financial institutions, noting that scalable blockchain networks could provide the infrastructure necessary for global capital mobility. By implementing digital assets and blockchain-based settlement systems, banks and corporations could access liquidity in ways previously thought impossible, bringing a new level of efficiency to global finance. The Nasdaq CEO’s comments underscore a growing consensus in the financial world: blockchain is not just a speculative tool but a foundational technology capable of reshaping capital flows. If implemented thoughtfully, it could release trapped capital, empower businesses, and redefine how value moves around the world. As Diana concluded, “If we do it right, we can actually deliver more capital to the system.” Her remarks signal a pivotal moment for both traditional finance and the blockchain ecosystem, pointing to a future where money moves faster, smarter, and more transparently than ever before. Conclusion Trading near $2.30 with solid support and rising ETF speculation, XRP is poised for a potential breakout toward $3.50. Strong technicals, growing institutional interest, and market accumulation signal that its next move could set the tone for the months ahead, making it a focal point for bullish investors. At Ripple Swell, Fredman emphasizes a pivotal moment for global finance. Blockchain can unlock trillions in trapped capital, boost liquidity, and drive faster economic growth by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional systems. Beyond speed and transparency, it has the power to reshape how money moves, creating a more efficient, inclusive, and dynamic financial ecosystem. Thoughtful implementation could transform not just transactions, but the very flow of global capital.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-08 11:11:23

Revenues of $972,900 increased 10% from Q2 but remained below 2023’s $4.1 million annual total. Bitcoin’s decline since September 30 positions Trump Media for another Q4 loss. The Trump family’s broader exposure includes World Liberty Financial’s $5.76 billion in holdings and Official Trump Meme’s $6.30 billion in holdings. Notably, Trump Media has also recently announced expansion into prediction markets with Crypto.com. Critical Support Level Determines Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin tests the 50-week EMA at $100,887, a moving average that has provided support in three previous bull market instances. The 780% advance from $15,000 to $132,000 over 24-35 months approaches the duration of a late-stage bull market. Secondary support ranges from $95,000 to $97,000, with major support at $85,000 to $90,000. Valuation metrics indicate that Bitcoin is 19% above its fair value. Whale accumulation patterns indicate consolidation expectations. Resistance emerges at $106,000, $110,000, and $120,000. Source: X/@fuelkek A successful defense of $100,000 support enables recovery toward $106,000-$110,000, followed by a possible advance toward $120,000-$150,000 over 2025-2026. However, a breakdown below $98,000 accelerates the decline toward $90,000 to $95,000. The near-term trajectory involves volatility between $95,000 and $110,000. Polymarket assigns a 48% probability to Bitcoin reaching seven figures first.

Meme coins have repeatedly rewritten the rules of the market, from Dogecoin’s pop culture takeover to Shiba Inu’s viral surge. Now, a new contender, MoonBull ($MOBU crypto), is lighting up the charts as the next breakout star. Alongside giants like Shiba Inu (SHIB), BullZilla (BZIL), La Culex (CULEX), Apeing (APEING), Dogecoin (DOGE), and the quirky Peanut the Squirrel (PEANUT), MoonBull is catching serious attention from crypto enthusiasts everywhere. While meme coins thrive on energy and community, MoonBull’s presale is already setting itself apart with innovation, high staking rewards, and strategic safeguards for holders. It’s not just another hype token; it’s the next 1000x crypto where real utility meets viral momentum. But what makes it so different? Let’s dive in. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): The 100X Meme Coin Offering Massive Gains MoonBull leads as a 100x meme coin that fuses excitement with structure. Designed for both seasoned investors and newcomers, MoonBull crypto offers transparent tokenomics, a fair launch system, and an ecosystem that rewards participation. Built on Ethereum’s reliable framework, it’s engineered for growth, security, and accessibility. From referral rewards to liquidity locks, every layer of $MOBU crypto has been fine-tuned to prevent volatility and encourage steady expansion. Its rapidly growing community and strategic presale stages prove that this isn’t a passing trend; it’s the best crypto presale of 2025 in full motion. MoonBull’s standout features are what truly fuel its explosive potential. At Stage 10 of the presale, it introduces a staking program offering a fixed 95% APY; an unheard-of rate in the meme coin space. Holders can stake directly through the MoonBull dashboard, with daily reward calculations and a simple 2-month lock-in. A colossal $14.6 billion $MOBU pool supports this system, ensuring long-term consistency. Once the presale ends, liquidity will be locked for 48 hours, and all presale tokens will be immediately fully claimable. The claim-delay safeguard protects holders for the first hour after launch; every sell requires a buy, keeping the token price from dropping below launch level. Altogether, this structure blends flexibility, fairness, and protection, making MoonBull presale one of the top cryptos to buy today before prices surge. MoonBull Presale Live Now: Stage 6 Heating Up with Over $550K Raised The MoonBull presale is already turning heads across the crypto scene, and it’s moving fast. Now in Stage 6, tokens are priced at $0.00008388, with over $550,000 raised and 1,900 holders joining the movement. Early investors are sitting on 235.52% ROI, with potential gains exceeding 7,244% at the listing price of $0.00616. Every stage brings a 27.40% price jump until Stage 22 and a 20.38% rise in the final Stage 23. Picture this: an investment of $1,250 at today’s price earns 14,902,241 tokens worth $91,797 at listing. The clock is ticking, and as stages climb, entry gets pricier. Miss this phase, and the subsequent surge may leave latecomers chasing green candles instead of riding them. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Doge Rival That Created a Movement Shiba Inu began as a playful experiment but has since evolved into a massive ecosystem with decentralized exchanges, NFTs, and a robust burn mechanism. Its loyal community transformed SHIB into a legitimate digital asset rather than a meme joke. With new projects like Shibarium expanding its utility, SHIB’s presence in DeFi continues to grow, proving it’s more than nostalgia. Shiba Inu remains in this lineup because it inspired an entire generation of meme-driven tokens that now fuel the altcoin surge. 3. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Community Beast With Long-Term Vision BullZilla storms into 2025 with unmatched community energy. The token emphasizes strength, growth, and diamond-hand culture, as reflected in its name. It blends hype with real-world applications, including NFT integrations and metaverse tie-ins, attracting both traders and collectors. Its tokenomics encourage holding, while liquidity injections ensure smoother trading. BullZilla earns its spot here for showing how power, persistence, and participation can build sustainable meme-coin momentum that rivals the early DOGE days. 4. La Culex ($CULEX): The Meme Coin Buzzing With Innovation La Culex injects humor into utility, delivering a lighthearted take on decentralized finance while introducing gamified staking. With unique branding inspired by a mosquito motif, it turns community growth into a viral event. Holders enjoy reward systems that promote continuous engagement and liquidity reinforcement. The team’s creative marketing has sparked global attention, making CULEX a refreshing and promising token in the meme coin lineup. 5. Apeing Crypto: The Wildest Upcoming Crypto of 2025 Apeing is swinging into the spotlight as one of the best upcoming crypto to buy before its explosive upcoming meme coin presale. Blending pop culture, NFTs, and blockchain innovation, Apeing is already making noise among upcoming crypto projects in 2025. Its vibrant community, dynamic roadmap, and limited supply make it a top contender in the race for upcoming crypto coins in 2025, poised to skyrocket once it officially launches and hits major exchanges. 6. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Pioneer That Started It All Dogecoin began as a joke but became the meme coin that defined a movement. Backed by a global community and notable personalities, DOGE maintains its spot as the entry point for many new crypto investors. Its low transaction fees and merchant adoption make it a bridge between entertainment and everyday use. Dogecoin’s resilience, humor, and massive following ensure it remains an essential part of any top-tier meme coin list heading into 2025. 7. Peanut the Squirrel (PEANUT): The New Nut in the Market Peanut the Squirrel is the latest fun-driven project adding flavor to the meme coin ecosystem. With its quirky branding and playful tone, PEANUT aims to turn casual traders into loyal community members through fair tokenomics and humor-based marketing. The project’s focus on creativity, transparency, and inclusivity helps it gain traction among newcomers looking for something fresh and relatable in the meme space. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, MoonBull leads as a 100x meme coin, followed by Shiba Inu, BullZilla, La Culex, Apeing, Dogecoin, and Peanut the Squirrel.

Grab Millions of $BZIL Tokens Before The Next 2.87% Price Surge Goes Live! Bitcoin Drops to $100K as BlackRock’s Massive Selloff Triggers Market Panic Bitcoin plunged to $100K on Thursday after reports that BlackRock sold nearly $478 million in BTC on Coinbase Prime, sparking market fear. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now shed over $22,000 this quarter after peaking at $123,000. The sell-off pushed Bitcoin’s market cap to $2.03 trillion and daily losses of 2.5%. Still, analysts say institutional profit-taking and Fed caution only reflect short-term volatility. Long-term holders continue to treat Bitcoin as digital gold and expect stability to return as ETF flows normalize. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Why did Bitcoin drop so sharply this week? Bitcoin fell after BlackRock’s large-scale $478 million sell-off hit Coinbase Prime. The move sparked panic selling and triggered a cascade of liquidations, although analysts expect price stabilization in the coming weeks. Is Bitcoin still a safe long-term investment? Yes. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Bitcoin remains the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, backed by strong institutional trust, limited supply, robust on-chain metrics, and a solid reputation as a reliable store of value. BullZilla ($BZIL): Best Crypto to Buy in November as Presale Momentum Explodes BullZilla is emerging as 2025’s hottest presale, blending meme culture with robust blockchain mechanics. Currently in Stage 9 (Bullish By Nature), Phase 3, its price sits at $0.00023239, with over $1 million raised and 31 billion tokens sold to 3,500 holders. ROI already stands at 2,168.34%, and early investors can still participate before a 2.87% price increase to $0.00023906. With its Progressive Price Engine and transparent vesting, BullZilla is becoming the best crypto to buy in November, attracting attention across the crypto community. A $2,000 Investment Could Roar to $45,322 by Listing Day At current rates, a $2,000 investment buys roughly 8.6 million $BZIL tokens. When BullZilla reaches its expected listing price of $0.00527, those holdings could be worth around $45,322. This growth projection shows why BZIL is becoming the presale everyone’s watching. Unlike speculative memecoins, BullZilla offers utility through staking, referrals, and burn mechanisms that continuously reduce supply and boost long-term value for holders who get in early. Its momentum is no accident; it’s engineered for ROI. How to Join the BullZilla Presale Begin by creating a Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, to securely manage your crypto.

Purchased tokens remain locked until the official launch, with vesting details clearly displayed on the dashboard for transparency. The entire process is fully audited, secure, and user-friendly, ideal for both newcomers and experienced investors preparing for Stage 10. Staking Benefits | The HODL Furnace The HODL Furnace is BullZilla’s signature staking platform offering a massive 70% APY to long-term holders.

Will BullZilla Presale be listed on Coinbase? While official listings remain unconfirmed, BullZilla’s Ethereum-based smart contracts, thorough audits, and strong community adoption position it as a top contender for major exchange listings once presale concludes and liquidity stabilizes. BNB Slips Below $1,000 as Market Pressure Mounts and Traders Eye Oversold Bounce Binance Coin (BNB) fell below the $1,000 threshold, hitting $901 before recovering near $948. This marks double-digit losses over the month as traders react to macroeconomic uncertainty and government funding delays. Analysts believe RSI levels near oversold territory could trigger a technical rebound. Last month’s rally to $1,369 showed the token’s resilience amid volatility. Despite short-term pressure, long-term holders still trust BNB’s DeFi and staking utilities, which continue to strengthen Binance’s dominance in the global exchange market. Frequently Asked Questions About Binance Coin Why did BNB fall below $1,000 this week? BNB dropped below $1,000 primarily due to macroeconomic pressures, including tighter liquidity conditions and profit-taking following its strong October rally. Analysts expect technical buying to trigger a rebound soon. Can BNB recover from its current levels? Yes. BNB’s ecosystem adoption and on-chain activity remain robust. With RSI nearing oversold levels, analysts anticipate short-term recovery and a longer-term uptrend fueled by strong utility and exchange demand across its network. Conclusion The past week was a roller coaster for blue-chip cryptos. Bitcoin’s $478 million BlackRock-driven sell-off triggered widespread panic, while BNB’s drop below $1,000 tested investor patience and confidence. Despite short-term fear, both remain pillars of trust and resilience within blockchain infrastructure. Institutional investors view these dips as temporary rebalancing rather than collapses. This trend has increased interest in alternatives, especially BullZilla, whose Stage 9 presale momentum demonstrates why it is considered the best crypto to buy in November , attracting savvy investors seeking high-growth opportunities beyond established coins. BullZilla ($BZIL) represents the next generation of opportunity-focused crypto investing. With over $1 million raised, 31 billion tokens sold, and a current ROI projection of 2,168% or more, it demonstrates how early participation can yield life-changing returns. Its 70% APY staking system, transparent vesting, and stage-based pricing create an optimal balance of reward and security. While Bitcoin and BNB offer stability, BullZilla embodies growth potential and investor excitement, positioning itself as the spark for the next significant bull wave in cryptocurrency markets.

This shift, though unexpected, may not be entirely negative. Historically, major holders often rotate capital into other crypto assets during transitional market phases. Among the growing list of projects attracting attention is Remittix (RTX) , now priced at $0.1166 per token, a DeFi project reshaping how digital currencies connect with traditional finance through its PayFi system. Bitcoin Price Prediction and Current Market Status Bitcoin Price is currently selling at $102,635, up by 1.77%, the network’s market capitalization currently stands at $1.99 trillion, and trading volume has increased to $87 billion by 42%. Some analysts following Bitcoin price prediction models say the continued sell-off may be a signal that profit-taking is occurring ahead of a new phase of accumulation. According to some experts, this is a healthy correction within the greater bullish cycle, particularly as institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs keeps rising. The next few weeks will probably define whether BTC can remain above $100K or more investors will switch to altcoins with stronger growth potential. Altcoins Rising as Investors Diversify Investors seem to be reallocating funds toward other promising tokens. Near Protocol (NEAR) has risen 44.32%, trading at $2.87 with a market cap of $3.02 billion. Its trading volume skyrocketed 228.81% to $808.57 million, suggesting active accumulation. Similarly, Internet Computer (ICP) has climbed 9.38% to $7.51, supported by a $4.01 billion market cap and $1.42 billion trading volume, up 45.79%. These gains show where liquidity from large Bitcoin holders might be flowing — into new altcoins and crypto projects with real-world utility. Many investors are now watching Remittix, an upcoming cross-chain DeFi project solving practical payment challenges. Remittix: The DeFi Solution Gaining Real Momentum Remittix has raised over $28 million in private funding, selling more than 684.3 million tokens. The platform’s ability to send crypto directly to traditional bank accounts across 30+ countries has positioned it among the best DeFi projects of 2025. It’s also one of the top cryptos under $1, combining accessibility with real-world functionality. What’s Fueling Confidence in Remittix Fully verified by CertiK, ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet $250,000 Giveaway rewarding early community engagement Wallet Beta testing open to iOS users Future listings confirmed for BitMart and LBANK Transparent low-gas-fee crypto transactions and global payment utility These developments strengthen Remittix’s credibility, showing why investors may be rotating from large-cap assets like Bitcoin into high-growth crypto projects with long-term use cases. The Shift Beneath the Surface The $45B Bitcoin sell-off may signal more than short-term profit-taking — it suggests a growing appetite for tokens that merge DeFi with real-world solutions. With its CertiK verification, expanding community, and unique payment bridge, Remittix could be among the next big altcoins of 2025.

Here’s Why Investors Are Paying Attention,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-fastest-growing-new-crypto-of-2025-heres-why-investors-are-paying-attention/,"Without substantial institutionalization or innovations in the DeFi sector of the cryptocurrency space, a single new cryptocurrency has gained a strong unobtrusive concentration among early adopters. As most projects are on a hype in the short term, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is providing the base of further development over the long term, and its growth has made it be among the fastest growing new crypto of 2025. Investors are paying attention with a roadmap of this nature, clear token model, and an imminent lending protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that is building a non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol that emphasizes efficiency, security and fairness. The platform enables users to loan out digital assets to make passive income or borrow financial resources on their holdings, which are managed through smart contracts that have automated processes and ensure transparency. The protocol is designed in terms of two lending markets. The former is referred to as Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and functions by using such liquidity pools with the assets in the form of ETH or USDT being deposited by the users. They in turn earn mtTokens which are their deposits and that earn yield as the borrowers utilize the liquidity. As an example, when a user puts in 10 ETH, he/she gets 10 mtETH, and it will automatically have an interest in relation to the use of the pool. The second one is the Peer to Peer (P2P) model that facilitates lending between users themselves, with flexible loan terms, in terms of interest rates and loan duration. The borrowers should have adequate collateral, which is calculated using the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. In case the value of collateral is less than a specific limit, the liquidations will be automatically implemented using smart contracts to protect the system. An Organized Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance is already among the most active in 2025. This growth has been consistent and clear and has seen an augmented investor confidence in the project fundamentals. Given the total 4 billion supply of MUTM tokens, the portion of the presale is approximately 45.5% or 1.82 billion tokens, which guarantees high penetration of the community, rather than concentrated ownership. The presale is based on a fixed-price, fixed-allocation model, i.e. every stage has to sell all tickets before the next stage starts at an increased price. This is a clearly demand-based model that generates inherent scarcity and FOMO among the investors. What started at $0.01 during Phase 1 is now at the price of $0.035 in Phase 6, a clean 250% increase to those that had supported it from the outset. To date, more than $18.5 million have been raised and more than 17,850 holders are taking part and approximately 790 million of the tokens have been sold. Phase 6 is already in the pre-elongation phase and at this rate; it would sell out even earlier than anticipated. The steady demand testifies to the high demand of the project by both the retail and larger investors. To complement its engagement strategy, Mutuum Finance has a 24-hour leaderboard, where the most productive contributor in a day wins $500 of MUTM tokens. This aspect has aided the momentum daily particularly due to its visibility enabling the participants to have an understanding of presale action and rankings of contributions. The V1 Protocol Initiation The official announcement of the team states that the V1 protocol of Mutuum Finance will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, and that the project will become live tested. The release will have initial features liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot to enable a two-asset lending, borrowing and collateralisation process with the initial assets being ETH and USDT. Security has been of high priority since the beginning. The protocol has already received a CertiK audit with a rating of 90/100 on its review on TokenScan, a good indicator of reliability of smart-contracts. The team also runs a bug bounty of $50,000 to attract conscious reporting of code vulnerabilities before the mainnet is launched. Such a multi-layered security brings a sense of security to users, as well as places Mutuum Finance in a more secure position than most unaudited competitors in DeFi. According to some analysts, due to the combination of its transparency, security, and active development, MUTM can be one of the most appropriate cryptocurrencies to invest in in 2025, in particular, as the presale demand keeps gaining more momentum. The Future Growth Drivers In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance will also introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be directly related to its ecosystem. It will not be like normal stablecoins, which have only reserves to back their value, as the one by Mutuum will include the lending interest flows in the treasury to facilitate long-term stability and sustainability. The team is building the system of a stablecoin, and also, the team is working on Layer-2 integration to minimize fees and increase throughput on a transaction to make the experience more comfortable even during peak network use times. Both these features are considered significant milestones on the way towards scalability and mass-market usability, which any DeFi protocol aspiring to leave its niche must have. The Reason Investors Are Taking Notice Respondents of the market indicate different factors behind the growing momentum of the traction of Mutuum Finance. One, it has a model that is utility-based so that the token demand aspect is not entirely speculative; it correlates with actual lending and protocol revenue. Second, the buy-and-distribute system returning fees to acquire MUTM on the open market and redistributing tokens to stakes of staking pools on the mtToken fabricates a continuous purchasing effect and compensates long-term owners. Thirdly, time is very important. Since the crypto market is entering the next bullish cycle, investors are seeking projects which reflect the early growth potential as experienced in the case of Solana or Aave over the last few successful stories. Mutuum Finance seems to correspond with that story with a functioning roadmap, future testnet, and confirmed audit.

Polymarket prediction markets are currently making waves with their latest insights into the ongoing US government shutdown. Traders on this innovative platform are placing their bets, revealing a 59% probability that the shutdown will extend beyond November 16. This fascinating development showcases how cryptocurrency-based prediction markets are becoming increasingly relevant in political forecasting. What Do Polymarket Prediction Markets Reveal About the Shutdown Timeline? The Polymarket prediction platform provides detailed breakdowns of when traders expect the US government shutdown to resolve. Currently, the data shows three distinct probability clusters that paint a clear picture of market expectations. The highest probability sits at 59% for resolution after November 16, indicating most traders believe the shutdown will continue for several more weeks. Meanwhile, the platform reveals a 31% chance of resolution between November 12 and 15. This suggests a significant minority of traders anticipate a mid-November compromise. The smallest probability, at just 9%, falls between November 8 and 11, showing very few expect an immediate resolution. How Do Prediction Markets Like Polymarket Actually Work? Polymarket prediction markets operate on a simple yet powerful principle: the wisdom of crowds. Traders buy and sell shares in specific outcomes, with prices reflecting the market’s collective probability assessment.

According to CrowdStrike, Russia-nexus actors have continued to pursue intelligence collection and disruptive campaigns tied to the war against Ukraine. Their objectives include tracking military aid, influencing European public opinion, and undermining NATO cohesion. Similarly, groups in Iran have also increased their campaigns against other countries as regional tensions escalate. CrowdStrike also noted that China has been focusing its cyber operations on strategic industries such as defense, manufacturing, and biotechnology. It identified Vertigo Panda’s use of USB-based exploits and Vixen Panda’s focus on cloud infrastructure, both designed to steal intellectual property that supports China’s industrial and technological ambitions. CrowdStrike noted that traditional defensive models that rely on static detection and reactive response are no longer sufficient. Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s Head of Counter Adversary Operations, noted the need for “intelligence-led defense powered by AI and guided by human expertise.” This strategy is expected to use several strategies to block the activities of these hackers before they cause further threats. Meanwhile, firms would need proactive intelligence sharing and other measures. According to the report , more than 2,100 firms have been affected by ransomware attacks. The platform mentioned that the attackers target firms like manufacturing, professional services, and retail. The report also noted that ransomware is on the rise in most European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Aside from improving their speed, threat actors have also changed their methods, diversifying their attacks through advanced social engineering and deception techniques. Another growing method is the CAPTCHA lure, which is known as Click fix. In these attacks, users are tricked into copying malicious code into their systems under the guise of verifying their identity.

The group uses the technology to increase their deployment speed by 48% and reduce the attack cycle to around 24 hours. This rise also shows how AI helps attackers carry out their criminal activities. CrowdStrike reveals integration of AI and ransomware According to the report , more than 2,100 firms have been affected by ransomware attacks. The platform mentioned that the attackers target firms like manufacturing, professional services, and retail. The report also noted that ransomware is on the rise in most European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Aside from improving their speed, threat actors have also changed their methods, diversifying their attacks through advanced social engineering and deception techniques. Another growing method is the CAPTCHA lure, which is known as Click fix. In these attacks, users are tricked into copying malicious code into their systems under the guise of verifying their identity. European organizations have reported over 1,000 of these cases since 2024. According to CrowdStrike, these evolving methodologies show how AI tools are being used to improve traditional social engineering strategies. Attackers carry out targeted campaigns that bypass security filters by using several methods State-sponsored usage of AI on the rise State-sponsored actors from countries like Russia, North Korea, China, and Iran have also expanded their targets across Europe. According to CrowdStrike, Russia-nexus actors have continued to pursue intelligence collection and disruptive campaigns tied to the war against Ukraine. Their objectives include tracking military aid, influencing European public opinion, and undermining NATO cohesion. Similarly, groups in Iran have also increased their campaigns against other countries as regional tensions escalate. CrowdStrike also noted that China has been focusing its cyber operations on strategic industries such as defense, manufacturing, and biotechnology. It identified Vertigo Panda’s use of USB-based exploits and Vixen Panda’s focus on cloud infrastructure, both designed to steal intellectual property that supports China’s industrial and technological ambitions. CrowdStrike noted that traditional defensive models that rely on static detection and reactive response are no longer sufficient. Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s Head of Counter Adversary Operations, noted the need for “intelligence-led defense powered by AI and guided by human expertise.” This strategy is expected to use several strategies to block the activities of these hackers before they cause further threats. Meanwhile, firms would need proactive intelligence sharing and other measures. A new report has revealed that ransomware attackers across Europe are now turning to artificial intelligence to bolster their operations. In the report released by CrowdStrike, it highlighted that the rise in ransomware attacks experienced by Europe is due to how these attackers have been integrating AI into their operations. In its report, the firm claims that Europe is responsible for about 22% of the global ransomware and extortion victims. It also noted that the continent ranks second among the most targeted regions worldwide after North America, leading to unprecedented risks for businesses and governments alike.

According to the preliminary prospectus sent and acknowledged by the SEC on Friday, the ETF will issue shares of beneficial interest listed on NYSE Arca under a yet-to-be-determined ticker symbol. WisdomTree Digital Commodity Services is the designated sponsor, with Delaware Trust Company placed as a trustee. Coinbase Custody Trust Company has been tapped for digital asset holdings, while The Bank of New York Mellon will manage cash custody, fund administration, accounting, and transfer agent duties. WisdomTree to launch CoinDesk 20 ETF The WisdomTree S-1 filing revealed that the ETF will invest directly in the underlying digital assets in approximately the same proportions as the index. Share prices will be calculated daily using CCData Blended Reference Prices, which is a combination of fiat and stablecoin-converted trading pairs. The WisdomTree CoinDesk 20 Fund is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not subject to SEC investment adviser regulations. It is also not part of any commodity pool under the Commodity Exchange Act, and the sponsor is not regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) in connection with this ETF. The Trust plans to issue shares by continuously redeeming them in “Creation Units,” with cash transactions based on the value of underlying assets, adjusted for sponsor fees and expenses. The SEC may have recently approved in-kind creations and redemptions for certain spot digital asset exchange-traded products, but WisdomTree said it will notify shareholders if and when in-kind transactions become available. CoinDesk 20 Index calculates asset values using a 24-hour volume-weighted average price from a curated selection of exchanges with an outlier detection system. Assets are weighted by market capitalization, and the largest constituent is capped at 30%, while all others are limited to 20%. Excess weight is redistributed proportionally, reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly at the close of the last business day. NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci said on X that “CoinDesk is aggressively seeking to position itself in crypto indexing,” which he reckoned would be “massive,” for the digital currency industry. According to Saturday midday trading data, the CoinDesk 20 index stood at 3,341, a positive 4.41% price correction from Friday’s 3,151 close at 4 PM ET. The level is a modest upturn from the index’s reading of 3,241.28 on Wednesday, when it had risen about 133.71 points, and another uptick on Thursday that took it further to 3,268. Two of the largest gainers in the last 24 hours are NEAR Protocol and Polkadot, which recorded gains of 20% and 17% respectively. WisdomTree Chainlink partnership and Q3 success Moving away from ETFs , WisdomTree has also been active in developing blockchain-based solutions. On November 5, the firm and Chainlink launched a live net asset value feed for the CRDT tokenized private credit fund on Ethereum. The integration provides decentralized pricing to users through 16 independent oracle operators using Chainlink’s DataLink Services. Maredith Hannon, Head of Business Development for Digital Assets at WisdomTree, said the firm is “excited to implement the Chainlink data standard to bring NAV data on-chain for our Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund.” Earlier this week, WisdomTree reported third-quarter earnings for the fiscal year 2025, posting revenue of US$125.62 million and net income of US$19.7 million. The firm declared a US$0.03 per share quarterly dividend and announced an increase in its equity buyback authorization to US$564.9 million. Looking ahead, the company projects revenue of $600.8 million and net income of $227.8 million by 2028. The positive scenario assumes a 10.6% annual revenue increase and a $168.2 million earnings rise from the current $59.6 million. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

According to Mei, Bitcoin's decline could deepen further if there is a sharp sell-off in AI and tech stocks. SignalPlus partner Augustine Fan emphasized that there are no new positive catalysts in the short term. He noted that security and regulatory uncertainties persist, limiting the appetite of large traditional institutions to enter the market.

Millions of Indians are expected to receive a whole year of free access to ChatGPT’s new, affordable “Go” AI chatbot starting this week. This announcement follows similar news from Google and Perplexity AI, released in the past few weeks. These two AI-powered search companies collaborated with local mobile firms in India to offer users a year or more of access to their AI tools. Regarding their collaboration with local mobile firms, Perplexity joined forces with Airtel, the country’s second-largest mobile network provider. Google, on the other hand, Partnered with Reliance Jio, the largest telecom company in India. The purpose of these collaborations is to provide Indian users with free or discounted AI tools together with monthly data plans. Analysts raise concerns about Big Tech’s free access to AI tool offers Following the free access offer to AI tools, analysts warned that such offers should not be viewed merely as a common courtesy. Based on their argument, such deals are strategic investments focused on India’s digital future. An example of these analysts is Tarun Pathak, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. During an interview, he mentioned that Big Tech companies aim at getting Indians engaged with generative AI before asking them to pay for it. Mr Pathak further explained that India’s big market comprises a young audience. Although other major markets, such as China, may challenge India in terms of user numbers, it is worth noting that China’s strict tech rules make it difficult for foreign companies to access. In contrast, India has a competitive and open digital market. These findings are released as global tech firms utilize the AI boom era to attract millions of new users, helping to train their AI models. When reporters reached out to Google, OpenAI and Perplexity to comment on the topic of discussion, they declined to respond. Meanwhile, India boasts over 900 million internet users and offers some of the most budget-friendly data worldwide. Most of its users in this sector are young individuals, with the majority being under 24 years old. To explain this trend, sources highlighted that the current generation excels at living, working, and connecting with others online using their smartphones. Therefore, merging AI tools with data plans presents a significant opportunity for tech firms, especially given that India’s data usage exceeds that of many other nations. As more Indians use this platform, companies gain access to useful firsthand information. “India is a highly diverse nation. The AI applications that develop here will offer important case studies for the global community,” said Mr Pathak. According to him, the more unique and firsthand information these tech companies gather, the more effective their models become, especially for generative AI systems. India’s internet users trade their data for free services or convenience While accessing valuable information greatly benefits AI firms, it raises concerns among consumers about data privacy issues. Prasanto K Roy, a Delhi-based technology writer and analyst, commented on the situation. Roy acknowledged that users are always willing to give up their data for free services or convenience. Hence, he believes that this trend will likely continue. Currently, there is no specific law in India for artificial intelligence. Additionally, a wider Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) 2023 exists, which is primarily designed to address digital media and privacy, but has not yet been enacted. Experts believe that while the act provides some basic protection for personal data, the rules set for its enforcement have not yet been fully developed.

Institutional investors have increasingly been turning to regulated crypto vehicles and investment products as they look to diversify their holdings and explore Bitcoin ETF options. JPMorgan Holds 5.3 Million BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Shares According to JPMorgan’s New York-based fintech arm’s latest 13F-HR Institutional Investment Manager holdings report, the firm owns IBIT shares worth $343 million. The report can be viewed on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website. Spot Bitcoin ETFs secured approval in January 2024, marking a watershed moment for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, primarily IBIT, are widely regarded as an important gateway for institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin ETFs give investors access to the asset without needing direct custody. Unlike futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs represent direct asset buys. A Vocal Critic JPMorgan was one of the harshest critics of spot Bitcoin ETFs before their approval in 2024. The financial behemoth was also critical of the broader cryptocurrency market. JPMorgan’s chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, made several comments about Bitcoin, questioning its validity as a real currency, and even calling it a “fraud” asset. Dimon urged the US government to shut it down and made several attempts to associate cryptocurrency with illicit and criminal activities. Dimon stated during an interview, “It does nothing. I call it the pet rock.” Dimon was initially very open about his dislike for cryptocurrencies, calling those investing in the asset “stupid,” and calling the asset a waste of time and a “hyped-up fraud.” However, Dimon’s tone has shifted in recent months. The JPMorgan CEO recently stated during an interview, “Crypto is real. Blockchain is real. Stablecoins are real.” Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan was operating a deposit coin and using smart contracts to improve transaction efficiency, noting, “It will be used by all of us.” Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs broke their six-day outflow streak, showing signs of recovery after Bitcoin (BTC) plunged over 16% over the course of the week.

The cryptocurrency market is witnessing an unusual trend this month, with Bitcoin posting a surprising -6.5% return as of November 8th. This performance starkly contrasts with historical patterns, leaving investors and analysts searching for answers about what’s driving this unexpected downturn. What Do the Current Bitcoin November Returns Reveal? According to fresh data from Coinglass, Bitcoin’s cumulative performance for November currently stands at -6.5%. This negative return represents a significant departure from the cryptocurrency’s typical November behavior. The current Bitcoin November returns are particularly noteworthy because they challenge established seasonal patterns that many traders have come to expect. Historical context makes this development even more intriguing. The average Bitcoin November returns over previous years have been remarkably positive, creating expectations that this month would follow suit. However, market dynamics appear to be shifting, prompting questions about whether this is a temporary correction or the beginning of a new trend. How Do Current Bitcoin November Returns Compare to History? The contrast between current and historical Bitcoin November returns couldn’t be more striking. Historical data shows an average return of 41.98% for November across Bitcoin’s trading history. This massive gap between expectation and reality highlights the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Consider these key historical facts about Bitcoin November returns: Bitcoin has recorded profitable November months in 8 of the last 12 years The historical average return of 41.98% significantly outperforms most traditional assets Only 4 November months have shown negative returns in the past decade This year’s negative Bitcoin November returns therefore represent a notable exception to the established pattern. Market analysts are closely watching whether this deviation signals broader market changes or simply represents short-term volatility. What Factors Could Explain This Year’s Bitcoin November Returns? Several market factors may be contributing to the unexpected Bitcoin November returns we’re observing. Market sentiment has been influenced by various macroeconomic conditions and regulatory developments. Additionally, trading volumes and institutional activity patterns have shown unusual characteristics this month. The current Bitcoin November returns might reflect: Broader cryptocurrency market corrections Investor reactions to global economic indicators Seasonal trading pattern adjustments Technical resistance levels being tested Understanding these Bitcoin November returns requires looking beyond surface numbers. Market depth, liquidity conditions, and trader positioning all play crucial roles in determining monthly performance outcomes. What Can Investors Learn From These Bitcoin November Returns? The surprising Bitcoin November returns serve as an important reminder about cryptocurrency market dynamics. While historical patterns provide valuable context, they don’t guarantee future performance. This year’s results demonstrate that even well-established seasonal trends can experience significant deviations. For investors monitoring Bitcoin November returns, this development underscores the importance of: Diversification across different time horizons Understanding that past performance doesn’t predict future results Maintaining perspective during unexpected market movements Using both technical and fundamental analysis in decision-making Conclusion: Putting Bitcoin November Returns in Perspective The current -6.5% Bitcoin November returns certainly deserve attention, but they represent just one data point in a larger market picture. While disappointing compared to historical averages, monthly fluctuations are normal in cryptocurrency markets. The key takeaway is that Bitcoin November returns, like all market metrics, must be viewed within broader context and understood as part of longer-term investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions Why are Bitcoin November returns important to track? Bitcoin November returns provide insight into seasonal patterns and help investors understand historical performance trends during specific periods. How unusual are negative Bitcoin November returns? Negative Bitcoin November returns have occurred in only 4 of the last 12 years, making this year’s performance relatively uncommon but not unprecedented. Should I change my investment strategy based on monthly returns? Monthly returns like Bitcoin November returns should inform but not dictate investment strategy. Long-term perspective typically yields better results than reacting to short-term fluctuations. What’s the historical average for Bitcoin November returns? The historical average for Bitcoin November returns stands at 41.98%, making this year’s -6.5% performance particularly notable. Can Bitcoin November returns predict December performance? While some correlation exists between monthly performances, Bitcoin November returns don’t reliably predict December outcomes due to market complexity. Where can I find reliable data on Bitcoin November returns? Platforms like Coinglass, CoinMarketCap, and other established cryptocurrency data providers track Bitcoin November returns and other performance metrics.

The flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $99,170 on Friday before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $103,284. According to analysts, market sentiment has turned positive as ETF inflows return, snapping a six-day outflow streak. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $102,287. JPMorgan Makes Bitcoin Prediction JPMorgan analysts have predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $170,000 within the next six to twelve months. The analysts, led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, stated in a report that the cryptocurrency market has corrected by nearly 20% from recent highs, with October 10 witnessing the sharpest decline, resulting in record liquidations. The crypto market registered substantial liquidations on November 3 as well. According to the analysts, the November 3 downturn occurred as investor confidence was shaken following the $120 million Balancer exploit, raising fresh concerns around protocol security. However, JPMorgan analysts believe the deleveraging phase in Bitcoin perpetual futures is largely over, with the ratio of open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures to market capitalization returning to historical norms. The analysts noted, “In CME futures, the opposite is true; there have been more liquidations in Ethereum than Bitcoin futures.” The analysts also stated that while there were some redemptions in ETFs, they were fairly modest compared to the weeks ending October 3 and October 10. “Overall, we believe that perpetual futures are the most important instruments to watch in the current juncture, and the message from the recent stabilization is that deleveraging in perpetual futures is likely behind us.” Kazakhstan Planning $1 Billion Bitcoin Reserve Kazakhstan plans to create a $1 billion crypto reserve fund by early 2026. The fund will be funded by seized, repatriated, and mining-related assets, and will invest in ETFs and crypto-focused companies, thus avoiding direct Bitcoin holdings. According to officials, the reserve will repurpose confiscated digital assets to strengthen economic sovereignty and formalize Kazakhstan’s digital asset strategy. Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) will manage the fund, which could also see participation from foreign entities once operational. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $102,430. The flagship cryptocurrency fell below $100,000 again on Friday, dropping to an intraday low of $99,170. However, it regained momentum to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $103,284. The recovery comes after a brutal market correction that wiped out over $1 trillion from the global crypto market, which fell nearly 20% from a peak of $4.4 trillion. According to analysts, the recovery is being fueled by renewed ETF inflows. Bitcoin ETFs snapped a 6-day outflow streak as investor sentiment improves despite substantial macro headwinds. The selloff was triggered by a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, which refused to guarantee rate cuts in November. Market sentiment was further soured by US-China trade tensions and a jump in Treasury yields, leading to reduced risk appetite. According to data by CoinShares, institutional outflows from crypto ETFs crossed $600 million as risk-off sentiment dominated markets. BTC started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising 0.84% on Friday and 0.56% on Saturday to settle at $111,666. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose nearly 3% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,548. BTC reached an intraday high of $116,410 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $114,087, ultimately dropping 0.40%. Selling pressure and volatility persisted on Tuesday as the price fell 1.03% to $112,906. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell 2.55% and settled at $110.032. Volatility and selling pressure persisted on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $111,629, fell to an intraday low of $106,279, and settled at $108,308. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC returned to positive territory on Friday, rising 1.15% and settling at $108,555. Source: TradingView Price action remained positive over the weekend, with BTC increasing 0.45% on Saturday and 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $110,536.

Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the flagship cryptocurrency slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892 before settling at $101,468.

The crypto analytics firm claimed that these fiat-pegged tokens were used in nearly 63% of money laundering transactions in 2024. The Chainalysis report asserted that stablecoins are mostly preferred because they are easy to send overseas. They can also be traded informally without identity verifications. The report says stablecoins are the new “back accounts” for criminal organizations. A “back account” is the final drop account from which the funds transferred across several accounts are withdrawn. The first account where deceived victims deposit their money is referred to as the “front account.” The report claims that, until 2021, Bitcoin was used almost exclusively for various money laundering crimes; however, stablecoins have recently become more untraceable, especially across borders. The growth of stablecoins has also led to a corresponding increase in their illegal use. FATF supports Chainalysis’s findings The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reported in June that the use of stablecoin by criminals has increased significantly since last year. The FATF also claimed that the majority of illicit activities on blockchains involve stablecoins. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also published a report in January claiming Tether (USDT) was the most popular currency for criminal gangs in Southeast Asia . The main reason stablecoins were used for laundering proceeds from criminal activities is their versatility. The UNODC noted the difficulty in smuggling fiat currencies overseas; converting them in Korea is even more challenging. The Chainalysis report also found that converting criminal proceeds into stablecoins allows for easy cross-border remittance. Money launderers can bypass exchanges by using overseas crypto exchanges that don’t require KYC (know your customer) verification. They can also use OTC (over-the-counter) transactions. The report noted that while stablecoins are fundamentally traceable, their decentralized nature allows them to avoid government control. It further noted that although the transactions may leave a trail, crypto wallets make tracking difficult because they use randomized alphanumeric characters. Tumbled or mixed stablecoins become even more challenging to track. Korea’s stablecoin-related fraud surges The report also found that Korean criminals are increasingly turning to stablecoins for the so-called “Oda Jangip fraud”. The scam begins with false advertising on online shopping stores or second-hand marketplaces, and then money is scammed from unsuspecting buyers. Stablecoins are used to launder proceeds from small-scale frauds (hundreds of thousands of dollars) and large-scale scams (hundreds of millions of dollars and more). However, the report suggests that criminals involved in stablecoin-related crimes often receive lenient sentences. Chainalysis gave an example of one criminal who laundered over $188 million while working for a voice phishing ring in January. The criminal, whom the analytics firm chose to call Person A, bought Ethereum and transferred it to an overseas crypto exchange. The ETH was then swapped for USDT and transferred to a crypto wallet controlled by the ring. The money laundering process began with domestic bank accounts, ETH, overseas crypto exchanges, stablecoins, and then a crypto wallet. However, the criminal received only one year and six months in prison, suspended for three years in August. Another criminal was reportedly sentenced to eight months in prison and two years’ probation for deceiving a victim who bought perfume through a second-hand marketplace. The criminal received the customer’s 220,000 won deposit through a fake bank account, and then exchanged it for USDT to cash out. The report noted that financial fraud organizations that use stablecoins primarily use tactics such as voice phishing, stock/coin “leading room” scams, and second-hand market fraud. They then seek ways to launder the proceeds cleanly and withdraw them as cash. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The R3 Corda Settler platform listed XRP as its first settlement asset, demonstrating interoperability with global financial systems. Ripple has also engaged with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Financial Stability Board (FSB). These institutions influence global payment standards, placing XRPL within credible policy discussions rather than speculative narratives. Standardization and ISO 20022 Migration Global payment systems are undergoing a synchronized upgrade to ISO 20022 messaging standards. This transition, expected to finalize in November 2025, will unify cross-border payment formats and enable new interoperability. Ripple’s technology aligns with this standard, allowing banks and settlement providers to connect efficiently to the XRPL. The timing of this migration could mark a critical point for utility-driven adoption.

That fee is permanently destroyed, not recycled or distributed. As transaction volumes grow, this deflationary burn mechanism steadily reduces supply. Combined with fixed circulation of roughly 50 billion XRP, growing utility can produce natural price pressure over time. Policy Recognition and Industry Participation Ripple’s inclusion in the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force under “Real-Time Cross-Border Transactions” highlights early U.S. policy recognition. Similarly, Ripple’s membership in the International Payments Framework Association (IPFA) places it beside SWIFT, the Federal Reserve, and major banks like RBC and U.S. Bank. This reinforces XRP’s presence within global payment governance rather than isolated experimentation. Measured Valuation Logic ProfessoRipplEffect’s model links XRP price directly to the share of settlement volume routed through XRPL. Even one percent of global settlement flows implies substantial value due to the scale involved. The model emphasizes utility, liquidity routing, and institutional adoption, rather than speculative momentum. In conclusion, the thesis presented by ProfessoRipplEffect stands on verifiable documentation and institutional evidence. With XRP’s deflationary design, ISO 20022 readiness, and deepening global integration, the asset’s long-term valuation framework appears grounded in tangible mechanics. If adoption follows the trajectory outlined, XRP could indeed emerge as a key settlement bridge across global markets.

With the current price hovering around $155.65, and trading volume hitting $6 billion in the last 24 hours, Solana’s recent dip has crypto traders watching closely. Market cap sits at a hefty $88 billion, and though SOL has slid 45% below its all-time high, bulls are still holding the line like penguins in a snowstorm. Analysts see Solana ($SOL) potentially charging toward $300 in the coming year, especially with DeFi and staking heating up across the chain. Yet, it’s the MoonBull presale that’s really stealing the show. The project’s unique model, tokenomics, and 95% APY staking are fueling whispers that this could be the next big meme sensation – and yes, the best crypto to buy now. MoonBull Presale Is Live: The Best Crypto to Buy Now Let’s talk about the new kid stealing headlines: MoonBull ($MOBU). The presale is live, and it’s got everyone from finance grads to crypto die-hards watching like cats tracking laser dots. Why? Because MoonBull is the best crypto to buy now – it fuses meme culture with powerhouse tokenomics. The Stage 6 presale price sits at $0.00008388, with over $550K raised and more than 1,900 holders already in. The ROI projection? A jaw-dropping 7,244% from Stage 6 to the listing price of $0.00616. Imagine tossing in $50,000 now – by the final presale stage, that could balloon into over $3.6 million. That’s not peanuts; that’s life-changing upside. Mobunomics: The Engine Powering MoonBull MoonBull’s system, nicknamed Mobunomics, is where the magic happens. Think of it as a bull’s engine firing on all cylinders. Each transaction redistributes wealth – 2% into liquidity, 2% to holders, and 1% burned forever. This trifecta keeps the token stable, scarce, and rewarding. Out of its 73.2 billion total supply, 50% goes to presale, 20% to staking, 11% to referrals, and 10% to liquidity. Unsold tokens? They get burned, creating the kind of scarcity that meme coins dream about. Built on Ethereum, MoonBull inherits its network’s security and DeFi access. The governance system starts at Stage 12, where every token equals one vote, making the community the true boss of the project’s direction. It’s smart, structured, and spicy – a meme coin that actually walks the talk. No more paper cats and hype hamsters; MoonBull is shaping up as the best crypto to buy now for those chasing their second chance at a 1000x run. Solana ($SOL) Price Prediction: Heading Toward $300 Solana ($SOL) has been trying to claw its way out of a tricky spot, holding firm near $160 after sliding from $175–$180. Analysts expect a battle at that range – if SOL breaks above $180, it could stampede toward the $200 zone, opening the door for the $300 mark in 2025. Bears may grumble, but long-term holders know Solana’s strength lies in its fundamentals: speed, scalability, and growing institutional integration. The network’s validator count may have dropped, but quality has improved. Fewer, stronger nodes now keep transactions smooth as butter on toast. Developers note that bad actors have left, congestion has eased, and efficiency has shot up. Solana’s DeFi growth, boosted by new launchpads and stablecoin inflows, is laying the groundwork for a fresh run. If the bullish setup holds, Solana could easily dance its way toward $300 by mid-2025, leaving slower chains in its dust. Long-Term Solana ($SOL) Price Predictions: 2026, 2030, 2040 Looking further down the road, Solana’s long-term trajectory seems less like a passing crypto craze and more like a marathon of sustained growth. By 2026, analysts expect the token to surge between $450 and $500, driven by expanding DeFi projects and healthier validator activity. As the network strengthens and more institutional partners step in, that price range could be only the beginning. By 2030, Solana ($SOL) may be testing the waters near $800 to $1,000, supported by widespread integration into payment systems, gaming platforms, and real-world financial applications. Its consistent focus on speed and scalability gives it an edge that many smart contract competitors struggle to match. Looking even further ahead, 2040 could mark Solana’s true coming of age – if blockchain adoption reaches global scale, a five-digit valuation is not out of the question. It’s a long-term play that rewards patience, proof that in the crypto jungle, steady bulls outlast jittery cats. Conclusion Based on the latest research and the market trends, Solana ($SOL) is still one of the strongest contenders among smart contract platforms, with a projected rise toward $300 in 2025. Yet, for those hunting for the next big wave, the MoonBull presale represents the best crypto to buy now . With its stage-based pricing, 95% APY staking, referral rewards, and Ethereum-based security, it’s not just a meme – it’s a movement. As early investors secure their spots, excitement is skyrocketing. This might just be the moment before the herd stampedes.

54165822,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=856070,1762604140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54165822.jpeg,India announces plans for agencies to push domestic AI governance guidelines,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/india-governance-group-panel-by-december/,"India has announced plans to set up an artificial intelligence government group and an expert panel committee by December. According to reports, the Artificial Intelligence Governance Group (AIGG) and Technology and Policy Committee (TPEC) will be set up to push objectives outlined in the India AI governance guidelines. The details were revealed by officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). As recommended in the guidelines that were released earlier this week, both bodies are expected to work together to help unify policymaking on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has become a source of concern for most countries, as they are now moving to create guidelines surrounding its usage. With bad actors now deploying it to carry out malicious activities, countries need to get ahead of it through regulations. India plans to set up AIGG and TPEC in December According to one of the officials, India is planning to move fast in setting up these bodies. The official mentioned that the agency is expected to coordinate all things related to AI. This is because they are expected to have the first meeting before work commences on five action areas before the India AI Summit takes place in February next year. “Among these, the framing of an India-specific risk assessment system for AI has received high priority,” the official added. The focal point of the summit taking place next year is to look into India’s progress in several areas identified in the governance framework. The government wants to ensure that various ministries and public agencies are in agreement over the direction of key AI policies, the official noted. AIGG is expected to coordinate policy on AI governance across ministries. In the report, the group is expected to be a small, permanent interagency body responsible for overall policy development. The group is also expected to be led by the principal scientific advisor, who has led a high-level advisory group since 2023. According to the official, the group was formed to examine various issues relating to artificial intelligence. The group will include officials from MeitY, the ministries of home affairs and external affairs, and the departments of science & technology and communications. In addition, representatives from some regulators are expected to make up the other members of the group. Agencies set to lend expertise to the program The agencies with representation in the group include the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Competition Commission of India (CCI), and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Others include Niti Aayog, University Grants Commission, and the Indian Council of Medical Research. According to another official, TPEC will be in charge of strategy and implementation of artificial intelligence policies, noting that MeitY is expected to choose its members soon. The framework also recommended that TPEC should comprise a small group of experts from fields like research and development (R&D) in emerging technologies, engineering, machine learning, data science, law, and public policy. The second official mentioned that current and former cybercrime experts are also expected to be added to the group to provide their wealth of experience in the field. The recently established AI Safety Institute would act as the main body responsible for guiding safe and trusted development and use of AI in India. Meanwhile, industry group Nasscom has mentioned that the next logical step for the program plan is to develop regulatory sandboxes and tool-building under AIGG and TPEC. This way, they would be able to create a balance between helping innovation and catching bad actors in the space. It will also help the country use AI responsibly , a move that nations across the world have been trying to make since the technology entered mainstream attention.
