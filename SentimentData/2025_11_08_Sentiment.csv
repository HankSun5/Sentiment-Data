The political deadlock has halted progress on key legislative priorities, including the long-anticipated crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act . Prolonged Shutdown Risks 2% GDP Hit as Senate Prepares Crucial Vote The Senate is expected to vote this week on a Republican-backed proposal that would end the shutdown and fund several federal agencies through the rest of the fiscal year. The measure requires 60 votes to advance, and while Republican leaders have expressed cautious optimism, uncertainty remains over whether enough Democrats will support it. “My hopes and expectations are always that we’re going to have enough Democrats to actually proceed, but I don’t know, we’ll see,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters. The standoff, which began on October 1 after lawmakers failed to agree on a budget, stems from disagreements over healthcare subsidies tied to the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring tax credits that help about 24 million Americans afford insurance, while Republicans argue that those issues should be negotiated separately once the government reopens. US Government Shutdown So Far: 1. 42 million people face interruption of SNAP 2. 3.5 million people have seen airfare disruptions 3. 750,000 employees furloughed 4. 5,000 flights set to be cancelled per day 5. $15 billion in US GDP lost per week 6. $10 billion of SNAP… — Zarar Khan (@DrZarar01) November 7, 2025 With roughly 1.4 million federal workers affected, including 700,000 furloughed since early October, the shutdown’s economic and social toll is deepening. Federal workers have now missed multiple paychecks, and agencies from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to the USDA are cutting services. Trump – No Snap Benefits Until Government Re-Opens. pic.twitter.com/yu1DwYAFOE — Ryan (Emperador Maximiliano) (@EmpMaximiliano) November 4, 2025 A Rhode Island court on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the SNAP program after it had been reduced to partial payments. The administration has appealed the decision, arguing that funding decisions should await congressional action. Nearly 42 million Americans depend on the program, which costs more than $8 billion per month. Economists warn the prolonged shutdown could inflict lasting damage on the U.S. economy. Turns out this shutdown is incredibly costly, averaging ~15B per week. Unlike past shutdowns, 650K furloughed workers may not get back pay, food aid is cut, small businesses without their loans, and some economic damage could be permanent if it extends through the holidays. pic.twitter.com/OImZwWDXTV — Tahra Hoops (@TahraHoops) November 5, 2025 The Congressional Budget Office estimates the standoff could shave up to two percentage points off fourth-quarter GDP growth, draining between $10 billion and $30 billion weekly. Small businesses that rely on federal contracts and loans are running short on capital, and consumer spending is declining as millions of workers remain unpaid. How Long Can Crypto Wait While Washington Sleeps? The shutdown has also paralyzed Washington’s regulatory machinery. Agencies overseeing financial markets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are operating with skeleton crews. Reviews of pending applications, including multiple proposals for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have been suspended. Interesting: Because most SEC staff are currently furloughed due to the government shutdown, they will NOT be available to review or respond to Fails-to-Deliver (FTD) related queries or compliance ISSUES unless they are designated as EMERGENCY functions. pic.twitter.com/5cDqudANAs — Reese Politics (@ReesePolitics) November 3, 2025 The impasse has effectively frozen legislative momentum on digital assets. The bipartisan CLARITY Act, designed to define how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are regulated across federal agencies, had seen renewed activity in late October. Senators John Boozman and Cory Booker said their committees were working “daily ” to finalize their section of the bill and expected a vote before Thanksgiving. However, with the government shutdown entering its sixth week, that timeline is now in jeopardy. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that roughly 90% of the bill’s issues had already been resolved and that Thanksgiving had been floated as a possible target for completion . The market fallout has extended beyond Capitol Hill. The liquidity squeeze triggered by the shutdown, exacerbated by the U.S. Treasury General Account hoarding funds while agencies remain closed, has weighed heavily on risk assets. Bitcoin has retreated from recent highs , testing long-term support levels as investors navigate reduced market liquidity and uncertainty around fiscal policy. Meanwhile, prediction markets indicate growing skepticism about a quick resolution to the shutdown.

Related Reading: Cathie Wood Trims Her 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction To $1.2 Million – Here’s Why The Zcash price recently surged above $650 for the first time since 2018, with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. According to CoinGecko, daily trading volume has surpassed $1.88 billion, with strong liquidity across Binance, Hyperliquid, and Bybit. This momentum reflects a growing resurgence of interest in privacy-preserving technologies amid increasing concerns over financial surveillance. The Electric Coin Company’s (ECC) recent upgrades, including those under Project Tachyon, and the rising adoption of the Zashi wallet have revitalized investor confidence. Privacy Narrative and Technical Upgrades Drive Momentum The renewed enthusiasm around privacy coins mirrors a broader market shift. Zcash’s shielded transactions, powered by zk-SNARKs, now represent over 30% of its circulating supply, reducing liquid float and contributing to price stability. Its integration into DeFi ecosystems through tokenized versions on Solana and BNB Chain has also expanded ZEC’s reach, with over 16,000 wallets interacting with these assets. Prominent voices like Naval Ravikant and Arthur Hayes have championed Zcash’s role in the evolving privacy revolution, calling it “the missing piece for Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the Zcash Foundation maintains that the surge reflects genuine user demand rather than speculative hype. Futures data further supports this thesis, with balanced long-short ratios around 1.1, indicating sustained, organic buying interest rather than excessive leverage. ZEC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Can Zcash Price Hit $1,000 Next? Analysts Weigh In The current Zcash price rally has sparked debate over its next target. Technical charts indicate robust support between $500 and $520, while resistance is located near $580–$600. Analysts from CoinGlass and Galaxy Digital project a conservative range of $650 – $750 in the near term, with an optimistic scenario pushing toward $1,000 if momentum persists. The bullish thesis hinges on the strength of the privacy narrative, expanding institutional participation, and ZEC’s scarcity model, mirroring Bitcoin’s 21 million-coin cap. However, traders caution that overbought conditions and potential regulatory headwinds could trigger short-term pullbacks.

Transfers between the two nations, largely involving USDT stablecoins, have drawn scrutiny after Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit processed billions of won in suspicious transactions. Much of this capital reportedly flowed to Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian platform sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K. Experts say the spike underscores how stricter local enforcement in Korea has driven criminal syndicates offshore. “It’s extremely difficult to detect all suspicious transactions before they occur,” said Youchull Jung, a white-collar crime attorney at Lee & Ko. The transfers highlight how foreign jurisdictions like Cambodia and the Philippines have become new operational hubs for crypto-based scams. Seoul Weighs New Sanctions After U.S. Crackdown on North Korean Crypto Laundering The revelations come as South Korea reviews potential sanctions targeting North Korea’s cyber-financing networks. On November 7, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Ji-na confirmed that Seoul could “review sanctions as a measure if they are really needed,” emphasizing coordination with the United States to counter Pyongyang’s crypto theft operations. The U.S. Treasury recently sanctioned eight North Korean nationals and two entities, including the Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC) and Ryujong Credit Bank, for laundering stolen digital assets to fund weapons programs. Analysts, such as Tiger Research’s Ryan Yoon, note that while new measures may have a limited short-term impact, they signal intensified coordination between Seoul and Washington on curbing crypto-funded proliferation threats. Regulation Tightens as South Korea Leads in Compliance Reform South Korea’s crypto market, valued at over $84 billion, has become a test case for striking a balance between innovation and regulation. The 2024 Digital Asset Act and Travel Rule bolstered exchange oversight, but outdated foreign exchange laws have left cross-border crypto flows in a gray zone. Regulators now face the dual challenge of protecting investors while closing loopholes exploited by bad actors. Amid growing global scrutiny, Seoul’s stance could shape the future of crypto compliance across Asia. If South Korea tightens sanctions and AML controls further, analysts say it may catalyze a new era of coordinated digital finance enforcement, stretching from Washington to Phnom Penh, and turning the region’s crypto boom into a geopolitical battleground.

The move aligns with Meta’s AI strategy, focusing heavily on expanding data centers to fuel advanced AI development, including the pursuit of “superintelligence”, a dream of scientists in which AI systems surpass human-level reasoning. Meta’s three-year commitment Meta has increased its focus on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence, which is why it has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to build several large AI data centers while making plans for bigger outlays to meet the compute needs this super AI will no doubt require. The company has revealed plans to invest $1.5 billion in a data center in Texas, breaking ground on its 29th such facility globally, and also locked in a $27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund its Louisiana data center, its biggest project globally. In September, CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated the idea before U.S. President Donald Trump over a White House dinner when he claimed that Meta would invest “at least $600 billion” in the U.S. over the next several years. With its investments in the AI sector, Meta expects “notably larger” capital expenses next year. On the company’s recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because “it’s the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we’re prepared for the most optimistic cases.” However, Cryptopolitan has reported about the firm funneling a lot of funds into the AI sector as it struggles to outdo rivals like Alphabet and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, who are also developing huge data centers to power future AI models. Even Google has joined the fray as it has revealed plans to invest $15 billion on a data center project in southern India that will be the search giant’s largest AI hub in the world outside of the U.S. Meta’s deal with Blue Owl Capital Meta’s joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital is expected to fund and develop the social media company’s massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana . The deal states that the asset management firm will retain 80% of the joint venture, while Meta will own a 20% stake and oversee the construction and property management services of the data center, which is being built in Richland Parish, Louisiana. Blue Owl reportedly contributed about $7 billion in cash as part of the joint venture, and Meta got a one-time payout of $3 billion. With the partnership, Meta gets “the speed and flexibility” it needs to build the data center and support its “long-term AI ambitions,” the social media company said in a statement. Local utility Entergy informed CNBC in June that the new data center would require about twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day. The outfit will directly compete with the data centers OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank have come together to build under the Stargate joint venture, which has seen the three companies invest $500 billion.

Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, said in a post on X that long-term holders (LTHs), investors who hold Bitcoin for more than 155 days, have ramped up their selling in recent weeks, a common pattern during bull markets. “LTH take profits as prices reach new highs,” he wrote. But what stands out this time, according to Moreno, is the absence of strong demand to offset that selling. “What’s important to analyze each time is if there’s growing Bitcoin demand that can absorb the LTH selling at higher prices,” he added. The data shows that demand, which had been growing between July and September, turned negative in early October. “Since October, LTH selling has increased (nothing new here), but demand is contracting (red areas), unable to absorb LTH supply at higher prices,” Moreno said. Long-term Bitcoin holders into a low-demand market. Source: CryptoQuant Demand dries up as LTH selling rises In a chart shared by Moreno , Bitcoin’s short-term demand, measured by apparent demand metrics, has been trending in the red zone for roughly 30 days. This signals that fewer new buyers are entering the market, even as long-term investors take profits. The 1-year demand metric remains in positive territory, but the decline is becoming more visible. If the trend continues, Moreno noted, the 1-year demand growth could soon dip below zero. As of this week, both positive and negative apparent demand stand at roughly zero, while the 30-day long-term holder spending sits at around 790,000 BTC as of the time of writing. This means that, on balance, demand and supply are in a delicate standoff, with large volumes of Bitcoin being sold by experienced investors but insufficient fresh capital coming in to absorb the selling pressure. Bitcoin demand over the last 30 days. Source: CryptoQuant The data shared by Moreno on CryptoQuant showed that the two major sources of institutional demand, ETFs and Michael Saylor’s Strategy , are both showing weakness. ETF demand growth has dropped sharply into negative territory, while Strategy’s remains flat at zero. A different market from earlier rallies During January to February 2025 and again from November to December 2024, long-term holder selling coincided with rising demand, which is identified as “green areas” on the chart. Those periods led to record-breaking prices, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs. But this time, conditions appear less supportive, especially after the October 10 event that nearly brought the market to its knees; selling has picked up, but demand has failed to follow. What comes next for Bitcoin? Selling by long-term holders can signal a healthy profit-taking cycle that resets the market for the next leg up; however, the current market activity doesn’t agree with this thesis. Bitcoin prices have dropped by over 5% within the past seven days from about $110,000 to a bit above $103,000. For prices to climb, fresh demand, particularly from ETFs and institutional investors , will need to pick up. Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth remains positive on a yearly basis, which suggests that the structural demand for Bitcoin as an asset class remains intact. But if contraction continues and dips below zero, it could indicate the market is entering a cooling phase similar to mid-cycle consolidations seen in past bull markets.

Bitcoin has dropped as low as $100,500 today, while Ethereum has fallen to $3,293, which is a 26% drop in the past month. However, recent falls have much more to do with stock market jitters than cryptocurrency fundamentals, and most major tokens are now in such an oversold position that they should recover vigorously by the end of the year. Investors should also consider diversifying into new and presale tokens, with one high-momentum presale coin – PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – looking like it could go exponential once it launches. Top Crypto to Turn $100 into $10,000 – Don’t Miss This Potential 100x Setup As its name suggests, PEPENODE is another Pepe-themed meme token, although it doesn’t rely solely on the viral potential of Pepe-related memes and motifs. It also adds a unique selling point to the mix, with PEPENODE providing users with the ability to grow and run their own virtual mining rigs. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 In contrast to the expense of normal mining, which relies on expensive hardware and lots of electricity, the only thing PEPENODE’s mining requires is that users hold some PEPENODE. They can use the coin to buy more virtual mining nodes, with more nodes earning users greater rewards, which PEPENODE pays out in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. It’s as simple as that, while holders of PEPENODE can also stake the token for a regular staking income. Currently, PEPENODE’s annual yield stands at just over 600%, making the coin potentially very profitable. These features help to explain why the coin’s presale has really taken off since launching in September, and at the last count, PEPENODE has raised more than $2 million from excited investors. It will have a total supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with the coin running on the Ethereum blockchain. How to Buy PEPENODE Early: Presale Price at $0.0011363 and Rising Its presale will run for several more weeks, at which point PEPENODE will list. What’s exciting about this is that its launch may come just as the market begins to recover properly from its current slump. The arrival of altcoin ETFs in the next few weeks may provide the kind of market bullishness that will help propel PEPENODE higher, and which will drive demand for its original mining platform. Investors may therefore want to hurry now and buy PEPENODE in its presale, while it’s available at what may end up being a discount. They can do so by going to the official PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet. The coin is currently selling at $0.0011363, although this will rise every few days until the sale enters its final phase. If the timing is right, its listing on exchanges could coincide with a bull rally, with the combination of market-wide momentum and bullish fundamentals serving to push it higher. This is why it’s one of the top cryptos to buy right now, and could remain so for some time to come.

54147281,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88972,1762558203,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Is XRP a Good Buy? Projected Value of 5,000 XRP by 2035",https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-a-good-buy-projected-value-of-5000-xrp-by-2035/,"Investor interest in XRP has surged amid ongoing optimism about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Many community members are speculating on how modest holdings, such as 5,000 XRP, could generate substantial returns over the next decade. As of today, purchasing 5,000 XRP would require approximately $11,800, based on a market price of $2.36 per token. This represents a significant increase compared to last year, when the same amount of XRP cost roughly $2,500. This growth reflects the broader price gains XRP has experienced over the past 12 months. Although today’s price is elevated relative to last year, it remains lower than recent highs. In July, XRP traded at about $3.66, meaning 5,000 tokens would have cost close to $18,300. At the current price, the token is trading nearly 37% below that peak, presenting a potential entry point for investors who may have missed earlier gains. Analysts note that minor variations in purchase price are unlikely to significantly affect long-term outcomes if XRP appreciates substantially over the coming decade. Long-Term Projections for 5,000 XRP Estimating XRP’s future price remains inherently uncertain, but several industry forecasts suggest significant potential upside. Changelly predicts that XRP could reach $115 per token by December 2034. Under this projection, an investment of 5,000 XRP today would be valued at approximately $575,000 by then. A more conservative forecast from Telegaon sets XRP at around $87 per coin by 2035, which would place the value of 5,000 tokens at roughly $435,000. Even this moderate estimate represents a substantial return over ten years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some market commentators envision even more dramatic growth. For example, Matthew Brienen, COO of CryptoCharged, suggested that XRP could reach $1,000 per token by 2035. If this occurs, 5,000 XRP could be worth $5 million, offering investors a significant opportunity for wealth accumulation. Possibility of XRP Surpassing $1,000 While projections above $1,000 remain ambitious, exchanges such as Changelly anticipate that XRP might not reach those levels until closer to 2040, potentially trading as high as $2,138 per token. At that valuation, 5,000 XRP would exceed $10.6 million. Although precise price forecasts cannot be guaranteed, the prevailing sentiment among XRP supporters is that the token’s current market price underrepresents its long-term potential. Many investors see this as an opportunity to acquire XRP at a relatively favourable level in anticipation of significant future growth. The current cost of 5,000 XRP offers a tangible benchmark for investors considering long-term positions. Depending on market adoption, institutional involvement, and broader crypto trends, this holding could increase substantially by 2035. Even conservative projections suggest notable appreciation, reinforcing the view that XRP remains an asset of interest for long-term portfolios.

The altcoin has struggled with lapse adoption over the past year: Stablecoin supply remains at 30 million despite the GENIUS act, and its Total Value Locked (TVL) trails newer chains. Hoskinson attributes Mignight as the solution, citing it to be the “biggest launches in the crypto industry” six years in the making during a recent X Q&A .

He claims it has already attracted over 80 deals with many developers who have sidelined Cardano in the past, including Sundae Labs, Maestro, OpenZeppelin, and Fluid Tokens. Popular X analyst Ali Martinez added technical backing to the optimism, highlighting a critical support retest at $0.51, a level that has repeatedly marked local bottoms over the past year. $0.52 is a support level that has triggered strong rebounds for Cardano $ADA since November 2024. pic.twitter.com/8HdaiayxYO — Ali (@ali_charts) November 5, 2025 If this support once again holds as a launchpad, Martinez expects a retest of key resistance at $1.15, this year’s high, signaling the potential start of a new bull run. Cardano Price Analysis: $1.15 Could Just be the Start The historical year-long resistance noted by Martinez contributes to a wider descending triangle pattern, setting much grander targets.

The RSI has rebounded from the 30 oversold threshold, often a marker of local bottoms, while the MACD levels off in the early stages of a potential trend shift. Buy pressure is building.

This isn’t just random market movement – it’s a powerful signal that smart investors are watching closely. According to leading macroeconomics and crypto analyst Andreas Steno Larsen, this crypto rebound pattern reveals crucial information about where liquidity is flowing in global markets. What Does This Crypto Rebound Actually Mean? When cryptocurrencies recover before traditional stocks, it typically indicates that new money is entering the digital asset space first. This crypto rebound pattern suggests several important market dynamics: Investors see crypto as higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities Digital assets respond faster to changing market conditions Institutional money may be diversifying into crypto Market sentiment is shifting toward digital assets Why Does Liquidity Matter for Your Investments? Liquidity inflow represents the lifeblood of financial markets. When money moves into cryptocurrencies ahead of traditional stocks, it signals that investors perceive stronger growth potential in digital assets. This crypto rebound phenomenon isn’t just technical analysis – it reflects real capital allocation decisions being made by both retail and institutional investors. How Can You Spot Genuine Crypto Rebound Signals? Not every price increase represents meaningful liquidity inflow. True crypto rebound patterns show specific characteristics that distinguish them from ordinary market fluctuations. Look for sustained upward movement across multiple major cryptocurrencies, accompanied by increasing trading volumes and positive fundamental developments in the space. What Challenges Come With This Trend? While this crypto rebound pattern offers exciting opportunities, investors should remain aware of potential challenges: Higher volatility compared to traditional markets Regulatory uncertainties in some jurisdictions Need for thorough research before investing Importance of proper risk management strategies Actionable Insights for Smart Investors Understanding this crypto rebound pattern can help you make more informed investment decisions. Consider diversifying your portfolio to include both traditional and digital assets. Monitor liquidity indicators regularly, and remember that while crypto markets move quickly, sustainable growth requires patience and strategic thinking. The current market dynamics reveal a fascinating shift in how investors allocate capital. This crypto rebound ahead of traditional stocks demonstrates growing confidence in digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. As liquidity continues flowing into cryptocurrency markets, staying informed about these patterns becomes increasingly crucial for anyone interested in modern finance. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a crypto rebound? A crypto rebound occurs when cryptocurrency prices recover significantly after a downturn, often signaling renewed investor interest and capital inflow. Why does crypto rebound before stocks? Cryptocurrencies typically react faster to market changes due to their 24/7 trading nature and higher risk-reward profile that attracts capital during recovery periods. How reliable is this rebound signal? While not foolproof, consistent patterns of crypto rebounding ahead of stocks have historically indicated liquidity shifts, though always verify with other market indicators. Should I invest based on this signal alone? No, this should be one of many factors in your investment decision-making process, combined with fundamental analysis and risk assessment. How long do these rebound periods typically last? Rebound durations vary widely, from several weeks to months, depending on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Which cryptocurrencies show the strongest rebound patterns? Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead rebound movements, followed by other established altcoins with strong fundamentals. Found this analysis helpful?

The Fear and Greed Index hovered around 21, suggesting risk appetite remains thin despite new activity in sectors linked to AI, storage, and infrastructure. Filecoin, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET, and Near Protocol each gained sharply, offering a narrow but telling view of where investors are concentrating during an uncertain phase of the cycle. Filecoin Extends Rally on Ecosystem and AI Ties Filecoin rose about 69% in 24 hours to around $2.34 , lifting its market capitalization above $1.66 billion. The move follows a series of ecosystem upgrades and rising expectations ahead of developer events later this month. The network recently introduced a gas fee cut of about 50%, which coincided with an increase in new deals and overall utilization. The chain’s positioning in decentralized storage has become increasingly tied to AI and DePIN discussions. The combination of lower costs and real data workloads has helped traders view Filecoin as a platform that could anchor decentralized compute growth. Market data also show deeper order books and rising open interest, an early indication that trading participation is extending beyond short-term speculation. . @FilFoundation and GSR Foundation support a cohort of projects that apply decentralized storage for public good. The new infographic outlines how this collaboration funds work in science, art, and human rights through verifiable data infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/ir4COLsnoP — Filecoin (@Filecoin) November 6, 2025 FET Gains From Renewed AI Momentum Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET traded near $0.32 after a 49% rise in 24 hours. The token, which links decentralized AI compute and automation services, continues to act as a liquid expression of AI enthusiasm within crypto. FET Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The alliance’s integration of multiple machine learning projects under one token remains a key draw for traders who seek AI exposure without relying on equity markets. The current flow resembles previous cycles of AI enthusiasm but now aligns more closely with infrastructure-backed narratives such as Filecoin’s. The shared theme of data, compute, and protocol-level utility has kept both assets near the top of watchlists heading into the weekend. Near Protocol Tracks Onchain Activity Near Protocol advanced about 26% to $2.5 , continuing a steady climb that began earlier in the week. On-chain data show consistent user activity and growth in wallet counts, while recent reports have pointed to higher transaction throughput and continued integration of application-layer projects. Traders have grouped NEAR alongside other large layer-one chains that demonstrate concrete network demand even during weak sentiment. Its inclusion in conversations around AI-compatible infrastructure has added to speculative interest, helping maintain liquidity in key trading pairs. Altcoin Season in Fear The Altcoin Season Index remains around 26, well below levels associated with wide participation. Despite that, targeted rallies in tokens such as Filecoin, FET, and Near suggest that capital is rotating selectively toward networks with real economic use cases and active development. The following weeks in November will test whether enthusiasm for decentralized compute and AI-linked assets can expand beyond a few leaders or remain confined to isolated bursts of trading momentum. If current liquidity holds while volatility eases into the weekend, these sectors may continue to attract attention even while most of the market stays risk-averse.

This comes as educational programs, such as My First Bitcoin, have become a crucial bridge for citizens unfamiliar with cryptocurrency around the world. The association is now announcing that it will transition from providing in-classroom support locally in El Salvador to supporting teachers and programs internationally. The Founder, John Dennehy, said the move shows where they are heading in the long term. “Our ambition was always to change the world, but we had to start with a single student, then a single city, then a single nation,” Dennehy said. “Now we are ready to raise the potential impact from 6 million people to 8 billion.” My First Bitcoin was founded as an independent nonprofit in 2021, during El Salvador’s early adoption of Bitcoin. It provided free, beginner-friendly classes for students, community groups, and adults. The program eventually created a formalized “Bitcoin Diploma” and trained local instructors to teach the classes. At the time of the announcement, the organization had taught more than 27,000 students in person, with the majority being public school youth. Partnership dissolves as El Salvador changes its Bitcoin policy Through the program’s partnership with the Ministry of Education, Bitcoin education will become available throughout the country in public schools. My First Bitcoin College sent out its curriculum to schools in 2024, following the publication of its diploma-style syllabus, which was developed in collaboration with the Ministry in 2023. They ultimately flamed out in April 2025. The government provided no specific reason for halting the initiative, but Arnold Hubach, Director of Communication at My First Bitcoin, stated that no new program will be introduced. The announcement marked another in a series of policy reversals on Bitcoin in El Salvador, which followed financial discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion IMF bailout in December 2024, which pledged to wind down Bitcoin projects and halt the government’s regulatory purchases of BTC. In January 2025, legislators revised the nation’s Bitcoin law, allowing businesses to opt in or out of accepting Bitcoin. Later in mid-2025 , the IMF reported that El Salvador had not purchased any new Bitcoin since the financing deal was signed — although an official website for the Bitcoin Office still advertises its ongoing purchases. The government’s reported Bitcoin treasury currently stands at approximately 6,374 BTC, which is valued at $654.8 million, according to current prices and public data on the Bitcoin Office website. A chapter closes, but the work goes on It’s on-the-ground time in El Salvador may be over, but My First Bitcoin says its mission remains the same. The organization aims to advise teachers and activists in other countries who wish to introduce Bitcoin education into schools, community centres, and informal learning environments. The group’s curriculum has already been implemented or piloted in Argentina, Costa Rica, Colombia, and other locations in Africa and Europe. Through the new pivot, My First Bitcoin aims to create an online learning network worldwide, rather than being a single centre. While My First Bitcoin may no longer run classes on Salvadoran soil, its mission is now more ambitious than ever: to teach billions of people worldwide how to navigate the world of Bitcoin safely and responsibly, starting with teachers and students who will carry the knowledge forward in their communities.

This move could open doors for mainstream investors to access XRP through regulated channels, simplifying the investment process. If approved, it would represent a significant step forward in bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency markets. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader ecosystem. What Is an XRP Spot ETF and Why Does It Matter? An XRP spot ETF allows investors to buy shares that directly track the price of XRP, making it easier to gain exposure without holding the actual cryptocurrency. This structure reduces the complexities of wallets and private keys, appealing to those who prefer familiar investment vehicles. Moreover, it enhances liquidity and could stabilize XRP’s market value by attracting institutional capital. Therefore, the 21Shares proposal could democratize access to XRP, fostering wider adoption. How Does the 21Shares XRP Spot ETF Filing Process Work? 21Shares filed a Form 8-A with the SEC, triggering a 20-day review period where regulators assess its compliance and risks. This step is crucial because it involves scrutiny under U.S. securities laws, which have been a hurdle for similar crypto products. Success here could set a precedent for other digital assets, encouraging more filings. However, challenges remain, such as regulatory uncertainty and market volatility, which could delay approval. What Are the Key Benefits of an XRP Spot ETF? Investors stand to gain several advantages from this development. For instance: Accessibility : Enables easy investment through traditional brokerage accounts. Security : Reduces risks associated with self-custody of digital assets. Transparency : Offers regulated pricing and reporting, building trust. Additionally, an XRP spot ETF could boost XRP’s legitimacy, potentially increasing its value over time. This aligns with growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. What Challenges Could This XRP Spot ETF Face? Despite the optimism, obstacles like SEC skepticism and legal disputes around XRP’s classification might slow progress. The regulatory landscape is evolving, and past rejections of crypto ETFs highlight the need for clear guidelines. Moreover, market sentiment can shift quickly, affecting timing and success. Nevertheless, 21Shares’ expertise in crypto ETPs positions them well to navigate these hurdles. How Might This Impact the Future of Crypto Investing? If approved, the XRP spot ETF could inspire similar products for other cryptocurrencies, accelerating mainstream adoption. It signals a maturation of the market, where digital assets integrate seamlessly with traditional finance. For investors, this means more choices and potentially lower barriers to entry. Ultimately, it paves the way for a more inclusive financial system. In summary, 21Shares’ XRP spot ETF filing is a pivotal moment that could reshape how we invest in cryptocurrencies. By combining innovation with regulatory compliance, it offers a promising path forward. Stay informed as this story develops—it might just be the breakthrough the crypto world needs.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed an explosive Filecoin price surge that left traders stunned. Overnight, FIL skyrocketed nearly 80%, climbing to nearly $4 on major exchanges and creating waves across the crypto space. What Triggered This Massive Filecoin Price Surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the Filecoin price surge began with a sharp rally that pushed FIL to $3.973 on Binance’s FIL/USDT trading pair. This remarkable movement occurred around 6:00 p.m. UTC, showcasing how quickly cryptocurrency markets can transform. The token has since settled around $3.3, still representing massive gains from the previous day’s trading levels. Several factors likely contributed to this impressive Filecoin price surge: Growing adoption of decentralized storage solutions Increased institutional interest in Web3 infrastructure projects Technical breakout from previous resistance levels Positive market sentiment toward utility tokens Why Does This Filecoin Price Surge Matter? This substantial Filecoin price surge represents more than just numbers on a chart. It signals renewed confidence in decentralized storage networks and their real-world applications. Filecoin’s core technology enables users to store data securely across a distributed network, creating a marketplace for digital storage that challenges traditional cloud services. The timing of this Filecoin price surge coincides with increasing concerns about data privacy and centralized control. As more users seek alternatives to conventional cloud storage, Filecoin’s value proposition becomes increasingly relevant. This rally demonstrates that investors recognize the long-term potential of decentralized infrastructure projects. What Can We Learn From This Filecoin Price Movement? This dramatic Filecoin price surge teaches us several important lessons about cryptocurrency investing. First, utility tokens with real-world applications can experience sudden growth spurts when market conditions align. Second, the decentralized storage sector continues to gain traction among both retail and institutional investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that such rapid price movements often include corrections. The Filecoin price surge saw some retracement from its peak, which is typical in volatile crypto markets. Smart investors use these opportunities to assess their positions and make informed decisions. What’s Next After This Filecoin Price Surge? Looking forward, the sustainability of this Filecoin price surge will depend on several factors. Continued adoption of the Filecoin network, partnerships with major companies, and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment will all play roles in determining whether these gains hold. The Filecoin price surge also highlights the importance of monitoring fundamental metrics beyond just price. Network usage, storage capacity, and developer activity provide better indicators of long-term value than short-term price movements alone. Conclusion: Understanding the Filecoin Phenomenon The remarkable Filecoin price surge demonstrates the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets and the growing importance of decentralized storage solutions. While short-term volatility is expected, the underlying technology continues to evolve and attract users worldwide. This event serves as a powerful reminder that innovation in blockchain technology extends far beyond financial applications to include practical solutions for everyday digital needs. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the Filecoin price surge? The Filecoin price surge likely resulted from combined factors including growing adoption of decentralized storage, positive market sentiment toward utility tokens, and technical breakout patterns. How high did FIL price reach during the surge? FIL reached $3.973 on Binance’s FIL/USDT trading pair during the peak of the price surge before settling around $3.3. Is Filecoin a good investment after this price surge? While the Filecoin price surge shows strong momentum, all cryptocurrency investments carry risk. Research the technology, market position, and your risk tolerance before investing. What is Filecoin used for? Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that allows users to store data securely across a distributed system, creating a marketplace for digital storage. Can the Filecoin price surge continue? Future price movements depend on multiple factors including adoption rates, market conditions, and technological developments within the Filecoin ecosystem. Where can I track Filecoin price movements? You can monitor FIL prices on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and through market tracking platforms like Bitcoin World.

His remarks highlight a recurring behavioral pattern in cryptocurrency markets, where investors often overreact to price corrections despite long-term gains. Historical Performance Context Currently, XRP is trading at approximately $2.36 , down over 10% in the last 7 days, during a challenging phase for the broader cryptocurrency market. The token’s market capitalization has declined to $132.87 billion, representing a drop of more than $82 billion from its July peak of $216.69 billion. Despite this recent downward trend , XRP has appreciated by 346% since November 2024, indicating significant gains over the past year. Diep Sanh emphasized that market participants frequently overlook such long-term progress during temporary pullbacks. Historically, XRP has experienced extended periods of volatility. After reaching $3.31 in January 2018, the token fell below $1 and remained mostly between $0.30 and $0.70 for nearly seven years. Brief spikes, such as $1.96 in April 2021, were followed by subsequent declines, illustrating the cyclical nature of investor sentiment. By 2070, you guys will be shitting your pants when XRP drops from $1,200 to $1,000 — BD (@DiepSanh) November 6, 2025 Investor Reactions in Extreme Scenarios In his commentary, Sanh projected that around the year 2070, XRP could reach $1,200 and later correct to $1,000. Although this would represent a 44,743% increase from the current price, he anticipates that investors would likely overreact, treating the decline as a loss rather than a milestone of long-term growth. Sanh’s point underlines a key aspect of investor psychology: even when holding a position with massive overall gains, market participants often focus on short-term losses. This behavior, according to Sanh, mirrors the patterns observed during previous XRP cycles, where investors panicked at temporary declines despite multi-year growth. Current Market Downturn The ongoing correction has reignited similar concerns. Following the November 2024 rally that pushed XRP above $3.40, the token now trades primarily between $2 and $3. Investors who purchased during the post-rally peak may currently face unrealized losses, which have contributed to heightened anxiety in the community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts view the current dip as a potential opportunity to accumulate XRP at lower prices. Some suggest that those unable to acquire XRP below $2 may soon have another chance, arguing that the ongoing correction could serve as a period of consolidation before the next potential rally. Overall, Sanh’s commentary emphasizes the importance of understanding market psychology alongside price movements. Even in a scenario where XRP achieves extraordinary long-term valuations, short-term volatility may still trigger strong emotional reactions among investors. For current and prospective XRP holders, the lesson is clear: historical trends show that temporary declines are common, and a long-term perspective is essential to navigate periods of volatility while maintaining confidence in the asset’s growth potential.

54149511,623508,1762560056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54149511.jpeg,Bitcoin Looks Overextended As Ethereum Shows Early Signs Of Accumulation – Capital Shift?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-overextended-ethereum-shows-accumulation/,"Bitcoin is once again testing critical support levels after briefly losing the $100,000 mark on Tuesday, raising questions about whether the market is entering the late stages of the current cycle. Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin continues to appear overheated, while Ethereum seems to be sending a different, more resilient signal. The overall market tone has become increasingly complex. On one side, Bitcoin’s relentless rally over recent months has many traders believing the bull run is nearing its end. Across social media and trading communities, the sentiment is clear: “The bull run is almost over.” and “There won’t be another alt season.” This growing skepticism reflects widespread caution among investors who fear that BTC’s parabolic advance could soon lead to exhaustion. However, beneath the surface, Ethereum’s quiet strength and on-chain activity hint at possible capital rotation or hidden accumulation — signaling that the cycle may not be entirely over. The divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies highlights a shifting market structure , where traders must now navigate increased volatility, fading euphoria, and mixed technical signals. Diverging Signals Between Bitcoin And Ethereum Fund Premiums According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Woominkyu, a subtle yet notable divergence has emerged between Bitcoin and Ethereum fund premiums — a dynamic that could reveal the next market rotation. The data shows that the Ethereum Fund Market Premium has been rising quietly, even as ETH’s price struggles around the $3,300 level. This indicates growing institutional interest in Ethereum despite its weaker spot performance. In contrast, Bitcoin’s fund premium has remained flat, showing little change even after weeks of strong price movement. This behavior suggests that while BTC continues to dominate retail and media attention, institutional demand has not accelerated in tandem — a potential sign of market fatigue or strategic capital repositioning. This divergence is not clearly bullish or bearish. It might represent early accumulation in Ethereum funds, signaling an upcoming rotation into altcoins, or simply temporary imbalances in demand between major crypto instruments. What’s evident, however, is that market sentiment and institutional behavior are no longer aligned. Bitcoin’s momentum is driving the narrative, but Ethereum’s quiet accumulation under the surface could be the first hint of shifting capital flows — setting the stage for a more complex and potentially surprising next phase in the market cycle. ETH/BTC Tests Multi-Year Support Amid Persistent Weakness The ETH/BTC pair continues to display structural weakness, currently trading around 0.0327 BTC, after failing to maintain its brief recovery attempt toward 0.04 BTC. The weekly chart shows Ethereum struggling to regain strength against Bitcoin, suggesting that the capital rotation remains heavily tilted toward BTC dominance. Since mid-2022, ETH/BTC has been in a persistent downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows — a clear sign of relative underperformance. The pair’s latest rejection near the 100-week moving average further reinforces this bearish structure. For Ethereum to regain momentum, a sustained move above the 0.037–0.038 BTC zone would be crucial, as this region aligns with both technical resistance and previous breakdown levels. However, there are early signs of potential stabilization. Volume patterns show accumulation near the 0.03 BTC zone, which coincides with the 2021 pre-bull run consolidation range — historically, a strong demand area. If Bitcoin consolidates around $100K and market sentiment improves, Ethereum could stage a rebound in this pair, possibly signaling the beginning of a slow capital rotation back into altcoins. For now, though, BTC dominance remains firm, and ETH’s relative weakness underscores the cautious mood across the broader crypto market.

Bulls are attempting to defend key support zones, but so far, momentum remains weak and upside recovery efforts have failed to gain traction. Despite this, no clear sign of a deeper breakdown has emerged, suggesting that the market could still be in a consolidation phase rather than entering a new bearish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Aggressively: 394K ETH Worth $1.37B In Just 3 Days In the midst of this volatility, Sharplink Gaming — notably one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to adopt a treasury strategy centered around Ethereum — has made significant on-chain moves during the recent downturn. This activity comes at a time when market sentiment has turned fearful and liquidity across exchanges has thinned, hinting that institutional actors may be positioning strategically amid the chaos. While the broader market remains on edge following Bitcoin’s dip below $100K, Ethereum’s network fundamentals and corporate adoption trends continue to attract long-term attention. Sharplink’s recent actions underscore the growing institutional role in ETH markets — and may signal that some players see opportunity where others see risk. Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Moves Signal Strategic Positioning According to data from Arkham shared by Lookonchain, a wallet linked to Sharplink Gaming made a significant move during the latest market correction. The wallet redeemed 5,284 ETH, valued at roughly $17.52 million, and subsequently deposited 4,364 ETH ($14.47 million) into OKX just four hours ago. The company’s total Ethereum holdings have risen to 859,395 ETH, now worth approximately $3.58 billion at current market prices. This makes Sharplink one of the most prominent institutional ETH holders, reinforcing its conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value despite short-term volatility. The move sparked debate among analysts, as the OKX deposit could imply either profit-taking or liquidity repositioning, depending on the company’s broader risk management strategy. However, given Sharplink’s consistent Ethereum accumulation and public alignment with blockchain-based initiatives, the transaction may instead represent active portfolio rebalancing during market stress — a sign of confidence rather than retreat. As Ethereum struggles to stabilize above $3,300, institutional moves like these highlight that smart money remains engaged, potentially setting the foundation for a stronger recovery once market sentiment improves and macro conditions stabilize.

The daily chart shows ETH attempting to stabilize above its 200-day moving average (red line) — a historically significant support zone that has served as a reversal area in previous market cycles. However, the broader structure remains fragile. Ethereum continues to trade below both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating that short- and mid-term momentum remains bearish. Bulls must reclaim the $3,400–$3,500 zone to confirm a stronger recovery, as this area represents both a psychological level and the point where the 50-day MA could act as dynamic resistance.

This development marks a turning point for Bitcoin education globally, affecting thousands of students and signaling new directions for cryptocurrency adoption. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Education in El Salvador? The partnership termination means the immediate suspension of educational programs that had successfully reached approximately 27,000 Salvadoran students. This Bitcoin education program represented one of the most ambitious national cryptocurrency literacy efforts worldwide. The initiative concluded in April 2024, leaving many wondering about the future of cryptocurrency education in the region. Before the partnership ended, the program achieved remarkable success in teaching students about: Bitcoin fundamentals and blockchain technology Digital wallet management and security Practical cryptocurrency applications Financial literacy through digital assets How Will the Global Bitcoin Education Rebrand Work? Following the partnership conclusion, My First Bitcoin announced plans to rebrand as a global Bitcoin education initiative. This strategic move indicates a shift from country-specific programs to worldwide cryptocurrency education. The rebranding represents an exciting evolution in Bitcoin education methodology and reach. The global approach offers several advantages: Broader audience reach across multiple countries Diverse educational content adaptation Increased accessibility through digital platforms Standardized Bitcoin education curriculum What’s Happening with El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy? While the educational partnership ended, El Salvador continues making headlines with its Bitcoin adoption strategy. The government claims to have purchased one Bitcoin daily since November 18, 2022, accumulating over 900 BTC. However, recent reports from the International Monetary Fund present conflicting information. The IMF’s report on its loan agreement with El Salvador indicates the country hasn’t purchased any Bitcoin since December 2023. This contradiction raises questions about: Transparency in national Bitcoin acquisitions Economic impact of cryptocurrency investments Future Bitcoin adoption strategies International financial oversight Why Does Quality Bitcoin Education Matter? Effective Bitcoin education serves as the foundation for responsible cryptocurrency adoption. The My First Bitcoin initiative demonstrated how structured educational programs can: Build financial literacy from early stages Promote safe cryptocurrency practices Encourage technological understanding Support economic innovation The global rebrand of this Bitcoin education program suggests continued commitment to these principles, just through different implementation methods. This evolution in Bitcoin education delivery could potentially reach even more students worldwide. What Can We Learn From This Transition? The partnership conclusion between My First Bitcoin and El Salvador offers valuable insights for cryptocurrency education initiatives. It highlights the importance of adaptable educational models and the need for sustainable Bitcoin education frameworks. The transition to a global approach may actually strengthen long-term Bitcoin education efforts by diversifying delivery methods and audience reach. Key takeaways include: Partnership models require careful planning Global approaches offer scalability benefits Continuous adaptation is crucial in crypto education Multiple delivery methods enhance accessibility Frequently Asked Questions Why did My First Bitcoin end its partnership with El Salvador? The specific reasons haven’t been publicly detailed, but the initiative is transitioning to a global Bitcoin education model rather than country-specific programs. How many students were affected by this change? Approximately 27,000 Salvadoran students who had been participating in the Bitcoin education program were affected by the suspension. When did the partnership officially end? The educational partnership concluded in April 2024, according to available reports. What happens to El Salvador’s Bitcoin education now? While My First Bitcoin programs are suspended, other initiatives or government programs might continue Bitcoin education efforts in the country. How will the global rebrand affect Bitcoin education? The rebrand aims to make Bitcoin education accessible worldwide through digital platforms and adapted content for different regions. Is El Salvador still buying Bitcoin daily? While the government claims continuous purchases, IMF reports suggest no Bitcoin acquisitions since December 2023, creating uncertainty about current practices.

According to Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer, the answer might surprise you. As gold’s impressive rally shows signs of slowing, Bitcoin appears ready to seize the opportunity and potentially deliver superior returns to investors seeking alternative assets. Why Bitcoin Could Outperform Gold Now Jurrien Timmer recently shared his compelling analysis on social media platform X, presenting a fascinating perspective on these two popular alternative assets. He suggests that gold and Bitcoin aren’t necessarily competitors but rather teammates playing different positions. However, the current market dynamics might position Bitcoin to outperform gold in the near term. The key insight comes from examining Sharpe ratios, which measure risk-adjusted returns. Timmer observed that these ratios for Bitcoin and gold have been moving in opposite directions recently. This divergence signals that Bitcoin could outperform gold as it evolves into a more mature asset class. What Makes Bitcoin Positioned to Outperform? Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s potential to outperform gold during gold price corrections: Growing institutional acceptance as a legitimate asset class Improved market infrastructure and regulatory clarity Digital native characteristics appealing to younger investors Scarcity value with predictable supply schedule As Bitcoin continues its maturation process, these attributes strengthen its case to potentially outperform gold during specific market conditions. The digital asset’s correlation with technology adoption and its appeal to digital-first investors create unique advantages that traditional gold cannot match. The Team Player Dynamic: Bitcoin and Gold Together Timmer’s ‘same team’ analogy provides crucial context. Rather than viewing Bitcoin and gold as direct competitors, investors should consider how they complement each other in a diversified portfolio. While both serve as alternative assets and potential inflation hedges, they attract different investor demographics and respond to different market catalysts. However, when gold experiences price corrections, Bitcoin’s digital nature and growth potential might enable it to outperform gold. This doesn’t mean gold becomes irrelevant, but rather that Bitcoin could capture more attention and capital during specific market phases. What This Means for Your Investment Strategy For investors considering whether Bitcoin could outperform gold in their portfolios, several actionable insights emerge: Diversification matters – Both assets have roles to play Monitor Sharpe ratios for timing decisions Consider maturity timeline for investment horizon Watch institutional flows as validation signals The possibility that Bitcoin could outperform gold represents a significant shift in how investors view digital versus traditional alternative assets. As institutional players like Fidelity provide this type of analysis, it adds credibility to Bitcoin’s investment case. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin’s Evolution Continues As Bitcoin continues evolving from speculative digital token to established asset class, its potential to outperform gold becomes more plausible. The key factors to watch include: Regulatory developments and clarity Institutional adoption rates Market infrastructure improvements Global macroeconomic conditions These elements will determine whether Bitcoin can consistently outperform gold or if the relationship remains situational and timing-dependent. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Sharpe ratio and why does it matter? The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns, helping investors understand how much return they’re getting for each unit of risk taken. Higher ratios indicate better risk-adjusted performance. Does this mean I should sell my gold and buy Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Both assets can play important roles in a diversified portfolio. The analysis suggests Bitcoin might outperform during specific market conditions, but gold remains a valuable diversifier. How mature is Bitcoin as an asset class compared to gold? Bitcoin is still maturing but has made significant progress. Gold has centuries of history, while Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance has grown dramatically in recent years. What risks should I consider with Bitcoin investments? Bitcoin carries volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, technological risks, and market liquidity concerns that differ from gold’s risk profile. Can both Bitcoin and gold perform well simultaneously? Absolutely. Both can thrive in environments of monetary uncertainty, inflation concerns, or geopolitical instability, though they may respond to different catalysts. How reliable are predictions about Bitcoin outperforming gold? Like all market predictions, they involve uncertainty. However, analysis from established institutions like Fidelity carries weight due to their research resources and market experience. Found this analysis insightful?

For anyone hunting the best cryptos to buy now , the story begins with established names like LINK and TRX gaining real-world heft and ends with an under-the-radar presale ready to gang up on the scene. Now the spotlight shifts to MOBU crypto, which is staging its presale in full force, offering early-bird access to those who feel like they missed previous moonshots. With Stage 6 live at a rock-bottom price, it’s time to decide whether to join the charging bull or stay on the sidelines watching. MOBU Crypto: The Best Crypto to Buy Now, Standing Out Among the Crowds MOBU crypto is quickly emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy now , fueled by excitement and solid fundamentals. Its MOBU crypto presale is live in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with a projected listing price of $0.00616, signaling a potential 7,244% ROI. With over $550K raised and 1,900+ holders already onboard, the project is turning serious heads across the crypto scene. The tokenomics keep things bullish: a fixed supply, 2% reflections, 2% auto-liquidity, and 1% burn model ensure long-term sustainability. Staking opens at Stage 10 with rewards up to 95% APY. For example, a $300 investment could turn into roughly $22,000 at listing, while $1,000 might climb to about $73,000, showing how early entries can make all the difference. Each presale stage increases the price by 27.40%, making this a first-come, first-served rush. For anyone who missed past moonshots, MOBU crypto offers that long-awaited second chance, standing tall among the best cryptos to buy now with real momentum, utility, and a bull-ready community.

Monthly leaderboards reward top referrers with juicy USDC prizes, making every invite worth the hustle. With over 8 billion $MOBU fueling this initiative, every connection strengthens the ecosystem. MoonBull’s growth isn’t just organic; it’s community-powered and financially electrifying. Chainlink News: LINK Trades at $15.03 as Institutional Demand Grows Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $15.03, up 0.78% in the last 24 hours, as its ecosystem sees growing adoption across DeFi and real-world asset platforms. The network powers over $95 billion in secured value across 700 oracle networks, with major institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Euroclear integrating LINK for tokenized asset solutions. LINK’s market capitalization is $10.48 billion, with a circulating supply of 696.8 million tokens, highlighting its strong presence in blockchain infrastructure and data validation. TRON Price Today: TRX Trades at $0.286 as DeFi and Content Ecosystem Expands TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.286, down 0.17% over the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $27.08 billion. The blockchain continues to expand its ecosystem, supporting over 2.6 million daily users, $4.8 billion in total value locked (TVL), and a 65% share of global retail USDT transfers under $1K. Key developments like the GreatVoyage v4.8.1 mainnet upgrade enhance ARM and JDK 17 support, improve EVM compatibility, and further TRON’s smart contract and DeFi adoption. Final Words Chainlink and TRON both bring serious credentials, infrastructure, adoption, and resilience, but if the objective is to find the best cryptos to buy now with explosive upside then MOBU crypto brings a very different flavour. Chainlink delivers stability and TRON scale, both of which are valuable for portfolios, but their upside is likely more muted than that of early-stage presale plays.

The cryptocurrency’s unexpected downturn has left many investors scratching their heads. However, the real story behind this Bitcoin price weakness might surprise you. Contrary to popular belief, the selling pressure isn’t coming from where most people think. What’s Really Causing Bitcoin Price Weakness? Recent analysis reveals a startling truth about Bitcoin’s market movements. According to Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas, the recent Bitcoin price weakness has minimal connection to ETF outflows. Instead, the real pressure comes from within the crypto community itself. This internal selling represents a significant shift in market dynamics that every investor should understand. The ETF Outflow Myth Debunked Many investors assumed that ETF redemptions were driving the market downturn. However, the numbers tell a different story. During the recent correction period: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded less than $1 billion in net outflows This represents only about 0.5% of total assets under management Baby boomer investors in these ETFs proved to be serious holders This data clearly shows that the Bitcoin price weakness cannot be attributed to ETF investors abandoning ship. Internal Selling: The Real Culprit Behind Bitcoin’s Decline Balchunas perfectly captured the situation by comparing it to a classic horror movie trope: ‘the call is coming from inside the house.’ The real selling pressure originates from established crypto participants rather than new institutional investors. This internal dynamic explains much of the recent Bitcoin price weakness that has concerned market observers. Long-Term Holders Take Profits Supporting evidence from CryptoQuant reveals staggering numbers. During the recent correction: Long-term holders sold approximately 405,000 BTC This represents over $41.3 billion in value These were holders who maintained positions for over 155 days This massive internal selling directly contributed to the Bitcoin price weakness we’ve observed. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Understanding the true source of Bitcoin price weakness provides valuable insights for strategic planning. The market dynamics suggest that traditional crypto participants are taking profits rather than new investors fleeing. This distinction matters because it indicates underlying strength in institutional adoption while highlighting natural market cycles. Navigating Future Market Movements Recognizing the patterns behind Bitcoin price weakness helps investors make informed decisions. The current situation demonstrates that even during corrections, institutional interest remains relatively stable. Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to play a significant role in price discovery through their strategic selling decisions. The recent Bitcoin price weakness tells a fascinating story about market maturity. Rather than signaling fundamental problems, the internal selling indicates natural profit-taking by experienced holders. This understanding should provide confidence to investors concerned about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. The market’s ability to absorb such significant internal selling while maintaining relative stability speaks volumes about Bitcoin’s growing resilience. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is causing Bitcoin’s recent price decline? The primary cause appears to be profit-taking by long-term holders rather than ETF outflows or institutional selling. How much Bitcoin did long-term holders sell? Data shows approximately 405,000 BTC worth over $41.3 billion was sold by holders who had maintained positions for more than 155 days. Are Bitcoin ETFs seeing significant outflows? No, ETF outflows accounted for less than $1 billion, representing only about 0.5% of total assets under management. Who are the main sellers in the current market? The selling pressure comes primarily from within the established crypto community, specifically long-term Bitcoin holders taking profits. Should investors be concerned about this selling pattern? This appears to be normal profit-taking behavior rather than panic selling, indicating healthy market dynamics. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s future price? The ability to absorb significant internal selling while maintaining relative stability suggests underlying market strength. Found this analysis of Bitcoin price weakness insightful?

The arrest of this crypto scammer reveals how sophisticated digital fraud operations can infiltrate mainstream politics and devastate unsuspecting victims. How Did This Crypto Scammer Operate? Romillo Castillo, operating under the alias ‘Cryptospain,’ allegedly built a complex multi-level marketing scheme that promised incredible returns. The crypto scammer presented himself as the head of an investment fund specializing in cryptocurrencies and luxury goods. However, authorities discovered there was no legitimate business behind the operation. The scheme targeted approximately 3,000 investors who collectively lost $300 million. This case demonstrates why due diligence is crucial when considering cryptocurrency investments. The sophisticated crypto scammer used several tactics to appear legitimate: Professional-looking websites and marketing materials Promises of exclusive investment opportunities Multi-level referral bonuses to expand the victim pool False documentation and fabricated success stories What Makes This Crypto Scammer Case Different? The investigation took an unexpected turn when police discovered potential political connections. Authorities suspect the crypto scammer funneled illicit investor funds to far-right politicians in Spain. This development has expanded the investigation to include Luis Pérez Fernández, a leader of a Spanish far-right political party. Police evidence suggests Fernández allegedly received campaign funds from Castillo’s fraudulent operation. This political dimension adds complexity to an already troubling case of cryptocurrency fraud. The involvement of political figures raises serious questions about oversight and accountability in campaign financing. What Can Investors Learn From This Crypto Scammer? This case serves as a powerful reminder about the importance of verifying investment opportunities. The arrested crypto scammer exploited common vulnerabilities that all investors should recognize: Too-good-to-be-true returns – Always question unrealistic profit promises Lack of transparency – Legitimate investments provide clear documentation Pressure to recruit – Beware of multi-level marketing structures Political connections – Don’t assume legitimacy based on associations How Are Authorities Responding to Crypto Scammer Threats? Spanish police have demonstrated increased vigilance against cryptocurrency fraud. The successful identification and arrest of this crypto scammer shows law enforcement’s growing capability to track digital financial crimes. However, the case also highlights the challenges authorities face when fraud crosses into political territory. The expanded investigation into political connections suggests authorities are taking a comprehensive approach. This sends a strong message that cryptocurrency fraud won’t be tolerated, regardless of where the money flows. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? Cases like this crypto scammer arrest inevitably fuel discussions about cryptocurrency regulation. While the technology offers innovation and opportunity, it also creates new avenues for fraud. The $300 million loss in this case underscores the need for: Better investor education about cryptocurrency risks Stronger verification processes for investment platforms Enhanced international cooperation among regulators Clearer guidelines for political campaign financing The arrest of this sophisticated crypto scammer serves as both a warning and a victory. It demonstrates that authorities can successfully investigate complex digital fraud while reminding investors that vigilance remains essential in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions How many people were affected by this crypto scam? Approximately 3,000 investors lost money in this scheme, with total losses estimated at $300 million. What was the scammer’s alias? Romillo Castillo operated under the alias ‘Cryptospain’ to appear more credible to potential investors. Were there any legitimate business activities? Authorities found no evidence of any actual business operations behind the investment fund. What political connections were uncovered? The investigation revealed potential ties to far-right politicians, specifically Luis Pérez Fernández, who allegedly received campaign funds from the scam. How can I avoid similar crypto scams? Always verify investment opportunities, research company backgrounds, be skeptical of unrealistic returns, and avoid pressure to recruit others. What happens to the investigation now? The probe has expanded to include political connections, and authorities continue to trace the flow of funds to recover investor money.

Evernorth recently made headlines for its significant acquisition of large allocations of XRP. However, the timing may not have been any more opportune, or less, according to fresh analysis by on-chain data provider CryptoQuant . Evernorth and DATs Feel the Heat as Crypto Losses Mount Just weeks after building up its position in XRP, Evernorth now has around $78 million in unrealized losses. The drop demonstrates how sensitive DATs are to price fluctuations — not only in Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also in other tokens that might move with less liquidity and more volatility. Evernorth is not alone. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), widely regarded as the first prominent corporate Bitcoin treasury model, have declined by more than 26% over the last month as the price of Bitcoin has retreated. Shares of Strategy are now down by more than 50% from their all-time high, according to market data. Despite all that pressure, Strategy is still in relatively good shape. A report from BitcoinTreasuries indicates that the firm has an estimated average cost of around $74,000 per BTC for its reserves, implying that it still maintains a significant amount of paper profit on its Bitcoin holdings. NET. More worrisome are the companies whose primary holdings reside in other major cryptocurrencies. BitMine, which holds more corporate Ethereum than any other company in the world, now has a nearly $2.1 billion loss on its unrealized Ether reserves. The firm now holds almost 3.4 million ETH, with over 565,000 being acquired in the last month alone, suggesting that accumulation persisted even as market momentum diminished. Left watching the sector are analysts who see companies closely linked to the crypto market performance — and valuations for such companies becoming more strongly correlated — as providing less of a cushion for companies without diversified revenue models when prices tumble. A recent report highlighted that retail investors have collectively lost approximately $17 billion as a direct result of investing in companies that adopted the DATs model. Also, the premium these companies used to command over their net asset value of crypto holdings had vanished almost entirely at the time of analysis, signalling a significant change in sentiment. The engineering risk associated with relying on crypto price appreciation is becoming increasingly front and centre for both equity investors and analysts. Market researchers and venture analysts are comparing the DAT’s resurgence to the late 1990s dot-com bubble. In each case, a wave of companies emerged surrounding a revolutionary new technology. Long-held beliefs and innovation fueled others. Fast wealth-creating opportunities and speculative froth from investors propelled others. Companies like Breed Capital believe that Bitcoin-centric treasuries may be better off looking ahead. Bitcoin’s liquidity, institutional involvement, and relatively stable regulatory environment mean it is less at risk of abrupt market deterioration than tokens with shallower order books. DATs industry faces critical pressure The situation playing out at Evernorth is likely to add to the already heightened scrutiny surrounding DATs firms — especially those whose business strategies are more dependent on token prices surging than stable operational revenue. Investors are now focusing on whether these businesses have the ability to generate sustainable cash flow, whether their treasury policies insulate against downside risk, and whether they have meaningful diversification (real or anticipated) and liquidity in place. These are the very issues that will decide which firms remain on the side of this market storm and which ones could be on the street, needing a “restructuring”.

In a groundbreaking speech that sent ripples through financial markets, Miran revealed how trillions in stablecoin demand could fundamentally alter how the Fed manages our economy. Why Is Stablecoin Growth Becoming the Fed’s Top Priority? Steven Miran, a key Federal Reserve official with close ties to former President Trump, delivered a stunning prediction on July 7th. He stated that stablecoin usage could reach an astonishing $1 trillion to $3 trillion within the next decade. This massive stablecoin growth represents what he called the “elephant in the room” for central bankers worldwide. The Fed now recognizes that this rapid stablecoin growth isn’t just a niche trend – it’s a fundamental shift in how people use and store value. As more individuals and institutions adopt stablecoins, the implications for traditional monetary policy become increasingly significant. How Will Stablecoin Demand Strengthen the US Dollar? Here’s where the story gets fascinating. Miran explained that increasing stablecoin adoption creates a powerful domino effect: Every stablecoin is typically backed by US dollar reserves Growing stablecoin demand means growing dollar demand This increased demand naturally strengthens the dollar’s value The Fed must then adjust monetary policy accordingly This stablecoin growth essentially creates a new channel for global dollar demand that didn’t exist a decade ago. As more people worldwide use dollar-pegged stablecoins, they’re indirectly supporting the greenback’s dominance. What Monetary Policy Changes Can We Expect? The Federal Reserve now faces a crucial decision point. Miran confirmed that monetary policy will “adapt to stablecoin growth” based on the magnitude of its impact. This means we could see: Adjustments to interest rate decisions Modified reserve requirements for banks New regulatory frameworks for digital assets Enhanced monitoring of stablecoin market movements The speed of stablecoin growth will determine how quickly these changes unfold. If adoption accelerates faster than expected, the Fed might need to act more decisively. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Everyday Users? This official recognition of stablecoin growth marks a pivotal moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Fed’s acknowledgment signals that: Stablecoins are becoming systemically important Regulatory clarity is likely coming soon Traditional finance and crypto are converging faster than expected Your stablecoin holdings could indirectly influence national policy For everyday users, this means greater legitimacy and potentially more stability in the stablecoin market as regulatory oversight increases. The Bottom Line: A Financial Revolution in Motion The Federal Reserve’s awakening to stablecoin growth represents a watershed moment for both traditional finance and the crypto world. We’re witnessing the beginning of a coordinated response to digital currency innovation that could shape economic policy for decades. As stablecoin growth continues its upward trajectory, expect more central banks worldwide to follow the Fed’s lead in adapting their approaches. The financial landscape is changing before our eyes, and those who understand these shifts will be best positioned for the future. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Fed Governor Miran say about stablecoins? Steven Miran stated that stablecoins could become a $1-3 trillion market within ten years and that the Fed’s monetary policy will adapt to this growing demand, potentially strengthening the US dollar in the process. How could stablecoin growth affect the average person? Increased stablecoin adoption could lead to more efficient cross-border payments, better access to digital financial services, and potentially influence interest rates and dollar strength through Fed policy adjustments. Will this lead to more stablecoin regulation? Yes, the Fed’s recognition of stablecoin growth as systemically important almost certainly means increased regulatory oversight and clearer frameworks are coming soon. Can stablecoin demand really strengthen the US dollar? Yes, because most stablecoins are backed by US dollar reserves, increased demand for stablecoins directly increases demand for dollars, which typically strengthens the currency’s value. How quickly might these policy changes happen? The timing depends on the speed of stablecoin adoption, but the Fed has indicated it will monitor the situation closely and adjust policy as needed based on the magnitude of impact. Should I change my investment strategy because of this? While we can’t provide financial advice, understanding these macroeconomic trends can help you make more informed decisions about both traditional and digital asset investments.

During these eight days, the stock declined by 8.6%, resulting in a loss of approximately $350 billion in market value. Amid the stock pressure, Microsoft Corp. recently inked a deal worth about $9.7 billion to acquire artificial intelligence computing capacity from IREN Ltd ., making the Australian company its largest customer. The five-year agreement grants Microsoft access to Nvidia Corp.’s systems in Texas, which are built for AI workloads, and includes a 20% prepayment, IREN said in a statement on Monday. Sydney-based IREN has agreed to purchase the necessary advanced chips, known as graphics processing units, and related equipment for $5.8 billion from Dell Technologies Inc. Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals with data centre operators like IREN and CoreWeave Inc. over the past few months in an effort to secure as much computing capacity as possible to compete in the race to build and power AI systems. Just days ago, the Redmond, Washington-based firm said it’s still struggling to secure enough capacity to fulfil all of the demand for its cloud services. Microsoft encounters significant challenges at this time due to AI weaknesses Microsoft’s stock has declined since it revealed its quarterly earnings in late October. While the report includes a few positive strengths, such as growth in its Azure cloud computing business coming in better than analysts expected, Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the money companies invest in building AI infrastructure. Sources noted that Microsoft’s investment move accounted for about $34.9 billion in capital expenditures in the quarter. Moreover, the company hinted that spending would rise again in its current fiscal quarter. Regarding Microsoft’s decline in stock, analysts noted that this decline indicates a shift in sentiment towards AI companies, which had significantly enhanced the market earlier in the year. Meanwhile, both the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index declined 4% this week, marking their largest percentage drop in a week since April. Contrastingly, Apple Inc., which has not invested as heavily in AI, encountered an increase in its stock, rising by as much as 0.9% on Friday. Despite AI weaknesses, this achievement has positioned the tech company as a safe choice. Apple remains unaffected in a recent large selloff Reports dated November 6 this year noted that a recent large selloff affected several top-performing AI stocks such as Palantir Technologies Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Interestingly, only Apple remained unaffected . While other tech firms encountered declines, the iPhone maker faced a slight increase. The Nasdaq 100 Index, on the other hand, decreased by 1.6%. This situation was similar to an earlier trading period, when Apple experienced a slight increase despite the overall index declining by around 2.1%. In the meantime, it is worth noting that Apple’s stock has escalated, surpassing the 5% mark in the past month, while the tech-focused index barely changed, surging by less than 0.5%. Concerning Apple’s remarkable performance, analysts commented that this accomplishment marks a return to the firm’s usual stability. To achieve this stability, the tech firm has adopted a mechanism to generate cash and secure a strong financial position, which has enabled it to withstand market challenges . However, Apple reportedly fell behind other companies for much of this year because investors shifted their focus towards AI profits. Still, the tech giant revived after sharing a positive outlook earlier, which counteracted findings that demonstrated poor performance in China. According to recent reports, the iPhone maker earned approximately $27.5 billion in net income last quarter, with total revenue reaching $102.5 billion.

Related Reading: Is A Ripple IPO Coming? Garlinghouse Shares New Insights Despite short-term weakness, analysts remain divided, with institutional forecasts ranging from $120,000 to $170,000 for 2025. Macro Pressure Keeps Bitcoin in Tight Range Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $100,900, down 2.01% in the last 24 hours, extending its 8.2% weekly decline. The broader crypto market capitalization slipped to $3.37 trillion as Ethereum fell below $3,400 and altcoins posted mixed results. Analysts attribute the muted action to tight liquidity and risk-off sentiment, with BTC trapped between key support at $100,500 and resistance at $102,500. According to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, maintaining levels above $100,500 keeps sentiment “constructive,” but a breakout above $102,500 is needed to target $104,000–$105,000. Whale activity, however, suggests accumulation. Wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC added nearly 30,000 BTC last week, signaling growing confidence among large holders. Diverging Institutional Bitcoin Forecasts Add to Uncertainty Institutional analysts remain split on Bitcoin’s next move. JPMorgan values BTC at $170,000, comparing its risk-adjusted volatility to gold, while Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor forecast a $150,000 year-end target driven by ETF inflows and institutional rotation. In contrast, Galaxy Digital cut its 2025 forecast to $120,000 after whales sold 400,000 BTC in October, warning that Bitcoin’s “maturity era” may lead to slower but steadier growth. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has trimmed her 2030 price target from $1.5 million to $1.2 million, citing stablecoin adoption in emerging markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where citizens are increasingly using USDT to hedge against inflation. Market Sentiment and Corporate Impact Market sentiment remains fragile, with RSI readings below 40 suggesting an oversold phase. Veteran analyst Tom Lee believes current macro challenges could “turn into opportunities,” predicting a turnaround once U.S. inflation eases. Adding to the mix, Block Inc., led by Jack Dorsey, reported $1.97 billion in Bitcoin-related revenue for Q3 2025, nearly one-third of its total earnings, despite a broader earnings miss that sent shares down over 10%.

Ray Dalio Warns Of ‘Stimulus Into A Bubble’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/most-dangerous-bitcoin-boom-ray-dalio/,"Ray Dalio has fired a shot across the macro bow, arguing that the Federal Reserve’s latest balance-sheet guidance risks “stimulating into a bubble” rather than stabilizing a weakening economy—an inversion of the classic post-crisis QE playbook with potentially seismic implications for hard assets, including Bitcoin. In a post titled “Stimulating Into a Bubble,” Dalio frames the Fed’s pivot—ending quantitative tightening and signaling that reserves will need to start growing again—as the next milestone in the late stage of the Big Debt Cycle. “Did you see that the Fed’s announcement that it will stop QT and begin QE?” he wrote, cautioning that, even if described as a technical maneuver, it is “an easing move… to track the progression of the Big Debt Cycle.” If balance-sheet expansion coincides with rate cuts and persistent fiscal deficits, Dalio warns, markets will be staring at a “classic monetary and fiscal interaction of the Fed and the Treasury to monetize government debt.” He adds that, in such a setup—high equity prices, tight credit spreads, low unemployment, above-target inflation, and an AI-led mania—“it will look to me like the Fed is stimulating into a bubble.” Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Just Bottom? Trader Says The Low Must Form Now The policy context for Dalio’s warning is not imaginary. After months of tightening liquidity and ebbing bank reserves, the Fed has announced it will end balance-sheet runoff (QT). Chair Jerome Powell underscored that, within the ample-reserves framework, the central bank will at some point have to add reserves again: “At a certain point, you’ll want reserves to start gradually growing to keep up with the size of the banking system and the size of the economy. So we’ll be adding reserves at a certain point,” he said at his October 29 press conference. Officials and many sell-side desks have emphasized that reserve management need not equal a return to crisis-era QE. The practical similarity: if the Fed is again a steady net buyer of Treasuries to maintain “ample” reserves as deficits persist, the market experience can rhyme with QE even without the label. While Dalio spars Bitcoin from his post, the mechanics are familiar to Bitcoin investors. He argues that when central banks buy bonds and push real yields down, “what happens next depends on where the liquidity goes.” If it remains in financial assets, “multiples expand, risk spreads compress, and gold rises,” producing “financial asset inflation.” Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 If it seeps into goods and services, inflation rises and real returns can erode. Crucially for cross-asset allocation, Dalio frames relative returns explicitly: with gold yielding 0% and, say, a 10-year Treasury yielding ~4%, gold outperforms if its price appreciation is expected to exceed that rate, especially as inflation expectations rise and the currency’s purchasing power falls. In that environment, “the more money and credit central banks are making, the higher I expect the inflation rate to be, and the less I like bonds relative to gold.” What This Means For Bitcoin Commentators immediately translated those mechanics for Bitcoin. “Fed resumes QE → more liquidity → real interest rates fall,” wrote Coin Bureau CEO Nick Puckrin. “Falling real rates → bonds & cash become unattractive → money chases risk and hard assets… Inflation risk rises → investors hedge with gold, commodities, and digital stores of value.” He highlighted Dalio’s own language—“gold rises so there is financial asset inflation,” and QE “pushes real yields down and pushes P/E multiples up”—before concluding: “Bitcoin thrives in precisely that environment… it’s digital gold on steroids.” Millionaire investor Thomas Kralow sharpened the timing risk embedded in Dalio’s framework: this would not be “stimulus into a depression” but “stimulus into a mania.” In his words, liquidity would “flood already overheated markets… stocks melt up, gold rips, and crypto… goes vertical,” with the usual risk-on sequence across the crypto complex. His caveat mirrors Dalio’s late-cycle caution: a liquidity melt-up now, then—on a longer horizon—re-acceleration in inflation, a forced policy reversal, and a violent bubble pop. For Bitcoin, the near-term transmission is straightforward. Lower real yields and expanding liquidity historically coincide with stronger performance of long-duration, high-beta, and scarcity narratives; similar to 1999-style melt-ups and late-cycle surges in hard assets, including gold—and, by extension, BTC as a “digital gold” proxy. But the medium-to-long-term tension is unresolved: if the same easing stokes renewed inflation pressure, the exit—the point at which policy must tighten into the bubble—becomes the regime break Dalio is flagging. Dalio’s bottom line is not a trading signal but a regime warning. “Whether this becomes a full and classic stimulative QE (with big net purchases) remains to be seen,” he writes. If the Fed is indeed easing into a bubble, Bitcoin may benefit on the way up—but that path, by Dalio’s own schema, ends with impact. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $99,717.
