The political deadlock has halted progress on key legislative priorities, including the long-anticipated crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act . Prolonged Shutdown Risks 2% GDP Hit as Senate Prepares Crucial Vote The Senate is expected to vote this week on a Republican-backed proposal that would end the shutdown and fund several federal agencies through the rest of the fiscal year. The measure requires 60 votes to advance, and while Republican leaders have expressed cautious optimism, uncertainty remains over whether enough Democrats will support it. “My hopes and expectations are always that we’re going to have enough Democrats to actually proceed, but I don’t know, we’ll see,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters. The standoff, which began on October 1 after lawmakers failed to agree on a budget, stems from disagreements over healthcare subsidies tied to the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring tax credits that help about 24 million Americans afford insurance, while Republicans argue that those issues should be negotiated separately once the government reopens. US Government Shutdown So Far: 1. 42 million people face interruption of SNAP 2. 3.5 million people have seen airfare disruptions 3. 750,000 employees furloughed 4. 5,000 flights set to be cancelled per day 5. $15 billion in US GDP lost per week 6. $10 billion of SNAP… — Zarar Khan (@DrZarar01) November 7, 2025 With roughly 1.4 million federal workers affected, including 700,000 furloughed since early October, the shutdown’s economic and social toll is deepening. Federal workers have now missed multiple paychecks, and agencies from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to the USDA are cutting services. Trump – No Snap Benefits Until Government Re-Opens. pic.twitter.com/yu1DwYAFOE — Ryan (Emperador Maximiliano) (@EmpMaximiliano) November 4, 2025 A Rhode Island court on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the SNAP program after it had been reduced to partial payments. The administration has appealed the decision, arguing that funding decisions should await congressional action. Nearly 42 million Americans depend on the program, which costs more than $8 billion per month. Economists warn the prolonged shutdown could inflict lasting damage on the U.S. economy. Turns out this shutdown is incredibly costly, averaging ~15B per week. Unlike past shutdowns, 650K furloughed workers may not get back pay, food aid is cut, small businesses without their loans, and some economic damage could be permanent if it extends through the holidays. pic.twitter.com/OImZwWDXTV — Tahra Hoops (@TahraHoops) November 5, 2025 The Congressional Budget Office estimates the standoff could shave up to two percentage points off fourth-quarter GDP growth, draining between $10 billion and $30 billion weekly. Small businesses that rely on federal contracts and loans are running short on capital, and consumer spending is declining as millions of workers remain unpaid. How Long Can Crypto Wait While Washington Sleeps? The shutdown has also paralyzed Washington’s regulatory machinery. Agencies overseeing financial markets, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are operating with skeleton crews. Reviews of pending applications, including multiple proposals for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have been suspended. Interesting: Because most SEC staff are currently furloughed due to the government shutdown, they will NOT be available to review or respond to Fails-to-Deliver (FTD) related queries or compliance ISSUES unless they are designated as EMERGENCY functions. pic.twitter.com/5cDqudANAs — Reese Politics (@ReesePolitics) November 3, 2025 The impasse has effectively frozen legislative momentum on digital assets. The bipartisan CLARITY Act, designed to define how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are regulated across federal agencies, had seen renewed activity in late October. Senators John Boozman and Cory Booker said their committees were working “daily ” to finalize their section of the bill and expected a vote before Thanksgiving. However, with the government shutdown entering its sixth week, that timeline is now in jeopardy. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that roughly 90% of the bill’s issues had already been resolved and that Thanksgiving had been floated as a possible target for completion . The market fallout has extended beyond Capitol Hill. The liquidity squeeze triggered by the shutdown, exacerbated by the U.S. Treasury General Account hoarding funds while agencies remain closed, has weighed heavily on risk assets. Bitcoin has retreated from recent highs , testing long-term support levels as investors navigate reduced market liquidity and uncertainty around fiscal policy. Meanwhile, prediction markets indicate growing skepticism about a quick resolution to the shutdown.

Related Reading: Cathie Wood Trims Her 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction To $1.2 Million – Here’s Why The Zcash price recently surged above $650 for the first time since 2018, with a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. According to CoinGecko, daily trading volume has surpassed $1.88 billion, with strong liquidity across Binance, Hyperliquid, and Bybit. This momentum reflects a growing resurgence of interest in privacy-preserving technologies amid increasing concerns over financial surveillance. The Electric Coin Company’s (ECC) recent upgrades, including those under Project Tachyon, and the rising adoption of the Zashi wallet have revitalized investor confidence. Privacy Narrative and Technical Upgrades Drive Momentum The renewed enthusiasm around privacy coins mirrors a broader market shift. Zcash’s shielded transactions, powered by zk-SNARKs, now represent over 30% of its circulating supply, reducing liquid float and contributing to price stability. Its integration into DeFi ecosystems through tokenized versions on Solana and BNB Chain has also expanded ZEC’s reach, with over 16,000 wallets interacting with these assets. Prominent voices like Naval Ravikant and Arthur Hayes have championed Zcash’s role in the evolving privacy revolution, calling it “the missing piece for Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the Zcash Foundation maintains that the surge reflects genuine user demand rather than speculative hype. Futures data further supports this thesis, with balanced long-short ratios around 1.1, indicating sustained, organic buying interest rather than excessive leverage. ZEC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Can Zcash Price Hit $1,000 Next? Analysts Weigh In The current Zcash price rally has sparked debate over its next target. Technical charts indicate robust support between $500 and $520, while resistance is located near $580–$600. Analysts from CoinGlass and Galaxy Digital project a conservative range of $650 – $750 in the near term, with an optimistic scenario pushing toward $1,000 if momentum persists. The bullish thesis hinges on the strength of the privacy narrative, expanding institutional participation, and ZEC’s scarcity model, mirroring Bitcoin’s 21 million-coin cap. However, traders caution that overbought conditions and potential regulatory headwinds could trigger short-term pullbacks.

Transfers between the two nations, largely involving USDT stablecoins, have drawn scrutiny after Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit processed billions of won in suspicious transactions. Much of this capital reportedly flowed to Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian platform sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K. Experts say the spike underscores how stricter local enforcement in Korea has driven criminal syndicates offshore. “It’s extremely difficult to detect all suspicious transactions before they occur,” said Youchull Jung, a white-collar crime attorney at Lee & Ko. The transfers highlight how foreign jurisdictions like Cambodia and the Philippines have become new operational hubs for crypto-based scams. Seoul Weighs New Sanctions After U.S. Crackdown on North Korean Crypto Laundering The revelations come as South Korea reviews potential sanctions targeting North Korea’s cyber-financing networks. On November 7, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Ji-na confirmed that Seoul could “review sanctions as a measure if they are really needed,” emphasizing coordination with the United States to counter Pyongyang’s crypto theft operations. The U.S. Treasury recently sanctioned eight North Korean nationals and two entities, including the Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC) and Ryujong Credit Bank, for laundering stolen digital assets to fund weapons programs. Analysts, such as Tiger Research’s Ryan Yoon, note that while new measures may have a limited short-term impact, they signal intensified coordination between Seoul and Washington on curbing crypto-funded proliferation threats. Regulation Tightens as South Korea Leads in Compliance Reform South Korea’s crypto market, valued at over $84 billion, has become a test case for striking a balance between innovation and regulation. The 2024 Digital Asset Act and Travel Rule bolstered exchange oversight, but outdated foreign exchange laws have left cross-border crypto flows in a gray zone. Regulators now face the dual challenge of protecting investors while closing loopholes exploited by bad actors. Amid growing global scrutiny, Seoul’s stance could shape the future of crypto compliance across Asia. If South Korea tightens sanctions and AML controls further, analysts say it may catalyze a new era of coordinated digital finance enforcement, stretching from Washington to Phnom Penh, and turning the region’s crypto boom into a geopolitical battleground.

The move aligns with Meta’s AI strategy, focusing heavily on expanding data centers to fuel advanced AI development, including the pursuit of “superintelligence”, a dream of scientists in which AI systems surpass human-level reasoning. Meta’s three-year commitment Meta has increased its focus on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence, which is why it has pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to build several large AI data centers while making plans for bigger outlays to meet the compute needs this super AI will no doubt require. The company has revealed plans to invest $1.5 billion in a data center in Texas, breaking ground on its 29th such facility globally, and also locked in a $27 billion financing deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund its Louisiana data center, its biggest project globally. In September, CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated the idea before U.S. President Donald Trump over a White House dinner when he claimed that Meta would invest “at least $600 billion” in the U.S. over the next several years. With its investments in the AI sector, Meta expects “notably larger” capital expenses next year. On the company’s recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because “it’s the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we’re prepared for the most optimistic cases.” However, Cryptopolitan has reported about the firm funneling a lot of funds into the AI sector as it struggles to outdo rivals like Alphabet and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, who are also developing huge data centers to power future AI models. Even Google has joined the fray as it has revealed plans to invest $15 billion on a data center project in southern India that will be the search giant’s largest AI hub in the world outside of the U.S. Meta’s deal with Blue Owl Capital Meta’s joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital is expected to fund and develop the social media company’s massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana . The deal states that the asset management firm will retain 80% of the joint venture, while Meta will own a 20% stake and oversee the construction and property management services of the data center, which is being built in Richland Parish, Louisiana. Blue Owl reportedly contributed about $7 billion in cash as part of the joint venture, and Meta got a one-time payout of $3 billion. With the partnership, Meta gets “the speed and flexibility” it needs to build the data center and support its “long-term AI ambitions,” the social media company said in a statement. Local utility Entergy informed CNBC in June that the new data center would require about twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day. The outfit will directly compete with the data centers OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank have come together to build under the Stargate joint venture, which has seen the three companies invest $500 billion.

Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, said in a post on X that long-term holders (LTHs), investors who hold Bitcoin for more than 155 days, have ramped up their selling in recent weeks, a common pattern during bull markets. “LTH take profits as prices reach new highs,” he wrote. But what stands out this time, according to Moreno, is the absence of strong demand to offset that selling. “What’s important to analyze each time is if there’s growing Bitcoin demand that can absorb the LTH selling at higher prices,” he added. The data shows that demand, which had been growing between July and September, turned negative in early October. “Since October, LTH selling has increased (nothing new here), but demand is contracting (red areas), unable to absorb LTH supply at higher prices,” Moreno said. Long-term Bitcoin holders into a low-demand market. Source: CryptoQuant Demand dries up as LTH selling rises In a chart shared by Moreno , Bitcoin’s short-term demand, measured by apparent demand metrics, has been trending in the red zone for roughly 30 days. This signals that fewer new buyers are entering the market, even as long-term investors take profits. The 1-year demand metric remains in positive territory, but the decline is becoming more visible. If the trend continues, Moreno noted, the 1-year demand growth could soon dip below zero. As of this week, both positive and negative apparent demand stand at roughly zero, while the 30-day long-term holder spending sits at around 790,000 BTC as of the time of writing. This means that, on balance, demand and supply are in a delicate standoff, with large volumes of Bitcoin being sold by experienced investors but insufficient fresh capital coming in to absorb the selling pressure. Bitcoin demand over the last 30 days. Source: CryptoQuant The data shared by Moreno on CryptoQuant showed that the two major sources of institutional demand, ETFs and Michael Saylor’s Strategy , are both showing weakness. ETF demand growth has dropped sharply into negative territory, while Strategy’s remains flat at zero. A different market from earlier rallies During January to February 2025 and again from November to December 2024, long-term holder selling coincided with rising demand, which is identified as “green areas” on the chart. Those periods led to record-breaking prices, with Bitcoin setting new all-time highs. But this time, conditions appear less supportive, especially after the October 10 event that nearly brought the market to its knees; selling has picked up, but demand has failed to follow. What comes next for Bitcoin? Selling by long-term holders can signal a healthy profit-taking cycle that resets the market for the next leg up; however, the current market activity doesn’t agree with this thesis. Bitcoin prices have dropped by over 5% within the past seven days from about $110,000 to a bit above $103,000. For prices to climb, fresh demand, particularly from ETFs and institutional investors , will need to pick up. Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth remains positive on a yearly basis, which suggests that the structural demand for Bitcoin as an asset class remains intact. But if contraction continues and dips below zero, it could indicate the market is entering a cooling phase similar to mid-cycle consolidations seen in past bull markets.

Bitcoin has dropped as low as $100,500 today, while Ethereum has fallen to $3,293, which is a 26% drop in the past month. However, recent falls have much more to do with stock market jitters than cryptocurrency fundamentals, and most major tokens are now in such an oversold position that they should recover vigorously by the end of the year. Investors should also consider diversifying into new and presale tokens, with one high-momentum presale coin – PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – looking like it could go exponential once it launches. Top Crypto to Turn $100 into $10,000 – Don’t Miss This Potential 100x Setup As its name suggests, PEPENODE is another Pepe-themed meme token, although it doesn’t rely solely on the viral potential of Pepe-related memes and motifs. It also adds a unique selling point to the mix, with PEPENODE providing users with the ability to grow and run their own virtual mining rigs. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 In contrast to the expense of normal mining, which relies on expensive hardware and lots of electricity, the only thing PEPENODE’s mining requires is that users hold some PEPENODE. They can use the coin to buy more virtual mining nodes, with more nodes earning users greater rewards, which PEPENODE pays out in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. It’s as simple as that, while holders of PEPENODE can also stake the token for a regular staking income. Currently, PEPENODE’s annual yield stands at just over 600%, making the coin potentially very profitable. These features help to explain why the coin’s presale has really taken off since launching in September, and at the last count, PEPENODE has raised more than $2 million from excited investors. It will have a total supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with the coin running on the Ethereum blockchain. How to Buy PEPENODE Early: Presale Price at $0.0011363 and Rising Its presale will run for several more weeks, at which point PEPENODE will list. What’s exciting about this is that its launch may come just as the market begins to recover properly from its current slump. The arrival of altcoin ETFs in the next few weeks may provide the kind of market bullishness that will help propel PEPENODE higher, and which will drive demand for its original mining platform. Investors may therefore want to hurry now and buy PEPENODE in its presale, while it’s available at what may end up being a discount. They can do so by going to the official PEPENODE website and connecting a compatible wallet. The coin is currently selling at $0.0011363, although this will rise every few days until the sale enters its final phase. If the timing is right, its listing on exchanges could coincide with a bull rally, with the combination of market-wide momentum and bullish fundamentals serving to push it higher. This is why it’s one of the top cryptos to buy right now, and could remain so for some time to come.

54147281,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88972,1762558203,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Is XRP a Good Buy? Projected Value of 5,000 XRP by 2035",https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-a-good-buy-projected-value-of-5000-xrp-by-2035/,"Investor interest in XRP has surged amid ongoing optimism about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Many community members are speculating on how modest holdings, such as 5,000 XRP, could generate substantial returns over the next decade. As of today, purchasing 5,000 XRP would require approximately $11,800, based on a market price of $2.36 per token. This represents a significant increase compared to last year, when the same amount of XRP cost roughly $2,500. This growth reflects the broader price gains XRP has experienced over the past 12 months. Although today’s price is elevated relative to last year, it remains lower than recent highs. In July, XRP traded at about $3.66, meaning 5,000 tokens would have cost close to $18,300. At the current price, the token is trading nearly 37% below that peak, presenting a potential entry point for investors who may have missed earlier gains. Analysts note that minor variations in purchase price are unlikely to significantly affect long-term outcomes if XRP appreciates substantially over the coming decade. Long-Term Projections for 5,000 XRP Estimating XRP’s future price remains inherently uncertain, but several industry forecasts suggest significant potential upside. Changelly predicts that XRP could reach $115 per token by December 2034. Under this projection, an investment of 5,000 XRP today would be valued at approximately $575,000 by then. A more conservative forecast from Telegaon sets XRP at around $87 per coin by 2035, which would place the value of 5,000 tokens at roughly $435,000. Even this moderate estimate represents a substantial return over ten years. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Some market commentators envision even more dramatic growth. For example, Matthew Brienen, COO of CryptoCharged, suggested that XRP could reach $1,000 per token by 2035. If this occurs, 5,000 XRP could be worth $5 million, offering investors a significant opportunity for wealth accumulation. Possibility of XRP Surpassing $1,000 While projections above $1,000 remain ambitious, exchanges such as Changelly anticipate that XRP might not reach those levels until closer to 2040, potentially trading as high as $2,138 per token. At that valuation, 5,000 XRP would exceed $10.6 million. Although precise price forecasts cannot be guaranteed, the prevailing sentiment among XRP supporters is that the token’s current market price underrepresents its long-term potential. Many investors see this as an opportunity to acquire XRP at a relatively favourable level in anticipation of significant future growth. The current cost of 5,000 XRP offers a tangible benchmark for investors considering long-term positions. Depending on market adoption, institutional involvement, and broader crypto trends, this holding could increase substantially by 2035. Even conservative projections suggest notable appreciation, reinforcing the view that XRP remains an asset of interest for long-term portfolios.

The altcoin has struggled with lapse adoption over the past year: Stablecoin supply remains at 30 million despite the GENIUS act, and its Total Value Locked (TVL) trails newer chains. Hoskinson attributes Mignight as the solution, citing it to be the “biggest launches in the crypto industry” six years in the making during a recent X Q&A .

He claims it has already attracted over 80 deals with many developers who have sidelined Cardano in the past, including Sundae Labs, Maestro, OpenZeppelin, and Fluid Tokens. Popular X analyst Ali Martinez added technical backing to the optimism, highlighting a critical support retest at $0.51, a level that has repeatedly marked local bottoms over the past year. $0.52 is a support level that has triggered strong rebounds for Cardano $ADA since November 2024. pic.twitter.com/8HdaiayxYO — Ali (@ali_charts) November 5, 2025 If this support once again holds as a launchpad, Martinez expects a retest of key resistance at $1.15, this year’s high, signaling the potential start of a new bull run. Cardano Price Analysis: $1.15 Could Just be the Start The historical year-long resistance noted by Martinez contributes to a wider descending triangle pattern, setting much grander targets.

The RSI has rebounded from the 30 oversold threshold, often a marker of local bottoms, while the MACD levels off in the early stages of a potential trend shift. Buy pressure is building.

This isn’t just random market movement – it’s a powerful signal that smart investors are watching closely. According to leading macroeconomics and crypto analyst Andreas Steno Larsen, this crypto rebound pattern reveals crucial information about where liquidity is flowing in global markets. What Does This Crypto Rebound Actually Mean? When cryptocurrencies recover before traditional stocks, it typically indicates that new money is entering the digital asset space first. This crypto rebound pattern suggests several important market dynamics: Investors see crypto as higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities Digital assets respond faster to changing market conditions Institutional money may be diversifying into crypto Market sentiment is shifting toward digital assets Why Does Liquidity Matter for Your Investments? Liquidity inflow represents the lifeblood of financial markets. When money moves into cryptocurrencies ahead of traditional stocks, it signals that investors perceive stronger growth potential in digital assets. This crypto rebound phenomenon isn’t just technical analysis – it reflects real capital allocation decisions being made by both retail and institutional investors. How Can You Spot Genuine Crypto Rebound Signals? Not every price increase represents meaningful liquidity inflow. True crypto rebound patterns show specific characteristics that distinguish them from ordinary market fluctuations. Look for sustained upward movement across multiple major cryptocurrencies, accompanied by increasing trading volumes and positive fundamental developments in the space. What Challenges Come With This Trend? While this crypto rebound pattern offers exciting opportunities, investors should remain aware of potential challenges: Higher volatility compared to traditional markets Regulatory uncertainties in some jurisdictions Need for thorough research before investing Importance of proper risk management strategies Actionable Insights for Smart Investors Understanding this crypto rebound pattern can help you make more informed investment decisions. Consider diversifying your portfolio to include both traditional and digital assets. Monitor liquidity indicators regularly, and remember that while crypto markets move quickly, sustainable growth requires patience and strategic thinking. The current market dynamics reveal a fascinating shift in how investors allocate capital. This crypto rebound ahead of traditional stocks demonstrates growing confidence in digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. As liquidity continues flowing into cryptocurrency markets, staying informed about these patterns becomes increasingly crucial for anyone interested in modern finance. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a crypto rebound? A crypto rebound occurs when cryptocurrency prices recover significantly after a downturn, often signaling renewed investor interest and capital inflow. Why does crypto rebound before stocks? Cryptocurrencies typically react faster to market changes due to their 24/7 trading nature and higher risk-reward profile that attracts capital during recovery periods. How reliable is this rebound signal? While not foolproof, consistent patterns of crypto rebounding ahead of stocks have historically indicated liquidity shifts, though always verify with other market indicators. Should I invest based on this signal alone? No, this should be one of many factors in your investment decision-making process, combined with fundamental analysis and risk assessment. How long do these rebound periods typically last? Rebound durations vary widely, from several weeks to months, depending on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Which cryptocurrencies show the strongest rebound patterns? Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead rebound movements, followed by other established altcoins with strong fundamentals. Found this analysis helpful?

The Fear and Greed Index hovered around 21, suggesting risk appetite remains thin despite new activity in sectors linked to AI, storage, and infrastructure. Filecoin, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET, and Near Protocol each gained sharply, offering a narrow but telling view of where investors are concentrating during an uncertain phase of the cycle. Filecoin Extends Rally on Ecosystem and AI Ties Filecoin rose about 69% in 24 hours to around $2.34 , lifting its market capitalization above $1.66 billion. The move follows a series of ecosystem upgrades and rising expectations ahead of developer events later this month. The network recently introduced a gas fee cut of about 50%, which coincided with an increase in new deals and overall utilization. The chain’s positioning in decentralized storage has become increasingly tied to AI and DePIN discussions. The combination of lower costs and real data workloads has helped traders view Filecoin as a platform that could anchor decentralized compute growth. Market data also show deeper order books and rising open interest, an early indication that trading participation is extending beyond short-term speculation. . @FilFoundation and GSR Foundation support a cohort of projects that apply decentralized storage for public good. The new infographic outlines how this collaboration funds work in science, art, and human rights through verifiable data infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/ir4COLsnoP — Filecoin (@Filecoin) November 6, 2025 FET Gains From Renewed AI Momentum Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s FET traded near $0.32 after a 49% rise in 24 hours. The token, which links decentralized AI compute and automation services, continues to act as a liquid expression of AI enthusiasm within crypto. FET Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The alliance’s integration of multiple machine learning projects under one token remains a key draw for traders who seek AI exposure without relying on equity markets. The current flow resembles previous cycles of AI enthusiasm but now aligns more closely with infrastructure-backed narratives such as Filecoin’s. The shared theme of data, compute, and protocol-level utility has kept both assets near the top of watchlists heading into the weekend. Near Protocol Tracks Onchain Activity Near Protocol advanced about 26% to $2.5 , continuing a steady climb that began earlier in the week. On-chain data show consistent user activity and growth in wallet counts, while recent reports have pointed to higher transaction throughput and continued integration of application-layer projects. Traders have grouped NEAR alongside other large layer-one chains that demonstrate concrete network demand even during weak sentiment. Its inclusion in conversations around AI-compatible infrastructure has added to speculative interest, helping maintain liquidity in key trading pairs. Altcoin Season in Fear The Altcoin Season Index remains around 26, well below levels associated with wide participation. Despite that, targeted rallies in tokens such as Filecoin, FET, and Near suggest that capital is rotating selectively toward networks with real economic use cases and active development. The following weeks in November will test whether enthusiasm for decentralized compute and AI-linked assets can expand beyond a few leaders or remain confined to isolated bursts of trading momentum. If current liquidity holds while volatility eases into the weekend, these sectors may continue to attract attention even while most of the market stays risk-averse.

This comes as educational programs, such as My First Bitcoin, have become a crucial bridge for citizens unfamiliar with cryptocurrency around the world. The association is now announcing that it will transition from providing in-classroom support locally in El Salvador to supporting teachers and programs internationally. The Founder, John Dennehy, said the move shows where they are heading in the long term. “Our ambition was always to change the world, but we had to start with a single student, then a single city, then a single nation,” Dennehy said. “Now we are ready to raise the potential impact from 6 million people to 8 billion.” My First Bitcoin was founded as an independent nonprofit in 2021, during El Salvador’s early adoption of Bitcoin. It provided free, beginner-friendly classes for students, community groups, and adults. The program eventually created a formalized “Bitcoin Diploma” and trained local instructors to teach the classes. At the time of the announcement, the organization had taught more than 27,000 students in person, with the majority being public school youth. Partnership dissolves as El Salvador changes its Bitcoin policy Through the program’s partnership with the Ministry of Education, Bitcoin education will become available throughout the country in public schools. My First Bitcoin College sent out its curriculum to schools in 2024, following the publication of its diploma-style syllabus, which was developed in collaboration with the Ministry in 2023. They ultimately flamed out in April 2025. The government provided no specific reason for halting the initiative, but Arnold Hubach, Director of Communication at My First Bitcoin, stated that no new program will be introduced. The announcement marked another in a series of policy reversals on Bitcoin in El Salvador, which followed financial discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion IMF bailout in December 2024, which pledged to wind down Bitcoin projects and halt the government’s regulatory purchases of BTC. In January 2025, legislators revised the nation’s Bitcoin law, allowing businesses to opt in or out of accepting Bitcoin. Later in mid-2025 , the IMF reported that El Salvador had not purchased any new Bitcoin since the financing deal was signed — although an official website for the Bitcoin Office still advertises its ongoing purchases. The government’s reported Bitcoin treasury currently stands at approximately 6,374 BTC, which is valued at $654.8 million, according to current prices and public data on the Bitcoin Office website. A chapter closes, but the work goes on It’s on-the-ground time in El Salvador may be over, but My First Bitcoin says its mission remains the same. The organization aims to advise teachers and activists in other countries who wish to introduce Bitcoin education into schools, community centres, and informal learning environments. The group’s curriculum has already been implemented or piloted in Argentina, Costa Rica, Colombia, and other locations in Africa and Europe. Through the new pivot, My First Bitcoin aims to create an online learning network worldwide, rather than being a single centre. While My First Bitcoin may no longer run classes on Salvadoran soil, its mission is now more ambitious than ever: to teach billions of people worldwide how to navigate the world of Bitcoin safely and responsibly, starting with teachers and students who will carry the knowledge forward in their communities.

This move could open doors for mainstream investors to access XRP through regulated channels, simplifying the investment process. If approved, it would represent a significant step forward in bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency markets. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader ecosystem. What Is an XRP Spot ETF and Why Does It Matter? An XRP spot ETF allows investors to buy shares that directly track the price of XRP, making it easier to gain exposure without holding the actual cryptocurrency. This structure reduces the complexities of wallets and private keys, appealing to those who prefer familiar investment vehicles. Moreover, it enhances liquidity and could stabilize XRP’s market value by attracting institutional capital. Therefore, the 21Shares proposal could democratize access to XRP, fostering wider adoption. How Does the 21Shares XRP Spot ETF Filing Process Work? 21Shares filed a Form 8-A with the SEC, triggering a 20-day review period where regulators assess its compliance and risks. This step is crucial because it involves scrutiny under U.S. securities laws, which have been a hurdle for similar crypto products. Success here could set a precedent for other digital assets, encouraging more filings. However, challenges remain, such as regulatory uncertainty and market volatility, which could delay approval. What Are the Key Benefits of an XRP Spot ETF? Investors stand to gain several advantages from this development. For instance: Accessibility : Enables easy investment through traditional brokerage accounts. Security : Reduces risks associated with self-custody of digital assets. Transparency : Offers regulated pricing and reporting, building trust. Additionally, an XRP spot ETF could boost XRP’s legitimacy, potentially increasing its value over time. This aligns with growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. What Challenges Could This XRP Spot ETF Face? Despite the optimism, obstacles like SEC skepticism and legal disputes around XRP’s classification might slow progress. The regulatory landscape is evolving, and past rejections of crypto ETFs highlight the need for clear guidelines. Moreover, market sentiment can shift quickly, affecting timing and success. Nevertheless, 21Shares’ expertise in crypto ETPs positions them well to navigate these hurdles. How Might This Impact the Future of Crypto Investing? If approved, the XRP spot ETF could inspire similar products for other cryptocurrencies, accelerating mainstream adoption. It signals a maturation of the market, where digital assets integrate seamlessly with traditional finance. For investors, this means more choices and potentially lower barriers to entry. Ultimately, it paves the way for a more inclusive financial system. In summary, 21Shares’ XRP spot ETF filing is a pivotal moment that could reshape how we invest in cryptocurrencies. By combining innovation with regulatory compliance, it offers a promising path forward. Stay informed as this story develops—it might just be the breakthrough the crypto world needs.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed an explosive Filecoin price surge that left traders stunned. Overnight, FIL skyrocketed nearly 80%, climbing to nearly $4 on major exchanges and creating waves across the crypto space. What Triggered This Massive Filecoin Price Surge? According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the Filecoin price surge began with a sharp rally that pushed FIL to $3.973 on Binance’s FIL/USDT trading pair. This remarkable movement occurred around 6:00 p.m. UTC, showcasing how quickly cryptocurrency markets can transform. The token has since settled around $3.3, still representing massive gains from the previous day’s trading levels. Several factors likely contributed to this impressive Filecoin price surge: Growing adoption of decentralized storage solutions Increased institutional interest in Web3 infrastructure projects Technical breakout from previous resistance levels Positive market sentiment toward utility tokens Why Does This Filecoin Price Surge Matter? This substantial Filecoin price surge represents more than just numbers on a chart. It signals renewed confidence in decentralized storage networks and their real-world applications. Filecoin’s core technology enables users to store data securely across a distributed network, creating a marketplace for digital storage that challenges traditional cloud services. The timing of this Filecoin price surge coincides with increasing concerns about data privacy and centralized control. As more users seek alternatives to conventional cloud storage, Filecoin’s value proposition becomes increasingly relevant. This rally demonstrates that investors recognize the long-term potential of decentralized infrastructure projects. What Can We Learn From This Filecoin Price Movement? This dramatic Filecoin price surge teaches us several important lessons about cryptocurrency investing. First, utility tokens with real-world applications can experience sudden growth spurts when market conditions align. Second, the decentralized storage sector continues to gain traction among both retail and institutional investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that such rapid price movements often include corrections. The Filecoin price surge saw some retracement from its peak, which is typical in volatile crypto markets. Smart investors use these opportunities to assess their positions and make informed decisions. What’s Next After This Filecoin Price Surge? Looking forward, the sustainability of this Filecoin price surge will depend on several factors. Continued adoption of the Filecoin network, partnerships with major companies, and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment will all play roles in determining whether these gains hold. The Filecoin price surge also highlights the importance of monitoring fundamental metrics beyond just price. Network usage, storage capacity, and developer activity provide better indicators of long-term value than short-term price movements alone. Conclusion: Understanding the Filecoin Phenomenon The remarkable Filecoin price surge demonstrates the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets and the growing importance of decentralized storage solutions. While short-term volatility is expected, the underlying technology continues to evolve and attract users worldwide. This event serves as a powerful reminder that innovation in blockchain technology extends far beyond financial applications to include practical solutions for everyday digital needs. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the Filecoin price surge? The Filecoin price surge likely resulted from combined factors including growing adoption of decentralized storage, positive market sentiment toward utility tokens, and technical breakout patterns. How high did FIL price reach during the surge? FIL reached $3.973 on Binance’s FIL/USDT trading pair during the peak of the price surge before settling around $3.3. Is Filecoin a good investment after this price surge? While the Filecoin price surge shows strong momentum, all cryptocurrency investments carry risk. Research the technology, market position, and your risk tolerance before investing. What is Filecoin used for? Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that allows users to store data securely across a distributed system, creating a marketplace for digital storage. Can the Filecoin price surge continue? Future price movements depend on multiple factors including adoption rates, market conditions, and technological developments within the Filecoin ecosystem. Where can I track Filecoin price movements? You can monitor FIL prices on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and through market tracking platforms like Bitcoin World.

His remarks highlight a recurring behavioral pattern in cryptocurrency markets, where investors often overreact to price corrections despite long-term gains. Historical Performance Context Currently, XRP is trading at approximately $2.36 , down over 10% in the last 7 days, during a challenging phase for the broader cryptocurrency market. The token’s market capitalization has declined to $132.87 billion, representing a drop of more than $82 billion from its July peak of $216.69 billion. Despite this recent downward trend , XRP has appreciated by 346% since November 2024, indicating significant gains over the past year. Diep Sanh emphasized that market participants frequently overlook such long-term progress during temporary pullbacks. Historically, XRP has experienced extended periods of volatility. After reaching $3.31 in January 2018, the token fell below $1 and remained mostly between $0.30 and $0.70 for nearly seven years. Brief spikes, such as $1.96 in April 2021, were followed by subsequent declines, illustrating the cyclical nature of investor sentiment. By 2070, you guys will be shitting your pants when XRP drops from $1,200 to $1,000 — BD (@DiepSanh) November 6, 2025 Investor Reactions in Extreme Scenarios In his commentary, Sanh projected that around the year 2070, XRP could reach $1,200 and later correct to $1,000. Although this would represent a 44,743% increase from the current price, he anticipates that investors would likely overreact, treating the decline as a loss rather than a milestone of long-term growth. Sanh’s point underlines a key aspect of investor psychology: even when holding a position with massive overall gains, market participants often focus on short-term losses. This behavior, according to Sanh, mirrors the patterns observed during previous XRP cycles, where investors panicked at temporary declines despite multi-year growth. Current Market Downturn The ongoing correction has reignited similar concerns. Following the November 2024 rally that pushed XRP above $3.40, the token now trades primarily between $2 and $3. Investors who purchased during the post-rally peak may currently face unrealized losses, which have contributed to heightened anxiety in the community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts view the current dip as a potential opportunity to accumulate XRP at lower prices. Some suggest that those unable to acquire XRP below $2 may soon have another chance, arguing that the ongoing correction could serve as a period of consolidation before the next potential rally. Overall, Sanh’s commentary emphasizes the importance of understanding market psychology alongside price movements. Even in a scenario where XRP achieves extraordinary long-term valuations, short-term volatility may still trigger strong emotional reactions among investors. For current and prospective XRP holders, the lesson is clear: historical trends show that temporary declines are common, and a long-term perspective is essential to navigate periods of volatility while maintaining confidence in the asset’s growth potential.

54149511,623508,1762560056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54149511.jpeg,Bitcoin Looks Overextended As Ethereum Shows Early Signs Of Accumulation – Capital Shift?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-overextended-ethereum-shows-accumulation/,"Bitcoin is once again testing critical support levels after briefly losing the $100,000 mark on Tuesday, raising questions about whether the market is entering the late stages of the current cycle. Despite short-term weakness, Bitcoin continues to appear overheated, while Ethereum seems to be sending a different, more resilient signal. The overall market tone has become increasingly complex. On one side, Bitcoin’s relentless rally over recent months has many traders believing the bull run is nearing its end. Across social media and trading communities, the sentiment is clear: “The bull run is almost over.” and “There won’t be another alt season.” This growing skepticism reflects widespread caution among investors who fear that BTC’s parabolic advance could soon lead to exhaustion. However, beneath the surface, Ethereum’s quiet strength and on-chain activity hint at possible capital rotation or hidden accumulation — signaling that the cycle may not be entirely over. The divergence between the two largest cryptocurrencies highlights a shifting market structure , where traders must now navigate increased volatility, fading euphoria, and mixed technical signals. Diverging Signals Between Bitcoin And Ethereum Fund Premiums According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Woominkyu, a subtle yet notable divergence has emerged between Bitcoin and Ethereum fund premiums — a dynamic that could reveal the next market rotation. The data shows that the Ethereum Fund Market Premium has been rising quietly, even as ETH’s price struggles around the $3,300 level. This indicates growing institutional interest in Ethereum despite its weaker spot performance. In contrast, Bitcoin’s fund premium has remained flat, showing little change even after weeks of strong price movement. This behavior suggests that while BTC continues to dominate retail and media attention, institutional demand has not accelerated in tandem — a potential sign of market fatigue or strategic capital repositioning. This divergence is not clearly bullish or bearish. It might represent early accumulation in Ethereum funds, signaling an upcoming rotation into altcoins, or simply temporary imbalances in demand between major crypto instruments. What’s evident, however, is that market sentiment and institutional behavior are no longer aligned. Bitcoin’s momentum is driving the narrative, but Ethereum’s quiet accumulation under the surface could be the first hint of shifting capital flows — setting the stage for a more complex and potentially surprising next phase in the market cycle. ETH/BTC Tests Multi-Year Support Amid Persistent Weakness The ETH/BTC pair continues to display structural weakness, currently trading around 0.0327 BTC, after failing to maintain its brief recovery attempt toward 0.04 BTC. The weekly chart shows Ethereum struggling to regain strength against Bitcoin, suggesting that the capital rotation remains heavily tilted toward BTC dominance. Since mid-2022, ETH/BTC has been in a persistent downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows — a clear sign of relative underperformance. The pair’s latest rejection near the 100-week moving average further reinforces this bearish structure. For Ethereum to regain momentum, a sustained move above the 0.037–0.038 BTC zone would be crucial, as this region aligns with both technical resistance and previous breakdown levels. However, there are early signs of potential stabilization. Volume patterns show accumulation near the 0.03 BTC zone, which coincides with the 2021 pre-bull run consolidation range — historically, a strong demand area. If Bitcoin consolidates around $100K and market sentiment improves, Ethereum could stage a rebound in this pair, possibly signaling the beginning of a slow capital rotation back into altcoins. For now, though, BTC dominance remains firm, and ETH’s relative weakness underscores the cautious mood across the broader crypto market.

Bulls are attempting to defend key support zones, but so far, momentum remains weak and upside recovery efforts have failed to gain traction. Despite this, no clear sign of a deeper breakdown has emerged, suggesting that the market could still be in a consolidation phase rather than entering a new bearish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Aggressively: 394K ETH Worth $1.37B In Just 3 Days In the midst of this volatility, Sharplink Gaming — notably one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to adopt a treasury strategy centered around Ethereum — has made significant on-chain moves during the recent downturn. This activity comes at a time when market sentiment has turned fearful and liquidity across exchanges has thinned, hinting that institutional actors may be positioning strategically amid the chaos. While the broader market remains on edge following Bitcoin’s dip below $100K, Ethereum’s network fundamentals and corporate adoption trends continue to attract long-term attention. Sharplink’s recent actions underscore the growing institutional role in ETH markets — and may signal that some players see opportunity where others see risk. Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Moves Signal Strategic Positioning According to data from Arkham shared by Lookonchain, a wallet linked to Sharplink Gaming made a significant move during the latest market correction. The wallet redeemed 5,284 ETH, valued at roughly $17.52 million, and subsequently deposited 4,364 ETH ($14.47 million) into OKX just four hours ago. The company’s total Ethereum holdings have risen to 859,395 ETH, now worth approximately $3.58 billion at current market prices. This makes Sharplink one of the most prominent institutional ETH holders, reinforcing its conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value despite short-term volatility. The move sparked debate among analysts, as the OKX deposit could imply either profit-taking or liquidity repositioning, depending on the company’s broader risk management strategy. However, given Sharplink’s consistent Ethereum accumulation and public alignment with blockchain-based initiatives, the transaction may instead represent active portfolio rebalancing during market stress — a sign of confidence rather than retreat. As Ethereum struggles to stabilize above $3,300, institutional moves like these highlight that smart money remains engaged, potentially setting the foundation for a stronger recovery once market sentiment improves and macro conditions stabilize.

The daily chart shows ETH attempting to stabilize above its 200-day moving average (red line) — a historically significant support zone that has served as a reversal area in previous market cycles. However, the broader structure remains fragile. Ethereum continues to trade below both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, indicating that short- and mid-term momentum remains bearish. Bulls must reclaim the $3,400–$3,500 zone to confirm a stronger recovery, as this area represents both a psychological level and the point where the 50-day MA could act as dynamic resistance.

This development marks a turning point for Bitcoin education globally, affecting thousands of students and signaling new directions for cryptocurrency adoption. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Education in El Salvador? The partnership termination means the immediate suspension of educational programs that had successfully reached approximately 27,000 Salvadoran students. This Bitcoin education program represented one of the most ambitious national cryptocurrency literacy efforts worldwide. The initiative concluded in April 2024, leaving many wondering about the future of cryptocurrency education in the region. Before the partnership ended, the program achieved remarkable success in teaching students about: Bitcoin fundamentals and blockchain technology Digital wallet management and security Practical cryptocurrency applications Financial literacy through digital assets How Will the Global Bitcoin Education Rebrand Work? Following the partnership conclusion, My First Bitcoin announced plans to rebrand as a global Bitcoin education initiative. This strategic move indicates a shift from country-specific programs to worldwide cryptocurrency education. The rebranding represents an exciting evolution in Bitcoin education methodology and reach. The global approach offers several advantages: Broader audience reach across multiple countries Diverse educational content adaptation Increased accessibility through digital platforms Standardized Bitcoin education curriculum What’s Happening with El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy? While the educational partnership ended, El Salvador continues making headlines with its Bitcoin adoption strategy. The government claims to have purchased one Bitcoin daily since November 18, 2022, accumulating over 900 BTC. However, recent reports from the International Monetary Fund present conflicting information. The IMF’s report on its loan agreement with El Salvador indicates the country hasn’t purchased any Bitcoin since December 2023. This contradiction raises questions about: Transparency in national Bitcoin acquisitions Economic impact of cryptocurrency investments Future Bitcoin adoption strategies International financial oversight Why Does Quality Bitcoin Education Matter? Effective Bitcoin education serves as the foundation for responsible cryptocurrency adoption. The My First Bitcoin initiative demonstrated how structured educational programs can: Build financial literacy from early stages Promote safe cryptocurrency practices Encourage technological understanding Support economic innovation The global rebrand of this Bitcoin education program suggests continued commitment to these principles, just through different implementation methods. This evolution in Bitcoin education delivery could potentially reach even more students worldwide. What Can We Learn From This Transition? The partnership conclusion between My First Bitcoin and El Salvador offers valuable insights for cryptocurrency education initiatives. It highlights the importance of adaptable educational models and the need for sustainable Bitcoin education frameworks. The transition to a global approach may actually strengthen long-term Bitcoin education efforts by diversifying delivery methods and audience reach. Key takeaways include: Partnership models require careful planning Global approaches offer scalability benefits Continuous adaptation is crucial in crypto education Multiple delivery methods enhance accessibility Frequently Asked Questions Why did My First Bitcoin end its partnership with El Salvador? The specific reasons haven’t been publicly detailed, but the initiative is transitioning to a global Bitcoin education model rather than country-specific programs. How many students were affected by this change? Approximately 27,000 Salvadoran students who had been participating in the Bitcoin education program were affected by the suspension. When did the partnership officially end? The educational partnership concluded in April 2024, according to available reports. What happens to El Salvador’s Bitcoin education now? While My First Bitcoin programs are suspended, other initiatives or government programs might continue Bitcoin education efforts in the country. How will the global rebrand affect Bitcoin education? The rebrand aims to make Bitcoin education accessible worldwide through digital platforms and adapted content for different regions. Is El Salvador still buying Bitcoin daily? While the government claims continuous purchases, IMF reports suggest no Bitcoin acquisitions since December 2023, creating uncertainty about current practices.

According to Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer, the answer might surprise you. As gold’s impressive rally shows signs of slowing, Bitcoin appears ready to seize the opportunity and potentially deliver superior returns to investors seeking alternative assets. Why Bitcoin Could Outperform Gold Now Jurrien Timmer recently shared his compelling analysis on social media platform X, presenting a fascinating perspective on these two popular alternative assets. He suggests that gold and Bitcoin aren’t necessarily competitors but rather teammates playing different positions. However, the current market dynamics might position Bitcoin to outperform gold in the near term. The key insight comes from examining Sharpe ratios, which measure risk-adjusted returns. Timmer observed that these ratios for Bitcoin and gold have been moving in opposite directions recently. This divergence signals that Bitcoin could outperform gold as it evolves into a more mature asset class. What Makes Bitcoin Positioned to Outperform? Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s potential to outperform gold during gold price corrections: Growing institutional acceptance as a legitimate asset class Improved market infrastructure and regulatory clarity Digital native characteristics appealing to younger investors Scarcity value with predictable supply schedule As Bitcoin continues its maturation process, these attributes strengthen its case to potentially outperform gold during specific market conditions. The digital asset’s correlation with technology adoption and its appeal to digital-first investors create unique advantages that traditional gold cannot match. The Team Player Dynamic: Bitcoin and Gold Together Timmer’s ‘same team’ analogy provides crucial context. Rather than viewing Bitcoin and gold as direct competitors, investors should consider how they complement each other in a diversified portfolio. While both serve as alternative assets and potential inflation hedges, they attract different investor demographics and respond to different market catalysts. However, when gold experiences price corrections, Bitcoin’s digital nature and growth potential might enable it to outperform gold. This doesn’t mean gold becomes irrelevant, but rather that Bitcoin could capture more attention and capital during specific market phases. What This Means for Your Investment Strategy For investors considering whether Bitcoin could outperform gold in their portfolios, several actionable insights emerge: Diversification matters – Both assets have roles to play Monitor Sharpe ratios for timing decisions Consider maturity timeline for investment horizon Watch institutional flows as validation signals The possibility that Bitcoin could outperform gold represents a significant shift in how investors view digital versus traditional alternative assets. As institutional players like Fidelity provide this type of analysis, it adds credibility to Bitcoin’s investment case. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin’s Evolution Continues As Bitcoin continues evolving from speculative digital token to established asset class, its potential to outperform gold becomes more plausible. The key factors to watch include: Regulatory developments and clarity Institutional adoption rates Market infrastructure improvements Global macroeconomic conditions These elements will determine whether Bitcoin can consistently outperform gold or if the relationship remains situational and timing-dependent. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Sharpe ratio and why does it matter? The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted returns, helping investors understand how much return they’re getting for each unit of risk taken. Higher ratios indicate better risk-adjusted performance. Does this mean I should sell my gold and buy Bitcoin? Not necessarily. Both assets can play important roles in a diversified portfolio. The analysis suggests Bitcoin might outperform during specific market conditions, but gold remains a valuable diversifier. How mature is Bitcoin as an asset class compared to gold? Bitcoin is still maturing but has made significant progress. Gold has centuries of history, while Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance has grown dramatically in recent years. What risks should I consider with Bitcoin investments? Bitcoin carries volatility risk, regulatory uncertainty, technological risks, and market liquidity concerns that differ from gold’s risk profile. Can both Bitcoin and gold perform well simultaneously? Absolutely. Both can thrive in environments of monetary uncertainty, inflation concerns, or geopolitical instability, though they may respond to different catalysts. How reliable are predictions about Bitcoin outperforming gold? Like all market predictions, they involve uncertainty. However, analysis from established institutions like Fidelity carries weight due to their research resources and market experience. Found this analysis insightful?

For anyone hunting the best cryptos to buy now , the story begins with established names like LINK and TRX gaining real-world heft and ends with an under-the-radar presale ready to gang up on the scene. Now the spotlight shifts to MOBU crypto, which is staging its presale in full force, offering early-bird access to those who feel like they missed previous moonshots. With Stage 6 live at a rock-bottom price, it’s time to decide whether to join the charging bull or stay on the sidelines watching. MOBU Crypto: The Best Crypto to Buy Now, Standing Out Among the Crowds MOBU crypto is quickly emerging as one of the best cryptos to buy now , fueled by excitement and solid fundamentals. Its MOBU crypto presale is live in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, with a projected listing price of $0.00616, signaling a potential 7,244% ROI. With over $550K raised and 1,900+ holders already onboard, the project is turning serious heads across the crypto scene. The tokenomics keep things bullish: a fixed supply, 2% reflections, 2% auto-liquidity, and 1% burn model ensure long-term sustainability. Staking opens at Stage 10 with rewards up to 95% APY. For example, a $300 investment could turn into roughly $22,000 at listing, while $1,000 might climb to about $73,000, showing how early entries can make all the difference. Each presale stage increases the price by 27.40%, making this a first-come, first-served rush. For anyone who missed past moonshots, MOBU crypto offers that long-awaited second chance, standing tall among the best cryptos to buy now with real momentum, utility, and a bull-ready community.

Monthly leaderboards reward top referrers with juicy USDC prizes, making every invite worth the hustle. With over 8 billion $MOBU fueling this initiative, every connection strengthens the ecosystem. MoonBull’s growth isn’t just organic; it’s community-powered and financially electrifying. Chainlink News: LINK Trades at $15.03 as Institutional Demand Grows Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $15.03, up 0.78% in the last 24 hours, as its ecosystem sees growing adoption across DeFi and real-world asset platforms. The network powers over $95 billion in secured value across 700 oracle networks, with major institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Euroclear integrating LINK for tokenized asset solutions. LINK’s market capitalization is $10.48 billion, with a circulating supply of 696.8 million tokens, highlighting its strong presence in blockchain infrastructure and data validation. TRON Price Today: TRX Trades at $0.286 as DeFi and Content Ecosystem Expands TRON (TRX) is trading at $0.286, down 0.17% over the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $27.08 billion. The blockchain continues to expand its ecosystem, supporting over 2.6 million daily users, $4.8 billion in total value locked (TVL), and a 65% share of global retail USDT transfers under $1K. Key developments like the GreatVoyage v4.8.1 mainnet upgrade enhance ARM and JDK 17 support, improve EVM compatibility, and further TRON’s smart contract and DeFi adoption. Final Words Chainlink and TRON both bring serious credentials, infrastructure, adoption, and resilience, but if the objective is to find the best cryptos to buy now with explosive upside then MOBU crypto brings a very different flavour. Chainlink delivers stability and TRON scale, both of which are valuable for portfolios, but their upside is likely more muted than that of early-stage presale plays.

The cryptocurrency’s unexpected downturn has left many investors scratching their heads. However, the real story behind this Bitcoin price weakness might surprise you. Contrary to popular belief, the selling pressure isn’t coming from where most people think. What’s Really Causing Bitcoin Price Weakness? Recent analysis reveals a startling truth about Bitcoin’s market movements. According to Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas, the recent Bitcoin price weakness has minimal connection to ETF outflows. Instead, the real pressure comes from within the crypto community itself. This internal selling represents a significant shift in market dynamics that every investor should understand. The ETF Outflow Myth Debunked Many investors assumed that ETF redemptions were driving the market downturn. However, the numbers tell a different story. During the recent correction period: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded less than $1 billion in net outflows This represents only about 0.5% of total assets under management Baby boomer investors in these ETFs proved to be serious holders This data clearly shows that the Bitcoin price weakness cannot be attributed to ETF investors abandoning ship. Internal Selling: The Real Culprit Behind Bitcoin’s Decline Balchunas perfectly captured the situation by comparing it to a classic horror movie trope: ‘the call is coming from inside the house.’ The real selling pressure originates from established crypto participants rather than new institutional investors. This internal dynamic explains much of the recent Bitcoin price weakness that has concerned market observers. Long-Term Holders Take Profits Supporting evidence from CryptoQuant reveals staggering numbers. During the recent correction: Long-term holders sold approximately 405,000 BTC This represents over $41.3 billion in value These were holders who maintained positions for over 155 days This massive internal selling directly contributed to the Bitcoin price weakness we’ve observed. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Understanding the true source of Bitcoin price weakness provides valuable insights for strategic planning. The market dynamics suggest that traditional crypto participants are taking profits rather than new investors fleeing. This distinction matters because it indicates underlying strength in institutional adoption while highlighting natural market cycles. Navigating Future Market Movements Recognizing the patterns behind Bitcoin price weakness helps investors make informed decisions. The current situation demonstrates that even during corrections, institutional interest remains relatively stable. Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to play a significant role in price discovery through their strategic selling decisions. The recent Bitcoin price weakness tells a fascinating story about market maturity. Rather than signaling fundamental problems, the internal selling indicates natural profit-taking by experienced holders. This understanding should provide confidence to investors concerned about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. The market’s ability to absorb such significant internal selling while maintaining relative stability speaks volumes about Bitcoin’s growing resilience. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is causing Bitcoin’s recent price decline? The primary cause appears to be profit-taking by long-term holders rather than ETF outflows or institutional selling. How much Bitcoin did long-term holders sell? Data shows approximately 405,000 BTC worth over $41.3 billion was sold by holders who had maintained positions for more than 155 days. Are Bitcoin ETFs seeing significant outflows? No, ETF outflows accounted for less than $1 billion, representing only about 0.5% of total assets under management. Who are the main sellers in the current market? The selling pressure comes primarily from within the established crypto community, specifically long-term Bitcoin holders taking profits. Should investors be concerned about this selling pattern? This appears to be normal profit-taking behavior rather than panic selling, indicating healthy market dynamics. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s future price? The ability to absorb significant internal selling while maintaining relative stability suggests underlying market strength. Found this analysis of Bitcoin price weakness insightful?

The arrest of this crypto scammer reveals how sophisticated digital fraud operations can infiltrate mainstream politics and devastate unsuspecting victims. How Did This Crypto Scammer Operate? Romillo Castillo, operating under the alias ‘Cryptospain,’ allegedly built a complex multi-level marketing scheme that promised incredible returns. The crypto scammer presented himself as the head of an investment fund specializing in cryptocurrencies and luxury goods. However, authorities discovered there was no legitimate business behind the operation. The scheme targeted approximately 3,000 investors who collectively lost $300 million. This case demonstrates why due diligence is crucial when considering cryptocurrency investments. The sophisticated crypto scammer used several tactics to appear legitimate: Professional-looking websites and marketing materials Promises of exclusive investment opportunities Multi-level referral bonuses to expand the victim pool False documentation and fabricated success stories What Makes This Crypto Scammer Case Different? The investigation took an unexpected turn when police discovered potential political connections. Authorities suspect the crypto scammer funneled illicit investor funds to far-right politicians in Spain. This development has expanded the investigation to include Luis Pérez Fernández, a leader of a Spanish far-right political party. Police evidence suggests Fernández allegedly received campaign funds from Castillo’s fraudulent operation. This political dimension adds complexity to an already troubling case of cryptocurrency fraud. The involvement of political figures raises serious questions about oversight and accountability in campaign financing. What Can Investors Learn From This Crypto Scammer? This case serves as a powerful reminder about the importance of verifying investment opportunities. The arrested crypto scammer exploited common vulnerabilities that all investors should recognize: Too-good-to-be-true returns – Always question unrealistic profit promises Lack of transparency – Legitimate investments provide clear documentation Pressure to recruit – Beware of multi-level marketing structures Political connections – Don’t assume legitimacy based on associations How Are Authorities Responding to Crypto Scammer Threats? Spanish police have demonstrated increased vigilance against cryptocurrency fraud. The successful identification and arrest of this crypto scammer shows law enforcement’s growing capability to track digital financial crimes. However, the case also highlights the challenges authorities face when fraud crosses into political territory. The expanded investigation into political connections suggests authorities are taking a comprehensive approach. This sends a strong message that cryptocurrency fraud won’t be tolerated, regardless of where the money flows. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? Cases like this crypto scammer arrest inevitably fuel discussions about cryptocurrency regulation. While the technology offers innovation and opportunity, it also creates new avenues for fraud. The $300 million loss in this case underscores the need for: Better investor education about cryptocurrency risks Stronger verification processes for investment platforms Enhanced international cooperation among regulators Clearer guidelines for political campaign financing The arrest of this sophisticated crypto scammer serves as both a warning and a victory. It demonstrates that authorities can successfully investigate complex digital fraud while reminding investors that vigilance remains essential in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions How many people were affected by this crypto scam? Approximately 3,000 investors lost money in this scheme, with total losses estimated at $300 million. What was the scammer’s alias? Romillo Castillo operated under the alias ‘Cryptospain’ to appear more credible to potential investors. Were there any legitimate business activities? Authorities found no evidence of any actual business operations behind the investment fund. What political connections were uncovered? The investigation revealed potential ties to far-right politicians, specifically Luis Pérez Fernández, who allegedly received campaign funds from the scam. How can I avoid similar crypto scams? Always verify investment opportunities, research company backgrounds, be skeptical of unrealistic returns, and avoid pressure to recruit others. What happens to the investigation now? The probe has expanded to include political connections, and authorities continue to trace the flow of funds to recover investor money.

Evernorth recently made headlines for its significant acquisition of large allocations of XRP. However, the timing may not have been any more opportune, or less, according to fresh analysis by on-chain data provider CryptoQuant . Evernorth and DATs Feel the Heat as Crypto Losses Mount Just weeks after building up its position in XRP, Evernorth now has around $78 million in unrealized losses. The drop demonstrates how sensitive DATs are to price fluctuations — not only in Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also in other tokens that might move with less liquidity and more volatility. Evernorth is not alone. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), widely regarded as the first prominent corporate Bitcoin treasury model, have declined by more than 26% over the last month as the price of Bitcoin has retreated. Shares of Strategy are now down by more than 50% from their all-time high, according to market data. Despite all that pressure, Strategy is still in relatively good shape. A report from BitcoinTreasuries indicates that the firm has an estimated average cost of around $74,000 per BTC for its reserves, implying that it still maintains a significant amount of paper profit on its Bitcoin holdings. NET. More worrisome are the companies whose primary holdings reside in other major cryptocurrencies. BitMine, which holds more corporate Ethereum than any other company in the world, now has a nearly $2.1 billion loss on its unrealized Ether reserves. The firm now holds almost 3.4 million ETH, with over 565,000 being acquired in the last month alone, suggesting that accumulation persisted even as market momentum diminished. Left watching the sector are analysts who see companies closely linked to the crypto market performance — and valuations for such companies becoming more strongly correlated — as providing less of a cushion for companies without diversified revenue models when prices tumble. A recent report highlighted that retail investors have collectively lost approximately $17 billion as a direct result of investing in companies that adopted the DATs model. Also, the premium these companies used to command over their net asset value of crypto holdings had vanished almost entirely at the time of analysis, signalling a significant change in sentiment. The engineering risk associated with relying on crypto price appreciation is becoming increasingly front and centre for both equity investors and analysts. Market researchers and venture analysts are comparing the DAT’s resurgence to the late 1990s dot-com bubble. In each case, a wave of companies emerged surrounding a revolutionary new technology. Long-held beliefs and innovation fueled others. Fast wealth-creating opportunities and speculative froth from investors propelled others. Companies like Breed Capital believe that Bitcoin-centric treasuries may be better off looking ahead. Bitcoin’s liquidity, institutional involvement, and relatively stable regulatory environment mean it is less at risk of abrupt market deterioration than tokens with shallower order books. DATs industry faces critical pressure The situation playing out at Evernorth is likely to add to the already heightened scrutiny surrounding DATs firms — especially those whose business strategies are more dependent on token prices surging than stable operational revenue. Investors are now focusing on whether these businesses have the ability to generate sustainable cash flow, whether their treasury policies insulate against downside risk, and whether they have meaningful diversification (real or anticipated) and liquidity in place. These are the very issues that will decide which firms remain on the side of this market storm and which ones could be on the street, needing a “restructuring”.

In a groundbreaking speech that sent ripples through financial markets, Miran revealed how trillions in stablecoin demand could fundamentally alter how the Fed manages our economy. Why Is Stablecoin Growth Becoming the Fed’s Top Priority? Steven Miran, a key Federal Reserve official with close ties to former President Trump, delivered a stunning prediction on July 7th. He stated that stablecoin usage could reach an astonishing $1 trillion to $3 trillion within the next decade. This massive stablecoin growth represents what he called the “elephant in the room” for central bankers worldwide. The Fed now recognizes that this rapid stablecoin growth isn’t just a niche trend – it’s a fundamental shift in how people use and store value. As more individuals and institutions adopt stablecoins, the implications for traditional monetary policy become increasingly significant. How Will Stablecoin Demand Strengthen the US Dollar? Here’s where the story gets fascinating. Miran explained that increasing stablecoin adoption creates a powerful domino effect: Every stablecoin is typically backed by US dollar reserves Growing stablecoin demand means growing dollar demand This increased demand naturally strengthens the dollar’s value The Fed must then adjust monetary policy accordingly This stablecoin growth essentially creates a new channel for global dollar demand that didn’t exist a decade ago. As more people worldwide use dollar-pegged stablecoins, they’re indirectly supporting the greenback’s dominance. What Monetary Policy Changes Can We Expect? The Federal Reserve now faces a crucial decision point. Miran confirmed that monetary policy will “adapt to stablecoin growth” based on the magnitude of its impact. This means we could see: Adjustments to interest rate decisions Modified reserve requirements for banks New regulatory frameworks for digital assets Enhanced monitoring of stablecoin market movements The speed of stablecoin growth will determine how quickly these changes unfold. If adoption accelerates faster than expected, the Fed might need to act more decisively. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Everyday Users? This official recognition of stablecoin growth marks a pivotal moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Fed’s acknowledgment signals that: Stablecoins are becoming systemically important Regulatory clarity is likely coming soon Traditional finance and crypto are converging faster than expected Your stablecoin holdings could indirectly influence national policy For everyday users, this means greater legitimacy and potentially more stability in the stablecoin market as regulatory oversight increases. The Bottom Line: A Financial Revolution in Motion The Federal Reserve’s awakening to stablecoin growth represents a watershed moment for both traditional finance and the crypto world. We’re witnessing the beginning of a coordinated response to digital currency innovation that could shape economic policy for decades. As stablecoin growth continues its upward trajectory, expect more central banks worldwide to follow the Fed’s lead in adapting their approaches. The financial landscape is changing before our eyes, and those who understand these shifts will be best positioned for the future. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Fed Governor Miran say about stablecoins? Steven Miran stated that stablecoins could become a $1-3 trillion market within ten years and that the Fed’s monetary policy will adapt to this growing demand, potentially strengthening the US dollar in the process. How could stablecoin growth affect the average person? Increased stablecoin adoption could lead to more efficient cross-border payments, better access to digital financial services, and potentially influence interest rates and dollar strength through Fed policy adjustments. Will this lead to more stablecoin regulation? Yes, the Fed’s recognition of stablecoin growth as systemically important almost certainly means increased regulatory oversight and clearer frameworks are coming soon. Can stablecoin demand really strengthen the US dollar? Yes, because most stablecoins are backed by US dollar reserves, increased demand for stablecoins directly increases demand for dollars, which typically strengthens the currency’s value. How quickly might these policy changes happen? The timing depends on the speed of stablecoin adoption, but the Fed has indicated it will monitor the situation closely and adjust policy as needed based on the magnitude of impact. Should I change my investment strategy because of this? While we can’t provide financial advice, understanding these macroeconomic trends can help you make more informed decisions about both traditional and digital asset investments.

During these eight days, the stock declined by 8.6%, resulting in a loss of approximately $350 billion in market value. Amid the stock pressure, Microsoft Corp. recently inked a deal worth about $9.7 billion to acquire artificial intelligence computing capacity from IREN Ltd ., making the Australian company its largest customer. The five-year agreement grants Microsoft access to Nvidia Corp.’s systems in Texas, which are built for AI workloads, and includes a 20% prepayment, IREN said in a statement on Monday. Sydney-based IREN has agreed to purchase the necessary advanced chips, known as graphics processing units, and related equipment for $5.8 billion from Dell Technologies Inc. Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals with data centre operators like IREN and CoreWeave Inc. over the past few months in an effort to secure as much computing capacity as possible to compete in the race to build and power AI systems. Just days ago, the Redmond, Washington-based firm said it’s still struggling to secure enough capacity to fulfil all of the demand for its cloud services. Microsoft encounters significant challenges at this time due to AI weaknesses Microsoft’s stock has declined since it revealed its quarterly earnings in late October. While the report includes a few positive strengths, such as growth in its Azure cloud computing business coming in better than analysts expected, Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the money companies invest in building AI infrastructure. Sources noted that Microsoft’s investment move accounted for about $34.9 billion in capital expenditures in the quarter. Moreover, the company hinted that spending would rise again in its current fiscal quarter. Regarding Microsoft’s decline in stock, analysts noted that this decline indicates a shift in sentiment towards AI companies, which had significantly enhanced the market earlier in the year. Meanwhile, both the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index declined 4% this week, marking their largest percentage drop in a week since April. Contrastingly, Apple Inc., which has not invested as heavily in AI, encountered an increase in its stock, rising by as much as 0.9% on Friday. Despite AI weaknesses, this achievement has positioned the tech company as a safe choice. Apple remains unaffected in a recent large selloff Reports dated November 6 this year noted that a recent large selloff affected several top-performing AI stocks such as Palantir Technologies Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Interestingly, only Apple remained unaffected . While other tech firms encountered declines, the iPhone maker faced a slight increase. The Nasdaq 100 Index, on the other hand, decreased by 1.6%. This situation was similar to an earlier trading period, when Apple experienced a slight increase despite the overall index declining by around 2.1%. In the meantime, it is worth noting that Apple’s stock has escalated, surpassing the 5% mark in the past month, while the tech-focused index barely changed, surging by less than 0.5%. Concerning Apple’s remarkable performance, analysts commented that this accomplishment marks a return to the firm’s usual stability. To achieve this stability, the tech firm has adopted a mechanism to generate cash and secure a strong financial position, which has enabled it to withstand market challenges . However, Apple reportedly fell behind other companies for much of this year because investors shifted their focus towards AI profits. Still, the tech giant revived after sharing a positive outlook earlier, which counteracted findings that demonstrated poor performance in China. According to recent reports, the iPhone maker earned approximately $27.5 billion in net income last quarter, with total revenue reaching $102.5 billion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are slowing down but the new projects with lower-cost tokens are where many perceive the biggest opportunity. One of the recently added to the list of entrants is a cryptocurrency that analysts are paying more attention to due to its strategic plan, increasing support, and actual use, so it may prove the most advantageous cryptocurrency to invest in currently prior to its official release. Presale Momentum One of the most active presales in DeFi is scheduled in 2025, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At this point, more than 17,750 holders spread around the world have been building a community that the project has already raised over $18.45 million. A total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens has been preallocated with some (1.82 billion) of the preprepared packs being allocated to the presale, which provides members of the early group on an even and open playing field to purchase their packs. The presale began in early 2025 with an initial cost of only $0.01, followed by the sale of multiple phases, and currently the token is valued at $0.035 in Phase 6, which is an increase of 250% over its original price. After the presale, the price of MUTM on launch will be $0.06. Going by the figures provided by the team, Phase 6 is already over 83% committed, and the pick-up is gaining more pace every week. The platform also implements a 24-hour leaderboard, and the highest addict that puts in during the day wins $500 worth of MUTM tokens, which motivates participants to work around the clock. The team also recently introduced a new payment option enabling investors to buy MUTM with a card and no purchase limits, which has won a few of the larger holders and increased presale growth. Long-Term DeFi Development The essence of it is that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing system with efficiency, transparency, and security in its top priority. This system will enable users to put their digital assets in loan to earn yield or more capital will be borrowed by them using their collateral as the guarantor of the loan all done automatically through smart contracts that will automate each transaction and make them need fewer intermediaries. The major part of this ecosystem is the mtToken, which is a yield-generating token that users earn by investing assets in the protocol. These tokens come with automated accruing interests as the lending pursuits increase, allowing users passive income. The other significant aspect in the model developed by Mutuum Finance is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. The revenue of protocols of lending fees is used in purchasing MUTM tokens on the open market and redistributed for those who invest mtTokens in a safety module. The independent security validation has also contributed to the high technical focus of Mutuum Finance. The protocol underwent a CertiK audit receiving a 90/100 Token Scan score, which is a good performance that builds investor confidence. Together with a bug bounty program of 50,000 dollars, it represents an indication that the project is moving towards the next stage of launching a product with a very high level of preparation. Stablecoin and Oracles In a case that goes beyond the launch, Mutuum Finance has already assured the launch of a USD-pegged stablecoin that would serve as a major component of their long-term expansion strategy. This stablecoin will be pegged on the borrowing activity in the platform. Such a system establishes a workable feedback loop, and lending volume matches in token demand. Chainlink oracles would also be used to give correct and real-time prices of all available assets in the project. In order to eliminate price manipulation and accurate liquidation events during times when borrowers are below expected collateral standards, oracles are essential. According to analysts, this is a perfect mix of proper pricing and robust liquidity management that places Mutuum Finance in the list of the most technically viable next DeFi crypto product. A number of market researchers have given optimistic views as to the future value of MUTM, basing on its plan to become a stablecoin, audited codebase, and token utility. Referring to local demand and ecosystem development, analysts predict possible 8x to 20x growth at its current presale price after the platform is launched, and listings start to take place. Growing Whale Interest The Mutuum Finance team has stated that the version 1 release of the protocol is planned to occur in the Q4 of 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet. This early release will be with the core functionality of the system Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot which will allow it to prove the functionality of real lending prior to its mainnet launch. The investor hype has been increasing at a high rate towards this milestone. Activities of whales have been witnessed especially within the past few weeks when several purchases of half a dozen figures have been registered within 24 hours. This is an indication that institutional and early strategic investors take the project seriously with Phase 6 approaching completion. Mutuum Finance is coming into the DeFi market when investors are seeking greater transparency and actual usefulness. Lending model, mtToken rewards and revenue-backed tokenomics form the model which has the potential to scale beyond hype cycles. As the presale is nearing the end stages and V1 release is coming, MUTM is becoming increasingly dissociated with hypothetical tokens that have little potential in the long term. Finally, as the major coins are driven into the background, there is potential that this new crypto is ultimately quietly positioning itself to have one of the best price performances of 2026.

Related Reading: Is A Ripple IPO Coming? Garlinghouse Shares New Insights Despite short-term weakness, analysts remain divided, with institutional forecasts ranging from $120,000 to $170,000 for 2025. Macro Pressure Keeps Bitcoin in Tight Range Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $100,900, down 2.01% in the last 24 hours, extending its 8.2% weekly decline. The broader crypto market capitalization slipped to $3.37 trillion as Ethereum fell below $3,400 and altcoins posted mixed results. Analysts attribute the muted action to tight liquidity and risk-off sentiment, with BTC trapped between key support at $100,500 and resistance at $102,500. According to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, maintaining levels above $100,500 keeps sentiment “constructive,” but a breakout above $102,500 is needed to target $104,000–$105,000. Whale activity, however, suggests accumulation. Wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC added nearly 30,000 BTC last week, signaling growing confidence among large holders. Diverging Institutional Bitcoin Forecasts Add to Uncertainty Institutional analysts remain split on Bitcoin’s next move. JPMorgan values BTC at $170,000, comparing its risk-adjusted volatility to gold, while Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor forecast a $150,000 year-end target driven by ETF inflows and institutional rotation. In contrast, Galaxy Digital cut its 2025 forecast to $120,000 after whales sold 400,000 BTC in October, warning that Bitcoin’s “maturity era” may lead to slower but steadier growth. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has trimmed her 2030 price target from $1.5 million to $1.2 million, citing stablecoin adoption in emerging markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where citizens are increasingly using USDT to hedge against inflation. Market Sentiment and Corporate Impact Market sentiment remains fragile, with RSI readings below 40 suggesting an oversold phase. Veteran analyst Tom Lee believes current macro challenges could “turn into opportunities,” predicting a turnaround once U.S. inflation eases. Adding to the mix, Block Inc., led by Jack Dorsey, reported $1.97 billion in Bitcoin-related revenue for Q3 2025, nearly one-third of its total earnings, despite a broader earnings miss that sent shares down over 10%.

Ray Dalio Warns Of ‘Stimulus Into A Bubble’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/most-dangerous-bitcoin-boom-ray-dalio/,"Ray Dalio has fired a shot across the macro bow, arguing that the Federal Reserve’s latest balance-sheet guidance risks “stimulating into a bubble” rather than stabilizing a weakening economy—an inversion of the classic post-crisis QE playbook with potentially seismic implications for hard assets, including Bitcoin. In a post titled “Stimulating Into a Bubble,” Dalio frames the Fed’s pivot—ending quantitative tightening and signaling that reserves will need to start growing again—as the next milestone in the late stage of the Big Debt Cycle. “Did you see that the Fed’s announcement that it will stop QT and begin QE?” he wrote, cautioning that, even if described as a technical maneuver, it is “an easing move… to track the progression of the Big Debt Cycle.” If balance-sheet expansion coincides with rate cuts and persistent fiscal deficits, Dalio warns, markets will be staring at a “classic monetary and fiscal interaction of the Fed and the Treasury to monetize government debt.” He adds that, in such a setup—high equity prices, tight credit spreads, low unemployment, above-target inflation, and an AI-led mania—“it will look to me like the Fed is stimulating into a bubble.” Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Just Bottom? Trader Says The Low Must Form Now The policy context for Dalio’s warning is not imaginary. After months of tightening liquidity and ebbing bank reserves, the Fed has announced it will end balance-sheet runoff (QT). Chair Jerome Powell underscored that, within the ample-reserves framework, the central bank will at some point have to add reserves again: “At a certain point, you’ll want reserves to start gradually growing to keep up with the size of the banking system and the size of the economy. So we’ll be adding reserves at a certain point,” he said at his October 29 press conference. Officials and many sell-side desks have emphasized that reserve management need not equal a return to crisis-era QE. The practical similarity: if the Fed is again a steady net buyer of Treasuries to maintain “ample” reserves as deficits persist, the market experience can rhyme with QE even without the label. While Dalio spars Bitcoin from his post, the mechanics are familiar to Bitcoin investors. He argues that when central banks buy bonds and push real yields down, “what happens next depends on where the liquidity goes.” If it remains in financial assets, “multiples expand, risk spreads compress, and gold rises,” producing “financial asset inflation.” Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 If it seeps into goods and services, inflation rises and real returns can erode. Crucially for cross-asset allocation, Dalio frames relative returns explicitly: with gold yielding 0% and, say, a 10-year Treasury yielding ~4%, gold outperforms if its price appreciation is expected to exceed that rate, especially as inflation expectations rise and the currency’s purchasing power falls. In that environment, “the more money and credit central banks are making, the higher I expect the inflation rate to be, and the less I like bonds relative to gold.” What This Means For Bitcoin Commentators immediately translated those mechanics for Bitcoin. “Fed resumes QE → more liquidity → real interest rates fall,” wrote Coin Bureau CEO Nick Puckrin. “Falling real rates → bonds & cash become unattractive → money chases risk and hard assets… Inflation risk rises → investors hedge with gold, commodities, and digital stores of value.” He highlighted Dalio’s own language—“gold rises so there is financial asset inflation,” and QE “pushes real yields down and pushes P/E multiples up”—before concluding: “Bitcoin thrives in precisely that environment… it’s digital gold on steroids.” Millionaire investor Thomas Kralow sharpened the timing risk embedded in Dalio’s framework: this would not be “stimulus into a depression” but “stimulus into a mania.” In his words, liquidity would “flood already overheated markets… stocks melt up, gold rips, and crypto… goes vertical,” with the usual risk-on sequence across the crypto complex. His caveat mirrors Dalio’s late-cycle caution: a liquidity melt-up now, then—on a longer horizon—re-acceleration in inflation, a forced policy reversal, and a violent bubble pop. For Bitcoin, the near-term transmission is straightforward. Lower real yields and expanding liquidity historically coincide with stronger performance of long-duration, high-beta, and scarcity narratives; similar to 1999-style melt-ups and late-cycle surges in hard assets, including gold—and, by extension, BTC as a “digital gold” proxy. But the medium-to-long-term tension is unresolved: if the same easing stokes renewed inflation pressure, the exit—the point at which policy must tighten into the bubble—becomes the regime break Dalio is flagging. Dalio’s bottom line is not a trading signal but a regime warning. “Whether this becomes a full and classic stimulative QE (with big net purchases) remains to be seen,” he writes. If the Fed is indeed easing into a bubble, Bitcoin may benefit on the way up—but that path, by Dalio’s own schema, ends with impact. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $99,717.

Blockchain analytics firm Santiment has issued a crucial warning that could impact every cryptocurrency investor’s portfolio. The alarming pattern of whales selling BTC while retail investors enthusiastically buy the dip represents a significant Bitcoin market risk that demands immediate attention. What Exactly is This Bitcoin Market Risk Signal? Santiment’s latest analysis reveals a concerning divergence in investor behavior. Since October 12th, whales holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have sold approximately 32,500 BTC. Meanwhile, smaller retail wallets have been actively accumulating during price dips. This creates a substantial Bitcoin market risk because historical data shows BTC prices tend to follow whale direction rather than retail sentiment. Why Should You Care About This Market Warning? Understanding this Bitcoin market risk is essential for making informed investment decisions. The current situation presents several critical factors: Whales control significant portions of Bitcoin supply Their movements historically precede major price trends Retail investors often enter at market turning points The divergence indicates potential volatility ahead How Does This Bitcoin Market Risk Impact Your Strategy? This developing Bitcoin market risk requires careful consideration in your investment approach. While retail buying shows confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, the simultaneous whale selling suggests experienced investors see short-term challenges. Therefore, you might want to: Review your risk management strategies Consider dollar-cost averaging instead of large lump sums Monitor additional market indicators beyond whale movements Prepare for potential increased volatility What Historical Patterns Tell Us About This Bitcoin Market Risk Santiment’s research demonstrates that similar divergences between whale and retail behavior have preceded significant market movements. The current Bitcoin market risk pattern mirrors historical instances where retail enthusiasm contrasted with whale caution, often leading to price corrections. However, it’s crucial to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results in this dynamic Bitcoin market risk environment. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Risk Landscape Facing this Bitcoin market risk doesn’t mean you should panic sell. Instead, use this information to make more informed decisions. The key is understanding that whale activity represents just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. You should also monitor: Overall market sentiment indicators Regulatory developments Macroeconomic factors affecting cryptocurrencies Technical analysis patterns This Bitcoin market risk warning from Santiment serves as a crucial reminder that successful cryptocurrency investing requires watching multiple indicators. While whale movements provide valuable insights, they work best when combined with other analysis methods. The current divergence between large and small investors highlights the importance of comprehensive market understanding in navigating Bitcoin’s volatile landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What defines a Bitcoin whale? Bitcoin whales typically hold between 10 and 10,000 BTC, representing investors with substantial market influence due to their large holdings. How reliable are whale movements as indicators? While historically significant, whale movements should be considered alongside other indicators since they represent just one aspect of market dynamics. Should retail investors stop buying when whales sell? Not necessarily. Many successful investors use dollar-cost averaging strategies regardless of whale activity, focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term movements. How often does Santiment update these analyses? Santiment provides regular market updates, but significant warnings like this typically accompany notable pattern changes or emerging risks. Can retail investors counteract whale selling pressure? While individual retail investors have limited impact, collective retail buying can sometimes provide support during whale selling periods. What other indicators should I watch alongside whale activity? Important complementary indicators include trading volume, fear and greed index, regulatory news, and broader market trends.

As the crypto market navigates sharp swings, investors are torn between proven giants and disruptive presales that promise astronomical gains. Ripple ($XRP), a mainstay in digital payments, continues to shape global liquidity networks. Yet deep within Ethereum’s core, a cinematic powerhouse named BullZilla ($BZIL) is emerging, a token designed to fuse storytelling, staking, and scarcity into one evolving ecosystem. In today’s unpredictable meme coin market, fundamentals and fun must coexist. Ripple’s established partnerships make it a reliable player, while BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine and live Roar Burn Mechanism set the stage for what could be one of the most explosive launches in 2025. Let’s dive into both worlds and uncover why traders are calling BullZilla the top crypto presale to buy this week. Ripple ($XRP): The Veteran Still Commanding the Crypto Arena Ripple remains a cornerstone of blockchain’s institutional adoption wave. Priced at $2.31 with a market cap of $139.63 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $5.86 billion, XRP remains a titan in the payment sector. Over the last 24 hours, XRP saw a 4.55% increase, though the 7-day performance dipped 9.95%, and the 1-month trend dropped 22.28%. Despite volatility, XRP has skyrocketed 333.67% in the past year, and from its all-time low of $0.002802 to its ATH of $3.84 (2018), it’s up an astounding 39,242%. Analysts expect Ripple’s price to hover between $3.20–$3.50 over the next 6–12 months as adoption accelerates through partnerships and CBDC integrations. However, Ripple’s momentum feels like a disciplined gallop compared to BullZilla’s untamed roar. Without deflationary mechanics or high-yield staking, Ripple offers stability over speculation, ideal for cautious investors, but less thrilling for those chasing explosive upside. In a market filled with barks and howls, Ripple remains the steady guard dog of crypto finance, but BullZilla may soon become the apex predator in meme token evolution. Frequently Asked Questions About Ripple What is Ripple’s current market performance? Ripple trades at $2.31 with a $139.63B market cap and $5.86B daily volume. Despite short-term dips, it’s up 333.67% annually and 39,242% from its all-time low, reflecting strong institutional adoption momentum. What is Ripple’s 2025 price prediction? Analysts forecast $3.20–$3.50 over the next 6–12 months, driven by global partnerships and CBDC integrations. Ripple’s steady growth positions it as a reliable asset for investors who favor consistency over the volatility of speculative meme coins. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Roaring Presale Reshaping the Meme Coin Era The BullZilla presale has introduced a new breed of tokenomics. Currently at Stage 9C (Phase 3) and priced at $0.00023239, the project has already raised over $1 million, with 3,500+ holders and more than 31 billion tokens sold. The beast’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. At this level, early buyers face a 2168.34% ROI from Stage 9C to the listing price of $0.00527, while the earliest believers enjoy returns exceeding 3941.56%. Each stage operates on a simple yet effective rule: the price climbs with every $100K raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This dynamic fuels FOMO and ensures continuous growth. Meanwhile, the Roar Burn Mechanism visibly burns a portion of supply at every chapter’s end, intensifying scarcity. With a 70% APY staking pool in the HODL Furnace and 10% referral rewards, BullZilla’s ecosystem keeps community engagement and token value roaring in sync. The Investor’s Blueprint: How a Small Bet Can Turn Gigantic For those seeking the top crypto presale to buy this week, BullZilla’s mathematics are impossible to ignore. A $1,000 investment today earns around 4.303 million $BZIL tokens, potentially worth $22,676 at listing. Scale that up, a $5,000 entry could yield 21.51 million tokens, translating to over $113,000 if the launch target holds. This isn’t blind speculation, it’s structured growth. BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine keeps token velocity consistent, while the Roarblood Vault provides long-term sustainability through its referral-driven community design. Fueled by Ethereum’s security and scalability, the project combines meme culture with hard-coded economic precision. BullZilla isn’t just a presale; it’s an evolving narrative of belief and burn. Frequently Asked Questions About Bullzilla Presale How does the BullZilla presale work? BullZilla’s presale price automatically increases every $100K raised or every 48 hours, ensuring consistent upward growth. Early investors gain access to lower entry prices, more substantial returns, and dynamic momentum-driven opportunities within its evolving ecosystem. What makes BullZilla different from other meme coins? BullZilla stands apart with narrative-based chapters, deflationary Roar Burns, 70% APY staking, and 10% referral bonuses. Each presale stage drives scarcity, amplifies engagement, and forges a community united by conviction rather than short-term hype. How much can investors earn from BullZilla staking? BullZilla’s HODL Furnace offers 70% APY, rewarding conviction over speculation. Holders who lock tokens earn consistent passive income while reinforcing network stability and strengthening long-term ecosystem value through sustainable yield mechanics and loyalty-based participation. Conclusion Based on our research and the latest market trends, both Ripple and BullZilla present distinct yet powerful opportunities for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape. BullZilla is named as the top crypto presale to buy this week . Ripple stands as a veteran of trust, driving institutional-grade liquidity and cross-border solutions with proven stability. Meanwhile, BullZilla represents the new-age contender—an ecosystem built around scarcity, lore, and gamified mechanics that transform holding into participation. Ripple’s foundation in real-world finance ensures reliability, while BullZilla’s presale innovation fuels energy, belief, and exponential upside for early believers entering before major adoption. Yet the difference lies in velocity and investor appetite. BullZilla’s progressive price increases, 70% APY staking furnace, and live Roar Burn deflationary system make it a standout among modern meme-driven ecosystems. Its cinematic lore chapters, automated price escalations, and community-fueled referrals create continuous momentum that rewards conviction over hesitation. As the presale edges closer to its next 2.87% surge, entry points tighten rapidly. Ripple may dominate institutional charts, but BullZilla’s roar is poised to dominate every headline in 2025.

The perfect storm hitting the mining industry right now threatens to wipe out operations that once thrived during bull markets. Recent reports reveal that rising Bitcoin mining costs combined with falling prices are creating an unprecedented survival challenge for miners worldwide. Why Are Bitcoin Mining Costs Becoming Unsustainable? The core problem lies in the hash price collapse. This crucial metric measures expected daily revenue per petahash per second (PH/s). It recently crashed to around $42 from July’s $62 per PH/s. This steady decline means miners earn significantly less for the same computational power they contribute to the network. Several factors drive these escalating Bitcoin mining costs: Soaring electricity expenses worldwide Increasing equipment maintenance and replacement costs Intensifying network competition requiring more powerful rigs Regulatory pressures adding compliance expenses How Are Miners Responding to These Challenges? The mining industry isn’t sitting idle. Many operations face tough choices as Bitcoin mining costs outpace potential rewards. TheMinerMag reports that continued hash price drops force some miners to consider complete shutdowns. This creates a domino effect throughout the equipment supply chain. Some manufacturers like Bitdeer now prioritize self-mining over hardware sales due to collapsing demand. Meanwhile, numerous Bitcoin miners pivot toward alternative revenue streams. The most popular shift involves transitioning to: AI computing services High-performance computing data centers Cloud computing infrastructure Alternative cryptocurrency mining What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future Security? Here’s the concerning part: if Bitcoin mining costs remain high while profitability declines, network security could suffer. Miners secure the blockchain through computational work, earning Bitcoin rewards. If too many miners shut down, the network’s hash rate could drop, potentially making it vulnerable to attacks. However, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment provides a built-in safety mechanism. Every 2016 blocks (approximately two weeks), the network automatically recalibrates mining difficulty based on participating hash power. This ensures block times remain consistent even as miners join or leave the network. Can Innovation Solve the Bitcoin Mining Costs Crisis? Absolutely. The industry already develops creative solutions to address rising Bitcoin mining costs. Renewable energy integration represents one promising approach. Solar and wind power can significantly reduce electricity expenses, which typically constitute 60-70% of operational costs. Other innovations include: More energy-efficient ASIC miners Heat recycling from mining operations Strategic location near cheap energy sources Modular mining facilities for easier scaling What Should Investors and Enthusiasts Watch? Monitoring hash price trends provides crucial insights into mining health. When Bitcoin mining costs exceed potential rewards for extended periods, industry consolidation typically follows. Smaller operations get acquired or close, while well-capitalized companies survive and potentially thrive during recovery periods. Additionally, watch for: Public mining companies’ quarterly reports Network difficulty adjustment trends Equipment manufacturer announcements Energy price developments in key mining regions Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Mining Crossroads The current Bitcoin mining costs crisis represents both danger and opportunity. While struggling miners face existential threats, efficient operations may emerge stronger. The industry’s pivot toward AI and alternative computing suggests resilience and adaptability. Ultimately, market forces will separate sustainable operations from those unable to manage rising Bitcoin mining costs effectively. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is hash price in Bitcoin mining? Hash price represents the expected daily revenue miners earn per petahash per second of computing power. It’s a crucial profitability metric that combines Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty. How do rising energy costs affect Bitcoin mining? Electricity typically constitutes 60-70% of operational expenses. When energy prices increase, Bitcoin mining costs rise significantly, squeezing profit margins especially when cryptocurrency prices decline. Why are miners switching to AI computing? AI and high-performance computing offer more stable revenue streams compared to Bitcoin mining’s volatility. This diversification helps miners survive periods of high Bitcoin mining costs and low profitability. Can Bitcoin mining become profitable again? Yes, through several potential developments: Bitcoin price recovery, more energy-efficient technology, cheaper renewable energy integration, or network difficulty adjustments that reduce competition. What happens if too many miners shut down? Bitcoin’s network automatically adjusts mining difficulty downward, making it easier for remaining miners to earn rewards. This built-in mechanism helps maintain network security during miner exodus periods. How can small-scale miners survive high costs? Strategies include joining mining pools, accessing cheaper energy sources, using more efficient equipment, and potentially diversifying into other computing services alongside Bitcoin mining.

While Bitcoin and major altcoins grab headlines, investors are increasingly looking for projects with tangible, income-generating utility. In this landscape, one presale is making significant noise by bridging blockchain technology with the stability of the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. RentStac (RNS) is a project that’s rapidly gaining traction for its clear and powerful value proposition. Instead of relying on hype or complex DeFi mechanics, RentStac offers fractional ownership of rental properties, a market historically out of reach for the average investor. With its presale crossing the half-million-dollar mark and a limited-time bonus offer creating a sense of urgency, many are viewing it as a foundational project in the RWA sector. Why RentStac is Making Headlines Unlike many new tokens that offer speculative promise, RentStac’s model is anchored in physical, cash-flow-positive assets. This provides a layer of stability and inherent value that sets it apart from more volatile cryptocurrencies. The platform’s approach is both innovative and straightforward. RentStac acquires income-generating properties and places them into a legally sound structure known as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The ownership of this entity is then tokenized into RNS tokens. This means that an RNS token isn’t just a digital currency; it’s a verifiable share of a real estate portfolio. This structure allows investors to enjoy the financial benefits of property ownership, like rental income and appreciation, without the complexities of direct management. Presale Details You Can’t Ignore The impressive early performance of the RentStac presale highlights strong market confidence in its model. Total Funds Raised: $561,242 as of November 7, 2025 Current Token Price: $0.025 during its initial phase Accepted Payment Methods: ETH, USDT, USDC The main catalyst driving this momentum is an exceptional 100% Double Allocation Bonus. For a limited period, any investment made in the presale is matched with an equal number of free tokens. This offer effectively doubles an investor’s potential return from the outset. Consider the impact of this bonus. An investment of just $100 at the current price of $0.025 would secure 4,000 RNS tokens. With the bonus, that allocation instantly becomes 8,000 RNS. If the token’s price climbs to $1 after its public launch, that initial $100 investment could grow to be worth $8,000. It is this type of asymmetrical upside that defines successful early-stage crypto investments. This “double up” opportunity is strictly tied to the current presale phase and will not be repeate d. The Future of Tokenized Real Estate RentStac’s appeal is further strengthened by its “dual-yield” ecosystem, which is designed to deliver value to both passive holders and active participants. First, all token holders benefit from a system of automated buybacks. A portion of the rental income generated by the property portfolio is used to purchase RNS tokens from the open market. This action creates consistent demand and reduces the circulating supply, supporting the token’s long-term value. Second, for investors seeking more direct returns, RNS tokens can be staked in pools that are linked to specific properties. Participants in these pools earn a share of the monthly rental income, which is distributed in USDC. This provides a stable, predictable income stream that is insulated from the broader crypto market’s price swings. The project is also building on a strong foundation of security. Its smart contracts have already received a high security score of 92.48% from an audit by SolidityScan, and a more comprehensive audit by the well-respected firm CertiK is currently in progress. As the digital asset space matures, projects that offer clear utility and connect to real-world economic activity are positioned for sustainable growth. RentStac is a leading example of this trend. Its combination of a proven asset class, an innovative tokenization model, and a powerful, time-sensitive presale bonus makes it a compelling opportunity for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio beyond traditional cryptocurrencies.

The MVRV metric now reflects a valuation reset similar to the conditions that preceded major rebound phases in prior cycles. Why The Reset Reinforces Bitcoin Value Proposition The crypto bearish performance echoes through the Bitcoin community as the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio dips into the critical 1.8 to 2.0 range, a zone significant for past cycle corrections where BTC found its footing before initiating a recovery. An ambassador and market expert, BitBull, has revealed on X that for those unfamiliar with its significance, the MVRV ratio compares BTC’s current market value to its realized value, which is what investors actually paid for their coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Flatline: Bull Score Crashes To 0 – What This Means For The Market However, when this ratio dips near 2, it signals that a majority of holders are hovering around their cost basis. At this point, there’s no greed left in the system, just conviction. Historically, this 1.8 to 2.0 MVRV range has coincided with major market bottoms in June 2021, November 2022, and April 2025, when the market felt broken, but BTC was quietly resetting. With the MVRV ratio currently re-entering this same critical zone, combined with the massive liquidations observed recently and a palpable sense of panic across the market, the pattern feels eerily familiar. Every time sentiment turns into hopelessness, on-chain data would show a different story of exhaustion, not collapse. BitBull personally views this phase as one of compression, not capitulation, indicating short-term pain but a long-term opportunity. The same market dynamics cycle that previously punished excessive leverage is now washing out the remaining weak hands. BitBull concluded that if history rhymes, this will be the part of the story where the bottom gets written, not the top. Why Liquidity Matters More Than Interest Rates Liquidity has been a crucial component of the Bitcoin market. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that if there is one macro factor that drives BTC and the broader crypto market, it’s the amount of global liquidity within the financial system, not interest rates. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Grabs: Institutions Target Low-Volume Zones To Move BTC Price This correlation is clear from comparing the global liquidity index with BTC’s price movements over the years. Daan has recently observed a shift where global liquidity has stopped expanding and begun to trend downwards again. However, this change has put a halt to BTS’s upward momentum, combined with the anticipated profit-taking behavior observed during the 4-year market cycle. “Once global liquidity starts expanding at a rapid pace, the market environment for crypto will become significantly more supportive than it is currently,” the expert noted.

54151110,623611,1762567259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54151110.jpeg,Bitcoin Structure Is Changing: What Rising CDD Says About This Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-structure-changing-what-rising-cdd-says/,"Bitcoin is struggling to hold the $100K level, with bulls unable to reclaim momentum as fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The price continues to trade near critical support, and despite strong on-chain fundamentals, sentiment remains fragile. According to top analyst Darkfost, the market is undergoing a profound transformation — one that’s making many traditional on-chain indicators less reliable. “With time, we can clearly see that the structure and dynamics of the market are evolving,” he notes. While retail behavior and exchange flows once defined market cycles, the growing influence of institutions, ETFs, and long-term investors has changed the rhythm of Bitcoin’s price action. Still, some metrics remain vital, and one of the most insightful, according to Darkfost, is Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) — a measure of long-term holder activity. “It’s one of the indicators I follow the most because long-term holders are still driving this market,” he says. Currently, between 75% and 80% of all Bitcoin supply is held by long-term holders, signaling that the majority of investors remain strong-handed despite volatility. This consolidation among patient holders may ultimately set the stage for the next major trend once short-term fear fades. Long-Term Holders Drive Market Dynamics Through Rising CDD According to Darkfost, the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric remains one of the most valuable tools for understanding Bitcoin’s market structure. It provides a clear visualization of long-term holder (LTH) activity and the potential selling pressure they exert. Essentially, CDD measures how long coins have been held before being moved — and when older coins start circulating again, it’s often a sign that distribution is underway. Currently, the 30-day moving average of CDD is steadily rising, having doubled since early summer. Interestingly, this metric declined before Bitcoin’s last all-time high, helping fuel that rally, but it has continued to climb since — reflecting growing LTH activity. On an annual scale, CDD levels have already surpassed the 2021 cycle and are approaching those from 2017, marking one of the most active long-term holder phases in Bitcoin’s history. This trend signals a massive transfer of supply between market participants. Despite this, Bitcoin remains above $100,000, showing that today’s market is more liquid, resilient, and institutionally driven than in previous cycles. LTHs now have the ability to distribute significant volumes without crashing prices, demonstrating how far Bitcoin’s maturity and market depth have evolved over time. Bitcoin Battles to Hold $100K Support Bitcoin is currently trading near $100,767, struggling to maintain stability after a volatile week marked by aggressive selling pressure. The daily chart reveals that BTC has once again tested the $100K psychological support, a key level that bulls must defend to prevent further downside momentum. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin remains below its 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, signaling that short- and mid-term momentum continues to favor the bears. The 200-day moving average (red) — now positioned slightly above $106K — is acting as dynamic resistance, reinforcing the broader correction phase that began in late October. If Bitcoin manages to close above $103K–$104K, it could signal a short-term recovery toward $108K–$110K. Conversely, a decisive break below $100K could trigger a sharper correction toward $95K, potentially testing the market’s resilience as sentiment continues to waver between fear and cautious optimism.

In a letter, OpenAI’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, Chris Lehane, requested that the existing 35% tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing be expanded to include AI data centres, server production, and essential electrical grid components. The move underscores OpenAI’s attempts to cut costs in building infrastructure for advanced artificial intelligence. Lehane argues that a broader tax credit would reduce the effective cost of capital, decrease risk in early-stage investments, and unleash private financing that could accelerate the development of AI infrastructure in the U.S.. The company also contended that enabling the sanctions to continue in force would be a step toward ensuring the existence of a domestic supply chain for critical materials and components, such as special steel, transformers, and other electrical equipment needed in high-capacity data centres. This push comes as OpenAI recently agreed to purchase $38 billion worth of capacity from Amazon Web Services. Amazon noted in a press release that OpenAI will utilize hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) in the United States to run workloads on AWS infrastructure, with plans to increase capacity in the coming years. Amazon stated that the rapid advancement of AI technology has created an unprecedented demand for computing power. According to Amazon, the deal’s initial phase will utilize existing AWS data centres, and it will subsequently expand its OpenAI infrastructure. Administration says no to federal AI backstop OpenAI’s request comes as attention to the costs and funding of AI infrastructure has been increasing. The company has already committed to investing $1.4 trillion in data centres and chips to develop even more advanced AI systems. Its investment plans have baffled some in the industry, as OpenAI has employed inventive financing mechanisms to support this expansion. This week, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar sparked controversy by suggesting that perhaps the U.S. government has a role to play in supporting financing for AI infrastructure. OpenAI promptly stated that it is not seeking a federal bailout, saying Friar was mistaken. The administration has been unequivocal in not supporting a direct financial backstop for AI companies. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks has publicly stated that there is no Federal bailout for AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman assured that the company is seeking measures to bolster the U.S. AI and semiconductor sector, not loans or guarantees for its own operations. A robust U.S. supply chain from the manufacturer of semiconductors and transformers to raw steel would benefit all industry customers and other industries that depend on those elements, and it should be a national security interest,” Altman said. OpenAI urges Washington to back AI infrastructure The letter also suggested that manufacturers in the AI sector may soon receive broader government support through grants, loans, or cost-sharing arrangements. Such a boost would be designed to guard against market distortion from international competition, including that of China, and reduce lead times in areas such as infrastructure. In a separate white paper published in September, the company also noted that loan guarantees would enable AI firms to purchase U.S.-made chips in volume without worry, adding more depth to domestic chip demand while driving down costs for AI developers. The Chips Act, which originally aimed at chip fabrication, has delivered only a small portion of its funds so far. OpenAI’s plan aligns with a Trump administration goal of enhancing U.S. competitiveness in AI by promoting domestic investment in infrastructure deemed essential. It could also help accelerate the deployment of AI data centers and other infrastructure, making it more likely that the U.S. can remain a winner in AI technology by building out AI ecosystems for manufacturing in America.” Although the administration has not publicly responded to OpenAI’s letter, the submission serves as an example of how AI companies are entering a new phase of influencing U.S. industry and technology policy. OpenAI’s proposal for a wider tax credit reflects its view that public policy could help facilitate the rapid deployment of AI while preserving the nation’s manufacturing capabilities.

Solana just pulled $9.7 million in ETF inflows within 24 hours, hinting at surging institutional interest, while Tron’s chart shows a double-bottom breakout that has analysts flipping bullish. These signals are fueling optimism across major altcoins heading into year-end. Meanwhile, MoonBull ($MOBU) is taking over the presale spotlight with a model that blends high staking rewards and scarcity-driven growth. As traditional assets steady and altcoins bounce, MoonBull’s mix of real utility, transparent tokenomics, and strong community engagement makes it the most exciting candidate for explosive returns in 2025. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Top 100x Crypto to Buy MoonBull isn’t just another presale; it’s a staking powerhouse. The project offers a fixed 95% APY return, starting from the 20h stage of the presale, allowing holders to earn daily rewards without rigid staking conditions. Tokens can be staked directly from the dashboard, with rewards supported by a 14.6 billion $MOBU pool dedicated to long-term sustainability. This system ensures every investor, from small participants to large whales, can grow their holdings consistently. By removing high entry barriers and maintaining flexibility, MoonBull aligns with its mission to deliver accessible passive income. The staking pool strengthens token stability while rewarding commitment, positioning MoonBull as the top 100x crypto to buy for investors seeking both growth and reliability. MoonBull Presale Momentum: Stage 6 and Rising MoonBull’s presale is now in its 6th stage, priced at $0.00008388 with over $550,000 raised and 1,900+ holders onboard. The current ROI sits above 7,244%, and early entrants from Stage 5 have already enjoyed 235% returns. With an upcoming 27.4% price surge expected in the next phase, investors still have time to secure positions before the next jump. The presale’s structured pricing ensures predictable gains, giving both early and mid-stage participants strong upside potential. This stage represents a sweet spot, late enough to confirm legitimacy but early enough to capture significant returns as liquidity and staking rewards scale after launch. Solana (SOL): ETF Inflows of $9.7M Spark $200 Price Ambition Solana continues its remarkable comeback, pulling $9.7 million in ETF inflows in just 24 hours, according to AMBCrypto. Institutional investors are piling in, driving optimism that Solana could revisit the $200 level before year-end. Analysts credit its strong on-chain performance and its ability to handle over 80 million daily transactions, making it one of the most scalable networks in crypto. The ETF traction shows Solana’s evolution from a retail-driven coin to an institutional favorite. Its expanding developer base and dominance in DeFi and NFTs are key factors behind the bullish sentiment. If the inflows continue at this rate, Solana could reclaim its 2021 highs faster than expected. Tron (TRX): Technical Rebound from Double Bottom Ignites Bullish Momentum Tron is quietly mounting a comeback. A new analysis by 99Bitcoins highlights that TRX has completed a double-bottom pattern, a technical indicator that often precedes a sharp trend reversal. Trading volume has increased significantly, and Tron’s consistent growth in stablecoin transactions exceeding $24 billion daily underlines its position as a cornerstone of blockchain-based finance. The Tron DAO’s focus on cross-border payments and recent integrations, including Dynamic’s wallet SDK, continue to attract developers. This shift suggests TRX could build steady momentum in Q4, making it one of the more reliable altcoins heading into 2025. Conclusion: As Solana’s ETF inflows accelerate and Tron regains bullish footing, the broader crypto market looks ready for its next leg up. These moves show that institutional interest and network fundamentals still drive long-term performance. Yet among these rallies, MoonBull offers what the giants cannot: massive early-stage potential and accessible compounding rewards. With 95% APY staking, a growing holder base, and a presale model that rewards loyalty, MoonBull combines the best of both worlds: innovation and income. For investors eyeing the 100x crypto to buy before 2025, MoonBull’s momentum, transparency, and ecosystem growth make it one of the most promising projects in today’s market cycle.

The end of the US government shutdown is about to create powerful liquidity tailwinds that could transform your investment portfolio. According to expert analysis from Glassnode co-founders, we’re standing at the edge of a significant market shift that benefits risk assets across the board. What Are Liquidity Tailwinds and Why Do They Matter? Liquidity tailwinds represent the powerful market forces that push investments forward. Think of them as favorable winds filling the sails of your investment ship. When liquidity increases, more money flows into markets, creating upward momentum for assets like stocks, cryptocurrencies, and high-yield bonds. The recent government shutdown created the opposite effect – liquidity headwinds. The Treasury General Account accumulated funds above its target, essentially draining money from the system. This temporary situation hurt risk assets, but the reversal promises to be dramatic. How Does the Shutdown End Create These Liquidity Tailwinds? When government spending resumes, something remarkable happens. The Treasury releases accumulated funds from the TGA back into the financial system. This creates immediate liquidity tailwinds that benefit risk assets in several ways: Increased money supply in circulation Improved market confidence and investor sentiment Enhanced borrowing and lending activity Stronger demand for higher-risk investments Negentropic, the analysis platform by Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, explains this creates perfect conditions for market recovery. What Additional Factors Boost These Liquidity Tailwinds? The shutdown resolution isn’t the only factor creating favorable conditions. Several other elements combine to strengthen these liquidity tailwinds: Quantitative tightening ends in December – reducing market pressure Potential interest rate cuts – making borrowing cheaper Federal Reserve balance sheet expansion – injecting more liquidity Together, these factors create a powerful combination of liquidity tailwinds that could drive significant market gains. The transition from headwinds to tailwinds happens quickly, catching many investors by surprise. How Can Investors Ride These Liquidity Tailwinds? Understanding liquidity tailwinds gives you a strategic advantage. Here’s how to position your portfolio: Monitor Treasury General Account levels for early signals Watch for Federal Reserve policy announcements Diversify across multiple risk asset categories Maintain some cash for quick deployment opportunities The current situation represents a rare opportunity where multiple liquidity factors align simultaneously. These liquidity tailwinds could drive the next major market rally. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? The emergence of strong liquidity tailwinds signals a potential turning point for risk assets.

The Binance founder’s recent statements challenge everything we thought we knew about presidential pardons in the cryptocurrency space. This explosive development comes at a critical time for the entire digital asset industry. What Really Happened Between Changpeng Zhao and Eric Trump? Changpeng Zhao recently sat down with Fox News to clarify the details of his encounter with Eric Trump. The meeting occurred at a high-profile Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi, but according to Zhao, the conversation never touched on presidential pardons or World Liberty Financial. This direct denial addresses mounting speculation about backdoor deals in the crypto industry. The Binance founder emphasized that claims linking their meeting to WLFI and his subsequent pardon are completely baseless. He stated clearly that no negotiations occurred and no business relationship exists with WLFI. This straightforward account contradicts circulating rumors that suggested otherwise. Why Does This Changpeng Zhao Denial Matter? The timing of Zhao’s statement is crucial. It comes just weeks after President Donald Trump granted Changpeng Zhao a presidential pardon, sparking intense lobbying allegations. The crypto community has been buzzing with theories about what really transpired behind the scenes. Key points from Zhao’s denial include: No pardon discussions occurred during the meeting No business relationship exists with World Liberty Financial The encounter was brief and casual Claims of deal-making are completely unfounded How Has the White House Responded? President Trump himself added another layer to this developing story when he stated he doesn’t know who Changpeng Zhao is and has never met him. This creates an intriguing contrast with the pardon decision. The administration framed the pardon as a strategic move to maintain American competitiveness in the cryptocurrency sector. The White House issued an official statement confirming that the pardon underwent thorough review procedures. This suggests that despite the unusual circumstances, proper channels were followed in the decision-making process concerning Changpeng Zhao. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation? This situation highlights the complex relationship between cryptocurrency leaders and government authorities. The case of Changpeng Zhao demonstrates how quickly misinformation can spread in the fast-moving crypto space. It also shows the importance of transparency when high-profile figures in digital assets interact with political families. The crypto industry faces increased scrutiny regarding: Political connections and influence Regulatory clarity Public perception of industry leaders Government oversight of digital assets Final Verdict: Separating Fact from Fiction The Changpeng Zhao case serves as a powerful reminder that in cryptocurrency, appearances can be deceiving. While the meeting with Eric Trump raised eyebrows, the lack of evidence supporting pardon discussions suggests we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. The industry continues to navigate uncharted waters where business, politics, and innovation intersect. As the dust settles, one thing remains clear: transparency and factual reporting are more important than ever in the crypto space. The Changpeng Zhao situation demonstrates why we must verify claims before accepting them as truth in this rapidly evolving industry. Frequently Asked Questions What did Changpeng Zhao say about meeting Eric Trump? Changpeng Zhao confirmed meeting Eric Trump at a Bitcoin conference but denied discussing any pardon or business deals. Why was Changpeng Zhao pardoned? President Trump stated the pardon was to keep the US crypto industry competitive, though he claimed not to know Zhao personally. What is World Liberty Financial? WLFI is a company that Zhao specifically mentioned having no business relationship with in his denial. Where did the meeting occur? The encounter took place at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi according to Zhao’s statements. Has the White House commented on this situation? Yes, the White House confirmed the pardon underwent thorough review and provided an official statement. What does this mean for crypto regulation? This case highlights the ongoing challenges in crypto regulation and political relationships within the industry.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase Premium Gap Has Been Red Recently As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, investors on Coinbase keep selling Bitcoin. The indicator of relevance here is the “Coinbase Premium Gap,” which measures the difference between the BTC price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). Related Reading: Bitcoin At Increased Risk Of Falling To $88,500 Support, Glassnode Warns When the value of this metric is positive, it means the asset is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than Binance. Such a trend suggests the users of the former are applying a higher buying pressure (or lower selling pressure) than those of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies Binance users are the ones participating in a higher amount of accumulation as they have pushed the asset to a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows how the Coinbase Premium Gap has fluctuated over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has stayed mostly in the negative zone during the past week, implying users on Coinbase have been participating in selling. The metric briefly turned neutral-green as the cryptocurrency witnessed a surge back above $104,000, but since then, the indicator’s value has again plummeted, and with it, the BTC price has erased its recovery. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin has often reacted to movements in the Coinbase Premium Gap in a similar manner, showcasing how Coinbase users have been a driving force in the market. The exchange is mainly used by American investors, especially large institutional entities like the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so the Coinbase Premium Gap essentially reflects how the US-based whales differ in behavior from Binance’s global traffic. Since the indicator has been red recently, it would appear that the American institutions have been distributing the cryptocurrency. Considering the pattern over the last couple of years, it’s possible that BTC’s recovery might depend on whether a bullish sentiment can return among this cohort. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Line That Has Triggered Strong Rebounds Since Nov 2024 In some other news, a movement of old tokens has just been spotted on the Bitcoin blockchain, as Maartunn has highlighted in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that a stack of over 13,000 BTC that has been dormant for between 3 and 5 years has become involved in a transaction, a potential sign that a HODLer may be gearing up for selling. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $100,200, down almost 9% over the last week.

54152256,623813,1762570818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54152256.jpeg,Bitcoin Boom Reward: Spain’s Science Institute To Liquidate Decade-Old BTC Holdings,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-reward-spains-science-institute-to-liquidate-decade-old-btc-holdings/,"A public research center in Tenerife is preparing to sell a stash of Bitcoin it bought more than a decade ago — a holding that has grown from a modest experiment into a multi-million dollar pot. Reports say the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER), tied to the Tenerife Island Council, purchased 97 BTC in 2012 for about €10,000. The coins are now worth over $10 million at current prices. Preparing To Liquidate A Long-Held Holding ITER did not buy the Bitcoin as a bet on prices. According to local reporting, the purchase was part of a project to study blockchain and related systems. Now, after years of rising values, council officials are in talks with a regulated Spanish financial institution to move the assets into cash in line with Bank of Spain and CNMV rules. The sale process faces hurdles. Banks and brokers often demand detailed compliance paperwork for big crypto transactions. That means the operation will be carried out through official channels rather than on a retail exchange. Some sources note ITER has been trying for years to sort legal and administrative steps around the holdings. Funds Pledged To Research Projects Based on reports, the money raised from the sale will be used to fund new research at the institute. ITER plans to put the proceeds toward projects including quantum technology and other scientific work that it says will benefit the island and regional development. Officials have framed the plan as a way to turn an old experiment into a public resource for research. How Big Is The Gain? The numbers are stark. Buying 97 Bitcoin for roughly €10,000 in 2012 and selling them now at market levels would mean a return measured in the thousands of percent. Exact figures will depend on the final sale price and exchange rates used on the day the coins move. Tax and legal costs could also affect the net amount the institute receives. What Officials Have Said Council members and ITER representatives have given short statements to local press about the plan, noting that the original purpose was research rather than investment. Reports indicate officials are coordinating with legal and financial advisers to make sure the disposal meets Spanish rules around public funds and asset sales. The aim is to avoid any misstep that might delay the cashing-out.

This incredible strategy has generated a staggering $5.65 million in unrealized profits, showcasing the power of strategic position building in volatile markets. What Exactly Are Pyramiding ZEC Longs? Pyramiding ZEC longs involves continuously using unrealized profits to open additional long positions. Think of it as building upward – each successful trade becomes the foundation for the next. This approach requires careful risk management and market timing, but when executed correctly, it can amplify gains significantly. The trader in question started their pyramiding ZEC longs position five days ago at an average entry price of $410. Through strategic reinvestment of profits, they’ve built their position to an impressive 55,000 ZEC tokens. The current average entry price now stands at $513.5, demonstrating how pyramiding can lower risk while increasing exposure. How Does Pyramiding Create Such Massive Returns? The magic of pyramiding ZEC longs lies in its compounding effect. Instead of taking profits, the trader reinvests them into larger positions. This approach works exceptionally well during sustained bull runs like ZEC’s current rally. Compounding gains – Profits generate more profits Increased exposure – Position size grows with success Risk management – Only profits are at risk in new positions Market momentum – Works best during strong uptrends What Are the Risks of Pyramiding Strategies? While pyramiding ZEC longs can create extraordinary returns, it’s crucial to understand the risks. The current liquidation price sits at $500.8, meaning a significant price drop could wipe out all gains. This highlights why proper risk management is essential when employing pyramiding techniques. ZEC’s impressive performance provides context for this success story. The cryptocurrency has surged over 270% in the past month alone, currently trading at $619.27 with an 11% daily gain. Such strong momentum creates ideal conditions for successful pyramiding ZEC longs strategies. Key Takeaways for Aspiring Traders This case study demonstrates several important lessons about pyramiding ZEC longs. First, timing matters – entering during a strong uptrend increases success probability. Second, position sizing requires careful calculation to avoid overexposure. Finally, having a clear exit strategy prevents emotional decision-making during market volatility. The $5.65 million unrealized profit from pyramiding ZEC longs serves as both inspiration and caution. While the potential rewards are substantial, the risks demand respect and careful planning. Frequently Asked Questions What is pyramiding in cryptocurrency trading? Pyramiding involves using unrealized profits from existing positions to open additional positions in the same direction, effectively compounding exposure during favorable market moves. How risky is pyramiding ZEC longs? Pyramiding carries significant risk since it increases exposure and lowers the average entry price closer to current market prices. A sharp reversal can quickly erase profits. What makes ZEC suitable for pyramiding strategies? ZEC’s recent strong momentum and sustained rally create ideal conditions for pyramiding, though any volatile cryptocurrency with clear trends can work. How do I start pyramiding positions? Begin with a solid entry strategy, determine position size increments, set strict risk management rules, and always have a clear exit plan before entering trades. What’s the difference between pyramiding and averaging down? Pyramiding adds to winning positions using profits, while averaging down adds to losing positions to reduce average cost – completely different risk profiles. Can beginners try pyramiding strategies? While possible, beginners should master basic risk management first and start with small positions to understand the dynamics before attempting pyramiding.

What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin ETFs Outflow Reversal? The recent data reveals a concerning pattern for Bitcoin ETFs enthusiasts. After breaking a six-day outflow streak with temporary inflows, the market has taken an unexpected turn. Major financial institutions saw significant withdrawals that contributed to this substantial net outflow figure. Let’s examine the breakdown from major players: BlackRock’s IBIT: $127.17 million outflow Fidelity’s FBTC: $256.66 million outflow Ark Invest’s ARKB: $144.24 million outflow Bitwise’s BITB: $10.68 million outflow Grayscale’s GBTC: $15.44 million outflow Why Are Investors Pulling Money from Bitcoin ETFs?

When we see such significant movements in Bitcoin ETFs, it typically indicates changing risk appetite among major market participants. How Does This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Market?

Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin’s price, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly holding digital assets. Why do Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? Outflows occur when investors sell more shares than they buy, often due to market volatility, profit-taking, or changing risk appetite. How do outflows affect Bitcoin prices? Significant outflows can create selling pressure, potentially leading to price declines as fund managers may need to sell Bitcoin to meet redemption requests.

Fidelity’s FBTC saw the largest outflow at $256.66 million, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB at $144.24 million. Can Bitcoin ETFs recover from such outflows?

Market veterans often view such outflows as potential buying opportunities when they believe the underlying asset remains strong. The key is to analyze whether the outflow reflects temporary market sentiment or fundamental concerns about Ethereum’s value proposition. What’s Next for US Spot ETH ETFs? The future trajectory of US spot ETH ETFs will depend on several factors. Market participants will be closely watching for: Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency Ethereum network upgrades and performance Broader macroeconomic conditions Institutional adoption trends While the current outflow from US spot ETH ETFs might seem concerning, it’s important to maintain perspective. The cryptocurrency market has always been volatile, and smart investors know that short-term movements don’t always predict long-term outcomes. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the recent US spot ETH ETFs outflow? The $48.1 million outflow was primarily driven by large withdrawals from Fidelity’s FETH ($72.23 million) and Grayscale’s ETH fund ($11.42 million), despite BlackRock’s ETHA attracting $32.96 million in inflows. How often do US spot ETH ETFs experience outflows? Outflows are common in volatile markets. This particular outflow occurred after breaking a seven-day losing streak, showing how quickly sentiment can change in cryptocurrency markets. Should I be worried about investing in US spot ETH ETFs? While outflows can indicate short-term concerns, they don’t necessarily reflect long-term value. Many investors view such periods as potential entry points, but always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance. How do US spot ETH ETFs differ from other crypto investments? US spot ETH ETFs provide regulated exposure to Ethereum without the technical complexities of direct ownership. They’re particularly attractive to institutional investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles. Can US spot ETH ETFs outflows predict Ethereum price movements? While there’s often correlation, outflows don’t always directly cause price declines. Many factors influence Ethereum’s price, including network activity, developer interest, and broader market conditions. What’s the long-term outlook for US spot ETH ETFs? Most analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of US spot ETH ETFs as cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow among both retail and institutional investors.

This decision came after a dragged-out overnight brawl between First Brands’ lawyers and a room full of pissed-off creditors. The loan keeps the company running for now, but it came with a ton of strings attached and even more people watching their backs. The whole fight started because more than 80 hedge funds and money managers offered to throw cash at First Brands, but only if they got paid first, on not just the new debt, but on $3.3 billion they were already owed. A bunch of creditors weren’t having it. They called the terms greedy and one-sided. Still, without that cash, the company was toast. So, like it or not, Judge Christopher Lopez said the deal was going through. Creditors protest, judge shrugs, deal moves forward The hearing on Thursday was packed, with close to 100 lawyers and advisers squeezed into that Houston courtroom, fighting over who gets what. People were hopping between side rooms and hallways, trying to get something on paper. Leading the charge for First Brands was Weil Gotshal & Manges, the law firm tasked with keeping the company from collapsing. And collapse was a real threat. Without the loan, they said, the company would be forced into a messy fire sale that wouldn’t cover much of anything. Creditors backing the deal said this was the only real option. But the committee of unsecured creditors wasn’t buying it. Their advisers warned the loan could carry an interest rate as high as 74%, which they described as totally outrageous. But again, Christopher said, “There are no better terms out there.” He admitted he didn’t love that the lenders would get top priority for both the new and old debt, but said this was an ugly case all around. “This is anything but a common case,” he added. Buried in the loan terms is another protection; if the money runs short, First Brands agreed to guarantee $200 million for admin expenses. That includes employee wages, building leases, and advisers’ pay. No one in the room wanted to be the one left hanging if this whole thing spiraled further down. Founder gets hit with lawsuit while court eyes more hearings While all that was happening in court, First Brands’ new management hit its founder, Patrick James, with a fresh lawsuit. They claim Patrick stripped the company of billions, draining it dry before everything blew up. He denies it, obviously. But the lawsuit is now one of the biggest bets left on the table. If they win, it could bring real money back into the estate. And yes, there’s already a formula in place for who gets what if they manage to claw back anything from Patrick or anyone tied to him. Now the court has more coming.On Monday, lawyers will meet again to decide whether Patrick can be stopped from selling off his assets while the case against him plays out. Then later this month, the judge will hear arguments on whether to bring in an independent examiner to dig into all the shady stuff that went down at First Brands before it filed for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, with lawyers and consultants billing like crazy, Christopher called it “an expensive room” and told both sides to work faster before the fees eat what’s left. Estimates say professional fees alone could hit hundreds of millions of dollars before this thing wraps, according to the Financial Times.

Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, & Sumitomo Mitsui To Jointly Issue Stablecoins As announced in a press release by MUFG bank, its banking group, along with two other major financial institutions, has just received approval from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on a stablecoins proof-of-concept. According to the press release, the banks’ project will involve joint stablecoin issuance and advanced cross-border payments, with both set to receive support from the FSA. Digital asset platform Progmat, founded by Mitsubishi UFJ, will provide the infrastructure and technological support for the proof-of-concept. “The three banks considering joint issuance will define requirements and establish evaluation criteria to build a concrete structure,” said MUFG. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that has its price pegged to a fiat currency. Currently, the most popular assets of this type are tied to the US dollar (USD). The three big banks are expected to issue a stablecoin backed by the Japanese yen (JPY). Last month, Japanese startup JPYC launched the nation’s first yen-based stablecoin, as reported by Bitcoinist . The token, called “JPYC,” is backed by domestic deposits and Japanese government bonds. For now, the company is offering 0% fees on issuance and redemption of JPYC to promote adoption. MUFG’s press release noted that blockchain-based payments and use of tokenized deposits and stablecoins are being explored both domestically and overseas. So this proof-of-concept from the banks will serve as a testing ground to accumulate practical knowledge related to joint stablecoin issuance. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong approved its legislature on these fiat-tied tokens earlier this year, and big names like Standard Chartered in its joint venture are on the waiting list for an issuer license. The first batch of approvals was earlier expected to drop next year, but a recent Financial Times report has revealed that mainland regulators have urged applicants to pause their plans, due to concerns about the growth of currencies controlled by the private sector. Over in Europe, a consortium of big banks has come together to launch a euro stablecoin in the second half of 2026. Initially, the consortium included nine European banks, but later a tenth financial institution in the American Citigroup joined the effort. The euro-pegged token, which aims to be fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), seeks to provide a real alternative to the USD-heavy stablecoin market. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has been facing bearish pressure recently, which has taken its price to the $100,000 level, down over 8% on the weekly timeframe. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin saw a recovery surge above $104,000. This rally interestingly occurred alongside notable stablecoin exchange inflows, as pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post . It’s possible that investors made these deposits to convert their stables for BTC and other volatile assets, but considering the latest price trend, the buying pressure didn’t last.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Japan|Japan Megabanks|Japan Stablecoin|stablecoin|Yen Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-08 04:00:08

At the moment, XRP trades at $2.16, down 12% in the last seven days as the wider crypto market struggles. Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Over 21,000 New Wallets Appear In 48 Hours Investor Reactions Vs. Reality Based on reports, the drop has stirred panic even though XRP is up over 300% since November last year. That sharp gain is easy to miss when prices fall. History shows how emotionally charged this market can be: XRP hit a $3.31 high in January 2018, then sank below $1 and spent six years between $0.3 and $0.7, with a brief rise to $1.95 in April 2021. The coin later rallied above that zone during November 2024, touching $3.40 before facing resistance. By 2070, you guys will be shitting your pants when XRP drops from $1,200 to $1,000 — BD (@DiepSanh) November 6, 2025 Market Numbers & Sentiment Today’s numbers put the recent mood in context. Reports show XRP reached a market cap peak of $215 billion in July but has since given up more than $82 billion, leaving a market cap near $131 billion at press time. Technical indicators and short-term forecasts point to continued pressure: one prediction expects XRP to fall 0.73% to reach $2.19 by December 7, 2025. The altcoin’s Fear & Greed Index reads 24, labeled “Extreme Fear”, and XRP recorded 15/30 green days with 6% price volatility over the last 30 days. Traders see the data and react quickly. Some call this a chance to buy; others see it as a warning sign. Will Future Holders Poop Their Pants? Diep Sanh’s quip — that people will be pooping their pants when a $1,200-to-$1,000 move happens in about 45 years — is meant to point out a behavioral pattern, not to set a real price target for 2070. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Potential 50% Crash—But Analysts Say The Fear Is Overblown Still, the numbers he used are eye-catching: a $1,000 valuation from today’s $2.23 would represent a 44,740% gain. That kind of math flips the usual perspective. What looks like a crash from the peak would actually be an extraordinary profit relative to present levels. Certain analysts contend that the latest pullback could prolong and offer yet another opportunity to accrue XRP below $2 for those who missed the previous rally. Conversely, some warn that those who bought after the surge in November 2024 may currently be sitting on losses. Based on reports, the outlook remains speculative and tied tightly to trader sentiment rather than any single fundamental shift. Markets move, people react, and the debate over whether this drop is a buying moment or the start of a deeper slide is still up in the air.

The figures referenced include $95 billion in payment volume through Ripple Payments and a market capitalization of about $1 billion for RLUSD . The summary further noted that Ripple has completed six acquisitions within slightly more than two years and has repurchased 25% of its outstanding shares. The commentary also stated that Ripple Prime , the company’s institutional-focused financial services division, has recorded three times the growth in its activity. Additionally, Ripple is said to hold 75 regulatory licenses across multiple jurisdictions, signaling continued emphasis on compliance and regulated market participation. These data points were presented to demonstrate commercial expansion, regulatory positioning, and institutional integration. Role of XRP and RLUSD in the Stated Framework Pumpius described a functional framework in which Ripple provides the payments and settlement infrastructure, XRP serves as a bridging mechanism to enable cross-border value movement, and RLUSD acts as the system’s stabilizing component. The commentary characterized these elements as coordinated within a developing financial network that connects traditional financial channels with digital settlement rails.

The involvement of well-established financial firms was presented as evidence of broader institutional willingness to participate in this shift. The commentary also suggested that the integrations, acquisitions, and compliance measures are being executed to support this transition and align with traditional financial system standards.

Institutional ETF outflows have increased recently, but not at panic levels; overall, institutional and company holdings remain relatively stable. Network fundamentals remain healthy, with Ethereum capturing the majority of new stablecoin flows and maintaining robust transactional activity, despite a recent decline in new users. I see ETH as a long-term accumulation opportunity at a 30% discount from ATH, though short-term downside risk remains amid macro and network headwinds. Price Action & Momentum Ethereum (ETH-USD) went on a bull run from its low on April 9, 2025 ($1,390), to an all-time high on August 24, 2025 ($4,950). Two and a half months later (today), the price of Ethereum has fallen back from that high, down 32%, to reach an intermediate zone marked at $3,400. In this article, I will review what institutional players are doing (ETF flows and balance sheet reserves) and how the Ethereum chain is responding and has responded (stablecoin uptake per chain, activity, and new vs. recurring users). Using these metrics, I will assess whether the long-term bullish thesis remains intact while also discussing the short-term risks. Trading View Institutional Activity Soso Value ETH Strategic Reserve The first thing we're going to do here is look at what institutional investors are doing with Ethereum ETFs, as well as companies that have allocated part of their treasury to ETH to earn staking yield. In the two images above, we can see the overall net inflows and outflows in the different ETH ETFs and by companies holding Ether on balance sheets and by the ETFs. At first glance, it seems that both exchange-traded funds and companies have not materially reduced their holdings. We can see in the second image a slight slowdown in the accumulation of Ethereum (the blue lines (ETFs) and green lines (companies)) show a slight decrease in their slope at a visual level, going from 12,959,000 ETH in August to a current level of 12,745,000 ETH (a decrease of more than 200,000 ETH). We can confirm this by looking at the first chart (ETF flows), This represents the capital inflows and outflows from the pool of existing ETFs for Ethereum. Currently, and since ATH, we have seen episodes of net capital outflows, generally lasting no more than three days. These episodes of outflows (August, September, and October of this year) have averaged $250 million in daily sales. This pattern broke on October 28, when we started to see a new episode of net capital outflows, but this time more sustained, as it continues to this day (6 days). We will see if it is a simple adjustment of positions, since the outgoing amounts are not typical of mass liquidations, or on the contrary, if ETFs are positioning themselves ahead of another leg lower. Network Perspectives Next we will go on to assess metrics that describe the state of the Ethereum network. Whether there are obvious features of capital turnover or shortage of fresh liquidity. Artemis In this graph we can see the volume of stablecoins flowing between the different blockchains of the entire cryptographic ecosystem. As is clear, there is an upward trend in the last year for the whole sector. This is because stablecoins (issued against cash or short-term US Treasury securities) are on the rise. This issuance indirectly finances the U.S. Treasury, as stablecoin issuers buy short-term Treasuries to back new tokens. Once we understand this, we return to the image above to see which network the new stablecoins are going to. As shown in the image, it is the Ethereum network that dominates the market in this regard, with a clear trend of increasing dominance over the last year (the blue bars represent a higher percentage in recent times: currently, its dominance share stands at 56%). This means that of the new percentage of stablecoins issued, the Ethereum network currently captures 56% of the new amount, which provides long-term stability, constant activity, and a network effect. All of this tells us that in the stablecoins aspect, the Ethereum network is in good health right now. Artemis The next step is to see the transactions made by users within the Ethereum network to confirm whether the comments in the stablecoins section are confirmed with this data. In this case, we show the historical evolution of the number of transactions broken down by activity in the network. As we can observe, the local minima of the series coincide with episodes of local minima of price (April 2025), and the local maxima with local maxima of price (August 2025). This is because the activity index is closely related to the price of this type of asset (the 90-day correlation coefficient is 0.68, which explains this relationship), since the greater the activity on the network, the greater the turnover of assets there will be, the greater the gas consumed in this case, which can make ETH net supply disinflationary/deflationary under its issuance-and-burn mechanism (EIP-1559), for how it is built. Broadly speaking, we see that transactional activity has declined over the last two months (the weekly average of transactions in the first two weeks of August was 740,000 transactions per week, which, compared to the current average of 560,000 transactions per week, gives us a 25% decline in transactional activity), with a sustained decline in transactions in the “Uniswap” category (red bars: 30,000 transactions on average during August compared to 8,000 currently, a decline of more than 60%). This has been able to influence the price of the asset in a negative way, since the decentralized exchange platform Uniswap is one of the main entry channels to the asset analyzed. On the transactional front, the network is also in good health. Artemis Third, and to conclude the current perspectives of the network, we analyze the evolution of new users who transact within the network compared to recurrent active users, all at a daily frequency. In the last year, recurrent transactionality dominates, leaving new users in second place as punctual actors. In this case, it is useful to study the directionality of the trend and the points where new users increase, since they coincide with moments of high prices (August). Currently, new users have been gradually falling since August, suggesting little new demand, which, added to the partial sales of ETFs in recent weeks and the decrease in burning due to lower transactionality, has put downward pressure on the asset price. The decline has occurred from a total average user level of 4.2 million wallets in the first two weeks of August to a current average level of 3 million wallets transacting with each other within the network. User growth has also slowed, from 1.1 million new users in August to 800,000 new users today, representing a decline of more than 20% in the current growth of new users (wallets) transacting with the network. My Personal View ETH has fallen 32% from its ATH, which can be explained by lower network usage (less gas means less burning and higher asset issuance) and several days of ETF outflows, which do not necessarily represent forced sales or massive liquidation levels. Ethereum continues to attract liquidity in stablecoins, and recurring users are sustaining on-chain activity. In addition, the 90-day price-activity correlation (0.68) suggests that if usage rebounds, the price should follow suit. That is why I maintain a long-term Buy rating, entering slowly and only accelerating if we see inflows into ETFs for several days in a row, burning above issuance, and a rebound in new users trading; if ETF outflows persist or adoption falls, it is better to wait. Looking at the broader macroeconomic factors that influence all risk assets, especially those with higher market beta (Ethereum), I believe we are still in a bullish cycle, as employment continues to grow (42,000 jobs have been created in the US according to ADP), inflation is stable for the moment (3.0% according to the latest official data), and it appears that the Fed's balance sheet policies will soon be relaxed due to the end of QT and the current pressure of the SOFR rate against the IORB (SOFR > IORB at the time of writing). That is why I think this downward movement may be temporary rather than structural. Thank you for reading. EXTRA Readers have two options for acquiring the asset. The first is to go to a centralized exchange, register, and buy the amount of Ethereum they want. The problem with this is that it directly or indirectly incurs the risk of self-custody. If the exchange suffers a hacker attack or the user loses their keys (if it is self-custody in a cold wallet), it will be difficult to recover those assets owned by the user. The second option is to use vehicles such as ETHE or ETHA, which are index funds that replicate the performance of the asset without the user needing to physically own it, freeing them from the risk of self-custody, as the exchange-traded funds themselves subcontract physical custodians to do so.",ETHA|ETHE|ETH-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-08 04:12:00

With Ethereum rallying on renewed whale demand and Polkadot holding key support levels amid ecosystem growth, the established layer-1 plays are proving their staying power. At the same time, MoonBull is stepping up as a presale project that combines innovative mechanics with early-stage entry. Each of these cryptos offers a distinct value proposition: Ethereum for infrastructure dominance, Polkadot for interoperability and multi-chain ambition, and MoonBull for high-reward presale dynamics. As crypto markets gear up for the next leg, investors are looking beyond simple speculation. Ethereum’s latest on-chain signals show institutional accumulation and bullish sentiment, while Polkadot’s development activity remains robust despite price consolidation. Against this backdrop, MoonBull’s tokenomics, liquidity mechanics, and presale stage create an interesting counter-balance, offering access to upside potential before broader market recognition catches up. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Bull’s Engine – Liquidity, Scarcity & Rewards MoonBull’s tokenomics are built around what it calls its “Bull’s Engine.” Every time $MOBU is sold, 2% of the transaction goes into liquidity (helping reduce slippage and stabilize market moves), 2% is distributed among all holders as passive income (reflections), and 1% is permanently burned (enhancing supply scarcity). These mechanisms operate in tandem to strengthen the ecosystem: deepening liquidity, rewarding holders, and reducing token supply, so that each remaining token carries more inherent value over time. After launch, these dynamics will continue reinforcing each other. Liquidity injections support smoother trading, reflections give passive yields to holders, and the steady burn reduces supply. Together, they align MoonBull’s economy with long-term growth rather than short-term hype. Why Is MoonBull the Top crypto to buy? MoonBull’s presale is currently in Stage 6, with the token priced at $0.00008388. To date, it has raised over $550K, and has counted more than 1,800 holders. The projected ROI from the current stage to a listed price of $0.00616 is about 7,244%, while earlier participants (1- 5 stage) are already showing an ROI of approximately 235.52%. The next stage is expected to introduce a price increase of roughly 27.40%, making this a meaningful entry window before public trading opens. What sets this presale apart is not just timing, but the structure behind it. By giving transparent mechanics, a defined reward system, and liquidity-friendly tokenomics, MoonBull offers an early-stage entry that appeals not only to speculators but also to investors seeking measurable upside, making it a top crypto to buy . Ethereum (ETH): Whale Demand and Renewed Bullish Momentum Ethereum is showing signs of renewed strength. According to a recent analysis, traders have pivoted to “extreme bullish” after whale investors began accumulating Ethereum again, especially during recent deleveraging episodes. On-chain data suggests large withdrawals, such as a roughly $70 million ETH withdrawal by a major entity, indicate institutional interest entering the market. With this backdrop, Ethereum remains one of the most credible crypto investments. Its infrastructure, developer ecosystem, staking mechanics, and institutional positioning offer both stability and upside potential—although the explosive gains of early presales may be less likely. Polkadot (DOT): Ecosystem Growth Amid Key Support Test Polkadot is trading around $2.60 and is currently hovering near a key support zone: roughly $2.50–$2.60 according to technical analysis. While price momentum is modest, the underlying network activity remains strong. Polkadot continues to attract developers, and cross-chain transfers remain active, reinforcing its long-term thesis. For investors eyeing the opportunity to invest in crypto, Polkadot offers a balance of infrastructure exposure and speculative upside. Price may be consolidating now—but the fundamentals of multi-chain interoperability and ecosystem expansion are very much intact. Conclusion Ethereum, Polkadot, and MoonBull represent three very different pathways to crypto growth in 2025. Ethereum provides institutional-grade infrastructure and ecosystem dominance; Polkadot offers multi-chain potential and developer depth; MoonBull brings early-stage upside with a structured presale and innovative tokenomics. If the goal is to identify the top crypto to buy in 2025, a diversified approach could make sense. Ethereum is the foundation, Polkadot is the growth engine, and MoonBull is the wildcard, but one with quantifiable mechanics. For those willing to ride the next 100x wave, MoonBull could be your bullish move.

The report argues that Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” is solidifying, particularly as liquidity tightens across traditional markets. As Bitcoin trades around $100,980, investors are eyeing the best crypto to buy now, those positioned to outperform as capital begins to rotate back into altcoins. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Institutional Flows Are Back After months of sideways movement, Bitcoin is back in focus. The world’s largest cryptocurrency recently faced severe declines and is currently trading at $100,980, as ETF volumes spiked 28% week-on-week. Citing growing use in corporate treasuries and digital asset funds, JP Morgan analysts predict that increased institutional involvement could push Bitcoin toward $150,000-$170,000 by mid-2026. According to the survey, investors looking for greater profits are diversifying into Layer 1 ecosystems, DeFi tokens, and cross-chain ventures with genuine utility, even though Bitcoin’s foundations are still solid. This renewed market optimism has triggered fresh inflows into tokens like Hyperliquid and Remittix (RTX) , two fast-growing projects now appearing on analysts’ watchlists. Hyperliquid: Fast, Scalable, and Built for Traders Hyperliquid (HYPE) has emerged as one of the more promising trading-focused networks of 2025. Built for speed and decentralisation, it provides high-performance infrastructure for derivatives, spot trading, and liquidity management. The token is trading around $40.68, and analysts expect it to test $65–$70 in Q1 2026 if volume growth continues. According to on-chain data, Hyperliquid’s TVL has surpassed $1.2 billion and its transaction count has doubled over the past two months. As a result, it is among the leading altcoins in the expanding decentralized exchange market, competing with well-known firms like dYdX and Injective. In a market dominated by speculative, meme-based tokens, HYPE stands out as a high-growth cryptocurrency with robust liquidity and actual trade usage. Remittix: The PayFi Token Turning Heads While Hyperliquid focuses on trading efficiency, Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention for real-world payments. Built as a cross-chain DeFi project, Remittix enables users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries with low gas fees and instant fiat conversion. The Remittix wallet beta is live, supporting over 100 cryptocurrencies. The project has already raised over $28 million, attracted 40,000+ holders, and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank. Analysts refer to it as a “next-gen PayFi token,” offering both DeFi functionality and everyday usability, a rare combination in today’s market. With its strong fundamentals and working ecosystem, Remittix (RTX) is being positioned as one of the best crypto investments for 2025, particularly as demand for real-world payment solutions continues to grow. Bitcoin Leads, But Altcoins Could Outperform JP Morgan’s bullish Bitcoin price target has given the market renewed confidence, but the most significant upside could lie in altcoins with real traction. Hyperliquid and Remittix represent two sides of that opportunity, trading infrastructure and payments innovation, both critical areas for the next phase of blockchain adoption. As capital rotation begins, investors seeking the best crypto to buy now should keep an eye on these projects that blend proven growth with practical use, where 2025’s biggest winners are likely to emerge.

This money has been stuck in Europe since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and has also since then been lined up as a blunt financial weapon, but not technically being seized. The European Commission’s plan is to let EU states use up to 185 billion euros, without stepping into full confiscation mode. That’s most of the 210 billion euros held across Europe. The U.S. source, who asked not to be named, said plainly, “Washington absolutely supports the EU and the steps they’re taking right now to be in a position to make use of those assets as a tool.” That support comes even as legal and political risks keep slowing the EU’s next steps. The assets are mostly parked in Belgium, and Belgian officials have been holding up the proposal. Germany links Belgian drone sightings to Moscow threat On the same day that Trump announced his support for the EU’s plans, Germany pointed a sharp finger at Russia over a string of drone sightings that were reportedly spotted over airports and military sites in Belgium, could be a warning shot from the Kremlin. The message? Don’t mess with those frozen assets. Moscow, of course, denied it had anything to do with the drones but still promised a “painful response” if the assets are touched. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, the West has locked down roughly $300 billion in sovereign Russian wealth, mostly held by central banks and state institutions. The latest EU proposal would be one of the biggest moves yet to actually use that frozen pile. But this is no smash-and-grab. The funds would be tapped carefully, avoiding full seizure that could trigger lawsuits or retaliation. Just last month, Cryptopolitan reported that the Trump administration slapped penalties on Rosneft and Lukoil, the two largest oil giants in Russia. That added to a huge pile of sanctions already aimed at choking Moscow’s economy. The White House is still watching to see how this plays out. But the U.S. official added, “There are more things we could do to try to up the pressure.” Trump hints at Hungary energy sanctions relief during Orban visit Meanwhile, as Trump met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House on Friday, the two leaders talked energy, trade, and, of course, the Russia–Ukraine war. During that meeting, Orban asked for a pass on U.S. sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas. Trump’s answer? He’s open to it. “We’re looking at it, because it’s very difficult for him to get the oil and gas from other areas. They don’t have the advantage of having a sea,” Trump told reporters. This was Orban’s first White House visit since Trump returned to office. He’s under pressure back home, and across Europe, for his cozy relationship with Putin. But Trump didn’t hold back on backing him, blasting Europe’s “hypocrisy” for still buying Russian energy while talking tough. He even gave Orban another endorsement for his re-election, saying the Hungarian leader had done a “fantastic job”. Orban, never one to hide his feelings, took shots at Joe Biden, praised Trump, and called this a new “golden era” in US–Hungary ties. “During the Democrat administration, everything was ruined,” he said. “After your leaving president, everything was basically broke, ruined, canceled.” He also hinted that Hungary may boost its purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas and nuclear fuel, which could help sweeten any exemption deal on Russia-related sanctions. Orban already visited Mar-a-Lago twice last year, showing just how tight he’s become with Trump’s circle. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Its decline came alongside the rest of the crypto market, with BTC dipping below $100,000 and ETH erasing all YTD gains. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT and Perplexity about their take on what’s to follow in the week ahead for PI, whether this volatility will continue, and whether it can hold the $0.20 support line. ChatGPT’s Predictions OpenAI’s chatbot solution outlined a few different scenarios for the week ahead. In the first, which it called “range first, then a squeeze,” it envisioned a mildly stable price movement around the current $0.21 level, with an upper boundary of $0.25. “Thesis: After a full retrace, PI typically chops in a value range before attempting a rebound. If buyers defend $0.20–$0.21, a reflex pop toward $0.24–$0.26 is likely.” Its second case is based on big news and updates coming from the Pi Network Core Team, such as the recent launch of Pi Node’s version 0.5.4. If there are such developments that could propel investors back to the PI scene, then the asset can bounce to $0.30 and beyond. However, if the team remains quiet and the overall market conditions do not improve, then the PI token might drop below $0.20 and test the ATLs of around $0.17. “Most probable weekly path: Stabilization above $0.20 and range trade $0.22–$0.26, with a 30–35% chance of a breakout attempt toward $0.30–$0.32 if sentiment improves. Highest realistic print this week (absent big news): ~$0.32. Downside risk guardrail: A firm break below $0.20 opens $0.18 (stop-hunt) before mean-reversion,” ChatGPT concluded. Perplexity’s Views ChatGPT’s rival provided a lot more volatile price predictions for the week(s) ahead. Its bear case envisions PI remaining sideways on November 8 but dropping hard in the following days to new all-time low levels. “-9.99% on Nov 9, -17.36% on Nov 10, falling to about 23% lower by Nov 12, 2025.” It concluded its bearish scenario with a prediction of a sustained price drop to under $0.15 by early December. However, it also outlined some highly bullish forecasts in case the Core Team indeed drops some big announcements and partnerships, and the overall market conditions improve dramatically over the next few weeks. In them, Perplexity set a massive target of $0.60 as early as this month, which would represent a 200% surge from current levels. Nevertheless, it admitted that both of these cases are quite extreme and are less likely to take place. Perplexity’s most probable scenario sees PI entering a longer consolidation period at around $0.20, influenced by “market volatility and subdued sentiment.” The post What’s Next for PI This Week? 2 AIs With Shocking Pi Network Price Calls appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-08 04:38:12

MSTY's dividends have been sharply reduced recently, reflecting falling net asset value. Despite MSTY's high current yield, further dividend cuts are likely if NAV continues to drop. Given these risks, MSTY is not a compelling investment at this time. Article Thesis Cryptocurrencies have recently hit a rough patch, which has impacted crypto-centric stocks such as Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ), too. While touted as a safer way to get MSTR exposure, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) has been hit very hard as well. Even worse, dividends have been cut drastically from where they were just a couple of months ago -- with net asset value falling, dividends could decline further going forward, which is why I think that MSTY is not a very compelling investment, despite an arguably very high current yield. Past Coverage I have written about the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF here on Seeking Alpha once, in July . Back then, I argued that MSTY was an avoid due to considerable downside risk and that its dividend yield, while very high, was not a reason to buy, including due to the fact that there was significant dividend cut risk. With more than three months having passed since then, it is time to take another look at MSTY -- has the thesis played out so far, and what's relevant for MSTY going forward? If you're interested in an overview of MSTY, I welcome you to check out the article from last summer I linked above. MSTY's Recent Performance MSTY offers a very high dividend yield and uses MSTR as the underlying for its covered call option strategy. But that does not mean that MSTY has a way better return outlook -- the high dividend yield comes at a cost. MSTY can only achieve this high dividend yield by selling covered calls aggressively, which sacrifices the upside potential in the underlying stock. This means that during bull runs, MSTY has a high chance of underperforming MSTR, as we have seen in the past. In the last couple of months, when MSTR did pull back, MSTY pulled back as well -- in fact, its price dropped even more than that of MSTR, as MSTY's covered call option strategy prevented it from benefiting from temporary upward moves in MSTR, as the following chart shows: Data by YCharts Over the last three months, Strategy saw its shares drop by around 40%, while MSTY dropped by around 50%. On a total return basis, the performance was better for both, but still extremely bad -- both picks would have generated a loss of more than 30%, with dividends already being accounted for. In retrospect, a ""Sell"" rating would have worked even better when I covered MSTY in the summer, but I'm still happy with my conclusion from July that MSTY was a risky pick that investors should avoid. With MSTR and MSTY performing more or less the same on a total return basis, as the dividend payments from MSTY were mostly offset by MSTY's more pronounced share price crash, I also continue to believe that MSTY should not be seen as a lower-risk way of investing in MSTR: Downside risk is relatively comparable, despite MSTY's dividend payments that were not able to prevent massive losses on a total return basis. MSTY's Bitcoin Exposure While the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is branded as an income investment and is seen as that by many investors, it still remains a bet on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), or, more precisely, on a fast-growing Bitcoin price. After all, MSTY's underlying -- Strategy Inc -- is a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. While that has worked out well for MSTR investors during past Bitcoin bull runs, it introduces major risks for MSTR and MSTY investors. MSTR issues debt and shares to buy Bitcoin, and MSTR also trades at a considerable premium compared to the per-share value of its Bitcoin holdings. While that can still make MSTR attractive for someone who believes that the price of Bitcoin will rise tremendously in the future -- such as ARK Invest with its $1.2 million price target -- it also means that MSTR is a quite risky play if Bitcoin doesn't rise as much as expected. More recently, the price of Bitcoin has actually fallen, which naturally is even worse for MSTR, and, of course, for MSTY: Data by YCharts Bitcoin has dropped almost 20% in the last couple of weeks, relative to the previous high, meaning Bitcoin is almost in a bear market today. Due to MSTR being a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, MSTR has dropped way more than Bitcoin -- MSTR trades at less than half its 52-week high today. The price of Bitcoin has always been volatile, and I don't know where it will trade in the future -- but I see that momentum currently is weak and that enthusiasm seemingly has faded in recent weeks. This could result in further downside potential for Bitcoin's price, which would likely result in an even larger hit to MSTR's share price due to Strategy Inc.'s use of leverage. If MSTR falls, MSTY will fall as well, as we have seen earlier. Considering how badly both MSTR and MSTY have performed in recent months, despite Bitcoin still being down less than 20% from its recent high, I don't want to know how far MSTR and MSTY would fall in case we see an even bigger drawdown in the price of Bitcoin -- in the past, Bitcoin has fallen by 50%, 60%, 70%, or even more from time to time. I'm not a Bitcoin bear, and it is possible that Bitcoin will stabilize here or start climbing again -- but it is also possible that Bitcoin falls a lot further, and that could be devastating for both MSTR and MSTY due to MSTR's usage of leverage. Declining Dividends: You Were Warned Some bulls have, in the past, argued that MSTY wasn't very risky -- due to its very high yield, investors would get back their principal in a short period of time, and then any fall in its share price wouldn't be much of a problem. I think the key counterargument to that is that this only works if MSTY keeps its dividend stable, which it has not done in the past. In summer, when I argued MSTY should be avoided, its monthly dividend stood at $1.18, or around $14.20 per year. Since then, MSTY has moved to weekly dividends instead of monthly dividends -- nice for those wanting very regular cash flow, but it doesn't mean higher overall dividends. The most recently announced weekly payout was $0.169, or around $8.80 per year. That is around 40% less than in summer, when I last covered MSTY -- dividends have fallen off a cliff in a rather short period of time. If MSTY were to continue on this trajectory of reducing its payout by roughly 10% per month, the dividend could be way lower than it is today in the not-too-distant future. This isn't set in stone -- if Bitcoin were to rally, MSTR would climb, MSTY's net asset value would stabilize, and MSTY could be able to maintain the current payout. But history shows that this is not very likely -- ever since MSTY began trading, its NAV has been trending down, and so has its dividend. The payout once was north of $4 per month, or more than $1 per week -- relative to that, the payout has dropped by more than 80%. MSTY: I Think It Remains An Avoid During past bull runs, MSTY has underperformed MSTR, and its dividend didn't really help during the recent bear market -- both MSTR and MSTY performed very badly on a total return basis. This is with Bitcoin still just 20% below its recent high -- if Bitcoin were to fall further, MSTR and MSTY would continue to drop. MSTY is a serial dividend cutter, and I thus believe that it is unlikely that the current dividend will be maintained in the long run. The current dividend yield of roughly 100% looks enticing, but it has been a yield trap in the past, and I think there is a significant risk of that holding true for the future, too. I continue to think that investors are better off staying away from MSTY -- if they want Bitcoin exposure, a direct investment in Bitcoin seems like a better idea.",MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-08 04:40:28

According to reporting from Bloomberg , Steve said that a situation like that would likey require the Federal Reserve to adjust its own policy stance to avoid slowing the economy by mistake. Steve said the surge of stablecoins is drawing heavy demand toward U.S. Treasury bills and other highly liquid dollar instruments, especially from buyers outside the United States, which then adds to the supply of loanable money in the economy. When the supply of lendable funds increases, the neutral rate (the level of interest that supports steady growth without overheating or dragging activity) can drift downward. Steve said that if the neutral rate is plunging, then the Federal Reserve must respond by lowering its policy rate, otherwise it risks tightening conditions unintentionally. He described the situation plainly, saying “Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers.” He added that the buildup of stablecoins is already influencing markets and will keep doing so as adoption grows. Stablecoin growth pressures interest benchmarks Steve referred to existing research to say that expanding stablecoin usage could lower the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate by around 0.4 percentage point. That figure aligns with the pattern of his policy views during his tenure. Since joining the Fed, Steve has repeatedly argued for deeper and faster rate cuts, saying the commonly assumed neutral rate is too high. He has said that holding rates above the true neutral level risks slowing down the economy more than intended. Until now, Steve had based most of his arguments on inflation trends and conditions in the broader economy. But the rise of stablecoins introduces a new long-term factor. By increasing the supply of money available for lending, he said, it naturally exerts downward pressure on the neutral rate for years ahead. “Even relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down the neutral rate,” Steve said. He continued, “If neutral is lower, policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy.” Steve warned that refusing to respond to this shift would be “contractionary.” He is set to leave the Federal Reserve in January, when the term he is currently filling is scheduled to end. Crypto market erases yearly gains as volatility hits Bitcoin Steve’s policy remarks come as the total market value of all cryptocurrencies (which reached nearly $4.4 trillion on October 6) saw a 20% decline that has wiped out nearly all the gains recorded earlier this year. The crash began after the sudden liquidation of roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions, which shook confidence among traders and left the market struggling for direction. Few market participants are currently betting on a strong rebound, per data from CryptoQuant. This downturn stands out because this year had been marked by stronger recognition of crypto from regulators, major banks and institutional investors. President Donald Trump’s push to position the United States as the central hub of global crypto activity earlier contributed to rising enthusiasm. Bitcoin at one point surged by 35% this year. But now the total crypto market value sits below where it was when Trump entered office. Bitcoin has fallen 9% so far this week alone, putting it on track for its worst weekly result since March. It also fell below its 200-day moving average, a level widely monitored by traders since the 2022 bear market. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading just under $100,000. Losses have been even heavier among altcoins, which are smaller and more volatile. They have underperformed across the board this year.

Central Bank Governor Timur Suleimenov announced the initiative during an interview with Bloomberg in London, stating that the fund would focus on investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and shares of companies involved in the sector, rather than holding digital assets directly. State-Run Crypto Asset Fund During the interview , Suleimenov expressed confidence that the fund would be operational by the end of the year or early January. He emphasized that the investment strategy would be cautious, steering clear of direct crypto exposure. Kazakhstan’s Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, Berik Sholpankulov, further clarified the government’s strategy, revealing that they are considering using some of the National Fund’s assets, as well as gold and foreign exchange reserves, for investments linked to crypto assets. Sholpankulov noted that any such investment activities would be managed exclusively through a state-run digital asset fund, which is currently under discussion. The National Bank’s Deputy Chairman detailed that confiscated cryptocurrency assets would be allocated to this state digital asset fund , where they will serve as a strategic reserve for the government. Additionally, he mentioned a proposal from the Ministry of Digital Development to allow state-owned mining companies to provide energy to private mining operations in exchange for payment in virtual currencies. According to the National Bank, the assets of the National Fund increased by $990 million in September compared to August, reaching a total of $62.7 billion. Concurrently, gold and foreign exchange reserves also saw a rise, with gold reserves growing to $39.7 billion, despite a decline in foreign exchange assets. Kazakhstan Eyes Regulated Digital Asset Landscape This initiative comes on the heels of the National Bank’s approval of a concept to create a national reserve of crypto assets, which will be managed through a new subsidiary focused on alternative investments. The government is also exploring the establishment of licensed crypto banks and a national cryptocurrency exchange to foster a regulated environment for digital asset trading in Kazakhstan. Over the past few months, authorities have cracked down on illicit cryptocurrency exchanges, shutting down 130 operations suspected of laundering criminal proceeds. This crackdown has led to the seizure of crypto assets worth approximately $16.7 million. However, Sholpankulov noted that around $15 billion in cryptocurrency has reportedly exited the country due to regulatory gaps surrounding digital assets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $100,820, marking a notable 9% decline over the past week. This puts the leading cryptocurrency 20% below its all-time high of $126,000, which was reached in early October of this year.

Reversal Setup Forms Beneath Heavy Resistance,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/polkadot-dot/polkadot-2-85-breakout-ahead/,"Polkadot’s price action is beginning to hint at a possible shift in momentum, with a reversal setup forming just below the critical $2.85 level. The bulls are gradually building pressure, eyeing a breakout that could confirm a change in trend. Still, the presence of strong resistance overhead means the coming sessions will be crucial in determining whether DOT can break free or face another rejection. DOT’s Downtrend Shows Signs Of Exhaustion As Buyers Eye A Short-Term Recovery Giving a follow-up on the expected path of DOT in the 4-hour timeframe, Elliott Waves Academy revealed that the series of declines through the sub-waves of the recent impulsive move may be nearing its end. This suggests that the current downward trend is exhausting itself, at least in the short term, with a potential recovery ahead. Related Reading: Polkadot Recovery Stalls As Bearish Pressure Returns With $3.5 In Sight Elliott Waves Academy observes that a diagonal pattern appears to be forming, which is outlining the intricate details of wave (1)/(A). This diagonal formation is key to the analysis, as it typically signals the termination of a prior trend and precedes a reversal. The analyst points to a confirmed break above the upper boundary of this diagonal pattern. Such a break would officially open the path for an upward recovery toward the zone between $3.3423 and $3.36538. On the other hand, the $2.2848 level is deemed crucial for maintaining the immediate recovery outlook. Elliott Waves Academy warned that if this critical $2.2848 level is broken, further significant downside is expected through an extension of the existing bearish waves. Polkadot Remains Trapped Beneath Major HTF Resistance Levels Crypto_Jobs shared on X that the long-term chart for Polkadot remains largely stagnant and constrained beneath major high-timeframe (HTF) resistance zones at $3.200 and $3.780. The analyst cautioned traders to remain conservative with any swing (long) setups while the price trades below these critical resistance barriers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap—Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Examining the current price action, Crypto_Jobs described market conditions as neutral, with Polkadot fluctuating within a tight range between $2.500 and $2.700. The sideways movement reflects a lack of clear direction, as both bulls and bears struggle for dominance. Despite this period of indecision, the chart showcases an emerging pattern that could soon dictate the next significant move. The crypto analyst noted the possible formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a neckline around the $2.700–$2.850 to $3.00 zone. A confirmed breakout above this neckline could signal renewed bullish momentum, potentially leading to a 5–10% price surge.

Reeves is expected to target pension contribution tax perks in the Budget, limiting reliefs for both employers and employees to help boost Treasury revenues by £2 billion ($2.6 billion) per year. However, there are concerns that the policy will unfairly penalise those who responsibly save for retirement and could also harm company pension plans. Reeves will not limit tax-free pension lump sum withdrawals Reeves had told the Office for Budget Responsibility she intends to hike income tax when she delivers the Budget on 26 November. According to reports, Reeves is contemplating a 2p income tax alongside a 2p national insurance cut, breaking from Labour’s manifesto commitment. Insiders say Reeves has opted against reducing tax-free pension lump sum withdrawals amid concerns that it would hurt pensioners. Retirees will still be able to take up to 25% of their pension—capped at £268,275—tax-free. However, she is turning her attention to salary sacrifice schemes in an effort to address the £30 billion funding gap . This week, the deputy Labour leader, Lucy Powell, warned that if the Chancellor breaks the party’s income tax pledge, it could undermine voters’ confidence. However, some economists argue that the combination of policy reversals, increased debt, and slow economic growth leaves Reeves little choice but to raise taxes or abandon her flagship borrowing targets. So far, officials see trimming pension tax reliefs as one of the easiest ways to boost revenue. Salary sacrifice currently allows workers to funnel any amount into their pensions before national insurance is charged, with contributions taken from pay before tax is deducted. Reeves is expected to limit this to £2,000 a year in the upcoming Budget. Any pension contributions exceeding £2,000 ($2681) would incur national insurance at 8% on salaries below £50,000 (approximately $ 65,795) and 2% on income above that threshold. Workers who use salary sacrifice to invest more than £2,000 in their pensions will feel the impact, even though 15% of their salary is suggested for retirement savings. For a basic-rate earner on £50,270, saving 6% of pay would increase national insurance by £80 annually, while saving £5,000 (10%) would add £240 ($315). Experts caution that many workers would face a double blow, since employers would also forfeit tax relief on pension contributions. Currently, employers receive full relief from the 15% national insurance on salary-sacrifice pension contributions. Reeves plans to limit this, which would increase the cost for a £50,270 employee saving 10% of pay by £450 ($592) a year. Companies may reduce their pension benefits to employees Steve Webb, a partner at pension consultants LCP, is opposed to tightening tax relief. He commented: “Salary sacrifice schemes have been around for a long time and are a way of encouraging employers to offer good workplace pensions. Introducing a cap would increase national insurance bills, mostly for employers and hit the very firms who are doing the right thing.” He cautioned that a cap could create fears that pension benefits are on the chopping block, potentially paving the way for eventual removal of pension perks, at a time when greater pension engagement is necessary. The Society of Pension Professionals’ tax group chair, Steve Hitchiner, said that the changes would likely push firms to make their pension schemes less generous to offset higher taxes. He explained that the reform would make salary sacrifice pensions more expensive for employers, due to the 15% national insurance payable on employee contributions. Similar to Webb, he also noted that employers may pass the additional expense to staff in the form of lower pension contributions or smaller raises. Some businesses have also given their opinions on the matter. One company said it would be left explaining to staff why their payslips will vary despite their previous stable earnings, while another accused the government of attempting to raise money “through the back door.” Some firms even suggested that, if the impact is significant, they may end their salary sacrifice programs.

Melker referenced comments by Tillman of Arch Public, who discussed why his view on XRP’s role in cross-border payments shifted after the emergence of stablecoins. The remarks were followed by contrasting responses from members of the digital asset community, who argued that XRP’s function remains distinct and broader in scope. Tillman at @tryarchpublic says he was a big $XRP believer until stablecoins changed everything. @TEXASOL61 pic.twitter.com/u6NT4kuzvQ — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) November 5, 2025 Tillman’s Position on Stablecoins and Settlement In the clip highlighted by Melker, Tillman explained that he once supported XRP due to its intended use in cross-border payments. However, he stated that the introduction of stablecoins changed his assessment of the space. He argued that, in his view, the value of a settlement asset depends on its ability to maintain parity with the asset being settled against. According to him, anything without par value was less efficient as a settlement layer compared to assets designed to remain pegged, such as stablecoins. He pointed to stablecoins as better aligned for settlement due to this parity, suggesting that their structure reduced the need for assets like XRP in payment flow scenarios. Community Responses Emphasize Cost and Structural Role Some users challenge the premise that stablecoins inherently serve as a superior settlement mechanism. Commenter Joshua D. Larkin noted that stablecoins do not operate on a single native ledger, meaning they are issued across multiple chains with varying transaction costs. He pointed out that some networks hosting stablecoins have higher fees than the XRP Ledger, raising questions about efficiency when measured through speed and cost. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter, RLFRS, emphasized that stablecoins are typically payment instruments issued by private companies or institutions. He argued that XRP’s role is broader than stablecoin payment, suggesting that XRP acts as liquidity to bridge multiple types of assets, including tokenized commodities and financial instruments, not just fiat currency pairs. He highlighted pathfinding on the XRP Ledger, describing how it is designed to locate optimal liquidity routes to facilitate conversion between diverse tokenized assets . In this perspective, stablecoins may function as transactional tools, but XRP is positioned as the mechanism that enables different asset classes to connect efficiently. Melker’s post underscored a clear division in how digital asset participants interpret the utility and future of XRP, compared to stablecoins. While Tillman framed stablecoins as a replacement for XRP in cross-border settlement, others maintained that XRP’s utility extends into liquidity and asset-bridging functions not addressed by stablecoins alone. The discussion reflects ongoing reassessment of digital asset roles as tokenization and settlement infrastructure continue to develop.

Experts Back 3 Altcoins Exploding Against The Downtrend,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-is-the-ripple-xrp-price-down-today-experts-back-3-altcoins-exploding-against-the-downtrend/,"Ripple’s XRP has come under renewed selling pressure, mirroring the cautious sentiment across major altcoins. Traders are rotating capitals into tokens with stronger momentum or clear fundamentals, which is why the price has gone down in the short term. Despite the dip, experts believe that while some assets pause, others—like ZEC, ICP, and Remittix—are breaking higher. Remittix (RTX) , a fast-rising PayFi project, has drawn attention for maintaining growth during broader weakness, emphasizing how investor capital is now flowing toward utility-based ecosystems rather than speculative price action. XRP Price Faces Mild Pressure As Rotation Continues The XRP price stands at $2.20, with a market capitalization of $131.11 billion and a trading volume of $5.31 billion, down 7.25% over the last day. This token, which had been strong of late, appears to undergo profit-taking now as cash flow shifts to newer projects that have been performing well of late. XRP still maintains one of the deepest liquidity pools in the altcoin market, which has been helping to cushion larger downside moves. Not all altcoins are moving slowly, however. Zcash is up 18.3% in 24 hours, selling at $683.06 and boosting its market capitalization to $10.53 billion. The trading volume of the token increased 42.24%. Internet Computer is also up 10.61% to $7.791, which gives it a market cap of $3.99 billion. The network is getting busier again, and investors are interested in blockchain platforms that are useful. Its daily volume hit $1.41 billion. Utility-Led Projects Like Remittix Defy Market Pressure While XRP consolidates, Remittix continues to build momentum in the crypto payments space. Priced at $0.1166 per token, the Remittix DeFi project has raised over $28 million through private funding, with more than 684 million tokens distributed. Its mission is to create a seamless crypto-to-fiat bridge that allows users to send crypto directly to traditional bank accounts across 30+ countries—making it one of the few upcoming crypto projects solving real-world problems. Remittix recently expanded its Beta Wallet testing to more iOS holders, inviting the top 10 weekly purchasers to join the next testing phase. This structured rollout allows for real community feedback while preparing the platform for mass adoption. The project’s credibility has also been boosted after becoming fully verified by CertiK, where it is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens for its security and transparency. The Advancements Pushing Remittix Into the Spotlight: Global Reach: Seamless crypto bank transfers across more than 30 countries. CertiK Verified: Ranked #1 for pre-launch credibility and building trust. $28 million Secured: Raised via private funding from early backers. Community Expansion: Ongoing beta wallet testing and referral incentives. Future Listings: BitMart and LBank confirmed as upcoming centralized exchanges. Market Takeaway — Building Through The Downtrend XRP’s decline highlights how investors are rebalancing toward tokens with tangible applications. ZEC and ICP’s rallies show that liquidity remains in motion, just more selective. Yet the bigger signal is the consistent attention on Remittix, where transparent funding, verified security, and expanding utility are shaping it into one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025. As traders look beyond speculation, projects proving real use—like Remittix—are setting the new direction for the next DeFi growth cycle.

According to recent analysis, if BTC rockets to $250,000 within three months, it might signal an impending market collapse rather than sustained growth. This surprising Bitcoin price prediction challenges conventional thinking about cryptocurrency rallies. What Exactly is a Blow-Off Top in Bitcoin Trading? A blow-off top represents one of the most dangerous patterns in any market. It occurs when prices skyrocket rapidly, creating extreme euphoria among investors. However, this excitement often precedes a sharp and painful decline. The current Bitcoin price prediction analysis suggests we might be approaching such conditions. Macroeconomic analyst Mel Mattison describes the current market phase as healthy adjustment. He warns that an overheated rally could disrupt this stability. His cautious approach to Bitcoin price prediction emphasizes sustainable growth over explosive gains. Why Would Rapid Growth Signal Trouble? Healthy markets typically show steady, measured growth. When assets climb too quickly, they often lack fundamental support. Consider these warning signs: Unsustainable momentum – Prices detach from real value FOMO buying – Investors chase gains fearfully Weak hands entering – Inexperienced traders dominate Leverage buildup – Excessive borrowing amplifies risk This Bitcoin price prediction scenario suggests that rapid appreciation might indicate market overheating rather than genuine strength. What’s the Realistic Bitcoin Price Prediction? Mattison offers a more measured outlook for Bitcoin’s trajectory. He suggests BTC could reach $150,000 by approximately February next year. This represents substantial growth while avoiding dangerous speculation levels. His Bitcoin price prediction focuses on cyclical patterns rather than hype-driven surges. The analyst emphasizes that current market conditions reflect healthy adjustment. This phase allows for organic growth without excessive speculation. Therefore, investors should view gradual appreciation as more sustainable than explosive rallies. How Should Investors Approach This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Understanding market cycles proves crucial for cryptocurrency success. While dramatic gains attract attention, they often carry hidden risks. This Bitcoin price prediction serves as a reminder that sustainable growth typically outperforms short-term spikes. Consider these protective strategies: Dollar-cost average – Regular investments smooth volatility Set realistic targets – Avoid chasing unrealistic gains Monitor market sentiment – Extreme optimism often signals tops Maintain perspective – Remember long-term fundamentals The Bottom Line: Sustainable Growth Over Speculative Spikes This thought-provoking Bitcoin price prediction reminds us that not all growth signals positive development. Sometimes, the most exciting rallies precede the most painful corrections. By understanding market dynamics, investors can navigate volatility more effectively. The key insight remains clear: sustainable, measured appreciation typically creates more wealth than explosive, unsustainable spikes. This Bitcoin price prediction encourages disciplined investing over emotional trading. Frequently Asked Questions What is a blow-off top in cryptocurrency markets? A blow-off top occurs when prices surge dramatically within a short period, followed by a rapid collapse. It typically marks the end of a bullish trend and signals impending bearish conditions. Why would reaching $250,000 be bearish for Bitcoin? Such rapid appreciation would likely stem from speculative frenzy rather than organic growth. This creates unsustainable conditions where prices detach from fundamental value, setting the stage for correction. What timeframe does this Bitcoin price prediction cover? The analysis specifically addresses a three-month window for the potential $250,000 scenario. The more realistic prediction of $150,000 targets February of next year. How reliable are Bitcoin price predictions generally? While analysts use various methodologies, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile. Predictions should inform strategy rather than dictate it, with diversification being crucial. What indicators suggest market overheating? Key warning signs include extreme leverage, dominance by retail investors, detachment from fundamental metrics, and widespread euphoria in media coverage. How can investors protect against blow-off top scenarios? Maintaining balanced portfolios, avoiding excessive leverage, taking partial profits during rallies, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term hype.

Bitcoin Options Open Interest Has Already Bounced Back From Oct Expiry In a new thread on X, analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the Bitcoin options market. This segment of derivatives trading involves traders betting on future price moves through contracts giving the right (but not the obligation) to sell or buy the cryptocurrency at a set price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Erases Recovery As Coinbase Users Relentlessly Sell Earlier, perpetual futures was the main derivatives trading pathway that investors in the sector used, but recently, demand for options has grown enough to challenge the futures market. One way to gauge interest in options is through the Open Interest, an indicator that measures the total amount of contracts related to the market that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin options Open Interest over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin options Open Interest reached a new record on October 31st. Shortly after, however, the metric saw a plunge due to the contract expiry. Options contracts come with an “expiry” date, on which the contract get either exercised or automatically closed out. A large amount of these expiries coincided on October 31st, which is why the indicator saw a flush. Interestingly, the options Open Interest has been quick to bounce back since then, with its value already halfway back to the ATH. Thus, it would appear demand for options is still alive and well. From the chart, it’s apparent that a similar pattern was also witnessed after the previous major expiry, when the metric gradually recovered and explored new records. “The options market open interest looks set to keep printing new ATHs, expiry after expiry,” explained the analytics firm.

As for whether investors are opening bearish or bullish trades with these moves, data suggests bearish bets, or “puts,” initially rose during the plunge, but then bullish bets, or “calls,” saw a surge as price rebounded. Once again, however, puts have seen a rise, indicating investors don’t trust a bottom has appeared yet. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced its recent recovery as its price is back at $100,900.

The focal point was a direct message from Garlinghouse regarding institutional alignment, upcoming developments, and the continued role of XRP within Ripple’s broader strategy. The video emphasized ongoing industry shifts, the pace of acquisitions, the importance of ecosystem development, and potential effects of increased institutional market access. XRP price will follow.. UP! pic.twitter.com/O2iInZcjFV — RIZ.. (@RizXRP) November 5, 2025 Institutional Participation as a Central Theme Garlinghouse began by expressing confidence in Ripple’s recent strategic investment partnerships with Fortress and Citadel Securities. He described these firms as major financial players and referenced their involvement as meaningful validation. According to Garlinghouse, their alignment sends a clear signal to the financial sector, including institutions that have yet to engage with digital assets. He stated that more than half of financial institutions in the United States currently have no crypto exposure, but he does not believe that will remain the case in the coming year. He framed this trajectory as favorable not only for Ripple but also for companies operating across the broader digital asset ecosystem. His comments positioned institutional adoption as accelerating rather than speculative.

He described XRP as “the heart and soul” of what the company is building, stating that Ripple’s goal is to promote trust, utility, and liquidity for XRP. He noted that the acquisitions undertaken by the firm—regardless of whether their relevance appears immediately clear to the public—are tied to long-term strategic planning. Garlinghouse acknowledged industry-wide challenges related to the dominance of speculative trading over practical application. However, he stated that increased regulatory clarity and global investment are paving the way for broader utility development. He cited growth across the XRP ecosystem , including projects independent of Ripple, attributing this to the blockchain’s efficiency, speed, and scalability. Outlook on a Potential Spot XRP ETF The interview also addressed claims that a spot XRP exchange-traded fund may launch soon. Garlinghouse said that while he is not ready to confirm timing, he views the introduction of such a product as beneficial. He noted that ETFs simplify access for investors who may not wish to use exchanges and pointed to the market impact observed following the launch of ETH-based ETFs earlier in the year. According to Garlinghouse, increased access and institutional trust would likely contribute to growth in the XRP market over time. RIZ’s post framed this as a signal of confidence, reflecting a belief that XRP’s price direction will follow broader industry progress upward.
