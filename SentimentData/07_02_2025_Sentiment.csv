Ethereum Could Be In Danger Of Falling Under Ascending Channel Support In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about where Ethereum could head next based on a pattern forming in its 12-hour price chart. The pattern in question is an Ascending Parallel Channel from TA, which, as its name implies, involves two parallel trendlines that are sloped upwards. Related Reading: Ethereum Recovers To $2,800 As Exchange Outflows Near $1 Billion When the asset is inside this channel, it goes through consolidation towards a net upside. The higher tops in its price trace the upper line of the pattern, while the higher lows draw the lower level. Like other TA patterns, the former line is assumed to act as a source of resistance in the near future and the latter as a point of support. Breaks out of either of these boundaries can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. The Ascending Parallel Channel isn’t the only parallel channel in TA. When parallel consolidation happens towards the downside instead, the formation is known as a Descending Parallel Channel. Neither of these are the most commonly observed type, though, as that title is held by the basic Parallel Channel, which has its trendlines parallel to the time-axis (that is, they have zero slope). Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that the 12-hour price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum half-day price saw a very brief retest of the Ascending Channel’s lower level recently. The coin found support then, but its value is still floating quite close to the line, meaning that another retest could potentially happen soon. The level is currently situated at $2,500. During the last few years, this line has continuously held for the cryptocurrency, so it’s possible that it may do so again in the near future. “If Ethereum $ETH holds above $2,500, it could rebound toward $4,000 or even $6,000,” notes Martinez. The former target is around halfway through the channel from the current mark, while the latter corresponds to the upper level. The last time that ETH topped out was near the former line. Related Reading: Chainlink Witnesses Highest Whale Activity Since 2023, Price Reversal Coming? “However, if $2,500 fails as support, the next target shifts to $1,700!” warns the analyst. From the current price of the coin, a crash to this target would mean a decrease of more than 39%. It now remains to be seen whether Ethereum will retest the lower level of the Ascending Channel again in the coming days or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,800, down more than 6% over the last seven days.

In a new announcement, Binance says it will be adding support for Berachain ( BERA ), an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-identical layer-1 blockchain that uses a proof-of-liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism. “Binance is excited to announce that Berachain will be added to Binance Simple Earn, ‘Buy Crypto,’ Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures.” A PoL consensus mechanism rewards validators for providing liquidity to a blockchain’s ecosystem rather than a traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which incentivizes staking tokens. As stated on Berachain’s official webpage, “Proof-of-Liquidity radically changes the way L1 economics are structured, prioritizing users and applications over validator rewards at baseline. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing the network/user growth. PoL strongly align the incentives of network participants (validators, protocols, users) and contributes to the overall long-term health of the chain.” News of the addition sent BERA flying, as the digital asset went from a February 5th low of $7.85 to a peak of $14.83 a day later, a gain of 89%. BERA has since retraced and is trading for $9.22 at time of writing.

That agency, part of the Indian Finance Ministry, had ordered Bybit’s website to be blocked in the country and imposed a fine after finding in January that the exchange violated anti-money laundering rules. The FIU-IND fined Bybit 92.7 rupees (around $1.1 million) on January 31, saying the exchange engaged in “persistent and continuous” violations of the 2005 Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules. As a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP), the exchange had reporting obligations, but it had expanded its services in India without registering the new offerings with the FIU-IND. Bybit’s suspension is part of a larger crackdown Bybit suspended all services to Indian users except withdrawals on Jan. 12, citing new and continuing regulatory issues. The suspension even applied to Bybit payment cards in India. The exchange said the suspension would be temporary. The exchange announced its payment of the fine and FIU-IND registration on Feb. 6. It noted that it had applied to the agency to become a registered VDASP in India in June 2024. The FIU-IND cracked down on foreign crypto exchanges in December 2023, alleging they did not observe the agency’s regulations. The exchanges affected included Binance, which was shut out of the country until June, when it paid a $2.2 million fine to the FIU-IND. India’s approach to crypto is evolving The Indian government has shown little enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, imposing strict regulations on the industry and high taxes on profits from digital assets. Part of exchange’s reporting obligations involve taxation. Crypto exchanges themselves are liable to taxation as well. In December, the Finance Ministry declared that domestic and foreign crypto exchanges owe an aggregate 8.24 billion rupees in back taxes. Binance owed the lion’s share of back taxes. A rift within the government came to light in May, when the Securities and Exchange Board of India recommended that government agencies regulate crypto. That position contrasts with the central bank view that retail crypto is a macroeconomic risk. In a February interview with Reuters, Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth said India was reconsidering its stance on cryptocurrency in light of world trends. In any case, India led the world in cryptocurrency adoption in 2023 and 2024, according to the annual Chainalysis survey.

But not all cryptos are created equal. Some projects are proving to be standout picks, combining cutting-edge technology, massive adoption potential, and real-world use cases that could drive rapid growth. Three cryptos currently leading the pack? Qubetics ($TICS) , Astra (ASTR), and Celestia (TIA). Astra (ASTR) is making waves by integrating AI with blockchain, ensuring enhanced automation, compliance, and efficiency in decentralized finance. Celestia (TIA) is tackling blockchain scalability issues with its modular architecture, allowing developers to build high-performance applications on a flexible, independent execution layer. But if you’re looking for the best crypto to join for short-term profits this month, Qubetics ($TICS) takes the crown. With its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, it’s reshaping how developers create smart contracts and interact with blockchain networks. Let’s take a deep dive into why these three cryptos are catching investors’ eyes right now. Qubetics: The Game-Changer in Smart Contract Development For years, blockchain development has been complicated, time-consuming, and expensive. Smart contract coding required deep technical expertise, and interoperability between blockchains was a nightmare. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project designed to streamline blockchain development through its QubeQode IDE. QubeQode IDE is an intuitive, AI-powered development environment that allows businesses and developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts seamlessly. Instead of spending weeks or months coding, this tool allows developers to build blockchain applications with greater speed and efficiency, regardless of the network they want to use. For example, a financial platform looking to create cross-chain lending services can do so without struggling with different programming languages or complex integrations. Similarly, gaming platforms can build decentralized economies across multiple blockchains with ease, all thanks to QubeQode IDE’s compatibility and automation. With over 461 million tokens already sold, and more than 18,600 holders participating in the presale, Qubetics is proving to be a massive success before even hitting the open market. The current presale price of $0.0667 per $TICS token is set to increase by 10% in the 21st stage at the weekend, making now the ideal time to get involved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that’s removing barriers to blockchain development and adoption. For those looking for short-term profits and long-term growth, Qubetics stands at the top. Astra: AI-Powered Compliance & Automation Blockchain meets artificial intelligence with Astra (ASTR), a crypto that’s making waves for its ability to enhance DeFi automation, compliance, and security. The project is bringing AI-powered automation into finance, security, and risk management, ensuring that blockchain applications can operate more efficiently and comply with global regulations. One of Astra’s biggest breakthroughs is its KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) automation system. Regulatory compliance has been a major headache for blockchain companies, but Astra is solving this by using AI to automate identity verification and fraud detection, making transactions more secure and trustworthy. Picture a decentralized exchange that wants to comply with global regulations without burdening its users with long verification processes. Astra’s system automates these checks in real-time, keeping platforms both secure and user-friendly. With regulatory pressure mounting on the crypto industry, Astra’s ability to streamline compliance while maintaining decentralization makes it a must-watch project. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term adoption, Astra is proving itself as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month. Celestia: A Modular Blockchain Built for Scalability Scalability has been a major issue for blockchain networks. As more projects demand high-speed, low-cost transactions, older blockchains struggle to keep up. This is where Celestia (TIA) comes in—its modular blockchain architecture separates consensus from execution, allowing developers to build high-performance applications with maximum flexibility. Traditional blockchains like Ethereum handle everything on a single layer, making them slower and more expensive as traffic increases. Celestia fixes this by letting developers run their own execution environments, meaning they can process transactions and smart contracts without congestion from other applications. For example, a logistics company using blockchain for supply chain tracking can create a dedicated execution layer that processes thousands of transactions per second, independent of other applications. This ensures fast, scalable, and cost-effective blockchain adoption. With Celestia gaining traction as one of the most efficient and scalable blockchain solutions, it’s no surprise that investors are eyeing it for short-term profits and long-term innovation. Whether it’s used for DeFi, NFTs, or enterprise applications, Celestia is proving itself as one of the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month. Conclusion Finding the best cryptos to join for short-term profits this month requires looking beyond hype and focusing on real-world applications, adoption potential, and innovation. Among the top contenders, Qubetics, Astra, and Celestia offer massive opportunities for both short-term traders and long-term investors. Qubetics ($TICS) is changing blockchain development with QubeQode IDE, simplifying smart contract creation and expanding cross-chain capabilities. Astra (ASTR) is leading AI-driven blockchain automation, ensuring fast, secure, and compliant decentralized transactions. Celestia (TIA) is revolutionizing blockchain scalability, offering a modular solution for high-performance applications. For those seeking short-term gains with long-term potential, Qubetics is the standout pick. Its strong presale numbers, cutting-edge technology, and growing ecosystem make it a must-watch crypto in February 2025.

Analyst Eye Potential 306X Surge,https://coingape.com/will-dogecoin-price-rally-to-20-analyst-eye-potential-306x-surge/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) price has gained attention following recent price analyses indicating a potential surge. Analysts suggest that if DOGE maintains a critical support level, it could see a significant rally. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience, remaining within an ascending channel, which could indicate further upward movement. Could Dogecoin Price Hit $20 in the Next Bull Run? Analyst Javon Marks has shared insights on Dogecoin price, suggesting that its historical market cycles indicate the potential for a substantial rally. Marks referenced previous cycles where DOGE experienced exponential growth, with a 90X increase in 2017 and a surge exceeding 306X in 2021. He noted that each bullish phase outperformed the previous one, supporting the possibility of an even larger price jump in the next cycle. His analysis projects that if DOGE follows the same pattern, it could experience another massive rally, surpassing its previous all-time high. Marks highlighted that DOGE demonstrated a repeating trend of accumulation and breakout phases. He suggested that if this trend holds, DOGE could achieve a crypto rally exceeding 306X, pushing its price beyond $20. Source: X More so, Marks’ analysis points to the possibility of continued expansion, with the cryptocurrency following its previous performance trajectory. Similarly, a recent CoinGape report highlighted the crypto rally, emphasizing Dogecoin price movements aligning with past market cycles. If the top meme coin price structure follows the 2017 trend, the DOGE price could be on track for a new all-time high. However, breaking through the key resistance level at $0.30 remains crucial for sustained upward momentum. DOGE Must Hold Above $0.19 to Sustain Momentum Analyst Ali Martinez provided a separate technical perspective on Dogecoin price, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a key support level. According to his analysis, DOGE must remain above $0.19 to retain its bullish setup. If this level holds, the meme coin could see a crypto rally targeting a potential rise toward $10. Martinez’s chart illustrates an ascending price channel, showing that DOGE has historically followed a structured upward trend. He identified multiple resistance and support zones, suggesting that the asset could continue its upward momentum. His analysis indicates that breaking below $0.19 could weaken the bullish outlook, while sustained price action above this level may drive further gains. Source: X Top Meme Coin Price Action Both analysts present scenarios where Dogecoin price could see notable gains. Marks’ projection points to the possibility of the meme coin surpassing $20 if it follows its historical market cycles. Meanwhile, Martinez’s technical analysis suggests that maintaining a key support level could lead to a parabolic rise toward $10. However, despite the bullish projections, Dogecoin (DOGE) price has experienced a 14% decline in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.002134. Market data shows that the meme coin trading volume surged by 64.53% to $6.37 million, indicating heightened activity. On the positive, DOGE whales have been buying aggressively, accumulating 750 million tokens amid the recent price drop to $0.2. This large-scale accumulation suggests strong investor confidence and a potential rebound in Dogecoin price. The post Will Dogecoin Price Rally To $20?

Ethereum appears ready for a major move, with analysts watching closely for a breakout above $4,000—a key level for further gains. Ali Martinez predicts that if Ethereum breaks through resistance, it might climb to $7,400, $10,000, or even $14,000. The price currently hovers around $2,705.34 , reflecting a 2.36% drop in the last 24 hours. Support is found at $1,850, while resistance at $4,000 stands as a major barrier.

The publicly-traded Canadian corporation has acquired a cool 1,000,000 DOGE units, apparently unconcerned by the erratic character of the meme-coin market. This is a bold move, indicating a strong conviction for the long-term viability of a cryptocurrency sometimes written off as a passing online joke. Is this, then, a wise investment or a risky gamble? Strategic Acquisition And Future Expansion Following their strategic purchase, Neptune paid an average price of $0.37 for each DOGE token . Although the original outlay would seem high, the current value of their Dogecoin holdings comes at about $266,600. Neptune (NDA CN, $300M mkt cap) Becomes Only the Second Publicly Traded Company to Buy $DOGE pic.twitter.com/I1aTRYH0NE — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) February 4, 2025 In fact, this fluctuation is what defines cryptocurrencies naturally. The business is not stopping at that level. Plans are under progress to increase their Dogecoin reserves. A suggested $3 million fundraiser—more especially, aimed at boosting their Dogecoin portfolio—is in the pipeline. This large financial infusion points to a strong belief on the direction the meme coin will take. Neptune is definitely diving headfirst, not only dabbling their toes in the Dogecoin waters. Reports also disclose that Neptune bought 20 Bitcoin at an average price of $99,833 when the DOGE acquisition was made. The DOGE acquisition by Neptune coincides with multiple potential issuers submitting applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission to introduce Dogecoin ETFs in the US. These consist of Osprey Funds, Bitwise, Rex Shares, and Grayscale. Investor Confidence And Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its rollercoaster-like volatility. Particularly, Dogecoin is well-known for its extreme price swings, usually driven more by social media trends and celebrity sponsorships than by any basic technology development. Although Neptune demonstrates some confidence, its actions raise questions about risk control. Given a well-defined plan, can a company actually predict the path of such a meme asset? Neptune’s share price dropped 1.27% last week alone, a little tremor perhaps, but a reminder of the connectivity of the crypto market and investor mood. Observing how the market responds to Neptune’s rising Dogecoin holdings and upcoming fundraising initiatives will be interesting. The Dogecoin Phenomenon: Long-Term Prospects The path taken by Dogecoin from online meme to a major competitor in the crypto field is interesting. Originally developed as a playful parody of Bitcoin, it has surprisingly attracted a devoted and passionate following. Even though its technology isn’t as innovative as some other cryptocurrencies, its fame and easy access make it appealing. Neptune’s Dogecoin bet is basically a risky bet on how long this unique digital money will last. The community will likely continue to grow, more people will use Dogecoin, and it will stay important in the changing financial world.

This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

40012852,https://coingape.com/?p=237559,1738884897,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Reviews BlackRock’s Proposal for Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemptions,https://coingape.com/us-sec-reviews-blackrocks-proposal-for-bitcoin-etf-in-kind-redemptions/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing a proposal from BlackRock to allow in-kind redemptions for its spot Bitcoin ETF. The regulatory agency acknowledged the proposal in a Thursday filing, inviting public comments within 21 days of its publication in the Federal Register. BlackRock’s Proposal for Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Redemptions According to an X post by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, the US SEC is evaluating whether to approve in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF which recently expanded to Europe . The Nasdaq submitted an amended 19b-4 filing on behalf of BlackRock, requesting this change for the iShares Bitcoin Trust. The SEC had previously required cash redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs when it approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Under the current model, when an investor redeems shares, the issuer sells Bitcoin and distributes cash to the investor. BlackRock’s proposal would instead allow authorized participants (APs) to receive Bitcoin directly rather than cash. Potential Benefits of In-Kind Redemptions If approved, in-kind redemptions could provide advantages for institutional investors by reducing transaction costs and improving market liquidity. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that this change would not apply to retail investors, as only APs—typically large financial institutions—would be allowed to redeem shares in Bitcoin. Shifting from cash-based redemptions to in-kind transactions could also help avoid forced Bitcoin sales, which might reduce downward price pressure on the asset. This process would make Bitcoin ETFs function more like traditional commodity ETFs, such as those for gold. Regulatory Shift in Bitcoin ETF Policies The SEC’s decision to consider in-kind redemptions marks a shift from its earlier position. When the agency initially approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, it favored a cash model due to concerns about market manipulation and volatility. However, with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the regulatory stance appears to be evolving. BlackRock’s request comes amid broader changes in the crypto investment landscape. In August 2023, Grayscale Investments won a lawsuit against the SEC, forcing the regulator to review its rejection of Grayscale’s attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. This legal victory contributed to the eventual approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Meanwhile, amid the cooling off of the crypto regulations, the CBOE BZX Exchange has also filed 19b-4 applications for XRP ETFs with the SEC on behalf of Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree.

The firms demand the immediate removal of tokens that misuse their names, logos, and intellectual property. Burwick Law Accuses Pump.Fun of Ignoring IP Violations In a statement released on social networking platform X, Burwick Law asserts that Pump.Fun has the technical ability to remove these tokens but has opted not to act despite the potential risks to the public. The law firms argue that Pump.Fun has allowed third parties to create these tokens to “intimidate” their clients and undermine ongoing legal actions. Unfortunately, hundreds of memecoins that mimic or mock Burwick and Wolf Popper remain active on the platform, raising concerns about Pump.Fun’s commitment to addressing intellectual property violations. Pump.Fun Faces Legal Heat Over Alleged Deceptive Practices It worth noting that the cease-and-desist letter follows a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper on January 30. The lawsuit, filed by memecoin investor Diego Aguilar in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Pump.Fun promotes tokens with Ponzi-like characteristics targeting younger, less affluent investors. The plaintiff alleges that he incurred significant losses after investing in three memecoins—FRED, FWOG, and GRIFFAIN—created via Pump.Fun, which he claims were marketed as having the potential for exponential returns. Dogshit2 Token Surges Amid Legal Drama Meanwhile, Dogshit2, one of the memecoins linked to the lawsuit, hit a $23 million market cap on Monday. Recent data from CoinGecko shows that Dogshit2 has seen a massive rise, with its trading volume increasing by over 1000 percent in the past 24 hours, pushing its market capitalization to $8.7 billion—a 242 percent increase. Despite its sudden popularity, Dogshit2 has not been absorbed in the linked lawsuit as it continues to face accusations of being part of a “high-risk pump-and-dump” scheme. Burwick Law has firmly denied any connection to the token to distance itself from further controversy, stating that neither it nor Wolf Popper has launched or endorsed any memecoins. The firm also dismissed claims that a blockchain address linked to Dogshit2 appears in their legal documents, calling such allegations “completely false.” Incidentally, these class actions come just days after Donald Trump’s self-named memecoin, TRUMP, experienced a sharp decline, losing 44% of its value since its peak of $73.43 in January.

Plot Twist: Investing Now Could Yield Massive Returns,https://thecoinrise.com/best-presale-crypto-projects-to-consider-now-plot-twist-investing-now-could-yield-massive-returns/,"Crypto presales are often a straightforward and lucrative investment route. You invest early at a low price and, if the project is successful, you could end up with an asset significantly more valuable than your initial payment. Historical data confirms this: numerous projects, like Ethereum during its early days, sold tokens at prices much lower than their later worth. However, not every presale is the same, and understanding a project’s vision and functionality is crucial for identifying true opportunities from potential flops. Here we present the top four ICOs currently on the market. While they all look promising, only one could be your ticket to substantial financial gains. Keep reading to discover which is the best crypto presale to consider now! 1. Web3Bay: Most Demanded Web3 Crypto! Ever hoped that online shopping could empower users instead of big companies? Web3Bay (3BAY) is turning this idea into reality. Moving away from traditional e-commerce giants, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology for a decentralized marketplace that offers safer and more beneficial transactions. At the heart of Web3Bay’s approach are smart contracts—automated agreements that promote total fairness and remove the necessity for intermediaries. This eliminates hidden fees, privacy worries, and central control. Unique to Web3Bay is its community governance system, where 3BAY token holders can propose and vote on important decisions, directing the platform’s trajectory. The excitement around Web3Bay’s presale is noticeable, with over $1 million raised and more than 280 million tokens distributed. With the current price at $0.004562625 in Stage 4 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see a return of approximately 4,200%. Web3Bay’s innovative vision for e-commerce and significant potential for returns makes it the best presale crypto project . 2. Dive into Gains with The Last Dwarfs Think crypto investment is just about holding tokens? The Last Dwarfs (TLD) is here to shake things up by merging gaming with investment opportunities in a thrilling and smart way. $TLD fuels a GameFi world where players can farm, battle, and devise strategies to earn crypto prizes. That is why it’s listed as one of the best presale crypto projects. This platform introduces a gamified launchpad, bringing a strategic twist to early blockchain investments. Players engage in an interactive game environment to unlock access to promising crypto assets, refreshing the typical presale approach. 3. Wall Street Pepe: Memes & Finance Collide While many meme coins thrive on buzz, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is setting a new standard by integrating viral charm with decentralized finance tools. WEPE offers users advanced DeFi trading tools, such as analytics, automated trading strategies, and unique market insights. This represents a savvy evolution in a sector often dismissed as merely speculative. Memecoins that provide actual value—like Shiba Inu with its staking features—tend to persist longer. If WEPE can successfully merge entertainment with utility, it might just be the top presale crypto project to consider now, amidst a sea of fleeting trends. 4. Meme Index: Top Meme Coin For those who are drawn to meme coins but wish to minimize risks, Meme Index (MEMEX) provides an ingenious solution. Rather than gambling on one token, MEMEX functions like an ETF for meme coins, encapsulating the performance of favorites like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin into a single index. This method simplifies enjoying the peaks of meme coin fluctuations without the pressure of selecting the next big winner. It’s an attractive option in a volatile market, where meme tokens can either soar or plummet unpredictably. By investing in MEMEX, enthusiasts can engage with the meme coin market broadly, balancing potential gains and losses. Wrapping Up: Best Presale Crypto Projects to Consider Now In summary, The Last Dwarfs innovates with its gamified investment model, Wall Street Pepe blends meme fun with financial tools, and the Meme Index allows for diversified meme coin investment. Yet, for those seeking practical utility coupled with substantial financial upside, Web3Bay stands out as the best presale crypto project to consider now. With a potential 4,200% ROI by its launch for early 3BAY token buyers, Web3Bay promises not only to redefine e-commerce but also to offer lucrative returns in the process!

Amid this uncertainty, a new powerhouse, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token , is emerging with the potential to deliver an astronomical 20,000% surge in the imminent bull market. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The DeFi Revolution Set To Outshine DOGE WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a groundbreaking DeFi platform that redefines the crypto wallet experience. This unique platform offers a robust and intuitive interface backed by cutting-edge AI-powered behavioral analysis. This technology adapts to user preferences, creating a smoother, more personalized experience that is far superior to traditional wallets. With a revolutionary security infrastructure , the platform provides a unique Push Protocol technology, which offers real-time on-chain notifications to keep users informed of wallet activity, adding an extra layer of transparency and security, unlike any other crypto wallet in the world. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform has also launched a cutting-edge MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App that sets new standards in DeFi utility. By integrating CoinGecko API , users can maximize live market data, real-time sentiment analysis, and advanced biometric security measures. The app delivers a modern and user-friendly experience that allows users to simulate the management of crypto wallets for ETH and USDT, display QR codes for easy payments , and even send tokens to external addresses. The platform’s native token is engineered for explosive growth in the bull market. With competitive staking rewards that allow investors to earn up to 180% APY , the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token not only provides an exceptional passive income opportunity but also removes the need to convert other cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees. A crypto expert has confidently projected that WallitIQ (WLTQ) could surge by an eye-popping 20,000% in the 2025 bull market, a projection that dwarfs the modest recovery prospects of the Dogecoin price. Imagine the transformative power of this growth: if you invest $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.0420 , a 20,000% surge would turn that into $200,000. Similarly, a $10,000 investment could multiply to $2 million, and a $100,000 stake could yield an astonishing $20 million. These numbers make it abundantly clear why the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is capturing global attention. With its Beta platform close to launching and its CoinMarketCap listing and a SolidProof smart contract audit building confidence in investors, it’s no surprise that the ongoing presale is regarded as a pot of gold ahead of the crypto bull market in 2025. Dogecoin Price Continues To Fade In This New Era The Dogecoin price is facing persistent challenges. The decline in DOGE’s performance has led many seasoned investors to reconsider their strategies. While DOGE might have been a household name during the last bull market, the current Dogecoin price trajectory suggests that DOGE may not be able to withstand the rigorous demands of a new, more advanced bull market in 2025. As the Dogecoin price declines, investors are now looking for altcoins that offer actual utility and innovation, qualities that DOGE lacks. Crypto whales and institutional investors remain pessimistic about Dogecoin price volatility and are shifting their capital away from DOGE. Conclusion: Secure Your Future With WallitIQ (WLTQ) The upcoming bull market in 2025 is poised to reward early adopters, and the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is at the forefront of this revolution. While the Dogecoin price might show signs of recovery, it simply cannot compete with the massive 20,000% surge projected for the AI token. With its innovative technology , unmatched security features, and a presale opportunity that offers a chance to transform a modest investment into millions, this unique token stands as the ultimate altcoin for the next phase of crypto growth. Investors who seize the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale at $0.0420 are not merely buying a token; they are securing a future of financial independence and monumental wealth. Act now before the price skyrockets and the window of opportunity closes. Seize your chance to embrace the future of decentralized finance and quadruple your portfolio in this 2025 bull market.

Solana’s DEX Volume Soars",https://thecoinrise.com/hottest-crypto-updates-eth-price-jumps-traders-flock-to-blockdag-for-unlimited-usdt-rewards-solanas-dex-volume-soars/,"The blockchain world is witnessing exciting developments as platforms vie for prominence. Solana’s DEX volume surge demonstrates increased user activity, while Ethereum’s recent price rise signals growing institutional interest. These trends highlight shifting market dynamics. However, neither addresses blockchain scalability as effectively as BlockDAG . While Ethereum benefits from ETF inflows and Solana gains traction through high-volume trading, BlockDAG is built for efficiency and real-time transactions. Its affiliate program further boosts accessibility, giving users a direct path to benefit from adoption. As attention remains on market leaders, BlockDAG’s approach offers a compelling alternative for sustainable blockchain growth. Boost Your Earnings with BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program offers a rewarding way to generate passive income by introducing new participants. With an instant 5% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for both the referrer and the purchaser, participants can easily monetize their network. Getting started is simple. Connect your wallet to BlockDAG’s platform, and you’ll receive a unique affiliate link. Share this link with friends, communities, or followers. Every successful purchase made through your link triggers an immediate reward. Unlike many referral programs with delays or complex payout structures, BlockDAG ensures commissions are credited instantly. Another benefit is the dual reward system. When someone buys through your referral, both you and the buyer receive 5% cashback. This makes it an attractive incentive for new participants. The program requires minimal effort—once a qualifying purchase is made, the referral system activates automatically. To enhance user experience, BlockDAG provides a detailed dashboard. This dashboard offers insights into referral activity, earnings, and conversions. There’s no limit on the number of referrals. The more you promote, the greater your potential rewards. The presale has already raised over $192.5 million across 27 batches, selling over 18.3 billion BDAG coins to over 170,000 unique holders globally. The coin is currently priced at $0.0248, reflecting a 2380% surge since batch 1. Miner sales have generated over $6.2 million, with over 15,500 miners sold. Solana’s DEX Volume Surges Solana recently recorded $200 billion in monthly DEX trading volume. This figure surpasses trading on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks. This remarkable growth was partly fueled by the recent launch of a Trump-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, which spurred significant user activity. Currently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $246, an 18% increase over the past week. Its market capitalization now stands at $120.05 billion, placing it fifth in the cryptocurrency market. In addition to the impressive DEX volume, Grayscale has applied to introduce a Solana ETF on the New York Stock Exchange. This move has generated considerable market interest and is considered a potential catalyst for future price growth. Analysts believe these developments could lead to increased institutional adoption, pushing SOL’s price closer to $300. Technical indicators also suggest a bullish outlook. The recent break of a bullish pennant formation indicates potential for continued upward momentum. If Solana maintains its current trajectory, supported by strong user engagement and institutional interest, reaching $300 in the future seems increasingly likely. What’s Driving Ethereum’s Price Rise? Ethereum’s price rose 7.5% to $3,421 on January 24, 2025. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, gained 2.6% and crossed $105,000, reflecting the overall market recovery. Positive sentiment was also boosted by Trump’s recent executive order supporting digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Significant inflows into ETH-focused ETFs also contributed to the rise. For example, BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw inflows of $287.7 million between January 13 and January 23, signalling growing institutional interest. Technically, Ethereum is trading above key support levels between $3,200 and $3,390, with resistance expected at $3,502 and $4,109. Analysts predict Ethereum could reach $7,000 in the first quarter of 2025, with nearer-term targets of $3,850 and $4,840. The combination of strong market sentiment and increased institutional involvement makes Ethereum’s outlook promising. Final Thoughts As Ethereum’s institutional support strengthens and Solana’s trading activity expands, the focus remains on scalability and real-world utility. While both networks demonstrate strong momentum, they still face challenges in transaction efficiency and accessibility. BlockDAG offers a structure designed for seamless transactions and user-driven rewards. Its affiliate program not only encourages adoption but also strengthens community participation. While traditional blockchain networks address scalability gradually, BlockDAG’s direct approach to efficiency and engagement provides a distinct advantage.

As the presale for FXGuys continues to exceed expectations, reaching over $3.4 million, it's clear that the project has the potential to achieve massive gains. Let’s explore the factors fueling $FXG’s rise! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano’s New Hope: Is the New Initiative Enough to Save ADA? The Cardano Foundation (CF) has launched its Venture Hub pilot program . The initiative aims to provide personalized guidance and technical expertise to Cardano-based projects. Cardano’s educational arm, Cardano Academy, introduced the Venture Hub to refine the Foundation’s support structure. Despite the Foundation’s positive efforts, internal conflicts continue to affect ADA’s outlook. Founder Charles Hoskinson has expressed dissatisfaction with the Foundation’s governance. He criticized the Swiss authorities for appointing board members without user voting rights. Hoskinson described this process as unfavorable to transparency and accountability. While Cardano is working to address these issues, recent price movements show challenges. ADA dropped from $1.13 to $0.92 in January 2025. However, the Venture Hub is driving optimism, with price projections predicting a rise to $2 by the end of 2025. Even with this potential, experts suggest that ADA may face stiff competition from other leading tokens. Among these, $FXG stands out as an emerging top DeFi token. Its unique offerings and strong market presence could see it outperform ADA in the coming months. Grayscale’s Interest Boosts Hedera, But Will HBAR Keep Up as a Top DeFi Token? Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token has gained attention, with Grayscale Investments adding it to their “assets under consideration.” This move signals growing institutional interest in Hedera’s enterprise blockchain solutions. Grayscale’s potential investment in HBAR could provide a significant boost to the token’s adoption and market performance. As a leader in crypto asset management, Grayscale’s backing typically results in heightened exposure and confidence in a token. Despite this growing interest, HBAR has faced challenges. The token price dropped from $0.328 to $0.258 in January 2025. Analysts predict a potential recovery to $0.660 by year-end, though investor confidence remains cautious. Institutional investors are eyeing HBAR’s potential, but its place as a top DeFi token faces competition from other projects. Among these is the rising DeFi star $FXG. FXGuys vs. Cardano & Hedera: Which One is the Future of DeFi? Since its debut in Q4 of 2024, FXGuys has emerged as a top DeFi token, offering powerful solutions that outshine rivals like Cardano and Hedera. Experts believe $FXG has the potential to achieve massive gains, particularly when compared to other projects in the crypto space and here's why!

Additionally, the no-buy, no-sell tax facilitates smooth and fee-free transactions for every trader. When compared to other projects like Cardano and Hedera, the FX Guys platform stands out in terms of delivering real-world utility.

This makes $FXG the top DeFi token for anyone looking to participate in a decentralized ecosystem with a true sense of community and support. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG’s Presale Hits $3.4 Million: Big Returns Await as Token Set to Launch at $0.10!

As FXGuys' presale continues to surpass expectations, having already accumulated over $3.4 million, the project shows significant potential for notable returns. Let's delve into the elements driving $FXG's ascension! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano's Fresh Initiative: Can It Revitalize ADA? The Cardano Foundation (CF) has unveiled its Venture Hub pilot program . This new initiative is designed to offer tailored guidance and technical support to projects based on Cardano. The Cardano Academy, CF's educational division, launched the Venture Hub to enhance the Foundation's support framework. Despite these constructive moves, internal disputes continue to cloud ADA's prospects. Founder Charles Hoskinson has voiced his dissatisfaction with the Foundation's leadership, criticizing Swiss authorities for appointing board members without allowing user voting rights. He labeled this process as lacking in transparency and accountability. Even as Cardano strives to resolve these challenges, recent price trends indicate hurdles. ADA fell from $1.13 to $0.92 in January 2025. Yet, optimism from the Venture Hub could lead to price forecasts suggesting an increase to $2 by the end of 2025. Despite this potential, experts believe ADA may encounter tough competition from other leading tokens, with $FXG emerging as a prominent DeFi contender. Its distinct features and robust market stance might enable it to surpass ADA in the months to come. Grayscale's Interest Lifts Hedera, But Can HBAR Stay at the Top of DeFi? Hedera Hashgraph's HBAR token has caught attention as Grayscale Investments considers adding it to their ""assets under consideration."" This development indicates a rising institutional interest in Hedera's enterprise blockchain solutions. Grayscale's potential investment in HBAR could significantly enhance the token's adoption and market performance. As a prominent player in crypto asset management, Grayscale's support typically boosts a token's visibility and credibility. Despite this growing attention, HBAR has faced obstacles. The token's price decreased from $0.328 to $0.258 in January 2025. Analysts anticipate a possible rebound to $0.660 by year's end, though investor confidence remains tentative. Institutional investors are watching HBAR's potential, yet its position as a leading DeFi token is challenged by other projects, including the promising DeFi newcomer $FXG. FXGuys Against Cardano & Hedera: Who Leads the Future of DeFi? Since launching in the last quarter of 2024, FXGuys has established itself as a leading DeFi token, providing dynamic solutions that outshine competitors like Cardano and Hedera. Experts assert that $FXG is poised for substantial gains, especially when compared to other projects in the crypto sphere, and here's why! A standout feature of FXGuys is its Trade2Earn program. This innovative system rewards traders with $FXG tokens for every trade, regardless of the result. By boosting trading activity, $FXG tokens foster a vibrant and rewarding ecosystem, benefiting both traders and holders. This strategy enhances volume and reinforces the utility of this leading DeFi token as it continues to expand its market presence. FXGuys' staking program offers up to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY), making it an attractive option for long-term investors. It aims to keep $FXG tokens active within the ecosystem, stabilizing prices and benefiting loyal holders. Furthermore, the absence of a buy or sell tax ensures smooth and fee-free transactions for every trader. When stacked against projects like Cardano and Hedera, the FX Guys platform is exceptional in delivering practical utility. While Cardano and Hedera emphasize scalability and enterprise adoption, FXGuys is sharply focused on empowering individual traders with the tools for success.

The top three cryptos on their radar are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and FXGuys ($FXG). These top altcoins have historically demonstrated impressive performance, and investors are now confused which coin should they pick for the best gains in 2025. Here, we will cover recent developments around these coins to highlight the best crypto to buy! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Experts Claim Ripple’s XRP Looks Fine Despite a Price Plunge The crypto market is going through a rough patch heading into February 2025, with Bitcoin crashing below $100,000 again and several altcoins following suit. Amid this development, CryptoInsightUK, a well-known commentator, has spotlighted XRP , assuring his followers that they have nothing to worry about. Taking to X on February 2, 2025, CryptoInsightUK noted that many people are panicking due to XRP plummeting, but the asset looks fine. In the last two months of the past year, XRP shot up the charts, breaking through several resistances and settling down very close to its all-time high. The market has become quieter, with the RSI cooling off nicely and the stochastic RSI flooring out. The RSI is slightly below the midpoint at 48.49, having descended from the overbought region at 70 during the upswing. He added that on the four-hour chart, XRP is coming out of the oversold region across the RSI and Stochastic RSI metrics, setting the tone for a potential rebound. If it happens, the anticipated rally could see the Ripple coin surpassing the $3.20 level, which would be a 24% increase in its current price of $2.68 after a 7% weekly loss. Solana Risks Slumping to $211 If SOL Doesn’t Scale a Key Resistance Zone Solana failed to break above its all-time high as the bears took control, with selling pressure climbing. Upside momentum is waning, leaving investors on the sidelines and watching how SOL behaves in the next few days. Carl Runefelt, a technical analyst, shared his two cents on SOL’s outlook and possible outcome in an X post on February 1, 2025. The analyst stated that Solana might retest the $222 resistance level from its current price, provided it breaks out of a daily bearish flag. This retest will likely be followed by a pullback towards $211, where the asset’s fate will be determined. However, if the bulls successfully defend current levels, SOL could push above the next supply zone and begin a price recovery. In this case, Solana could gather enough strength to challenge higher levels moving forward. SOL is currently down 5% this week to $214. FXGuys Prepares For a 100x Rally in 2025: The Best Crypto to Buy? FXGuys is becoming more popular because of the profit potential of its native token, $FXG. With over $3.83 million raised in its presale so far, $FXG is one of the most adopted DeFi projects today. But there’s more to it than meets the eye. Specifically, the FXGuys proprietary trading platform allows users to access several asset classes, from stocks to cryptocurrencies and commodities, and provides capital to trade these assets. This funding initiative is a part of its trader development programs geared toward helping traders achieve their financial goals. After passing a challenge phase set up by the firm, traders can access up to $500,000 in trading capital, with a chance to keep 80% of the profits made. To incentivize users of the prop trading firm, the FX Guys platform is introducing the Trade2Earn initiative. This initiative will allow traders to receive $FXG tokens for every trade they execute. So, when they buy or sell on the platform, $FXG is deposited into their wallets as a reward. Rather than holding the $FXG token and waiting for its price to increase before making a profit, holders can stake their token and earn up to a 20% APY. This can serve as an additional source of income for FXGuys users. $FXG has many use cases, making it a valuable asset with a bright future. Its presale performance mirrors that of some established altcoins, and experts predict it can rise 100x after its exchange debut. But the main question is, is it the best crypto to buy now? >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Ranks as the Best Crypto to Invest in Among Top Altcoins Compared to XRP and SOL, $FXG is a relatively new crypto coin with a long way to go. If it were to reach the levels of these top altcoins, investors would realize more than a 100x return on their investment. $FXG currently sells for $0.05 in Stage 3 of its public presale. With its launch price set at $0.10, Stage 3 investors can secure 100% gains upon its exchange listing. Experts also believe that the token price will pump 100x right after its exchange debut. Based on its post-launch projection, $FXG would be the best crypto to buy after XRP and SOL. So, don’t hesitate to buy $FXG tokens now!

As reported by Bloomberg, citing anonymous, the trading platform has a timeline for later this year. The Gemini IPO Plans Gemini hopes to go public this year via the Initial Public Offering route, showcasing the growing interest in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent interview, Cameron Winklevoss acknowledged that the company is open to an IPO. Furthermore, he noted that the ongoing internal discussions are centered around deciding on the timing and feasibility of the move. Per the Bloomberg report , the firm has commenced discussions with several entities, including financial advisors. However, no decision has been made on the key details relating to the IPO. Pending the push for this IPO, Gemini has stayed focused on expanding its business. Last month, it appointed three new executives to pilot its European Union expansion drive. It hopes to build on the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license it secured in France last November. Beyond Gemini, Growing IPO Clamor There is an ongoing trend among crypto firms to go public. This trend could be attributed to the crypto market’s growth over the past year. For example, Bitcoin hit a $108,000 all-time high earlier in January. The coin also has ETF products tracking its price and has now raked in over $50 billion in inflows On this premise, investors’ interest in the burgeoning sector has peaked in recent months. Several firms are now trying to meet the increasing demand for crypto solutions. On the Bitcoin ETF front, companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the solution providers. As a thriving digital currency trading platform, Gemini believes an IPO move might help it scale its services. In addition, Bullish Global also has IPO plans , as per an earlier report from CoinGape. While no official announcement has been made yet, there are talks about the exchange operator mulling plans to go public in the US this year. In addition, firms like Circle, Kraken, and Chainalysis are projected to go public later this year. Favorable Crypto Regulation Fueling IPO Hype This hype among crypto firms to go public is connected mainly to the improved regulatory landscape in the United States. President Donald Trump’s administration is pulling resources and investing efforts in implementing favorable crypto policies. Under Mark Uyeda’s leadership, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a Crypto Task Force. This crypto task force , headed by Hester Peirce, will recommend practical policy measures that encourage innovation and protect investors. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the application of federal securities laws to the digital currency ecosystem market, which may benefit potential IPO candidates.

While Aave dominated the lending sector and Cardano earned its strong reputation through research-backed blockchain development, another player is on the scene that challenges this status quo: FXGuys. What happens at the heart is that this investor-friendly move, innovative features, and strong global marketing drive make FXGuys a budding force to reckon with in 2025. Let's look at how AAVE and ADA are performing and why $FXG might be the best cryptocurrency investment opportunity in DeFi today! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Aave: Pressure Mounts On This DeFi Giant AAVE has always spearheaded the DeFi space by allowing users to accrue deposit interest and obtain crypto loans without intermediaries. Most recently, AAVE traded at $237 , approximately 19% below its price a week ago. The latest trading range saw a high of $202 and a low of $315. This downturn is attributed to overall market volatility and intensified competition from emerging DeFi projects. However, a recent governance proposal introducing a fee switch and token buy-back program has generated optimism among investors, suggesting potential for future price recovery. Cardano: Strong Fundamentals, But Struggling for Momentum Cardano has long been recognized for its research-driven approach and robust technical foundation. However, despite its ambitious roadmap, ADA has failed to maintain an uptrend in the ongoing market cycle. It recently traded at $0.69 , dipping 20% over the past week. The latest trading range was $0.57 to $0.93. The volatility, coupled with the gradual adoption of its smart contract functionality, has affected investor confidence. While Cardano remains a significant player in cryptocurrency, emerging projects with innovative features are increasingly attracting retail and institutional investors. $FXG: The New DeFi Token Conquering 2025 While AAVE and Cardona are under market pressure, FXGuys is introducing a very rewarding ecosystem for traders and investors. Unlike the competition, FXGuys isn't just another DeFi project; it's a complete financial ecosystem designed to foster growth, innovation, and real utility. Here are a few ways $FXG is dominating the DeFi world: Major Global Marketing: Unlike most DeFi projects, which have relied on organic growth, FXGuys has embarked on an aggressive global marketing campaign.

FXGuys Market Performance and Growth Potential FXGuys is not another hyped token but a well-structured investment with great growth potential. Currently, $FXG is priced at $0.05, making it a very good early investment option for those who want to capitalize on its future surge. FXGuys has raised millions in funding, reflecting strong investor confidence. For now, the project is in its presale phase, which means investors can buy before a major exchange listing drives the price upwards. Given its trajectory, $FXG could experience exponential growth. Some projections estimate it may surge as high as 10,000% after listing. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Looking For the Best Cryptocurrency Investment in 2025? Join the FXGuys Presale!

While Aave has been a leader in the lending sector and Cardano has garnered respect through its research-focused blockchain innovations, a new contender is emerging to challenge these giants: FXGuys. The core of this shift lies in FXGuys' investor-friendly strategies, cutting-edge features, and robust global marketing efforts, positioning it as a formidable force in 2025. Let's delve into AAVE and ADA's current performance and explore why $FXG could be the most promising cryptocurrency investment in today's DeFi scene! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Aave: The DeFi Leader Under Strain AAVE has been at the forefront of the DeFi movement, enabling users to earn interest on deposits and secure crypto loans without intermediaries. Recently, AAVE was valued at $237 , approximately 19% lower than its price a week prior. Its recent trading range spanned from $202 to $315. This decline is largely due to market volatility and fierce competition from emerging DeFi initiatives. Nonetheless, a new governance proposal that includes a fee switch and token buy-back initiative has sparked hope among investors, indicating potential future price recovery. Cardano: Strong Foundations, Yet Lacking Momentum Cardano is known for its research-centric methodology and solid technical framework. Despite its ambitious plans, ADA has struggled to sustain an upward trend in the current market cycle. It recently traded at $0.69 , experiencing a 20% decline over the past week. The trading range spanned from $0.57 to $0.93. The volatility and the slow rollout of its smart contract capabilities have shaken investor confidence. While Cardano maintains its significant status in the crypto world, new projects with cutting-edge features are increasingly drawing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. $FXG: The Rising DeFi Token Dominating 2025 While AAVE and Cardano grapple with market pressures, FXGuys is launching a highly beneficial ecosystem for both traders and investors. Unlike its competitors, FXGuys isn't just another DeFi project; it offers a comprehensive financial ecosystem aimed at fostering growth, innovation, and practical utility.

The announcement was made by WLF co-founder Chase Herro at the Ondo Summit in New York, where Donald Trump Jr. also expressed strong support for the digital asset industry. Trump Jr. Calls Crypto the “Future of American Hegemony” Donald Trump Jr. made a surprise appearance at the Ondo Summit on Thursday, where he spoke about cryptocurrency’s role in global finance. Addressing industry leaders, he stated that he believes crypto will shape the future of the U.S. economy. “I think it’s perhaps the future of American hegemony, in terms of our economic status, our economic might,” Trump Jr. said at the event. His remarks were part of a broader discussion on the role of digital assets in financial markets and regulatory policies. WLF, which has been actively purchasing digital tokens in recent months, recently acquired $470,000 worth of ONDO, the native cryptocurrency of Ondo Finance. The company has also invested in Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Tron’s TRX, AAVE, and Chainlink’s LINK, among other tokens. World Liberty Financial’s Strategic Reserve Plans Chase Herro, co-founder of WLF, revealed that the company is setting up a strategic crypto reserve but did not specify its intended purpose. “We are big builder fans,” he said, referring to WLF’s continued investment in digital assets. The idea of a cryptocurrency reserve has been a topic of discussion since Trump’s presidential campaign last year. In January, he signed an executive action to evaluate the feasibility of a digital asset stockpile. This has fueled speculation about the role WLF could play in shaping national policies on decentralized finance.

From ONDO’s $8.16 million whale move to Coinbase to Hedera's (HBAR) institutional spotlight with Coinbase Derivatives’ futures filing and the groundbreaking solutions of FXGuys ($FXG), the race is on to turn $1,000 into $10,000. While ONDO and Hedera draw attention, FXGuys is stealing the show with its bullish presale momentum and trading solutions. Equipped with zero fees, no-KYC policies, and the potential for 10x gains, $FXG is quickly becoming the go-to DeFi token for investors ready to capitalize on the presale momentum. Discover why these low-cap bets are gaining attention and how you can join the 10x journey today! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE A Whale Moves $8.16 Million Worth of ONDO to Coinbase ONDO experienced a huge volume of transactions over the past week. According to OnchainLens , a crypto whale deposited 5.76 million ONDO tokens, valued at $8.16 million, into Coinbase. This transaction happened after 4 months of inactivity. The whales strategically accumulated these tokens over the year in seven transactions, with the largest purchase of 4.18 million ONDO tokens worth $3.8 million occurring 313 days ago. The whale’s most recent transaction added $180,514 worth of ONDO tokens. ONDO tokens hit a high of $1.60 before plunging to $1.22 due to the market's downtrend. However, experts predict that ONDO could rise to $1.72 in the coming weeks. While the deposit raises concerns about a potential sell-off, it also highlights investors' growing interest in low-cap bets for high returns. A new DeFi token, $FXG, is preparing for a 10x gain rise in 2025, and ONDO holders are taking notice of that. Coinbase Derivatives Files to List Solana and Hedera Futures Coinbase Derivatives, a subsidiary of Coinbase, has submitted filings to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch futures contracts for Hedera and Solana, two prominent altcoins.

Solana futures, on the other hand, will be offered in two sizes: 100 SOL and a nano contract of five SOL. Looking at the price performance, Hedera’s HJBAR has taken a bearish fall. Currently, HBAR is trading at $0.23. Experts are pessimistic that the price of HBAR could hit $0.50 in Q1 2025 if the bulls take over. The recent move by Coinbase highlights the growing institutional interest in the top 10 altcoins.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance over the entire market is at 60.3% after a 4% increase in the past 24 hours. Notably, crypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed to the 71% dominance level as an important threshold for crypto investors still awaiting an altcoin season. Reaching 71% Is Critical For An Altcoin Season The Bitcoin dominance chart, which tracks Bitcoin’s market capitalization in relation to the entire crypto market, has consistently risen throughout this cycle, even during periods of price corrections. Bitcoin’s dominance has been fueled by institutional demand after the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and market dynamics favoring BTC as a potential reserve for countries. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Paused Forever? What The Rising Bitcoin Dominance Says Will Happen A direct consequence of this prolonged Bitcoin dominance has been the sluggish performance of the altcoin market. Although some altcoins like Solana and XRP have managed to outperform Bitcoin for brief periods, the capital has consistently rotated back into Bitcoin, preventing a sustained altcoin market breakout. However, some analysts believe a significant shift could be very close, with Bitcoin dominance now sitting at a multi-year high. One such analyst is an analyst known as Rekt Capital on social media platform X. His analysis reveals a historical pattern where altcoin seasons emerge whenever Bitcoin dominance reaches a key threshold and subsequently faces rejection. According to a Bitcoin dominance chart that accompanied his analysis, Bitcoin’s dominance has been rejected around the 71% level three successive times in the past. Interestingly, each rejection has been marked by Bitcoin’s dominance falling over multiple monthly candles, as altcoins outperformed Bitcoin throughout those months. The most recent occurrence of this pattern was during the 2021 bull market. At the time, Bitcoin dominance briefly spiked above 72% before reversing course. Once rejected, it entered a five-month downtrend, ultimately stabilizing around the 40% level as altcoins took control of the market. Will 71% Trigger A New Altcoin Season? Although Bitcoin’s dominance is not at 71% yet, it is still steadily inching upward towards this level. Particularly, Bitcoin’s dominance is at 60.3%, and there are no signs of slowing down. This means that investors banking on a repeat of rejection around 71% might have to wait longer for the dominance to even reach this level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms First Daily Death Cross On Dominance Chart In 4 Years, What To Expect Next If the 71% dominance level eventually becomes a local top again, historical patterns suggest altcoins could experience rapid gains. However, unlike in previous cycles, Ethereum may not take the lead in an altcoin season this time around. The leading altcoin has struggled to gain momentum this cycle as recent market dynamics have diminished its dominance in relation to other altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, which are witnessing more interest among crypto traders.
